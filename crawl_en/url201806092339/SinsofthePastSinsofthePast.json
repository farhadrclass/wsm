When he receives word that his elderly mother is missing, he returns to Chicago. Together with the lieutenant in charge of the case, John begins to realize that maybe something from his past may have triggered his mother's disappearance.My Thoughts - This one started off really good. I liked the dynamics between Sharon and John. I loved how they'd follow the clues. But then out of nowhere, the author threw in something that turned it in a completely different direction. Until then, I was really enjoying the story. My rating: 3 starsShadowed by Dani Pettrey - Ben McKenna is a simple Alaskan fisherman who takes tourists out on his fishing boat. When competitive swimmer Libby Jennings shows up in the rain for a whale watching tour, neither she or Ben expect to be drawn into a web of deceit and situations involving more than just the body they found. My Thoughts - I loved this story. I loved getting to meet the parents of the McKenna siblings from the Alaskan Courage series. Like all of Dani's books, this story was a thrill ride from start to finish. This was my favorite of the three novellas. My rating: 5 starsBlackout by Lynette Eason - A young woman, Macey, has been having blackouts over the past several years that are linked back to when she was an unintended part of a burglary gone wrong. When neighbor Chad hears her scream one evening, he rushes over. Together Chad and Macey begin a race against time to see who is trying to kill her. Is it all tied into her past?My Thoughts - This was another one that I really enjoyed. I loved how quickly it moved. I was glad that my suspicions were proved wrong. It kept me on the edge of my seat. My rating: 4 starsOverall Thoughts - This novella collection is overall really good. It's fun to pick a collection of novellas and have them being romantic suspense. Fans of these authors will enjoy this book.I received this book for free from Bethany House for the purpose of reviewing. My thoughts and opinions are my own.Recommended to fans of Dee Henderson, Dani Pettrey, Lynette Eason, Irene Hannon, romantic suspenseOverall rating: 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Aerykah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920961-aerykah", "userReview": "Missing by Dee Henderson - 3 StarsThis one started off quite well and really pulled me into the story! And, while it definitely is better than the last couple of novels I've read by this author and the basic storyline was interesting... it's still only a 3-star read for me. I don't know which of us changed, but I find that I simply don't enjoy this author's writing style as much as I used to. This novella is still a good read, though! :)Shadowed by Dani Pettrey - 4 StarsWell! This one certainly drops you right into the middle of the story! And then the first chapter comes along and takes you back to the \"beginning\" so you can understand more of what's going on. With mystery, suspense, and romance, this one kept my attention from beginning to end and is probably my favorite of the three.And we get another McKenna story-- Yay!! :D Libby: \"Four... or maybe five, a handful.\" -- Ben: \"We have five adventurous kids who take after us, and we're definitely going to have our hands full.\"Blackout by Lynette Eason - 4 StarsA couple of my favorite things about this book were the flashbacks and the relationship background. The flashbacks feed you information in a... smooth sort of way. I could see them clearly with my mind's eye and I liked that. And the relationship background gave the couple a basis of trust and friendship that helped them work together and made a relationship between them an easy transition rather than a sudden \"Oh my gosh, you're gorgeous and I'm in love with you!\" sort of thing. I always like that in a story. ;)Overall, I really enjoyed these stories and the fact that they are wholly unrelated to each other. The writing was great, the suspense was gripping, and the endings were satisfying. I likely only would have enjoyed them more had they been full length novels. ;)I received a free copy of this book through the Bethany House Blogger Review Program in exchange for an honest review.

I have really enjoyed Dani Pettrey\u2019s and Lynette Eason\u2019s suspense books in the past, and this novella collection introduced me to the writing of Dee Henderson. It is one of the reasons I enjoy novella collections. There have been many times that I have found another author I like when their work is paired with those I already know.In Missing by Dee Henderson, I really enjoyed the way the author walked me through the process of trying to find John Graham\u2019s mother. It was interesting to see the clues as they unfolded and watch the way the case was handled. I also thought that the gentle, slow development of the romance between the two characters was realistic for the situation.In Shadowed by Dani Pettrey, I loved getting to see how the McKenna parents, Libby and Ben, met. It was definitely a surprise to find out what they had been through and to see where their children got their sense of adventure from! I thought the author did a great job of building up the romantic tension between these two! Another thing I really enjoyed was the references to things of the time period, such as music, clothing styles, and brands that were popular.In Blackout by Lynette Eason, I was terrified about the attempts on Macey\u2019s life and mesmerized by the flashbacks she kept experiencing. This was such a suspenseful story! I loved the way the author gave us only little glimpses into the past a bit at a time, making the big reveal at the end of the story even more powerful. The romantic tension was great in this novella, as well.This was such a fun collection to read! I liked how each story did, in fact, tie back to something in the past. In two of the stories, there was a link to an event in the past. In the other story, the novella was actually set in the past. It was a great tie-in between the novellas!I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Madison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6951127-madison", "userReview": "Three of my favourite romantic suspense authors all in one book?? Sign me up!!! Sins of the Past is a collection of three romantic suspense novellas. All three stories are based on something that has happened in the past impacting current events and they bring together plenty of action, suspense and romance. Missing - Dee HendersonMissing is a wonderfully insightful and exciting look at working a missing persons case, one that is very personal. Police chief John Graham's mother has been reported missing. He teams up with Lieutenant Sharon Noble to help locate her. It's a frustrating and emotional time for John, but he enjoys working with the enigmatic Sharon. The focus of this story is definitely the case. Details, interviews, clues and time lines, it's like being dropped into the middle of an active crime scene and it's very interesting. As always with Dee's writing it is also very enjoyable to read. This is the first time I have read a novella by Dee and was pleased by the balance in timing, and the mix of family, crime solving and romance is also perfect. The story never felt rushed or cut short. The romance develops slowly and sweetly, with the delicate hand that Dee Henderson always turns to her love stories. Very enjoyable.Shadowed - Dani PettreyIn Shadowed, readers get to meet the parents of the McKenna group, Ben and Libby, and uncover the story of how they first met. Those who have read Dani Pettrey's Alaskan Courage series will know these two become the parents of the McKenna children who star as our heroines and heroes of that series. It's fun to go back and see where their story starts. And just like any book in the McKenna series, Shadowed is full of action and plenty of twists that just keep coming, especially when you think things have resolved. You can see where the McKenna clan get their tenacity, deep curiosity and love of investigating. It's a fun novella, lots of suspense, great positioning in the era and setting and sweet romance. Blackout - Lynette Eason Blackout starts off terrifying - don't start this one at night - and continues with plenty of action. Macey was unwittingly involved in a crime when she was a teenager but never fully retained her memories of what happened. Now someone is out to make sure she dies before she does remember. Breaking into her house is just the beginning. Macey's neighbour, police detective Chad is on scene when Macey's house is broken in to. It gives him the opening to help Macey begin an investigation into her past and find who is hunting her now, and maybe even convince Macey to finally give them a chance as a couple. Things are a little rushed to fit the timeline of this story, prints and lab results are conveniently returned very quickly and the action happens quickly. I didn't connect with Macey, but Chad is charming. Blackout is not as good as some of Lynette Eason's full-length books, but still an enjoyable read. The publishers provided a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The authors expertly used hooks, the element of surprise, and pacing to their advantage and delivered entertaining tales of redemption and mystery.I especially enjoyed the Cold War setting of Dani Pettrey's Shadowed. I think this might be the first book since The Bourne Identity that I've read that took place in that era, and I was pleased with the story line. Ms. Pettrey was a new author for me, and I must say I was delighted with her writing ability. I usually try two or three books from authors before forming a permanent opinion, but she's started off on a good foot with me.Lynette Eason's Blackout brought a slightly different style than I'm used to from her, in that she used flashbacks fairly often. With the partial amnesia the lead character struggled with, this technique worked beautifully. As always, she crafted memorable characters and crimes and twists. I stayed up way too late to finish this one, because I couldn't go to sleep with the crime nearly-but-not-yet solved. Yes, she did that to me. Again. (And I love her for it!)The story that fell short for me was Dee Henderson's Missing. It was extremely dialogue-heavy with little action, and I expect suspense books to contain a ton of action (especially from an author who had mastered this in her O'Malley Chronicles and Uncommon Heroes series). The story was too stilted and controlled, not free flowing; each character carefully thought out every word before they said it, because they already knew what other characters could and couldn't handle or deal with. Life isn't that neat and tidy. People don't know what other folks can and can't handle, nor how they'll react to things. I want to see more reality in Ms. Henderson's stories, like her first two series contained. I'm not sure why there's been such a departure from her original author's voice, but it's obvious to me that her style is vastly different now; it seems like the two phases of her career have been penned by two different authors. I keep trying her newest books, hoping she'll find a happy middle ground or something, but each time I close the book with disappointment and a dying hope for the next one.Overall, Sins of the Past earned four stars from me, because two out of the three stories were excellent, and I was happy to see that the third one had a premise I had not seen before. This books would be a great gift for suspense lovers and crime-drama fans.This is my unbiased, honest review."}, {"userName": "Donna (More Than a Review)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2219399-donna-more-than-a-review", "userReview": "Sins of the Past: is a collection of three novellas by Dee Henderson, Dani Pettrey and Lynnette Eason Can you ask for a better collection of authors for romantic suspense??? Missing with have you holding your breath. One of your worst fears; you mother is missing. John who is a sheriff in Wyoming receives the call that his mother is missing. He feels the guilt of wondering if it is one of his enemies from his days of working undercover in Chicago. You just melt at the relationship you experience between John and his mother and his concern for her. It is so heartwarming. Sharon Nobles is the lead investigator. If you read Traces of Guilt she is mentioned as the lead in the new team to work cold cases of missing persons. I liked her immediately. She is in charge in a subtle way. In true Dee Henderson fashion you are not sure how this will turn out, especially when half way through the book it takes a major turn. Suspense at its best. Fans of Dani\u2019s Alaskan series will be thrilled to read Shadowed which is the story of how the parents of the McKenna family met and fell in love. Ben is a fisherman (with an interesting back story that I will not spoil for you) who finds a dead body that happens to be one of the competitive swimmers. Libby, who is also a competitive swimmer, happens to be with him at the time. They try to solve the mystery of the swimmers death who may actually be a Russian defector. Elliot, one of the secondary characters was very interesting with his mysterious past. I really liked Ben, and liked Libby even though she was obnoxious a couple of times wanting to make sure she was included in the mystery. Lynette delivers high octane suspense in Blackout. Macey cannot remember what happened during a robbery gone wrong years ago. As one of the culprits is released on parole, he comes to find her because he wants her to remember. The loot has never been found and he thinks she knows where it is. Chad is her next door neighbor for the last two years and happens to be a detective. He wants to help protect her.

Each is a quick, well-written read that may be just what you are looking for if you are craving some romance, suspense, and some entertaining plot twists. Probably my favourite of the three is \"Missing\" by Dee Henderson, as I particularly enjoyed the interaction and dialogue between the characters John and Sharon and the way the plot unfolds. However, the other two additions are also fine reads. \"Shadowed\" is a great prequel to Pettrey's Alaskan Courage series with action-packed scenes and a sweet romance. Eason's \"Blackout\" provides the most heart-pounding moments, and I am always glad to read anything by such a talented suspense author, with this novella being no exception. What I particularly appreciate about each of these novellas is how each is imbued with Christian faith and ideals and how each is a clean addition to the romance field with no messy inappropriate scenes to wreck the story. All in all, these novellas are sure to please fans of Henderson, Pettrey and Eason, as each features an interesting plot that will keep you guessing and, of course, a happy ending that will leave a smile on your face.Sometimes you simply aren't in the mood for a long novel that will require a day or two of reading. If so, then the \"Sins of the Past\" collection is just what you are looking for!

Yes, please! Needless to say Sins of the Past was my most anticipated read of 2016!Missing by Dee Henderson-4.5 Stars!-This story got the collection off to a great start! As a huge fan of Dee's O'Malley family series, I am happy to say that I feel like this one was a lot closer to her earlier books than her more recent ones. While the suspense wasn't quite the same as in the O'Malley books, Missing was still very suspenseful, I had no clue whether John's mother would survive. And I totally didn't guess the reason for her disappearance until right before it was revealed! I also really enjoyed the romance between John and Sharon, it was very fun and I felt that it was very well developed for a story this short! Overall, while this novella wasn't my favorite of the collection, I still really loved it!Shadowed by Dani Pettrey-5 Stars!-If you know me at all then you probably know what a huge fan I am of Dani's books! I absolutely adored every page of her Alaskan Courage series and I was over the moon excited when I found out that Dani's contribution to this collection would feature the parents of our beloved McKenna clan! Words truly cannot express how happy it made me to finally be introduced to Ben and Libby, I was completely enthralled with every single word of their adventure! I don't know how Dani does it but every time I think one of her books has reached the absolute pinnacle of awesomeness, the next ups the awesome factor tenfold. Such was the case with Shadowed, forgive me but I just can't seem to stop gushing, it was just SO perfect! The suspense was off the charts crazy, I loved it! One of the things I thought was so cool about this story was all the references to pop culture and things of the time, I'm only twenty four years old but those details helped to paint such a vivid picture that while I was reading the story I felt like I was really living in 1979! I could go on for days about how much I loved this book but for the sake of everyone reading this review and for fear of spoiling something I'll draw this gush-fest to a close! Let me end by saying that the ending of this book caused me to feel giddy tingles of pure happiness and I had the biggest grin on my face when I read the last few sentences! This was my favorite of the three novellas and as soon as I finished it I found myself wanting to read it all over again, and I plan to make sure I leave room in my schedule to re-read it many times in the future!Blackout by Lynette Eason-5 Stars!-Lynette Eason is another one of my favorite authors, I always love her stories and Blackout was no exception! Macey and Chad were both such great characters and I loved their story. This was such a unique take on a suspense storyline and I loved it! I really had no clue who the villain was and I was totally surprised when their identity was revealed! I was absolutely blown away by the intensity as well as the sheer number of suspenseful scenes that Lynette was able to squeeze into a story this short, I never had a chance to catch my breath and I loved it! This story also contains one of the most crazy suspenseful climax's that I have ever read, I was literally on the edge of my seat wanting to know what would happen next! I loved every minute of Blackout and I anticipate re-reading it many times in the future!Sins of the Past is a novella collection that not only has a permanent spot on my keeper shelf but that all fans of romantic suspense NEED to read, you will not be sorry! This book will totally make my favorite books of 2016 list!

The novella concept is growing on me for a variety of reasons:1. The lure of familiar authors introduces me to an unfamiliar ones.2. Single serving stories are great for short intense bursts of reading.3. With so much concentrated action, I wasn't tempted to set my book aside when my reading was interrupted by a \"Hey Mom, watch this!\"Unlike the first novella that I read where all of the stories intertwined, Sins of the Past is made up of three romantic suspense novels that are entirely unrelated.MISSING, by new-to-me author Dee Henderson, kicked off this romantic suspense collection. It unfolds in present day Chicago after an elderly woman disappears from an assisted living center. Her son, Wyoming sheriff John Graham, is met at the airport by Lieutenant Sharon Noble. The two waste no time theorizing and trying to pin down the events that lead up to Martha's disappearance. Around chapter 7 I realized that I didn't have a clear idea in my head of what these main characters looked like. I liked how, up to this point, the author chose to base their mutual attraction solely on personality and mutual respect. Missing wasn't exactly a nail-biter for me, but I'll read more from Dee Henderson in the future.SHADOWED gave me a healthy dose of the fast-paced, high adventure fiction which always endears me to it's author. Veteran Pettrey fans and new readers alike will be enchanted by boat captain Ben McKenna's affections for the mermaid-esque competitive swimmer Libby Jennings. Together, under the continual threat of danger, they search to uncover who murdered Libby's greatest racing competitor. I finished this book with a great satisfaction and huge smile having gained new insights into the McKenna family of Dani Pettrey's Alaskan Courage series.If I were to compare BLACKOUT to a cup of coffee, it would definitely be a double shot of espresso, because it really got my heart pumping. Memory flashbacks provide readers with clues to the mystery of who is hunting Macey Adams. The unrelenting action of Lynette Eason's writing keeps readers on the edge of their seats until the villain's grand reveal. I liked the composition and crescendo of the novella. Even though the stories were unrelated in many respects, the common element of suspense was enough to bind them together. Sins of the Past is definitely one for the beach bag.

John Graham, a Wyoming sheriff has come back home to Chicago because his mother Martha has come up missing. Her car is in its spot and her purse with all the contents is next to the front door. Martha lives in a retirement home. Is Martha the victim of foul play? Is so what could be the motive? Could it be someone John Graham arrested in the past has a grudge against John and wants revenge. Also I was wondering if maybe Martha had onset of dementia and lost her way. Lt. Sharon Noble helps John in his quest to find out what happened to his mother. The novella kept me engaged since I wanted to find out what happened to his mother. Of course you do eventually find out what happens but I shall not give too much of the story away. In the end a friendship develops between John and Sharon and is implied that it could develop into something more.Shadowed by Dani Pettrey is the second novella in this book. This novel is more of a prequel to his Alaska Courage series which consists of five books and deals with one family, the McKennas. This novella is about the parents Libby and Ben, how they met, the mystery they helped solved and their love story. It started out suspenseful with the discovery of a female corpse in the water. Libby was a competitive swimmer and recognized the victim as a member of the Russian team. As the story progressed it seem to drag some the main reason was too hard to keep up with all the characters. I had never read any of the Alaska Courage books so this novella did spark an interest in me reading the Alaska Courage books. The last novella was Blackout by Lynette Eason. It was by far the best. I knew it would be. I didn't start this late at night because I knew I could not stop until I finished and I was right. This book had me hooked from the first page. Lynette's books always get me hooked from the beginning. In this book Macey had gone through a traumatic experience a few years before. She has no memory of what happened but has nightmares of what happened to her. She is afraid to let anyone get close to her. She is afraid that anybody close to her will die. Eventually she has no choice but to trust Chad, her next door neighbor who is also a detective. I liked the way the love story developed in this novella.

This is a romantic suspense novella collection by three popular Christian inspirational authors - Dee Henderson, Dani Pettrey and Lynette Eason.Missing by Dee Henderson - Police chief John Graham travels from Wyoming back to his hometown of Chicago after his mother mysteriously disappears from a retirement village. He works alongside Lieutenant Sharon Noble to solve the case, but they could be running out of time. This story started out well, but I felt it got a bit bogged down in detail as the police worked the evidence. It's really more of a police procedural than a suspense story, and I felt there were some lost opportunities to ramp up the drama.The romance was also a little light-on, though I appreciated that Henderson didn't move things too quickly either, as that would have been unbelievable given the circumstances. I loved Henderon's O'Malley series, but this seemed a little pedestrian by comparison.Shadowed by Dani Pettrey - This is a prequel to Pettrey's popular Alaskan Courage series that features the drop-dead gorgeous and outdoorsy McKenna siblings. This novella is set in the 70s and tells the story of how their parents met. Libby is a champion ocean swimmer who's in Yancey for a competition. On a rare afternoon off, she goes on a whale-watching tour with hunky skipper Ben. However, things take a sinister turn when they discover the body of Libby's Russian competitor floating in the ocean. Is the dead Russian a spy, and if so, whose side is she on? It's an interesting Cold War story, though it was a bit constrained by the novella length. Some potentially suspenseful moments were cut short, yet there was a lot of time for introspection. I read this on Kindle last year, not realising it was a novella until I suddenly reached the end. Fans of the series will probably enjoy it. You can see my full review at the following link: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...Blackout by Lynette Eason - Macey Adams had been in a serious car accident six years ago, after being innocently caught up in a robbery-gone-wrong. The details of that night have been a blank, but after she starts remembering bits and pieces, her life is in jeopardy, along with the lives of those she loves. People are getting killed and Macey could be next, in spite of the efforts of Chad, the hunky policeman next door who is smitten with Macey. I liked this novella the best of the three. It had genuine suspense and an interesting plot, though there were still a few little things that niggled me. I enjoyed the collection overall, but I would put it in the light, holiday-read category. Not that that's a bad thing. I like a light holiday-read. I just felt there were some lost opportunities for suspense at times, and some of the writing could have been tightened. I hadn't read any of Lynette Eason's books before, and I may have a look at her full-length works. I felt the stories by Henderson and Pettrey weren't up with their best, but the novella length is not always easy to get right. If you like inspirational romantic suspense, you might like to give this collection a try.

I also guessed who the bad guy was so that revelation came as no surprise.However, it was still a good suspense read that kept the mystery going right till the end. Her O'Malley series is still my favourite.Shadowed - Dani Pettrey - 4 stars This one was fast-paced suspense - exactly how I like my suspense. I was drawn from the beginning to the end with the mystery and had no clue who the killer was or why.The characters were very likeable and I enjoyed getting to know them. I'm hoping for another novella which will take place few years after this novella where all 5 kids are born already and causing loads of adventures for the parents.Blackout - Lynette Eason - 4 stars Lynette is one of my favourite suspense writers and this novella confirmed why. From the start to the end there was non-stop action and the flashbacks was intriguing and kept me fully interested in the story. I did guess correctly but the way it was written did not take any suspense away from the story. There was enough back story to the relationship to avoid any insta-love scenario.Recommended to fans of these authors or to someone who is looking for new Suspense writers - this is a great introduction to what these authors can do and their novels is even better."}, {"userName": "Tamara Tilley", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383724-tamara-tilley", "userReview": "What better way to be introduced to three great romance/suspense writers. Dee Henderson, Dani Pettrey, and Lynette Eason are leaders in the field of Christian/romance/suspense.First, Dee Henderson with MISSING-Though I wouldn\u2019t say this is Henderson\u2019s best work; it was still enjoyable to read. Wyoming police chief, John Graham, is called to Chicago because his elderly mother had disappeared from her retirement home. Teamed with Lt. Sharon Noble, they try to piece together his mother\u2019s last steps before she disappeared. Though this doesn\u2019t seem like the proper setting for a budding romance, both John and Sharon quickly develop feelings for each other. With the intention of keeping their relationship professional, they choose to set aside their personal feelings until the disappearance of John\u2019s mom is solved.The setting aside of their personal feelings is what makes this story less romance, and more police procedure. I get easily frustrated with romance novels that keep the love interests at arms-length for most of the story. However, because of their professions, I was willing to put those frustrations aside. Like I said, not Henderson\u2019s best story, but with the constraints of a novella, I still feel she made it worth my wild.Next, Dani Pettrey with SHADOWED-As always, Dani immediately throws her main characters together in order to ignite a spark\u2014a spark that simmers throughout the book.Libby Jennings is an open-water swimmer and is in Alaska for a competition. While there, she decides to do some whale watching and ends up being the only passenger on the excursion led Ben McKenna. When Ben and Libby recover a body from the water, Libby immediately recognizes the deceased as Kat Stanic, one of her fellow competitors and former college roommate. However, Kat abruptly left Berkeley, and though she still competed against Libby, she fused to have any interaction with her. With Kat dead, Libby can\u2019t help but wonder if Kat was involved in some sort of spy game or espionage. Needing answers for herself, Libby inserts herself into the investigation, alongside Ben. While they hunt down clues, their attraction grows.Dani Pettrey\u2019s characters are always so charismatic and full of adventure. Her females are strong and self-reliant, and her males are the epitome of rough-around-the-edges hero material. Ms. Pettrey\u2019s Alaskan Courage series is on my favorites list, and the great thing about SHADOWED, is it\u2019s link to that same series. I would\u2019ve bought SINS OF THE PAST for this installment alone.Finally, Lynette Eason with BLACKOUT-Macy Adams is living with a nightmare she can\u2019t remember. Someone is stalking her because of her involvement in a robbery gone bad when she was a teenager. The problem is, she can\u2019t remember the events of that night. However, someone is convinced Macy knows more than what she\u2019s telling, and that she stashed the cache from the robbery. Chad Latham, is not only Macy\u2019s next-door neighbor, but he happens to be a cop. When it becomes clear someone is stalking Macy, Chad steps in, not just because he\u2019s a detective, but because his attraction for Macy has gnawed at him for two years. He always felt she kept him at arms-length, now he knows why. His hope is to find the person who\u2019s threatening her, and with any luck, tear down the walls she\u2019s erected around herself. This is another amazing story from Lynette Eason. Action grabs you from the first page and gives the reader little time to catch their breath. A stressed-out heroine, and a patient cop\u2014a great combination. The situation Macy got herself into as a teen was a tad far-reaching, but hey, that\u2019s why we call it fiction. It didn't detract from the overall story. Thanks ladies for a great read. My only complaint . . . I would\u2019ve rather the stories be full-length because the novellas read too fast."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20350483-sarah", "userReview": "I\u2019m not usually a fan of novellas, in a collection or otherwise, but when I saw this one with three of my favorite suspense authors, I couldn\u2019t resist giving it a go and I definitely enjoyed it! Bethany House is building a reputation for creating great novella collections that maybe allow readers to be introduced to new-to-them authors, or maybe just build on characters from said authors previous works. I\u2019m generally fairly leery of novellas, even from my favorite authors, because I love long books. It\u2019s a statement of fact and I often find novellas far too short for my tastes, or they simply feel rushed. I can very happily say that I didn\u2019t find that to be the case with any of the stories in this collection!The first book in the collection is \u201cMissing\u201d by Dee Henderson. I\u2019m a huge fan of her work, so I was both thrilled and a little nervous to read this story. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like the shortened tale or if I could accept the fact it would be a little over 100 pages long, instead of the now familiar 400+ pages. Thankfully, these questions were quickly put to rest as I easily became engrossed in the search for John\u2019s mother and the mystery of what happened. I was rather sorry that it ended so quickly, but everything was tied up well, without any loose threads or the sense of it being rushed. The characters were easy to get to know and like, and I enjoyed that Ms. Henderson was able to weave in some important wisdom, even with the mystery taking dominance. The second book is \u201cShadowed\u201d by Dani Pettrey, which is something of a prequel to her Alaskan Courage series. It follows the story of Ben McKenna and Libby Jennings (parents to the McKenna siblings that are the focus of the aforementioned series) and how they met. I enjoyed this glimpse into the past and getting to know the parents of the siblings I so fell in love with! You don\u2019t have to have read the books to love this story, though you may find yourself snatching them up as soon as you\u2019ve finished it! It\u2019s filled with her now-trademark suspense and kept me guessing! I also have to say that I did appreciate slowing down for a moment here and there to see Ben and Libby getting to know one another and falling in love. I also really enjoyed the epilogue at the end that tied it up well and kept the romance between them from feeling rushed. The final book in the collection is \u201cBlackout\u201d by Lynette Eason. This story may have been my favorite of those here, though I did enjoy them all. I think it\u2019s my favorite because I very much love Ms. Eason\u2019s way with suspense. If the others kept me hooked, then this one also had me on the edge of my seat! I wanted to know what would happen next, and of course, whodunnit! I really liked Macey and Chad\u2019s characters, as well as Lilly, who I\u2019m hoping may have a story of her own, at some point (hint, hint). This story did feel a tad rushed compared to the others, but it actually worked well, with the story and how everything was playing out so quickly. Overall, I really can\u2019t think of anything that I didn\u2019t like about this collection, except you know, that these weren\u2019t individual full length novels. But they were all great reads and I have to highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys suspense. And I\u2019m so excited for the next work each of the authors has releasing, hopefully soon! I received a copy of this book from the publisher for my honest review, which I have given. I was not required to write a positive review and have not been compensated for it in any way.

Heading up the investigation is the head of missing persons Sharon Noble. Together they try and find out who took John\u2019s mother and why. Could it be someone from John\u2019s past? Or was it a random crime of opportunity? As the hours march by the chances of his mother being found alive grow slimmer. I really liked this short story! There was mystery, a bit of suspense and even a potential for some romance. Plus add in one of my favorite authors writing the story and I was quite satisfied.Shadowed by Dani PettreyBefore the McKenna\u2019s in the Alaskan Courage series their parents Ben and Libby were involved in a murder mystery in the 70\u2019s.While out whale watching Ben and Libby discover a body floating around among the Orca\u2019s. Upon hauling the body in Libby discovers that she knows the woman. Kat was a Russian competitor among the long distance swimmers that Libby also competes in.Ben and Libby discover a code sewn into Kat\u2019s swim cap. They are determined to break the code in hopes of discovering who killed Kat, but that person is just as determined not to be discovered, including eliminating Ben and Libby to keep his identity secret.I enjoyed reading how the McKenna parents met and fell in love. It was fun to see their personalities and their dreams of one day having a family. The mystery was good and I found it interesting to go back in time to where Russia was the enemy and spies and espionage were the norm.Blackout by Lynette EasonMacey Adams is starting to remember the nightmare that happened when she was 17. The only problem is someone from that night doesn\u2019t want Macey to remember anything about that night.When Macey\u2019s next door neighbor, Chad Latham, hears her screams in the night he races over to her house to help her. Fearing that someone has tried to get into her house Macey believes she knows who it was. People have already died in order to keep Macey quiet about that fateful night, she is reluctant to share with Chad what is going on, but knows that she needs help to keep herself alive and learn the truth of what her mind has refused to remember.I love a good romantic suspense and Blackout did not disappoint! Lynette Eason is one of those authors that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat throughout.  MY THOUGHTS:All three authors in Sins of the Past are some of my favorite romantic/suspense writers and I enjoyed all three of their short stories. I liked that all three stories seemed to be complete on their own without feeling like I was missing something that went on before or after. Each story had all of the elements I have come to expect from these authors. Each story had a believable romance and each one had suspense that moved the story along.

Some novellas I loved, and others were just so-so.Missing by Dee Henderson: I started reading Henderson's romantic suspense in college, and I absolutely devoured her O'Malley series. This is the first of her writing that I've read in probably close to ten years, and I have to say, I didn't really enjoy it. The story is fine\u2014John returns to Chicago when his mother goes missing, and he begins working with Chicago cop Sharon to find her. The mystery was intriguing, and though I did accurately guess who had John's mother, I was way off on the motive. The problem for me was that Henderson told the reader that John and Sharon were falling for each other, but it was all talk\u2014there was a lack of emotion that made me not buy the two romantically. 2-1/2 stars.Shadowed by Dani Pettrey: Pettrey's Alaskan Courage series featuring the McKenna family is one of my favorite series of all time, so I was thrilled to dive into the love story of Ben McKenna and Libby Jennings, who would later become the parents of the McKenna tribe. (They are long dead by the time the Alaskan Courage series begins, so it was nice to meet them.) The mystery surrounds the murder of one of Libby's swimming competitors, and as Libby and Ben investigate, they find their lives in danger. For me, the love story was a bit rushed, but the suspense was spot on. And, as always, Pettrey's writing was excellent. 4 stars.Blackout by Lynette Eason: Of the three novellas included in this collection, Blackout is by far my favorite. Macey survived being shot and buried alive as a teenager, but her memories of that tragic night have been dim at best. When she finally starts remembering, she becomes a target. Macey's next door neighbor Chad, a police detective, helps her search for the person who is after her, but the closer they get to the truth, the more dangerous things become. Eason is known for her high-octane suspense, and Blackout certainly lives up to her reputation! Also, the romance in this novella doesn't feel rushed (as the two are friends prior to the novel's beginning), which lent an air of believability to the story. 5 stars.Overall, I enjoyed Sins of the Past, and, while I definitely connected with some novellas more than others, I think most fans of romantic suspense will enjoy this collection. 4 stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free for review.

As soon as they started talking about suspects, I knew who had done it, so spending the rest of the novella shaking my head at two seasoned cops who couldn\u2019t figure it out made me less intrigued. However, if the characters were three-dimensional, this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue at all.The characters kept referring to one another by name, sometimes multiple times in a conversation. I do hope that will be taken care of before it goes to final print, but it was rather distracting\u2014not something that happens in a real conversation.However, I was more disappointed in the quality of the characters. They felt flat\u2014almost monotonous\u2014and the romance truly felt forced. I didn\u2019t feel any sparks between the two, so when John, the hero, asked Sharon, the heroine, about the pull between the two of them, I was caught off guard. It was abrupt, in my opinion.I\u2019m normally a Dee Henderson fan and truly don\u2019t like giving a negative review, but this is not a novella I\u2019d read again. However, there may be editorial changes made before the book comes out, so don\u2019t not read this one based on my review.Next is Shadowed by Dani Pettrey.Oh, it was so good to read a prequel to Dani\u2019s Alaskan Courage series! To read how the siblings\u2019 parents (Ben and Libby) met and how their relationship developed. It was like coming home. \uf04aDani didn\u2019t disappoint with regards to her writing style. The tension, the sparks, the suspense\u2026it\u2019s all there in spades. A truly great, fun novella!! Finally, there\u2019s Blackout by Lynette Eason.Lynette never fails to disappoint me, I have to admit. This is a fast-paced, very suspenseful story. Macey and Chad are a great team, and there\u2019s a lot of action packed into a short novella! Sometimes the pacing is a little too fast, but considering the shortness of this story, it\u2019s completely understandable. Overall, a great read by one of my favorite romantic suspense authors!While I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend Dee Henderson\u2019s novella, I do recommend Dani Pettrey\u2019s and Lynette Eason\u2019s!*Note: I received this book via NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.

Since I am not sure how to review this book, I will do a short review for each story:Missing by Dee Henderson: Of the three stories in the book, this one would rate the lowest. I liked the main characters, but the plot and answer to the mystery were a tad bit disappointing, but maybe it was just me. It was an interesting story that held my interest. I just found the ending a bit disappointing.Shadowed by Dani Pettrey: I wasn't sure about this one at first. I love Dani's books, and her Alaskan Courage Series is among the best Christian suspense out there...... but it is set in 1979. I was hoping it would pick up where that series left off. Then I started reading it, and loved it - I should not have doubted the author. If you have read the Alaskan Courage Series that centers around the motherless and fatherless McKenna adult children, you will definitely want to read this novella. Dani wrote it about the parents and how they met, and of course there is a nail biting mystery going on. This story was the best of the three, and I absolutely loved it. Suspense, cold war, romance, and a lot of mystery and drama....definitely 5 stars.Blackout by Lynette Eason Lynette is another favorite author who never disappoints, and she proves she can write as great of a novella as she can a full length novel. This one had a great plot, and very likable characters. The author packed a lot of suspense and mystery into so few pages, and she kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next and how it would turn out.

These three enjoyable stories are tied together only by the theme of past situations impacting the characters. Missing by Dee Henderson is a unique story about a cop's elderly mother who disappears from her assisted living facility. The characters were engaging and I particularly enjoyed the setting since I work in a skilled nursing facility. My one disappointment was that the resolution was pretty obvious fairly early in the story, although the \"why\" wasn't clear until much later. Dani Pettrey's Shadowed is a prequel to her Alaskan Courage series and portrays the story of the McKenna parents in their young adult years. I loved how the title coordinated with the rest of the series and the tie-in to the Cold War and the fierce competition between the US and Russian athletes. Pettrey once again kept me glued to the pages of this compelling story. One of my favorite suspense authors, Lynette Eason always writes a chilling story, and Blackout is no exception. Plenty of action and heart-pounding moments fill this story that is best read well before bedtime, especially if you are a female who lives alone!

Because of these details I actually thought the stories were even more suspenseful. The first story, Missing, from Dee Henderson is not only heart-pounding it is also heart-gripping. Beyond the shear terror of a missing person's tale this is also a beautiful story of a mother and son and their deep love for each other.The second story, Shadowed, by Dani Pettrey was a scary but fun trip back in time. The setting is the late 70's in Yancey, Alaska. As a fan of Dani's Alaskan Courage series I was delighted to read the story of Ben and Libby and the beginning of the future McKenna clan. If you've read that series, you must read this as well.The third and final story, Blackout, by Lynette Eason is a quick snapshot of Lynette's amazing crime drama style.
