I read it in its entirety in a 16 hour journey from Paris to Philly. Needless to say, the book definitely helped those hours fly by.I really enjoyed this book. I especially liked that it takes place in Philadelphia and gave a good insight about how slavery was viewed in the US, and especially PA, in 1855. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical fiction or to anyone who enjoys learning about Philly's past."}, {"userName": "Enik\u0151", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1195946-enik", "userReview": "Two stars - it was okay. The story itself was good, but it got lost in the telling. For exemple, I found myself frustrated when, after Ginnie finally climbed out from beneath the blankets and straw in the wagon to breathe freely, the narration turned toward the Quick family. These were Ginnie's first real moments of freedom, but the author chose this moment to introduce them. I might add that there were so many members in this family that I could never quite keep them all straight, apart from Harriet and perhaps Manny and Della. I wonder if there wouldn't have been a better way to introduce them, perhaps fewer at a time instead of all at once.I also feel that Ginnie's pain at leaving Bennie behind wasn't given sufficient recognition. I would have thought her first move, once free, would have been to ask the members of the Underground Railroad about bringing him north. As it is, I almost feel that the book's title was not justified, although I did like the ending. It was realistic, instead of perfect."}, {"userName": "Alexine Fleck", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7160993-alexine-fleck", "userReview": "I'm about half way through, and it's not as good as I really wanted it to be. But then I wonder, do I hold historical novels about slavery to higher standards? How does a person write really well about this enormous traumatic injustice that went on for centuries? And I hate to say it, but how does one write about slavery after Toni Morrison wrote about slavery? That said, I just think it's thin. I don't much care about the romance plot. I want Mercer to be happy, but I don't want to read about that. I want to learn more about life and about what it means to \"pay\" a child for freedom. Then I think, am I no different from all those white abolitionist ladies who only want to hear about drama and heartache? Why can't I just let Mercer find love and happiness? Finished a few days ago. Disappointing. I don't feel like it did the necessary work to earn the ending, which could have been much more moving if that narrative arc were more carefully crafted.Sigh.

But sometimes there\u2019s something about the book that keeps a person reading it. It could be because of something they heard about the book or just curiosity. Very few people does this because when they aren\u2019t very interested, they give up on the book.From interesting to suspenseful to boring to interesting again, Lorene Cary\u2019s novel \u201cThe Price of a Child\u201d tells about a family who was able to become free. After many years, Virginia Pryor and her children was finally able to be free from her master and slavery with the help of Philadelphia\u2019s Vigilance Committee. With freedom and new lives, a new name had to be made for Virginia (Mercer Gray) as well as new relationships and responsibilities as she becomes a speaker on the abolition circuit. When reading \u201cThe Price of a Child\u201d, I was really interested in reading the book at first because there was so much going on. You wanted to know what happened in the past and what would happen next. But as I kept reading the book, the interest started to die down causing me to read the book less and less. However, I never stop reading the book because I still wanted to know what was going to happen to Mercer and her kids. I wanted to know how the book was going to end. And as I kept reading, the book started to get interesting again because unpredicted events started to happen. I never enjoyed reading books that had to do with slavery or history in general because I\u2019m not a big history fan. Even though a book is fiction, I still can\u2019t find myself reading it. That\u2019s why this book was a challenge for me to read. I\u2019ve never read a book like this on my own will before and that\u2019s why I decided to read it. I wanted to read something new for a change. And even though I found the book interesting in the beginning and ending, I can\u2019t come to say that this book was my overall favorite because lost my attention. I would catch myself reading the book but not knowing what was happening so I would have to read the pages over again. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys historical events. Someone who is crazy about history and not looking for extra excitement. And those who don\u2019t really like history, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this book because they probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy as much like I did. But if someone wanted to challenge themselves, I would say this book would the one especially if you and history don\u2019t get along. \u201cThe Price of a Child\u201d was a book that I thought I wasn\u2019t going to like and I was right. And for now on I am going to continue to read books that fits my interest but will also read books that is out of my reading comfort to challenge myself even more."}, {"userName": "Hannahwissner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24176700-hannahwissner", "userReview": "This book takes place in 1855 and follows a slave and mother of 3 named Ginnie. Growing up as an educated slave, her owner Jackson Pryor always treated her well and liked her, he liked her so much that he is the father of her three children. The novel starts out with Jackson only allowing Ginnie to bring her two oldest children with him and her as they travel north. Once in Philadelphia, Ginnie and the kids managed to escape from Jackson. They then had to go into hiding with help from the Quick's family who are involved in the underground railroad. Changing her name to Mercer, she had to leave her children to go hide in New York where she began to be involved in speaking out about slavery rights. Eventually, she came back to Philadelphia to her kids and fell in love with a married man, Tyree but in the end they cannot be together but she is given money from him, almost enough to buy her child back left in Virginia. I found this book to be good but it is for people who enjoy history but do not need interesting events to happen. This did a good job of showing what America was like during the time of slavery and their struggles.It could get boring and was a sad book but I would still recommend it."}, {"userName": "Aquil Thompson--king", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37173028-aquil-thompson--king", "userReview": "In this book \"The Price of a Child\", the main character Ginnie Pryor is a woman with two children who are trying to start a new life by trying to get away from a man named Jackson.

Ginnie later on in the story changes her name to Mercer, goes to court to become a free woman from Jackson Pryor.

Mercer at the end continues on to find a stable a life with her family, and she moves on from Tyree to go to West Chester, PA.What I liked about this book was the fact that it was really compelling and interesting. It pulls you in to read more and more of the book to find out what happens next. What also makes this book really good is that it is a book based off of real events, which makes the book even more credible for the reader becoming interesting in the book.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in historical books.

For readers who enjoy historical fiction set during antebellum period, this novel will not disappoint. The novel opens during the year of 1855, when Lorene Cary introduces the heroin character of Ginnie Pryor, a Virginia plantation slave, and her crusade to seek freedom. Cary also brilliantly addresses Philadelphia\u2019s Underground Railroad history by intriguingly basing the character of Ginnie Pryor on the actual life of a gallant Philadelphian slave woman.
