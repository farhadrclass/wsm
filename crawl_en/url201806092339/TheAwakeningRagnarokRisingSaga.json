I had no idea what \"Ragnarok\" meant, but after Wikipedia let me know, it makes sense. It's essentially the Norse end of life as we know it scenario, and it makes sense in context with this book, because the main character apparently worships Odin. As in, Thor. I have to admit that it was strange for me to get used to that at first, because I think of Odin in terms of the recent Hollywood movies with Anthony Hopkins and Chris Hemsworth. Every time the main character prayed to Odin and \"Friend Thor\", it made me want to laugh. Sorry, someone's religion isn't funny, but can you picture praying to Chris Hemsworth? It's just what I pictured. Anyways. The story is pretty fantastic, the characters are great, the dialogue is well written (and very funny at times). I really don't have much to say that's negative. I think the title might make some people overlook the book, which is a shame, and there are a few areas where I think it's detail-heavy. (While driving through Springfield, every time they went out, we were told every street, right, left, everything they saw, what they might have seen a different direction, etc. I don't know Springfield, and it felt a little bogged down by every minute detail.) Otherwise, a really great book. Wylie is the ultimate warrior, and Spec4 is his perfect warrior sidekick. Also, it doesn't really have anything to do with the book, but at the top of every new chapter, the author added some fairly famous quotes. I loved them. Really great quotes, and they tied in very well with the warrior theme to the book. Now, Mr. Roberts, I need book two ASAP!!"}, {"userName": "David P Forsyth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7201946-david-p-forsyth", "userReview": "In \u201cRagnarok Rising: The Awakening\u201d DA Roberts offers an exciting and fresh take on the tried and true story of a zombie apocalypse as seen through the eyes of a correctional officer who discovers the best place to be is inside a jail. This action packed thrill ride is full of horror, suspense and gun-play. The protagonist, along with a strong female sidekick, discovers that zombies are not the only threat they face when humanity consumes itself. Yet even in the face of trigger happy rednecks and military atrocities, they rise to the call of duty and rescue civilians, fellow officers, and family in a story that displays both the best and worst sides of mankind and leaves you wanting more. Five stars for this outstanding addition to the genre!Review by David P Forsyth (Author of Voyage of the Dead, Flotilla of the Dead, and Deluge of the Dead)"}, {"userName": "T.L.

Usually these end up being outrageous self images put to paper. D.A. Roberts has created a local real life world that has adapted to the zombie infestation in a mostly realistic manner. Roberts brings the fear and adrenaline of a horror scenario to the streets he knows best. Once the story starts rolling it is hard to put down. The story build up does not last as long as Tom Clancy but does last long enough to ensure the background of the main character is not ignored. Overall this is a great zombie story that makes you feel as if you could be the person living the situation."}, {"userName": "Brian Hash", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10903878-brian-hash", "userReview": "I got the ePub version of this book and finished it two days later!

Roberts (Review)By Capt. (Mike) CreeperTitle: Ragnarok Rising: The AwakeningAuthor: D.A. RobertsPages: 418Publication Date: June 30, 2012Basic Plot: \u201cInitial reports of rioting and chaos begin to appear in the news, slowly spreading east from California. As the unusual 'riots' come closer and closer however, the first hints of their true nature begin to emerge. Internet videos show rioters eating those they overtake. When the disturbances finally reach Springfield Missouri, all law enforcement officers are called to field duty. Officer Wylie Grant finds himself manning a remote checkpoint. There the true nature of the \"rioters\" becomes terrifyingly clear, and only Wylie and Corporal Chrissy Wilder survive the revelation. Their new goal becomes to survive \u2026\u201d (Amazon)My likes/dislikes: So this is the first book in Roberts' \u201cRagnarock\u201d series. We are fortunate that he sent us the book to read because I doubt I would have come across it on my own or if I did I might have passed it by, because as I have mentioned recently, I feel there is a glut on the market and am honestly getting a little tired of zombies. That having been said, I have to add that once again I was pleasantly surprised to find I actually enjoyed this book. It has the usual stock of characters and starts out the same as a lot of zombie books with an unknown outbreak that starts in other parts of the country and spreads eventually closing in on our hero\u2019s location. What\u2019s nice is there isn\u2019t a lot of the denial of zombies not being possible. Our characters quickly realize what the threat is and adapt accordingly. I constantly found myself rooting for the main characters and wishing for the deaths of others. Surprisingly the characters I wanted dead the most weren\u2019t even given that much attention in the book\u2026 but I still wanted them to get their faces eaten off. Now there is some bad to this book. It tends to get a bit repetitive as Wylie (our protagonist) keeps going back out on rescue/scavenging missions. I felt overwhelmed at times with road names and directions as our group of hero\u2019s went looking for other survivors. I am not from Missouri and have only ever driven through it so a lot of the road descriptions meant nothing to me, but, I am sure anyone from the area who reads the book will get a kick out of recognizing the area. Of course if Mr. Roberts gets the details wrong then they will be the first to criticize it also. One of the things I really didn\u2019t like was the focus on all the weapons. I am not a gun enthusiast so the mention of weapon after weapon was a bit distracting since I had no idea what they were talking about. What I really liked was, for lack of a better word, the realism in the book. I know, I know\u2026 realism in a zombie novel? Yes, I said it right\u2026 realism. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026 any of you who have listened to me on this show or read my reviews will notice that I can only take suspension of disbelief so far and then I get pissy. Roberts does great job of not taking things too far. The vehicles which become our hero\u2019s main mode of transportation for the search and rescue take a hell of a beating, and Roberts doesn\u2019t ignore the laws of reality, i.e. one vehicle loses its topside gun while crashing through a house and they abandon another one due to it being unfit to drive anymore. Also, our characters suffer injuries and it affects them like it would anyone, there aren\u2019t any super heroes or BFG\u2019s and certainly no Dead Reckoning (yes those were obscure pop culture references again\u2026 come on people Google was invented for a reason). Additionally, something else I liked was the way Roberts divided the zombies into five different categories when we usually only see one or two, three at the most. Its not silly or arbitrary either, it makes sense especially if you are a fan of the zombie genre.I went and read some other reviews of \u201cRagnarok Rising: The Awakening\u201d and wanted to address a couple of issues that never originally occurred to me... One reviewer ragged on the book for like three paragraphs and then at the end in, what appears to be a throw away sentence, mentions the focus, or lack thereof, of the Norse mythology. Yes Wylie\u2019s character professes to worship the Norse gods as opposed to Christianity and yes there is very little explanation about it or for it, but, I have to say\u2026 SO WHAT. I would think by today that we have more tolerance to not focus on someone\u2019s religious beliefs. Yes, I hope with the next book we might get more background and/or explanation but I don\u2019t feel that is really the point or focus of the book. The other issue I saw repeatedly was people ragging on the fact that the character of Wilder seems to fall for Wylie in a relatively short period of time and feel her character is shallow or something for it. One person mentions that within 24 hours of meeting they are sleeping alone together in a room, in each other\u2019s arms. Now I have never been enlisted in the military let alone in any sort of combat situation but it seems to me that this might actually be a normal reaction in the face of what they were dealing with. I don\u2019t know for sure though so I will leave it to the experts, but I never once questioned it while I was reading it. So over all this was pretty good and I really liked it despite having a few minor problems. I even liked the fact that he didn\u2019t resolve anything at the end, as you often find in writers of series, but left you with a cliffhanger which means waiting for the next book. Bastard. Anyway I can\u2019t wait to read the next book. Well done.My score: 4 out of 5 stabsFormat: Paperback and e-bookTAGS: Creepercast, Michael Donner, Captain Creepers Book Corner, Capt Creeper, Mike, horror, books, review, Ragnarock Rising The Awakening, D.A.

Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors.

Wylie Grant likes law-enforcement news stories, since he is a Corrections Officer with the Nathanael County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Springfield, Missouri. That day, he watched footage of mob violence and rioting in LA. Wylie notices the rioters shamble through the wreckage, their eyes glazed and their mouths ringed with blood.As the violence continues, Wylie experiences vivid dreams about Vikings fighting the same type of rioters he'd seen on TV. Wylie's tattoos are a triple horn on the left pectoral and a volknut on each bicep. The tattoos symbolize his dedication to Odin and the Aesir. He prays to Odin and Thor for help.D. A. Roberts offers a different perspective on zombies. Ragnarok Rising: The Awakening (Book One of The Ragnarok Rising Saga) tells the story from Wylie's point of view.
