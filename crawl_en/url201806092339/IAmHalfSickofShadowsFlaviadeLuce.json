Each of them was interesting in a different way, and this one was no exception.\u201dFlavia de Luce always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong right time. She doesn\u2019t have to leave her small town of Bishop\u2019s Lacey to find a steady supply of bodies recently discarded by their souls. Due to precarious pecuniary circumstances Flavia\u2019s father has recently rented out the ancestral home of Buckshaw to a film crew. Flavia has been busy in her long departed Uncle Tar\u2019s laboratory on the upper floors of the home. She is whipping up a batch of chemical substances that will help her catch St. Nicholas once and for all. \nSt. Nick has no idea what is waiting for him on the roof of the de Luce house.\u201dScribbled in the margin of one of Uncle Tar\u2019s notebooks, I had found a quotation from Sir Francis Bacon: \u2018We must not then add wings, but rather lead and ballast to the understanding, to prevent its jumping or flying.\u2019Precisely what I had in mind for Saint Nicholas! A dose of the old tanglefoot! Later, in bed, my head filled with visions of reindeer stuck fast to the chimney pots like giant bluebottles to flypaper, I realized I was grinning madly in the dark.\u201dWith the film crew is the famous actress Phyllis Wyvern who is a mixture of niceties and temperamental outbursts. She does make an astute comment about Flavia\u2019s interactions with her older sisters Ophelia (Feely) and Daphne (Daffy). \u201dOlder sisters are much alike the world over: half a cup of love and half one of contempt.\u201dAs Flavia observes Wyvern in action she also discovers most of her secrets and is soon on the trail of others. Flavia is naturally nosy once she gets a whiff of something she doesn\u2019t understand. \u201dI realized at once that a great actress can never be greater than when she\u2019s starring in her own life.\u201d\nBesides an interest in dead bodies.\u201dI noticed at once the way the illuminated cine screen was reflected in her eyeballs, giving the illusion for a moment that she was alive, her eyes sparkling. But even though the eyes had not yet begun to cloud over--she\u2019s not been dead for long, I thought--something had already begun to soften her features, as if her face were being sanded down for repainting.\u201d\nShe is also overly fascinated by poisons and fantasizes regularly about implementing them on those that annoy her. \u201dIn my mind, Larshaw was already writhing on the floor, his face engorged, his eyes bulging from their sockets, hanging on with both hands to his gut, begging for the antidote to cyanide poisoning.\u201dWahaha, it does keep one sane just indulging in a bit of imaginary homicidal revenge, and you can even wish them a Merry Christmas through gritted teeth at the same time. Her oldest sister Feely is popular with the local boys, a source of constant irritation to Flavia. \u201dFeely had more swains than Ulysses\u2019s wife, Penelope, had suitors--I like \u2018swains\u2019 better than \u2018suitors\u2019 because it sounds like \u2018swine\u2019--all of whom, through some strange quirk of fate, had now turned up at Buckshaw at the same time.\u201dHer other sister Daffy can rarely be found without a book in her hand. She\u2019s the sister I would be chasing after, for a chat about books, but would probably find that she has little time for me because conversation is just another thing that keeps her from reading another dozen pages in Bleak House or The Way We Live Now.\u201dBooks are like oxygen to a deep-sea diver, \u201c she had once said. \u201cTake them away and you might as well begin counting the bubbles.\u201d\nFlavia is busier than any three eleven year old girls put together. She is investigating a murder; trying to avoid the police who are never too happy with her meddling; concocting her chemical trap for Saint Nicholas; and trying to learn as much as she can about the magic of movies. As she puts the pieces together and begins to understand the why and the who she becomes the next target for a very Christmas Murder. This is the fourth in a surprisingly charming and entertaining series.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten or you can catch some of my reviews on http://www.shelfinflicted.com/."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/831894-jenny", "userReview": "Mr. Bradley, write faster!"}, {"userName": "Danielle Young", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983656-danielle-young", "userReview": "Probability and reality are not reasons to read a Flavia de Luce book, and that is as true for I Am Half-Sick of Shadows as any of them. I am not looking for a well crafted mystery when I read these books, I am looking to romp around with the characters (especially Flavia) that populate the strange little world of Bishops Lacey. A romp (with a good dash of firework chemistry) is what this book delivers. This book takes place solely in Buckshaw (where pretty much the entire town of BL happens to be as well), so you get a lot more of Buckshaw and less of Flavia and Gladys touring the countryside. In particular, you get to know Dogger better (Dogger!) and he is a treat of a character and a mystery in and of himself. A great addition to the series (will she catch Father Christmas? And if so will the German Father Christmas have to deliver all of England's presents?), but if you're new to Flavia just start at the beginning."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "There is plenty to love in this installment of Flavia de Luce's adventures, especially if you are her existing fan. I Am Half-Sick of Shadows is a Christmas story, with a great infusion of some new blood, which is a must for any series focusing on such a tiny place as Bishop's Lacey. Flavia's father is forced to rent out Buckshaw to a movie company to film its new feature. When the star of the movie is found murdered, Flavia is on full alert. Now she has two Christmas cases on her hands - the murder and her project to confirm the existence of Santa. Whatever you liked about the previous books in the series, is all there - the humor, the charm, the interesting characters, the mischief. However, I feel that in their zeal to deliver I Am Half-Sick of Shadows just in time for Christmas, Bradley and his gang of editors and agents forgot to pay attention to the quality of this novel. To put it bluntly, it is half-baked. Besides the wonky motives of the killer, far-fetching backstories of some characters, multiple pointless cameo appearances of characters from previous books and half-hearted at best red herrings, this book lacks simple continuity. The part that especially stood out for me (unless, of course, I misunderstood it) was when a certain character in one chapter is sent out in a snowstorm to fetch a couple of people, in the next chapter is sitting in the Buckshaw's living room chatting and in the next is just coming from outside with the couple (if you are curious, I am talking about Sergeant Graves in chapters 13-15). How is it possible that an editor of this book didn't notice this discrepancy, if even I, a person absolutely unobservant, did? As usual in such cases, I am pretty sure nobody had read this manuscript before rushing it into print.In spite of its many obvious flaws, the book was still entertaining and funny. I just hope the next one is edited and constructed better."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4* of fiveThe Book Report: Flavia de Luce does Christmas. Buckshaw, Bishop's Lacey, is now the scene of Ilium Films's new Phyllis Wyvern extravaganza, The Cry of the Raven. The film company has paid the desperately strapped-for-cash Colonel Haviland de Luce a sizable sum to use Buckshaw as the backdrop for this bound-to-be-mega hit, which means Christmas will be spent with an entire film crew up the family's collective backside. Flavia meets the famous Miss Wyvern as she enters the house, charming as cheesecake on a plate of strawberries, even winning the adulation of the normally suspicious Flavia by demonstrating her apparently genuine interest in matters of murder: She quotes from the dreadful gossip sheet Illustrated London News about a recent scandalous killing. Well then!Not long after the lady's arrival, the cast and crew and director make their various appearances, as doe the Vicar, with a modest proposal: He'd like famous movie star Wyvern to appear as Juliet, her star-making role, in a village fete in aid of the church roof's repair. To absolutely universal astonishment, Miss Wyvern agrees, and the plot begins to spin faster and faster. Since the hairpins have begun to fall, and Miss Wyvern's true meanness is revealed, the fact that she's murdered by someone present at Buckshaw after the fete...which includes just about the whole village, since a blizzard's blown in, sealing all the audience in Buckshaw's foyer...comes as no surprise whatever.Even though the bloom has gone off the rose of Flavia's admiration for the lady, a murder under her own roof is simply too much to resist meddling in! And meddle she does, searching the victim's room and even standing in at the post-mortem examination of the body. Flavia, though, is callously shut out by Inspector Hewitt of the Hinley P.D., as is his wont. He has, thinks Flavia, personal animus against her now, as Flavia made a terrible break at tea taken in the Hewitt home.But in the end, Flavia solves the horrible, tawdry crime, and fails to become the next murder victim herself by dint of one of her chemistry experiments designed to trap Santa Claus on his way to the chimney, thereby disproving her horrible, heartless sisters's claims that there is no Santa. And, at the very tippy-end of the book, Buckshaw's future at the hands of the tax receivers is probably averted thanks to the very play that caused the Christmas crisis to begin with...a lovely, deft scene that wrapped up an end I was really ticked about having loose.Merry Christmas indeed, Flavia.My Review: Every series needs a Christmas book. This is it. If you liked the others, this one will please you; but it has the standard plot-hole and plausibility flaws. If they didn't tick you off before, they won't now, either.

After all, at least it features a curious, resourceful young girl who is interested in chemistry and forensics, who solves murders in a delightfully Blyton-esque way by getting herself all tangled up in them. Of course there're problems with this... fetishisation of an old British country house and ~British spirit~*, etc, Flavia tampering with crime scenes, the nigh-on abusive behaviour of Flavia's sisters (although that does seem to be developing, slowly, book by book, and might perhaps become more understandable later on). No, nitpicking aside, I Am Half-Sick of Shadows is fun. How very like Flavia to try and prove the existence of Father Christmas by attempting to more or less glue him to the chimney pots. And there's a touch more about her Aunt Felicity, and Dogger, which makes both of them more interesting characters. Well, I already found Dogger interesting, but I wasn't sure what the point of Aunt Felicity was. Now... I think she and Flavia have more in common than we've yet seen.The mystery itself is fairly perfunctory -- the murder isn't discovered until pretty much half-way through! I barely had time to get my head around the suspects before Flavia was getting attacked. It's really less of a mystery series and more of a quirky detective series, mysteries to some extent optional.Still, as I say, it's fun -- when I don't take it seriously.*British my foot. The De Luces of this series are very, very English, and that's what Alan Bradley meant them to be. British is unnecessarily inclusive of the Welsh, Scots and Irish. There's not a trace of any of those nationalities here."}, {"userName": "Josie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21250-josie", "userReview": "Having read all four Flavia de Luce novels in the last couple of weeks, I'm all Flavia'd out for the time being. She certainly is unique -- who else would try to capture Father Christmas by coating the roof and chimneys in birdlime? -- but perhaps is best taken in small doses. I don't think I can take much more of her tampering with crime scenes. (Does this bother anybody else? I could understand her looking around, but she disturbs the body, moves things around, and steals evidence for her own investigations! The Inspector has the patience of a saint.) I also disliked the implications in this book that Ophelia and Daphne have a ~special reason~ for hatin' on Flavia so much. They're older sisters: they don't need an excuse to be bitches.P.S. Who else noticed the continuity error midway through the book? Sergeant Graves is sent out into the blizzard to fetch back the vicar and his wife.

It is the fourth installment in a series of books about Flavia de Luce. Eleven year old Flavia lives with her sisters Daphne and Ophelia and her father, Colonel Haviland De Luce, in a rambling old mansion in the English countryside. The story is set around Christmas sometime during 1940\u2019s-1950's era.Flavia is quite a character, someone straight out of the fictional St.Trinian\u2019s School for Girls series of British movies. She is smart, tormented by her older sisters, has a passion for chemistry, poisons and solving murders. Author Alan Bradley is Canadian, but when reading this novel, you get the feeling that the story was written by a British author with a very wry, witty sense of humour. I loved the writing!!In this story the colonel agrees to rent out part of the house to a film studio for a movie shoot as his funds are desperately dwindling. The crew and actors move in during the Christmas season. After a particularly painful production of Romeo and Juliet held for the local townspeople at the mansion, a terrible snowstorm leaves everyone present at the house stranded overnight. A sleepless Flavia discovers Phyllis Wyvern, leading actress and major pain in the neck, murdered by strangulation. There are plenty of suspects and Flavia\u2019s sleuthing skills are geared up for action.This novel would make an excellent Disney movie \u2013 overall very entertaining and a fun story!"}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "Reason for Reading: next in the series.Oh, the sweet pure pleasure of reading a Flavia de Luce mystery, the witty and wise 11yo chemist with a propensity for poisons.

Making a great Christmas gift as our action takes place on Christmas Eve this is sure to please fans and newcomers alike. Fans will be pleased to see familiar faces but newcomers won't miss a thing just jumping in with this series. A great character study and return to the traditional British mystery, Bradley has the Christie flair down to a \"T\". The book entices us with two mysteries actually as the murder does not take place until 2/3s of the way into the book. While the reader is kept guessing as to who will be murdered for the larger part of the book they are then rewarded with a splendid crime that has members of Flavia's own family on her list of suspects and her own life in danger at the climax.

For me, the Flavia de Luce series by Alan Bradley is just for fun. I enjoy Flavia and her adventures. I always say that she never sounds like a little girl, but this one was the closest of her being and acting her own age. I really liked that and it made me smile. I also like her family dynamic.

Yes, in this series she's been a precocious narrator of her own brilliant, amateur sleuthing as well as infatuation with chemistry, especially concerning poisons. There's been a good amount of good humor, as well as violent denouements which don't fit the overall setting.The setting, a large, old estate in a small town, must have been begging for the full blown \"cozy\" treatment, because this one delivers that, in your face, to the point that in the end, the Inspector (who actually has shown more competence this time around, not being so ridiculously shown up by a pre-teen amateur) has to point out that it's \"rather like an Agatha Christie\" mystery. No sh**, Sherlock.But, I found the plot way too \"staged,\" and the characters too stock and much less interesting than in prior books (I can't say if that would be true to a new reader), the humor thinner, and the violent penultimate scene too unreal (as in prior books). It dragged so much that I sort of \"sped read\" my way through. I won't be in such a hurry to read the next one. Maybe the entire book was supposed to be tongue in cheek??, but that could have been done in a much smaller manner (or manor).And an afterthought: One element of the plot is Flavia's serious attempt to catch or trap Father Christmas on the rooftop where he must obviously go to drop down the chimney. Seriously. And it's not until the end that this brilliant student of science figures out that maybe the Santa Claus scenario has some logical flaws?? Maybe I'm the dummy, assuming this book was aimed at those smarter than a 5th grader."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44435094-claire", "userReview": "Absolutely spiffing! 4.5/5 starsThis review was originally posted on my book blog.I listened to the audiobook version of I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, narrated by Sophie Aldred.I picked up this audiobook from the library because it was the only title in the mp3 range which appealed to me. I didn\u2019t have a clue that it\u2019s number 4 in a series, and I\u2019m very happy to report it made very little difference to my enjoyment of the story.I LOVED this. It took a while to get used to Flavia\u2019s incredibly idiosyncratic voice and turn of phrase, but once I did, it was the best thing about the book. It reminded me of how the Famous Five spoke to each other, but smarter! If I\u2019d started the series at book 1, I\u2019m sure I would have already been at home with her voice and not needed this \u201cadjustment time\u201d. That said, this book worked as a stand-alone, I fell in love with Flavia and by the end was incredibly sorry it was all over.The mystery element of the story was good, if nothing new (all the suspects trapped in a big house because of unexpected heavy snow\u2026 we\u2019ve never seen that before!). The setting was excellent and the set up interesting. The film crew and actors brought some old Hollywood glamour to the story. But the star of the show is Flavia, her love of chemistry and her rather \u201cinventive\u201d experiments.

I want to read these stories as fast as I can, and, yet, I want them to never end. I highly recommend this book and the others to anyone who needs a smile, a tug of the heart, a warm fuzzy feeling of comfort and joy. In this latest tale, Flavia's beloved Buckshaw, decaying ancestral home, has been rented out to a film company in order to help with the de Luce's always dwindling financial state. It happens to take place at Christmas, and before the requisite murder occurs, Flavia is using her skills in chemistry and deduction to lay a trap for Father Christmas. When a body is discovered with a knot of film around the neck, it is in a house full of Bishop's Lacey's residents who are snowbound after a charity performance at Buckshaw. Flavia turns to her usual cunning bag of tricks and wit to unmask a killer in the crowd.

At the half-way point, the residents Bishop's Lacey comes to Buckshaw for a show. Ah-ha, Flavia doesn't need to travel to Bishop's Lacey; Bishop's Lacey will come to her! This is when I finally became invested in the book, only to be a little disappointed when the quirky residents are under-utilized. I've wanted Flavia to have another chat with the town's little gossip maven, Maximillion Brock, ever since her debut novel.Many of the new and returning characters are also haphazardly sprinkled about. Two or three of movie crew seem to exist purely to lurk around and be shady suspects, and a returning character from The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag makes an appearance that serves absolutely no narrative purpose.Flavia does spend a bit of the novel pre-occupied with capturing Saint Nicholas. Her brilliant scheme to trap him--of course involving an ingenious chemical mixture--reminds us that despite her brilliant scientific and deduction skills, Flavia is still an eleven-year-old girl.There are some funny and tender moments, but this holiday Flavia is more of a delightful stocking stuffer than a filling Christmas feast."}, {"userName": "Emilie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332301-emilie", "userReview": "T\u00e4m\u00e4 oli tasoltaan yht\u00e4 hyv\u00e4 kuin edellisetkin kirjat.

In order to earn money to pay off the family's debts, Colonel du Luce has rented our the use of Buckshaw to a film company. The whole village is excited about the imminent arrival of the famous film star, Phyllis Wyvern. The vicar asks the actress if she would be willing to do a short scene in order to help raise money for roof repair, and she quickly agrees to perform a scene from Romeo and Juliet with her costar. Things quickly go from bad to worse when the villagers are snowed in, and then Phyllis Wyvern is found murdered by Flavia. Now in addition to preparing glue to catch Saint Nicholas and making fireworks to set off as her Christmas present to the village, Flavia has a murder to solve.This is definitely my favorite of the Flavia series so far. The mystery is well done as usual, but I found her Christmas plans to be quite funny and entertaining. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mysteries. Five stars."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2099671-michael", "userReview": "Review from  Badelynge.The de Luce family have suspended their usual Christmas preparations in order to try to generate some much needed cash, hiring out Buckshaw to a film company. Usually Christmas is the one time of the year that the warring sisters declare a temporary truce for the celebrations but that seems unlikely amongst the uproar of visiting film royalty. It's not long before things start going wrong and most of the population of Bishop's Lacy is camped out in the halls, pretty much snowed in and trapped with a killer at large amongst them. Much as Flavia de Luce loves a good murder to keep her 12 year old deductive skills finely honed, even she has to admit that juggling vital scientific experiments (proving the existence of Father Christmas) at the same time as digging into family history, while making sure the local police are suitably impressed with her cleverness and creating the firework display to end all firework displays, might be a little too much for even her array of skills.This one is possibly as good as the series debut. Flavia and co just dance off the pages which seem to evaporate under your fingers and into your brain. If you can get it into your reading schedule over the Christmas period then all much the better. Flavia is as fascinating and captivating as ever, straddling the line of cleverness and hopeless naivety and brought to life by Alan Bradley with lots of wit, cheekiness and flashes of surprising depth of feeling. Whether you buy into his somewhat Ealingesque image of 1950s rural England doesn't really matter - it's just too much fun to give a damn."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Audio performed by Jayne Entwhistle3***In this 4th installment of the Flavia DeLuce series we find Buckshaw overrun with a cinema crew just at Christmas. It\u2019s the perfect setting for the film and they\u2019ll pay handsomely (keeping the estate afloat for another year). Flavia, however, is much more concerned with whether Father Christmas is real. In an effort to settle the question once and for all, she concocts a chemical trap \u2013 her own sort of SuperGlue \u2013 which she spreads around the chimneys. Meantime, half the village has come to Buckshaw in a snowstorm for a benefit performance featuring the film\u2019s two stars. As the snow turns to a blizzard they are all trapped on the estate, without phone or a means to travel back to town. It\u2019s the perfect setting for a murder!Bradley is stretching the plot rather thin in this book. The murder doesn\u2019t happen until half-way through the book. As much as I love Flavia, I read the series for the mysteries and her efforts to solve them. While Flavia certainly helps to identify the killer, she spends much more time on her elaborate schemes for Christmas (she\u2019s made fireworks as well at the trap for Santa). One thing I definitely did appreciate was the somewhat improved behavior of her sisters; they were far less cruel to her in this book than in previous installments. I also liked the additional information about Dogger, Colonel DeLuce and Flavia\u2019s deceased mother. As usual, Jayne Entwhistle is marvelous voicing Flavia and the other characters on the audio version.

(I say \u201cenjoyed\u201d since this is the fourth and latest book in the series. I hope there are more.)Flavia de Luce is an 11 year old, precocious, independent, and intelligent young girl and an amateur detective. I wouldn\u2019t want to have her as a daughter; she\u2019d be too much for me to handle. As a character in book, however; she is a delight. She is a bane in the side of the local inspector, since she can\u2019t seem to control her impulses and her curiosity enough to not look further into the \u201cmurder\u201d. She is driven more from a scientific perspective, rather than a competitive urge to show up the police. She is a bit overconfident in her abilities, reckless and presumptive; but her intent is truly to help and learn, even if it doesn\u2019t work out or interpreted in that way.The family dynamics are also becoming more interesting to me. Flavia\u2019s mother died shortly after she was born \u2013 she has not real memories of her mother. She longs for a more intimate relationship with her father; but the actual real and communicative connections with her father are few and far between. They are intimate and precious however; when they do occur. Her sisters are horrid and seemingly abusive to her in the first three books. In this book, you learn that at least one of the sisters truly loves her. It\u2019s not clear, however, why she has been a \u201cbitch\u201d to her in the past. I look forward to further books and development in this series."}, {"userName": "J.

Perhaps it was hastily written to meet the Christmastime deadline? It was a quick read, as were the others, but I did not find myself as amused or deliciously satisfied as I had been with its predecessors. Dogger (my favorite) is still the most mysterious and complex character in the series, and I am glad to get a better glimpse into his psyche. However, I would like to see more significant maturation in the characters' relationships. The development has become stagnant and could use some deeper exploration in order to keep things interesting. Isn't it, in fact, the characters who keep us invested in the story? So far, all the family interactions have been mere snippets meant to tease the reader with the promise of progression but are abruptly cut short by, in the case of this novel, a less than engaging plot. I found myself disinterested in the murder and did not even try to figure out the who the murderer was, as one usually does while reading a mystery. Rather, I kept reading merely to see the outcome and because I was sure, due to my experience with previous writings, that there would surely be some sort of payoff. I was wrong. I still look forward to the next Flavia de Luce novel, but if the magic does not return, I fear, neither shall I."}, {"userName": "Asghar Abbas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37421322-asghar-abbas", "userReview": "Delightful as alwaysnever change Flavia, never change Even if faux Britishness is too much at times.Following, not Nolan's movie, is the direct result of an idea impelled while reading this wonderful book : https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog..."}, {"userName": "Tiffy_Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3873781-tiffy-reads", "userReview": "Loved this one as much as I did the previous ones.

Only Flavia de Luce would think of flooding an entire portrait gallery to create an indoor ice skating rink. The amateur chemist and detective is back for a holiday adventure. Her overly-logical brain has worked out a plot to \u201ccatch\u201d Santa with a sticky chemical solution applied to the roof. She\u2019s so clever it\u2019s easy to forget that she\u2019s still a little girl, wondering if Santa exists. As the de Luce family\u2019s finances dwindle, Flavia\u2019s father decides to rent out their home, Buckshaw, to a movie studio as a filming location. An entire crew, including the director and aging movie stars arrive in the small English town and set things buzzing. Instead of having Flavia flit about the town of Bishop\u2019s Lacey, as she has in the other novels, the entire town heads to Buckshaw. The actors agree to perform a scene from Romeo & Juliet to raise money for the local parish and the villagers brave the snow and head to Flavia\u2019s home for the show. A blizzard ensures that they won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon and the novel takes on the feel of an Agatha Christie novel. When an unexpected murder occurs, all of the suspects are confined to one location. Throw in a few crabby sisters, some fireworks and an on-going battle of the wits with local Inspector Hewitt and it\u2019s the perfect holiday treat. I would say the pacing is very similar to the first three books. If you loved those, like I have, you\u2019ll probably love this one as well. Many feel unsatisfied with the books thus far and I would say that this one isn\u2019t a deviation from the previous ones. There are bits and pieces revealed about the main characters, but nothing huge. I would think that most of us know if we like a series or not by the fourth book, so go with your instincts. Dogger has always been one of my favorite characters in the series. Even if he\u2019s not in the spotlight, he\u2019s always standing quietly in the background, loyally waiting to provide whatever is needed. This book sheds more light on why he is the way he is and I was so glad to get to know him a bit better. The restricted setting really worked for me. I loved having all the characters in one place. I think it helped move things along quickly. The murder mystery is always a background for the bigger story of the de Luce family itself and setting the entire book in their home helped hone that focus. It boils down to this, if you love Flavia and the whole crazy de Luce household, this is a must for the holiday season. \u201cImpertinent children ought to be given six coats of shellac and set up in public places as a warning to others.\u201d \u201cThere are those of us who create because all around us, things visible and invisible are crumbling.\u201d"}, {"userName": "An Odd1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863716-an-odd1", "userReview": "\"I am half-sick of shadows\" (Flavia 4) by Alan Bradley is from Tennyson's \"Lady of Shalott\", the red cover and Santa hat, is Flavia de Luce, precocious 11, using her superb chemist skill to test the presence of Father Xmas with birdlime glue on the chimney pot, and celebrate the night with extra-dose gunpowder firecrackers off the roof. For much needed funds, her widowed father Haviland rents their magnificent manor Buckshaw to famous 1950s British movie director Val Lampman. He brings star Phyllis Wyvern (spoiler: his mother Phyllida Lampman), her downtrodden assistant Bun Keats, his assistant Marion Trodd (resembles former star Norma Durance), overshadowed co-star striking Desmond Duncan, lurking chauffeur Anthony and other support staff such as electrician Gil Crawford, trained as a commando proficient in garotting (p223 Flavia's elegantly penned suspect list). Even Aunt Felicity knew Phyllis as spies when first laboratory owner Uncle Tar helped Winston Churchill. Someone strangles Phyllis with cinema reel strip tied in two bows, and dresses her in the booted peasant costume for the Russian tragedy depicted therein. Disappointingly, the answer lies in back issues of tabloids we are not privy to, the villains inexplicably gang up on our heroine at midnight on the roof, and elder sisters bookworm Ophelia \"Feely\" and adored-by-boys Daphne \"Daffy\" (or is it vice versa?) are despicably mean. Unlike the previous book where Flavia trampled all over, mucking up the crime scenes, here Inspector Hewitt goes first, and gets close by alternate research - clever author. Her clumsiness with relationships, such as him and his lovely wife Antigone reminds us how young is Flavia. By now, could our lonely heroine not trust the patient forgiving policeman a little? Better series show growth, multiple sides to one human's behavior.Everyone is intriguingly eccentric. Faithful manservant and medical savant Dogger was raised in India, decorating a mango tree for Christmas. He shares Flavia's passion for chemical trivia, and demonstrates doctoring abilities; she responds instantly, perfectly, (like adult?) when his wartime torture memories resurge. She wants to believe in Santa, thinks \"affair\" means best friends, and is sheltered from the birth process. Does Nialla Gilfoyle, from Porson puppeteers book 2 return to ... demonstrate Flavia's ignorance?
