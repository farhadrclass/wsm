I was not disappointed. It is amazing that this book was written in 1976 and feels just as fresh and timely in 2016. Dana, a young African American woman who has just started a career as a writer in California, is suddenly and inexplicably yanked back in time to Maryland in 1815, where she must save a white boy named Rufus from drowning.This becomes only the first of many time traveling episodes for Dana. She quickly realizes that Rufus is one of her own ancestors, mentioned in the family Bible. Somehow, they are connected across time because they are kindred. To assure her own future, Dana must keep Rufus alive until he has children who will some day be Dana\u2019s family line. Unfortunately, Rufus gets in a lot of trouble.Only moments pass in the modern world each time Dana is called away, but months or even years pass in the world of 1815. Dana watches Rufus grow from a little boy into an adult slave owner who inherits his father\u2019s plantation. She tries her best to influence Rufus\u2019 development, but can she overcome the poisonous institution of slavery that infects everyone it touches?The novel is a potent metaphor for the modern African American experience and the American experience in general. We may be lulled into the feeling that we have advanced, that we have made progress as a society. But at any moment, we may be yanked back into the past and reminded of where we came from. That heritage of slavery, exploitation and racism is an integral part of our national identity, and it is never far below the surface. It can overcome us in an instant. Like Dana, we must be constantly on guard, well-equipped and ready to be yanked out of our supposedly modern and enlightened existence to deal with the ugliest parts of our nature. We are kindred with the Americans of 1815, whether we like it or not."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "\u201cThe ease. Us, the children\u2026 I never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.\u201d\nButler is an author that constantly pops up on \"Best sci-fi\" and \"Must-Read African American authors\" lists and I can finally see why. This book may be my first by her, but it won't be my last. Kindred is a fascinating, horrific journey through a dark time in American history, combining eye-opening historical research with time travel.I suppose some modern readers will want to compare this story to Outlander and there are some similarities - a woman trying to survive in the past, lots of blood-soaked history and horror, the harsh realities of being who you are in that time - but not only did this book come first, but it is far more distressing, more tied in with historical truth, and way more about surviving than it is about lusty scenes with a kilted hot dude.It's a really important \"what if\" book about race. What if a modern black woman suddenly found herself transported 150+ years into the past, right into the centre of the antebellum South? The book doesn't shy away from portraying the realities of that (nothing is sugar-coated, be prepared for some upsetting scenes). But it's also more than a gruesome look at historical racism and violence. There are many complex and interesting characters - both slaves and slave owners. Butler has written a book that goes deeper than surface level, exploring how people come to accept slavery as the norm and to justify poor treatment of slaves. Dana is horrified how easy it is. And so was I.Kindred is so good because, not only is it well-written and emotionally effective, but it also manages to be several different important things: complex historical-fiction, intriguing science-fiction, and a memoir of slavery. For a novel so obviously fictional, it feels very real and true. Maybe because, sadly, most of it is. I know this is one book that will stay with me for a long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Octavia Butler is an amazing writer. If you enjoy reading SF/F, or even an interest in speculative fiction, you would like her work.Kindred, first published in 1979, would become her most best-selling novel.This is also a painful book to read because of its graphic depiction of slavery and Butler wastes no time in demonizing what was demonic. Describing the slave life from the perspective of a time-travelling modern woman, Butler\u2019s strong narrative prose is in high form for a low burden \u2013 to illustrate to contemporary readers the horrors of slavery and in this context to draw a comparison with life of our time, making the transition to the early 1800s all the more stark and evil in contrast.Kindred is also an allegory for our modern times, still burdened by the wounds of slavery and a racial consciousness in our society that has scars that won\u2019t heal. Butler shows us, though, that we as a nation and a people are bound, as kindred, between races and with a shared history.Back in the 90s I was working in Washington DC and I had the opportunity to meet a group of folks from Africa. Multi-lingual (with French predominant among the diplomats) I found the people I met worldly, intelligent, generous and interesting to talk to \u2013 and they were singularly not American. I think this was the first time I had met a large group of people from another continent and the idea struck me how much closer I was to my black neighbors than I was to these people I had just met. Butler adeptly reveals in Kindred, in multiple ways, the many degrees of our shared humanity. But more narrowly, Butler is pointing out our kinship as Americans, dates like 1976 and July 4th must be intentional, how the shared history of slavery \u2013 between black Americans and white Americans \u2013 has bound us together.Butler also, once again, has created a strong female protagonist in Dana whose endurance and courage are remarkable, made more evident by the fact that she has a unique viewpoint. Dana, in some respects, becomes a symbol of a present-day African-American woman, both made stronger from her heritage, but also still bearing the wounds of past wrongs.Kindred also displays Butler\u2019s amazing talents in storytelling, using dramatic irony expertly. A reader may notice a subtle, though strangely twisted reference to a scene in Lee\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird.Introspective and somber, with many questions that remain unanswered, Kindred is a powerful work told by an artist of genius ability."}, {"userName": "M\u2014", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1353617-m", "userReview": "On October 5, 2004, Octavia E. Butler visited my graduate university to give a lecture and book signing. I was really impressed by her. She actually spent several hours at the university, giving a public interview with one of the professors, then a short lecture to a large auditorium, then a book signing. I even skipped class in order to attend. The interview was really fascinating, where Butler answered questions about how she worked to write Kindred and how she felt about the characters and how the result all turned out. The professor kind of threw Butler for a loop once, when she pulled an interpretation of the book out of left field, and Butler blinked, and slowly said she didn't write with that interpretation at all in mind, but that she was of the opinion that any interpretation the reader reaches is a valid one. I thought she handled the question particularly well. In the lecture, Butler talked mostly about how she writes, her writing style, her relationship with her fans, and the book she was currently writing, Fledgling. The signing afterwards was very informal, but I didn\u2019t try to stay and chat. Butler had lots of professors and awestruck students who were all trying to catch her attention. I got my book signed, said a polite thank you, and left happy. Fledgling turned out to be the last book Butler wrote. She died unexpectedly in early 2006. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the chance to meet her. The book: Was good. A time-traveling story dealing with love, gender, race, racism, and responsibility. It was beautifully and rather painfully done. I never would have found it if it hadn\u2019t been for the author visit, and I\u2019m rather sad about that."}, {"userName": "Carol.

So buying a copy of Kindred without knowing anything about it was a no-brainer. I even deliberately avoided looking at the book's synopsis before hand, I just wanted to get to know the book as I read on. I hoped for a pleasant surprise, which I did get. This is only the second Octavia Butler book I have read and I already worship her.Kindred is about Dana, an African American woman who finds herself time travelling involuntarily to Maryland in the early nineteenth century. It is not explained how or why this happen to her, the mechanic of it is entirely irrelevant to the story. The novel is about her experience of slavery in the past. Her fate becomes intertwined with Rufus, a white ancestor who is the only son of a plantation owner and who somehow triggers her time traveling trips every time he is in mortal danger, a situation that arises more frequently to him than to most people. While there she experiences the woes of slavery first hand, including whipping, beating, degradation and humiliation.This is a harrowing and emotional read, I almost cry manly tears during some of the chapters. I never pondered what it may have been like to be a slave, it is not exactly a contingency which is at all likely to ever arise. However, Ms Butler - genius that she was - made me feel it through the eyes of her protagonist. The pains and humiliation of slavery resonates with me even though there ought to be nothing to resonate. I kind of winced every time a stroke of a whip is described. This is not a comfortable read but highly engrossing and thought provoking. The book is very much character-centric, the relationship between Dana and Rufus is very complex and fascinating. Dana's husband Kevin who also become embroiled in time traveling and is marooned in the nineteenth century for years without his wife adds to her complications, his reaction to returning to the present time (1976) is entirely believable and again resonates strongly.The book reminds me a little of Connie Willis's excellent Doomsday Book, which is about time travelling to the fourteenth century and also a harrowing (yet wonderful) read, though the emphasis of that book is on poverty, hardship and diseases rather than slavery. The involuntary time traveling aspect of the book reminds me of Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife, though Kindred predates it, and Kindred is certainly not a romantic book. Octavia Butler was not one of those literary writers who try to avoid the science fiction label like the plague even while using sf tropes in their works, she has always loved sf and gladly embraced the genre (see photo below).\nThat said, Kindred is also not science fiction. The author described it as a \"grim fantasy\" and deliberately did not put any science in it, it is described by some literary critics as a \"neo-slave narrative\". I did consider why the book was written as a fantasy (or almost sf) instead of historical fiction, then I realised that it was probably done so the modern reader can experience the nineteenth century Maryland through the protagonist's contemporary eyes, this makes the book very visceral.While the book was written to make the reader ponder some serious issues such as man's inhumanity to man, inequality and courage in an environment where you are made to feel worthless, at no point did I feel like being lectured to. The author knows the importance of communicating through the story, and I was completely swept away by it. Whatever I read next will likely suffer from being compared to this book. This goes in my all-time greats list.Notes:\u2022 From Tor.com: Octavia Butler Will Change the Way You Look at Genre Fiction.\u2022 HERE is another reason to love Octavia Butler.\u2022 Interesting background info from The Portalist:Kindred was inspired by the time a very young Butler spent with her mother at work. Butler told In Motion Magazine in 2004 that a lot of the motivation behind her novel Kindred \"came when I was in preschool, when my mother used to take me to work with her.\" Kindred follows Dana, a writer who travels back in time to the antebellum South and meets her ancestors, a white plantation owner and a Black slave. The novel argues for the courageousness of people existing under unimaginable circumstances, as Dana makes compromises in order to survive slavery. Butler's own mother was a housemaid, and many of Butler's earliest memories were of the degradations her mother endured at work. She told In Motion that witnessing the racism her mother put up with in order to bring Butler a better life helped inspire much of Kindred's message: \"I got to see her not hearing insults and going in back doors, and even though I was a little kid, I realized it was humiliating. I knew something was wrong, it was unpleasant, it was bad. I remember saying to her a little later, at seven or eight, \"I'll never do what you do, what you do is terrible.\" And she just got this sad look on her face and didn't say anything. I think it was the look and the memory of the indignities she endured. I just remembered that and wanted to convey that people who underwent all this were not cowards, were not people who were just too pathetic to protect themselves, but were heroes because they were using what they had to help their kids get a little further.\"\n Excellent Kindred Infographic (with spoilers) click on image to see full size."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "\u201cI never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.\u201d I wanted to love this book. I knew the slave narrative might be harrowing (though it\u2019s not overly graphic), but it has an average GR rating over four stars, features time-travel dilemmas, has a strong, intelligent, kind, and practical female protagonist, and gives thought-provoking insights into the complexity of US race relations in the 1800s and, to a lesser extent, the 1970s. It is a good and powerful, exciting and educational book. But something didn\u2019t quite connect for me. I hoped that composing my thoughts would make me see it in a more favourable light - and it has. Perhaps I just read it too fast to digest it properly.Kindred One word, seven letters, but several interpretations, all with emotional impact. * The most common and literal meaning relates to ties of blood: our immediate family. The kindred we can\u2019t choose, even if we hate or despise them.* But blood is too narrow to include one\u2019s partner, or any adopted children, honorary uncles and aunts, or step parents. And what about children born to slave women who could never claim their father/owner\u2019s family as kindred, even if they wanted to?* So it widens to \u201ckindred spirits\u201d - our closest friends and allies, with whom we share attitudes, experiences, and interests. Regardless of biological parentage, a slave child\u2019s kindred can only be fellow slaves.* Ultimately, Butler\u2019s message is that black and white (and brown and pink and yellow), male and female (and everything else), we are all kindred. One race: the human race. Race as a social construct. (See Live Science and Bill Nye.)This is not a Christian book, and I am not a Christian person, but I was reminded of the message of Jesus\u2019 parable of The Good Samaritan. The man who asked \u201cWho is my neighbour?\u201d was shown that the answer was everyone in need. That\u2019s a tough message to apply, but given the turmoil in the word right now, it is as important as it ever was. Plot - No SpoilersThe book is easy to summarise in a way that gives no more spoilers than the first three pages and back cover. Dana is a 26-year old middle class African-American living in 1976 LA with her white husband, Kevin. Somehow, she comes unstuck in time (like Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five and Henry in The Time Traveller\u2019s Wife) and suddenly finds herself on a plantation in Maryland in 1815. This happens several times, over twenty years of 19th century time, with the usual issues and dilemmas of time travel, but that is just the mechanism for depicting the horrors of slavery, and the complex power and sexual relationships that result, as well as exploring the source of hatred (nature versus nurture), acquiescence, revenge, and the types and possibility of redemption and freedom. Kindred is more historical and political adventure than sci-fi. It\u2019s fast-paced and, despite the subject, quite an easy read. And the ending is satisfying, but not ludicrously sentimental or tidy.Owning and Being OwnedIn 1976, Dana is proud of her independence, having repeatedly fought to do what she wanted, rather than settle for what was expected. In the 19th century, she has to consider the terrifying risks and consequences of striving for even a tiny bit of independence. The power-play between master and slave can acquire aspects of Stockholm Syndrome.Although the story is told by Dana and she is the central character, at least as important is Rufus Weyland, son of the plantation owner. The way his attitude and behaviour change as he grows up is echoed in the more recent The Help, though it is more complex here. As a small child, he\u2019s allowed to have slave children as friends, even as his father buys and sells their families, beats and sleeps with them. Gradually, Rufus develops an unrequited \u201cdestructive single-minded love\u201d for two women that I never fully understood. With one woman, it\u2019s sexual, so he repeatedly rapes her. \u201cThere was no shame in raping a black woman, but there could be shame in loving one.\u201dOf course, Rufus doesn\u2019t think of it as rape because she doesn\u2019t try to stop him and, more importantly, he owns her. So the woman endures, but \u201cShe forgave him nothing, forgot nothing.\u201dDana sees how manipulative Rufus is, she experiences it herself. She sees the bad in him and occasionally slivers of good. She tries to enlighten him, but is remarkably forgiving when he follows in his father\u2019s footsteps. More so than I could be, which is perhaps another reason why it didn\u2019t quite ring true for me. He\u2019s of his Time. Does that make it OK?\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a monster at all. Just an ordinary man who sometimes did the monstrous things his society said were legal and proper.\u201dA common debate on GR and in the wider world (yes, there is one, I\u2019m led to believe), is to what extent we judge those in the past by the standards of our time. * Should we cast aside books by people who we now know had hateful views and who maybe did hateful deeds? * Should books about the past be sanitised and redacted to make them acceptable to modern sensibilities?Dana is confronted by this dilemma in a more direct and personal way. She wants to teach Rufus to think of and treat his slaves kindly, but as his views become darker and more complicated, her opinion of him is ever more conflicted - exacerbated by the power he has over her. * How much of what happens can be blamed on the surrounding cultural norms? * Does a slave owner who beats relatively rarely and gently deserve leniency?Identity: Colour, Gender, Social Rank, AncestryWho is Dana, and how free is she? In both periods she can be seen as, and is sometimes called, \u201ca white nigger\u201d. In 1815, she is assumed to be a slave just because of her colour, all the more inferior because she's female. But the fact she talks white and educated causes confusion, resentment, and conflict. And she comes to realise that even in 1976, she is not entirely free of her heritage, despite her relative detachment from it (though she has read at least some of her ten books about black history even before she has a specific need to do so).There are similar questions for many other characters, especially slaves who consider running away in the hope of freedom (or death), those who stay because they want to keep their children, and those who trade privilege and suffering (such as sleeping with a boss they hate to have slightly gentler conditions).I could write a whole review about her husband, Kevin: how he - and their marriage - is changed by her experiences, and his. But I won't this time; it's interesting and important, but secondary. The other huge aspect is ancestry, and how that defines one's identity, both in terms of racial identity, but also in terms of character. What if you are appalled by who and what your forebears do are and do? (An issue those who research their family trees often have to face.)Words and LanguageThis is a book you read for the ideas and story, rather than the language. But Butler makes her words work in a book that\u2019s barely 300 pages: a single word title, and short, elemental chapter titles: The River, The Fire, The Fall, The Fight, The Storm, The Rope. Of course, \u201cthe N word\u201d is used frequently. Given the setting, it would be bizarre if it were not.Human PantoneThe image at the top is from this short blog post about race:http://www.laurassoapbox.net/2012/08/...But it is actually part of Ang\u00e9lica Daas\u2019 \u201cHuman Pantone\u201d art project, which I saw on posters in Bilbao earlier this year:http://brazigzag.com/culture/angelica..."}, {"userName": "Adina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina", "userReview": "DNF at 50% (with some skipping) What came first, the egg or the chicken? What came first, the badly written book or the reading slump? Hard questions to answer but one thing is certain. It definitely did not help forcing me to reach 50% of this book. I only did it because of my rating rule and because I wanted to bitch about it. So here it is again the time for an unpopular opinion. I though this book to be TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t even know with what to start. I understand it is written by a woman of color in a time when it was an extraordinary accomplishment. I get and admire that. I also get that she had an agenda to prove how easily one can accept slavery, even in our modern world. However, the above is not a relevant excuse for bad writing, cartoonish characters, poorly conceived plot and ridiculous dialogue. Also, the use of time travel had nothing to do with SF, there was no explanation of the phenomenon, and it was only a lazy gimmick to prove her point. Yes, others used it as well but better, in my opinion. Let\u2019s start with the plot. We are in 1976 America, a young black woman is married with a white man and she suddenly starts to repeatedly go back in time in the antebellum South so she can save a child (and later young man) who proves to be her ancestor. It quickly becomes obvious that she has to save him every time he is in trouble, otherwise she would not exist in the present time. So far so good, the premise sounds interesting. Too bad the execution was poor. Firstly, the two pair accepted way to easy the time travelling part. The same happened with the people in the past. You tell me that a person in the 19th century would not freak out and try to murder any source of such an abomination? The dialogues between the husband and wife after the first two times she comes back are laughable. At first he doesn\u2019t believe her although she disappeared and then he doesn\u2019t understand why she is scared. Really? I would lose control of myself it that happened, screaming my ass into a mental hospital. Later, when they both land in the past, I could not believe how easily they get used to the roles they had to play there, her as a slave and him as the white master. I totally understand that she had to lay low in order to survive but that doesn\u2019t mean she had to be acceptant in her mind or find excuses for that little piece of shit, Rufus. And to convinced Alice that is ok to be raped so you can survive\u2026. Nope.I disliked all the characters, especially Dana and her detachment; the author did not make me feel anything except annoyance.

As much as we humans like hiding behind false truths, we're merely trying to go easy on ourselves and to maintain our breakable feeling of control. We don't control shit. From the moment I read Holocaust accounts, I've met a lot of people assuring me that these days wouldn't ever happen again because people would fight harder and longer. Ha. This fallacious argument first forgets that it already happened again, and secondly it dismisses way too quickly how readily people accept awful behaviors if they become the norm. We can hate ourselves for that, but I'm not sure what we're trying to achieve when we forget that. There will always be people who fight, but they'll often be fewer than those who silently accept or participates in the dehumanization. Now how can we change that is the real question.\n\u201cThe ease. Us, the children... I never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.\u201d\nThis is what makes \nKindred\n both so interesting and horrifying : Dana, a 25 years old black woman, is transported from 1976 to 1815 whenever her ancestor - Rufus - needs her to stay alive, straight into the plantation his father runs. What follows is an unflinching and very important look at what slavery really was and how its mechanisms worked, without, for once (thank you thank you), an ounce of romanticization, but rather a complex but unforgiving portrayal of what many books would sell out as a Good Master (ugh). This is what the world needs. I often mention my students in my reviews, but honestly, it's because I often feel that we ask more of children than we do of fucking adults. At ten, they're able to understand that their intend doesn't mean anything if they hurt someone : they still have to be held accountable. The world needs to hear that as white people, we might not intend to comfort and sustain white supremacy, yet every time we buy into some romanticized version of slavery, we do. A slaver who falls in love with one of his slaves is still very much a monster in my book. So, what? The guy has feelings? SO WHAT? He'll still buy and sell people as if they were furniture. He'll still make them work, hurt them, for his sole gain. What Kindred shows the reader is that no matter how easily we could feel sorry for said slaver - as Dana sometimes does - it doesn't change a thing. It should never change a thing.\n\u201cRufus had caused her trouble, and now he had been rewarded for it. It made no sense. No matter how kindly he treated her now that he had destroyed her, it made no sense.\u201d \nServed with a compelling and frightening plot, Kindred won't let you look away and will capture your all being until the very last page - if that's not the mark of great books, what is? This novel is absolutely terrifying and it doesn't need any zombies to be : people are the monsters. White people are, and the fact that it actually happened in history makes it even more chilling. More, if we look at History as a whole, slavery has stopped in the US such a short time ago. And if Kindred reminds us of something that we should have never forgotten, it's how easily we come to adapt to - or make the best of, how horrible that can sound - such an horrendous system. In the end, we humans want to live. This ongoing thirst might make us able to do great things, but it also makes it harder for us to fight.\n\u201cRepressive societies always seemed to understand the danger of \u201cwrong\u201d ideas.\u201d\nI wish this novel would be more famous worldwide, because if it's apparently studied in High-school in the US, I had never heard of it before last year - as I found, it was translated into French in the 2000s but by such an unknown publisher, it's a shame. When are we starting to translate - and promote - these important books rather than the last NA by Colleen Hoover? Really? As the first science-fiction novel published by a black woman, and as a fucking amazing book that will linger in my mind for so long, because I'm neither able to forget these complex and fascinating characters nor the message they carry, I'd say the world should wake the fuck up and read this book.

This novel is a beautifully elegant analysis of a not-so-beautiful period in American history. Using a prominent element of Science Fiction, Butler confronts the poisonous attitudes & double standards that are propagated by racism, but from a modern perspective. I enjoyed how this book didn't shy away from being brutally honest. It doesn't seek to obscure the cruelty of the time period. It doesn't ask for the approval of its readers. It forces you to examine. We all like to think that we wouldn't have participated in that atrocious behavior that has stained our history. It's easy for us to imagine ourselves as a hero, to pretend we would have loudly & proudly condemned the enslavement of human beings. But would we have?Dana's excursions may suggest otherwise. At times she even finds herself adjusting her actions to mold to the past & providing forgiveness where she never would've expected to. To discuss history is to remember it. To remember it is to prevent it from repeating itself. Keeping the conversation alive is vital.I would recommend this book to everyone. I only docked half a star because I spotted one or two trivial inconsistencies. Otherwise, a marvelous classic and one I'm sorry I waited this long to pick up.This review and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "BkC10) KINDRED by Octavia E. Butler: Excellent!!I still agree with myself. And what better review for Valentine's Day than this time-travel novel in which a modern-day African-American woman is summoned by her slave-owning ancestor to rescue him at critical moments, and then must pimp her slave ancestress to the slave owner to ensure that she is born?Rating: 4.75* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The first science fiction written by a black woman, Kindred has become a cornerstone of black American literature. This combination of slave memoir, fantasy, and historical fiction is a novel of rich literary complexity. Having just celebrated her 26th birthday in 1976 California, Dana, an African-American woman, is suddenly and inexplicably wrenched through time into antebellum Maryland. After saving a drowning white boy there, she finds herself staring into the barrel of a shotgun and is transported back to the present just in time to save her life. During numerous such time-defying episodes with the same young man, she realizes the challenge she\u2019s been given: to protect this young slaveholder until he can father her own great-grandmother. My Review: Oh my heck. Modern African American, circa 1976, makes her way in the slave society of 1815, and all that that entails. It's not an easy, fluffy read, but it's amazing how Butler pulls no punches and still manages to keep the easy, smug path of good = noble, bad = horrible, from making her characters into masks capable of expressing only one emotion. I liked reading the book because it pulls no punches, and it left me breathless at frequent intervals with its complete willingness to engage all, each, every, facet of human love. Octavia Butler, gone too soon, wrote this meditation on survival when she was abour thirty. What a feat that is. So young, and so sharply critical of denial and misdirection...so ready to face up to the underlying motivations and the foundational lies of each and every character's identity...what she must have been like as a friend! Her insights would be Buddha-like, if they were anything like the honest and unsparing insights she used in creating this book.Beautiful, hard, fiery.

It\u2019s a page-turning, disturbing, provocative, complex, incredibly smart novel. Technically it\u2019s science fiction, since it involves time travel, but it doesn\u2019t follow a lot of other SF conventions. Dana, an African-American woman living in late 70s LA, is suddenly taken back to Antebellum Maryland, where she saves a young white boy from drowning. Although she is inexplicably whisked home, she is brought back to the past again shortly, where she realizes her task is to save the life of this white man who turns out to be her ancestor, over and over and over.

This year I\u2019m trying to get over my hesitation and this was one of my biggest overlooked books. Even though it\u2019s a few decades old, Kindred really holds up. Every time I thought it might be getting a little problematic, it was just me not seeing that Butler was setting me up to address the very issue that was making me uncomfortable. She stares harsh truths and prejudices right in the face and she also creates a story you cannot stop reading.\u2013Jessica Woodburyfrom The Best Books We Read In July 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/08/01/riot-r..."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "I wish we could read more authors like Octavia Butler, bell hooks, and Celeste Ng in our English classes instead of white men like Ernest Hemingway. I loved Kindred because it uses the science-fiction/fantasy genre to expose the cruelties and horrors of slavery and racism in an innovative way. Similar to what author Viet Thanh Nguyen writes in his book \nNothing Ever Dies\n, the United States's education system often informs us of issues like war and slavery through a sanitized, depoliticized lens. Though we \"learn\" about these events, we do not recognize the cruelty and evil our country's past generations committed - and how we are also complicit if we do not act for justice today. Octavia Butler's Kindred tells a gripping tale and reminds us of how we must not let the stories of our past happen again.Kindred follows 26-year-old Dana, a black woman who lives in California and gets transported to the antebellum South. There, she meets Rufus, the white son of a plantation owner who will go on to sire the daughter who becomes Dana's ancestor. Dana is teleported back in time over and over again to protect Rufus from death, but each time she travels to the past, she encounters increasing amounts of danger and abuse that put her own life at risk for extinction.Butler creates a compelling cast of characters in Kindred. Dana, Kevin, Rufus, Alice, etc. all have complex motivations and their relationships with one another feel replete with nuanced power dynamics, as well as love and hate and fear. In addition to imbuing Kindred with a fast-moving and surprising plot, Butler succeeds at showing and not telling the atrocities of slavery through Dana's travels backward and forward in time, in particular her forced journey to acclimate to plantation life in the nineteenth century. Through detailing the pain Dana suffers and the pain she sees her fellow enslaved individuals suffer at the hands of white folk, Butler encourages us to consider the challenges of surviving in an unjust world, just like the one we live in now. Why is it that our ancestors, as well as a lot of us today, are so willing to look away from the evils of racism? How do we stay true to our values in a society that so often pits minorities against each other, gives power to those who disempowers others, etc.? Kindred makes us think about these questions without offering simple answers, providing proof of its thoughtfulness and strength as a novel.Overall, a book I would recommend to anyone and everyone. I honestly feel ashamed at my younger self for not reading authors like Butler sooner and for buying into problematic portrayals of slavery, like Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind. I am doing my best to make up for it now by reading more books about social justice, by donating to the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center and other organizations fighting the good fight, and by having conversations about these topics, volunteering, etc. As a companion to Kindred, I would recommend reading \nThe New Jim Crow\n by Michelle Alexander and giving to groups that fight mass incarceration, as that injustice serves in many ways as the slavery of our time. Thank you to Ms. Butler for creating art that allows us to see injustice and to fight it."}, {"userName": "Taryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1334938-taryn", "userReview": "Without any warning, Dana Franklin is thrust back through time and space. It's 1976 and she's settling into her new California apartment when she starts to feel dizzy. Her modern surroundings fade away and suddenly she's in antebellum Maryland. She seems to be inextricably linked with Rufus Weylin, the young son of a plantation owner. Dana is pulled to Rufus anytime his life is in danger, which happens with surprising frequency. The era is dangerous for Dana--she's black and has no enforceable rights. It turns out that she and Rufus both need each other to survive, but they are also capable of destroying each other.\nSlavery was a long slow process of dulling.\nKindred is a quick read because the language is plain and it's dialogue-heavy, but there's so much to unpack. I was surprised that the logistics of Dana's time traveling were never addressed, but the time traveling is just a framework to explore the themes. Octavia Butler describes it as a \"grim fantasy\" and there's no science. Dana's story begins in 1976, two hundred years after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. It's such a whirlwind! Because of the mechanics of Dana's time traveling, each chapter begins and ends with a life-threatening situation. The chapters have titles like The Fire, The Fall, etc. that give hints of what's to come and add to the intensity. Rufus is a few years older every time Dana returns to the plantation, so we get to watch him and the other characters as they grow up and their roles on the plantation evolve. Dana is always marked by her experience when she's transported back to California, sometimes permanently. When we first meet Dana, she is laying in a modern hospital bed after her left arm has been amputated.\n\u201cThe ease seemed so frightening,\u201d I said. \u201cNow I see why.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThe ease. Us, the children \u2026 I never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.\u201d\nDana was intellectually aware of the horrors of slavery, but her education doesn't prepare her for the brutality she actually experiences. She sees how inadequate Hollywood is at portraying the real thing. Dana is shocked at the ease with which people settle into their institutionally-defined roles, herself included. She's especially shaken when she sees the children playing slave-trading games. Dana notices that despite the disdain with which we view slavery now, wide-scale, government-sanctioned oppression has been allowed to occur repeatedly in the modern era. She specifically mentions Nazi Germany and apartheid in South Africa.\n\u201cBetter to stay alive,\" I said. \"At least while there's a chance to get free.\" I thought of the sleeping pills in my bag and wondered just how great a hypocrite I was. It was so easy to advise other people to live with their pain.\nLike many slave-owners, the Weylins use family attachments to keep the slaves in line. Dana's hands are similarly tied by family; her entire ancestral lineage depends on Rufus. Dana has to betray her modern values in order to ensure her eventual birth. In an era with only bad and worse choices, she begins to empathize more with the slaves on the plantation. With hindsight, it's easy to create caricatures of those in the past and forget that they are complex human beings with nuanced relationships. Dana sees firsthand how privileged it is to judge someone's actions from a safe distance and how sometimes what seems like the best course of action can have terrible ramifications. But even Dana falls into the trap of feeling superior to others: \"I looked down on her myself for a while. Moral superiority. Here was someone even less courageous than I was. That comforted me somehow.\" \nHis father wasn\u2019t the monster he could have been with the power he held over his slaves. He wasn\u2019t a monster at all. Just an ordinary man who sometimes did the monstrous things his society said were legal and proper.\nIn Han Kang's Human Acts, there's a section about how everyone has the potential for good and evil and a character wonders how humans can be directed towards the more humane path. Kindred explores how institutions drive behaviors and make it hard to change anything. Sometimes there were glimpses of potential goodness in the Weylin men, but the brutality always wins out. Dana tries to exert a progressive influence on Rufus, but it's an impossible task when everything else in his world is working against her efforts. There are some parallels between Dana's life in the 1800s and the 1970s. In 1976, Dana works what at she calls \"the slave market,\" a temp agency where \"nonpeople rented for a few hours a few days, a few weeks.\" At first, it made me think about the casualness with which words like \"slave\" and \"Nazi\" are thrown about in the modern world. But as the parallels continued, I also began to see the way the remnants of the past worm their way into our present and the basic human impulses that can snowball into something horrific. \nStrangely, they seemed to like [Rufus], hold him in contempt, and fear him all at the same time. This confused me because I felt just about the same mixture of emotions for him myself. I had thought my feelings were complicated because he and I had such a strange relationship. But then, slavery of any kind fostered strange relationships. Only the overseer drew simple, unconflicting emotions of hatred and fear when he appeared briefly. But then, it was part of the overseer\u2019s job to be hated and feared while the master kept his hands clean. \nAt one point Dana's husband Kevin, a white man, is also transported to the Weylin plantation, which adds some additional complications. His presence makes it safer for Dana because he can pretend to be her owner, but what happens if she gets transported back to 1976 and he's unable to grab onto her in time? She's worried about what this era will do to him. Will it destroy him or rub off on him? Kevin is essentially a good man, but sometimes clueless. I expected more from him, so sometimes I'd be as angry with him as I was with Rufus. Like Rufus, he is more progressive than his forebearers but he's still a man of his time. There are times in both 1976 and the 1800s where he's unable to see outside the lens of his own experience. He remarks on how plantation life isn't as bad as he would've expected, unaware of how different his experience is from Dana's experience and unable to confront the true horror of something he'll never be subjected to. \nRepressive societies always seemed to understand the danger of \u201cwrong\u201d ideas.\nThe most jarring thing about Dana's character is she quickly accepts her fantastic situation. She is somewhat detached from her experiences. Much of that is purposeful as she eases into her role, but maintains an observer's distance. However, she remains remarkably levelheaded from the beginning. While Dana sometimes felt \"empty\" to me, Butler really brings the supporting cast to life: Alice, Luke, Nigel, Carrie, Sarah, and even characters with smaller roles like Sam. Maybe Dana was written the way she was so that the reader could essentially \"inhabit\" her body and become a time traveler themselves.My edition included a critical essay by Robert Crossley, which includes information on Octavia Butler's background as well as analysis of Kindred. There were some aspects I picked up on, but many I didn't. Because of my prior knowledge and the book cover, I didn't notice that Dana's race was withheld until a specific moment. I loved learning about Butler's mischievous reasoning behind choosing a spouse for Dana. Crossley also writes about how the science fiction landscape and the nature of the \"alien\" changed with the inclusion of female authors, which was really interesting.I've been meaning to read Kindred for a long time, but I just now made time for it in preparation to read Kindred: A Graphic Novel Adaptation (review coming soon). One thing is clear: I need more Octavia Butler in my life! I think those that enjoy this book might want to try The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead, which addresses slavery but plays with time in a different way. Even if you didn't like The Underground Railroad because some of the liberties the author you took, you might want to give Kindred a try. Despite the time travel, it keeps an accurate historical timeline."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "4.5/5Butler's yet another one of those names that I feel I should be hearing float by a lot more frequently than I do. A female person of color who is not only well regarded in the field of science fiction, but also the first science fiction writer to have won the MacArthur \"Genius Grant\". Much as I am a fan of DFW and Pynchon, their ivory towers of public awareness need little help in terms of circulation via word of mouth.Now, I like it when my fiction tries to achieve something beyond the boundaries of a logical plot and decent characterization. I am much more interested in themes, especially ones concerned with the intersection of the written word with reality, and as such am forgiving of the more eclectic aspects of certain branches of literature so long as they get the job done. Besides gorgeous prose and immersive writing constructions and all that straining of fiction towards the very limits of the conveyance of reality and beyond, I am a sucker for social justice and all of its underlying metafictional contexts. In that light, this book had much to offer.However, there were also problematic issues that are as much a matter of previous readings and personal preference as the potential delights. Having been deluged with the masterpiece that is Beloved less than two months ago, the comparisons were unavoidable. Tying in the fact that I'd never had much interest in the field of science fiction until encountering a pinnacle of such within the last year (thank you, The Dispossessed), I was all set for appreciating the book, but not as much as I could have without such esteemed baselines. Lucky for me, this book holds its own.A major factor in said holding this own is the writing's practicality, thus from the beginning veering away from the more eloquent descriptions of that both TD and 'Beloved' share. I disliked it at first, but grew increasingly appreciative of it as the story continuously reached new heights of complexity. Butler set out to portray a California woman of 1973 time traveling to Maryland of the early 1800's, and did so in such a way that the reader is caught up in the world to a comprehensible degree. The reality may not be nearly as psychologically indoctrinated to a brutal degree as 'Beloved', but the results of cold facts meeting human sensibilities are all there, and nowhere is there a simple line of black and white.What I particularly admired was the skillful twisting between past and present, ugly lines of common accordance that I can recognize today despite the novel's present having been set forty years ago. While the critical essay inserted in the last pages asserts that this work is not actually science fiction, in this case I would rather stick to the popularly mandated Genres tag than academic opinion. If there's one thing I don't like, it's passing something up on the basis of overarching stereotype rather than actual experience, a fate to which SF has been long consigned to. It's books like these that are wearing away my instinctive imaginings of lasers and extended technological treatises and general conformance with sociocultural structures of today, and I'd like that encouragement to continue.Now, I just need Dhalgren to still be stocked at a particular bookstore when I return, and I'll be set."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "This is pretty much a historical novel with a bit of SF icing, focusing almost exclusively on the relationships built between a mid-1970's modern black woman who is continually sent back in time to save an ancestor from an early death. Unfortunately for her, she's a black woman on a slave plantation, and she's stuck there for a disproportionately long time, sometimes even bringing her white husband back into the past with her and sometimes leaving him behind. Theres a ton of time dilation, where moments pass in the modern world and years pass in the past, so it brings a real sense of horror to the story as her real life tumbles away into long absences with her husband.Of course, the real story isn't about Dana and Kevin, our moderns. Or at least, their intro brings to life a closer contrast of living as a slave, and not always entirely that different from those living in such humiliating circumstances on the plantation. Sure, science, medicine, the abolition of slavery, the freedom to speak your mind, all of that is very well and good, but it says a lot right out of the gate that Dana was able to fit into the frankly horrifying life of the past without too much struggle. Life as a temp slave as she struggled with her dream to become a writer seemed to be merely an appetizer before the grand meal of humiliation and torture.I can make a pretty solid argument that most people live an all too-similar picture of daily grind and humiliation, and it's only in the matter of degree that anything has really changed, either that, or it's a matter of sublimation.Dana was seen by too many of those past slaves as an black who pretended to be white because she was educated and tried, with varied success, to stand up to the one person she was nearly irrevocably tied to: Rufus, the son of the plantation owner, who despite Dana's best efforts, still turned out to be a fucking ass. Is it merely cultural? Is it thoroughly cultural? Butler's argument really seems to push aside individual will, time and time again, with every push in the right direction met with an equally feverish backlash.Sure, we could have had these reversals take place as a science fictional trope, but Butler does something much more interesting. She blames people for being people.Those times were a travesty of human stupidity and misery, and it's an even bigger blow to us as a species that it's hardly isolated or unique. We live in our own version of slavery, still, even if so many of the particulars have improved, we're still weighted by expectations, assumptions, and bloody-mindedness no less destructive.Be kinder to our writers. Give them an outlet to create wonderful mirrors to ourselves, such as this novel.I'm very sorry to know that Butler had passed away, and I'm sorry that it has taken me these many years to finally come around to reading her for the first time.

But it has many flaws. I'll get to that in a few, but first, let me gush about what's great about it. The plot/premise is brilliant. I love the idea of a modern black woman being propelled back into time to help one of her white ancestors to survive, even if he becomes a mean and despicable slave master. I love the fact that it used time travel, which I usually hate, but found tolerable here. I love the observations of the protagonist, Dana. She's an interesting character, with a lot of strength, and some flaws that I found believable. The book is easy to read, but perhaps that's where I start my critique. It sometimes over simplifies in an effort to push through the story. There was a lot of opportunity for complexity, and the author sorta takes the easy way out in many instances. Also, it feels a little dumbed down at times, and the author tries too hard to explain some things, and it comes off as contrived. In other instances, though, she doesn't explain enough, like why Dana is traveling through time in the first place. Overall though, it's a really ambitious and brilliant concept, and a fascinating read. We need more African-American novels that use paranormal elements to explore socio-historical issues.

I love Octavia Butler's science fiction, but KINDRED is a book that I purposely put off reading because I'd heard it was brutal. Good, but brutal, and utterly unflinching in the portrayal of that brutality.Dana is a black woman living in the 1970s. Her husband, Kevin, is white, and both their families disapprove of that union, even in the twentieth century. Things are pretty good for Dana, though; she has a decent job, a husband who loves her, and her own house filled with books. All that changes when one day, without explanation, she's plunged into the past to save a white relative from death.Rufus is the son of a plantation owner, and one of her relatives, the Weylins, although her family history is so occluded that until now, she never realized he was white. There's a bond connecting them, tightening whenever Rufus is about to die - and the only way that Dana is able to return to her own time is when her own life is threatened. Some people have said that this reminded them of OUTLANDER, and that's true: the time-travel is just as sketchy and mysterious, and neither shrink back from cruelty and rape.What makes KINDRED such an interesting book is the complex way that Butler portrays slavery. She makes so much social commentary about both the twentieth century and the nineteenth century, and despite being published about forty years ago, it still feels fresh and modern. Dana struggles with slavery as a modern woman, and yet even she realizes how sinister a trap it is: when you have no rights, any concession feels like a blessing, to the point where you may start to feel affection for someone just treating you like a human being. She experiences something akin to Stockholm syndrome, and sees firsthand how some of her peers struggle and are oppressed by those same societal constraints.KINDRED is not an easy read. There is rape, and torture, and cruelty of all colors. The N-word is bandied around a lot (because this is the South in the nineteenth century, and it would not be realistic otherwise). I think many readers, white readers especially, will probably be shocked at the no-holds barred approach, especially if they're accustomed to the version of history that sugar-coats the antebellum period and has slaves and black servants being adored and treated like family. Dana herself has a similar moment of disillusionment when she is researching the period and picks up a copy of GONE WITH THE WIND, only to put it down in disgust.The fact of the matter is, slavery happened. It happened and it was awful, and it happened. But it's important to know that it happened, and what it was like; it's important to know that real human beings suffered at the hands of other human beings, and were made to feel different based on where they came from and the color of their skin; it's important to know that injustice is a real and painful thing that is mired in our shared history and continues to be perpetuated to this day.It's important to know that, so we remember why we must never go back; and why we must do our best going forward to work towards a future of true equality.

There is time travel here but it isn't the most important part of the story, in fact it is more of the framework than the point (something I appreciated since many time travel novels are only about the time travel!)Dana is a newly married mid-20s woman living in Los Angeles in 1976. Suddenly one day, the room spins and she finds herself in antebellum Maryland. She is black, and in that place and time she could only be a slave. In another writer's hands, this would have felt very much like an overly didactic tale, but in Butler's hands the horror is real. The reader feels Dana struggle with her place in society without power to really change it. She also has some reasons to not just give up, since the boy/man who keeps calling her back is actually her ancestor, a white plantation owner (it starts out as the child of the owner) who calls her to him in space and time whenever his life is in danger. So self-preservation has two sides.At some point, she brings in her husband Kevin, and I think this is the most interesting element of the entire novel. Kevin is white, and even living in the slavery-ridden south, he doesn't necessarily get it. He is able to shut it out, diminish it, even when he is at fault. It is interesting to see them navigate how their relationship changes when they aren't equals, but then you wonder if they ever really were when you see them interacting back in 1976."}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "So he had called me. I was certain now. The boy drew me to him somehow when he got himself into more trouble than he could handle.Kindred is my second story by Octavia E. Butler, the first being in the Wastlelands anthology, where her story was one of the few I really liked. This was selected as my work's sci-fi bookclub February read, and honestly I wasn't looking forward to it because I really don't usually enjoy time travel books.This one though was definitely something different. It was a very easy read in terms of language, however the subject matter was difficult as it had to do with race relations beginning in 1815. As a black woman traveling back in time she provided a unique perspective on the times, something I felt was done really well. Someone described it as \"accessible\" and I couldn't agree more.The possibility of meeting a white adult here frightened me, more than the possibility of street violence ever could.I was hoping that this book would take a lighter turn, but having read one of her books previously I knew it probably wasn't the case, and I was correct. It does deal with dark themes, but not in a way where I felt like I was being forced someone's viewpoint. It definitely takes a talented author to take a difficult topic such as race and present it in a way that doesn't come off as emotional manipulation.My only issue with the book is that there was really no reasonable explanation as to why she was pulled into events as she was. The dreaded time travel paradox, but the book kept my attention enough that I can overlook this one fault.This isn't a book I would have normally picked up as in seems to be in a very particular niche, but I'm glad I did and it has definitely made me curious as to what else Butler has written."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. A powerful story, that even nearly 40 years after it was first published is still incredibly hard hitting and relevant today. Dana, an African-American writer, can travel through time. Intrinsically linked to a boy called Rufus, who lives in the pre Civil war Maryland, she appears to him whenever he appears to be in danger. Connected through time, Dana becomes embroiled in plantation life, and makes the often difficult decisions needed to survive and return to her own time. I was surprised how deeply involved I became in the storyline. There\u2019s no shying away from the brutality of life for slaves in the ante bellum South here. Everything is told vividly and convincingly. It\u2019s violent, cruel, raw and very real. The characters are full of life and complexity too. Not least Rufus, who we follow through Dana\u2019s eyes from child to man as the son of a plantation owner. At first, we feel something similar to pity for him. His father ignores him, his mother mollycoddles him, and he\u2019s friendly with his slaves children. Brought up to abuse them without really understanding that he\u2019s doing so, his rude introduction to Dana catches him by surprise, and we hope, maybe change him into a better man than his father. There\u2019s a scene we see between some slave children, where they play act a slave auction as if it\u2019s normal and unordinary. Dana and her husband Kevin are appalled by this, and it reminds them that no matter what they may feel about integrating into this lifestyle, they\u2019re not of this time. Their attitude is grossly different to the contemporaries they\u2019re surrounded by, and this is mirrored in Rufus as he grows up to be a person Dana comes to despise, down in part because of his upbringing and environment. It\u2019s a deeply complicated codependent relationship, as Dana tries to shape him into a \u2018better man\u2019, but being pulled up short by the times and expectations. For example, Rufus sees no harm in repeatedly humiliating and beating Dana to remind her of her place, just as his father does, yet feels some level of shame in doing so and feels a \u2018need\u2019 for her never to leave him. It\u2019s a kind of love that\u2019s toxic, but one Rufus believes is acceptable between a plantation owner and people he believes he owns. There\u2019s a certain level of complicity that runs throughout the novel, as Dana seems to readily slip into this role of slave and accept that she may never return to her present time. She accepts Rufus\u2019 often brutish treatment of her, along with the other white men she comes across, without any consideration as if it\u2019s her birth right as a black woman during this period of time. Perhaps this is because of the deep level of fear that seems to permeate the novel between all of the slaves. It\u2019s as if at any moment, any of them could be sold or beaten to death (or worse). They\u2019re so downtrodden, it\u2019s hard to imagine how anyone could rise above this to lead any kind of revolt or rebellion and it amazes me that anyone of this time did. These are the people history tend to overlook, when they faced such abject adversity to make them truly heroic . I would liked to have seen more of Dana and Kevin in their time together \u2018after\u2019 and how deeply the emotional scars ran into the future, and how they\u2019re altered by their time spent in the past. However, this was a wonderful read."}, {"userName": "Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206366-lawrence", "userReview": "This book is one of the top 10 books that I've read in my life time.

It\u2019s an exploration of American slavery and its painful legacy from the eyes of a contemporary (well, circa 1976) young black woman named Dana. So don\u2019t expect to learn why she keeps being pulled back in time to a pre-Civil war slave plantation in Maryland every time her ancestor, a white slave owner named Rufus Weylin, finds his life in danger. It\u2019s a plot device that allows the reader to experience all the horrors of being a powerless black female slave in 1815, while retaining a modern perspective. So this book is firmly in the tradition of Alex Haley\u2019s Roots (1976), Alice Walker\u2019s The Color Purple (1982), and more recently the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave (2013) in describing the impact of slavery and poverty that still leaves its marks on the American psyche today.As the first prominent black woman SF author to emerge in the late 1970s, it\u2019s not surprising that Butler would want to write a story concerned with the position of black women in both contemporary society and the past, and give it a SF framing device. The story of Kindred is deceptively simple, but Butler does not take the expected route of merely showing us the evils of slavery. Instead, she tackles a much more difficult subject, the strange and twisted relationship between white slave owners and their black slaves, one in which cruelty, oppression, and dehumanization are mixed with paternalism, religious condescension, and White Man\u2019s Burden. The question she asks is straight-forward: what would a contemporary young black woman do when forced into a position of subjugation under an ignorant and vicious white slave owner and his young son, if that young man was her own distant ancestor?Dana is a young black woman in Los Angeles, working low-paid temp jobs via an employment agency that she and others joking refer to as economic slavery. She aspires to be a writer, but has never found a way to make this dream a reality. At one of her jobs she meets another aspiring writer, Kevin, an older white man who she becomes friends with. Neither are living the American dream. Their families are not approving of their inter-racial relationship, and life is not easy, but they find comfort in each other and their common interests and eventually get married.One day, on her 26th birthday, she feels dizzy and loses her senses. When she comes to, she sees a young white boy struggling to avoid drowning in a river. She wades in to save him, but is soon after confronted with an angry white woman, his mother, who assumes she is hurting him, and then confronted by a shotgun-wielding man, his father, who points his gun at her. At that point she is transported back to her LA apartment with Kevin. Neither understand what happened to her, and Kevin initially struggles to believe her, but he quickly adjusts to the situation after she is repeatedly transported back in time, always to a time when Rufus is in danger, though each time she goes back he is a little older, and the relatively short time spend in the past is much longer in the present. Knowing that it can happen without warning, Dana and Kevin prepare supplies to help her survive in the past. Interestingly, they make no attempt to describe the situation to anyone else, assuming they will be considered insane.With this pattern established, the bulk of the story details Dana\u2019s increasingly longer stays in antebellum Maryland. While Rufus\u2019s father Tom is a vicious and ignorant man, regularly beating and intimidating his slaves to \u2018keep them in their place\u2019, young Rufus is initially just another little boy learning from his environment. He accepts the world around him \u2013 white men are at the top of the hierarchy, followed by white women, and then black men and women are essentially subhuman property (slaves) that are there to serve white people and should be beaten down at the slightest hint of resistance. Each time we meet Rufus, he is a little older and a little more like his father, yet retains some signs of decency in his strange relationship with Dana. Because Dana is clearly educated, despite being a black woman, both Rufus and his father Tom are unsure how to categorize her. Her intelligence and knowledge are intimidating, but when she talks back to them they react violently, either beating her or using psychological violence to suppress her.Butler forces us to experience Dana\u2019s situation, trapped as a slave but with full knowledge of the future, and shows unflinchingly just how deep-rooted the slave and slaver mentality is ingrained in whites and blacks alike. It\u2019s a telling detail that religious ministers also find convenient passages in the Bible to justify the relationship of slave and master, something we also see in the film 12 Years a Slave. The other slaves on the plantation resent Dana, since she talks like an educated white person, and gets special treatment as Rufus\u2019 tutor. Notably, Rufus is attracted to a strong-willed slave named Alice, whom he initially approaches peacefully, but when she rejects him he rapes her instead, blaming her for being difficult. Over time, Rufus fathers several children with Alice, all against her will. Throughout this process, he continues to want Alice to like him and is continually frustrated by her refusal to accept his overtures. Rufus demands that Dana intercede on his behalf, but she is torn. She knows that one of their children will become her ancestor, so she cannot prevent her own future existence. Even when she desperately wants to kill Rufus for his casual cruelty to her and Alice, she always hesitates for that reason.I\u2019ll leave further plot details for readers to discover on their own, but the relationship between Alice, Rufus, Dana, and Kevin becomes every more complex, until events come to a violent and cathartic head. The entire story is emotionally-wrenching, since it is impossible not to imagine ourselves in Dana\u2019s position, and yet that is truly unimaginable for any modern person. Or is it? Dana\u2019s early life in LA, while not subject to arbitrary beatings, is little different from economic slavery. The disapproval of her relationship with Kevin by their families shows the persistent nature of racism even in the world of 1976.But the central question, one that really bothered me throughout the story was why both Dana and Kevin slipped so quickly into the mindset of slavery in those dark times. Why does Dana continue to give Rufus the benefit of the doubt, always hoping he will be more kind and compassionate than his cruel father, only to be disappointed again and again? And why doesn\u2019t Dana resist her slavery more aggressively, perhaps trying to arrange an underground railroad to free slaves like Harriet Tubman (something that Kevin alludes to). Instead, the powerlessness of her situation, the psychological oppression and fear of beatings wears down her will to fight, and she has the benefit of a modern upbringing. How much harder would it be for slaves raised from birth to question or fight back against oppression. There are many cases of blacks running away in the story, but they are constantly hunted down, brutally beaten, and sold off farther South. One of the cruelest methods the Weylins use to keep their slaves cowed is by deliberately selling off their children, whether fathered by Tom or Rufus or the black male slaves, just the way you\u2019d sell livestock. By casually severing the bonds of parent and child, they crush all will to resistance. This was truly the most sickening aspect of slavery in the book, as if the beatings, rapes, and hardship were not enough. Initially I found it difficult to accept the possibility that any contemporary woman could eventually fall into an uneasy relationship with a white slaver owner, even given the unique (and artificial) plot constraint of him being Dana\u2019s distant ancestor. I\u2019m sure we would all think we\u2019d rather slit Rufus\u2019 throat, run away, or even take our own lives rather than \u2018sleep with the enemy\u2019. But Butler doesn\u2019t let us off the hook so easily. We could never know the real answer unless we were actually thrown back in time like Dana as a powerless black woman at the mercies of cruel and ignorant white masters. And yet Butler also depicts these men with fairness \u2013 they have moments of compassion once in a while, but they continually revert to the slaver mindset when pushed, and this is not hard to believe since that was the standard of the times. It would take a truly strong willpower to resist all the accepted beliefs of the time to fight against slavery, and yet somehow that was accomplished when slavery was abolished after the Civil War. Sadly, though the institution officially disappeared, as in stories like The Color Purple, black poverty has continued to persist long after the Civil War ended. Even in Dana\u2019s contemporary world, economic slavery remains, though it is not restricted to blacks. So although Kindred is not particularly uplifting, it does make the reader confront the slave/slaver relationship in all its complexities, and perhaps to understand it better in the end.The audiobook was narrated by Kim Staunton, who has an extensive theatre, television and film-acting career, and graduated from the Julliard School. She has narrated a number of audiobooks that focus on the stories of African Americans, and does an excellent job on Kindred. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act to handle the Southern accents of uneducated whites and blacks back in pre-Civil War Maryland without straying into stereotype territory, but I thought she was convincing. She also alternated this with the modern voices of Dana and Kevin, and I was really impressed with what she did with Kevin, as he started with a modern voice but after many years trapped in the past, his voice started to take on the speech patterns of the period. Very well done."}], "description": "(Alternate cover for B000VZPWFM)Dana, a modern black woman, is celebrating her twenty-sixth birthday with her new husband when she is snatched abruptly from her home in California and transported to the antebellum South.
