Plus, as a diehard liberal, I take issue with the conservative Republican stance that so many of these authors take. So when hubby decided to write a zombie series, I was interested.When I read ZKS, I was first heartened to see some left-leaning political satire in the preface (I only wish that Kim Kardashian's baby daddy was a certain presidential candidate....). And then, when I realized that the stoners were the highly functional saviors here, and that among them was a Samoan drag queen (hello, Duane Johnson - The Rock - would be perfect for this role), I was so happy! He wrote a zompoc novel that I would enjoy reading.An unlikely and somewhat dysfunctional crew all live in a new luxury skyscraper in lower Manhattan, so they have a great view as the zombies hit NYC.There is/are plenty of gore, guns, and tomahawks. But the strong women are Haitian and Israeli, one of the leaders is the previously mentioned Samoan drag queen, and, to quote Dylan, \"everybody must get stoned!\"Could use a touch better editing."}, {"userName": "Liz Long", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14510353-liz-long", "userReview": "It is a short book, but it left me wanting more. The lead characters are well prepared thanks to their job in the security field. One of them is a drag queen, which is well done, IMHO. There are nice details like a custom-made dress dummy for Polly included in the story, but it feels like a natural part of the story. This whole episode definitely feels like the set-up for a series, so just know going in that you won't get closure. But that's why it's \"episode 1\" not \"the whole story\"!"}], "description": "This is a significant update to the first edition, with typos fixed and plot-holes closed.The ZomPoc has hit New York City like the 'A' train plowing into a baby stroller. A high rise at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan has become the center of the universe for a group of survivors who think outside the box. Everyone understands the smoke signals from inside the bowl.This short but sweet first installment packs in:Lots of Zombies (it's the Big Apple, after all). Explosions. Awesome Views. Big Guns. Big Samoan Drag Queens. Kind Bud. Hot Babes. Mormons. More Zombies. Laughs. Musicians. Thespians. Millionaires. Dogs.Anyone and anything is fair game for us to poke fun at; absolutely nothing is sacred. So sit back, do whatever works for you to free your mind and don't take this too seriously; it's mental masturbation... not the end of the weed, uh, world ;).", "title": "Zombie Killing Stoners, Episode 1: Rescuing the Samoan Princess", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21850235-zombie-killing-stoners-episode-1", "average": 3.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397079591l/21850235.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6904384.C_Che_Bhalin", "name": "C.
