It shows mostly in form of her musings on gender injustice, because well that is where most of injustice is to be found. She has just lost an infant daughter. Although she has dealt with that well enough. \nI make the chappaties and we start on our meal. And suddenly I remember Anu, her little sparrow mouth open to receive the spoon, banging her own spoon on the table, turning her head to follow Kartik as he dances about the room to amuse her, the spoon sccrapping her cheek... \nHer sense of feminist values is so strong that,for example, she wont use the money her husband sends him but must earn her own. She even walks out on her husband (a gentle man) on the day of their marriage to show her independence -only to come back next day, having made her statemnet. She even came as far as to question whether women were brainwashed into the motherhood thing (by making it all that emotional and mysterious) when one of her friend, another working woman, tells her that her children think that she do not pay enough attention to them. Same thing that doesn't make them angry on their father. This reminnded me of what Pepsico's CEO Indira Nooyi had once said about working women. \nThe Poet trapped in Women's body\nShe comes to discover Meera's poetry. Meera is her long dead mother-in-law, the two never met. Latter didn't want to marry and probably was raped by her husband after her marriage: But tell me, friend, did Laxmi too,twist brocade tassels round her fingersand tremble, fearing the comingof the dark-clouded, engulfing night? Meera felt trapped, alone in her new family. she has no metaphorical 'rooom of her own' (both Woolf and her essay are mentioned in passing), she must steal moments late in night when everybody is asleep to write. Although there is a physical room which she has all to herself for three full days of month so that she may no pollute others.\n \"I rememeber the day the astrologer came home, He read all our horoscopes, told us our futures and we listened as if they were stories about other people. Only my mother's horoscope was not read. \"Don't you want to know your future?\" I asked her. And she replied this - 'Whats there in my life apart from all of you? If I know all of you are well and happy, I'm happy too.' Did she really mean that? Will I become that way too, indifferent to my own life, thinking it nothing? I don't want to. I won't. I think so now, but maybe my mother thought like when she ws my age. It frightens me. No, it doesn't, I'll never think my life, myself nothing, never.\"\nBeaten by life, Meera taunts her mother in her poems :\n \"To make myself in your imagewas never the goal I sought. \nNo, Meera couldn't help it. Her mother thought she was acting in her best interest in marrying her:\n \"Green sari draped about megreen bangles encircle my wrists,fill your eyes with the sight, mother,look at me, fruitful and green.Silver toe rings twinkle on my toessilver anklets tinkle as I walkbut, oh mother, I stumble, I fallmy arms sink heavily by my sides.\nMeera only found happiness again during her second pregnancy:\n Tiny fish swiming in the ocean of my wombmy body thrills to you..Bridging the two worlds, you awaken in mea desire for life\nIronically, she would die during child birth, perhaps willlingly: Smiling and joyful, Karna tore off his armour,his boody trailed blood.Will that coruage be mine when, denuded,I stand naked and bare?Moreover:I feel the quickening in my womb,he moves - why do I call the child he?No, she has no gender preferences. She just doesn't want the child to suffer similar fate. Woman must know fear.The statement comes from mother of a rape victim who comes to be in the touch with Urmi. The mother complains that her daughter invited the rape by decorating herself. Urmi protests knowing it to be a case of victim blaming. The daughter shouldn't ideally have anything to fear; she argues and yet, but Urmi believes she was probably afraid: I know how fearfully I look back, my heart thudding in panic, when I hear footsteps behind me on a dark desserted street. The victim-blaming isn't limited to the mother. Outsiders think that her behavior was 'objectionable' or that she was prostitute (because that would justify the rape!). Police registers it as a case of an accident because a rape case is too much trouble for everybody - police, doctors, family, victim etc. The mother herself doen't want the case registered, because it will make lives of other children troublesome too. Media does get involved later and there is all that drama - politicians, pseudo-sociologists etc. which most Indians can imagine from their recent memories. No, the book was written way back in 1993. What must have author have felt when Delhi rape case happened!\n Dharma, Dharma, Dharma, Dharma, the Mahabharta endlessly, tirelessly repeats. Yet at the end, the poet cries out in despair, I raise my arms and I shout, but no one listens.'"}, {"userName": "Sridevi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9962288-sridevi", "userReview": "I read Shashi Deshpande\u2019s \u201cThe Binding Vine\u201d late into last night and was left with a dark, disturbing feeling . For the first time , I was reading someone who did not romanticize or glorify grief and pain . Urmi , the narrator stubbornly embraces her grief and pain after losing her one year old daughter to death . She refuses to be condoled and instead gets pulled into the sad tale of a comatose Kalpana , who apparently had been raped brutally , but whose mother adamantly refuses to file a case because she has two more daughters to marry and she does not want the daughters\u2019 \u2018 honor\u2019 to be sabotaged . As the days progress and Kalpana is forcibly shifted to another far away hospital much against her mother\u2019s wish , her mother is forced to revise her views and gives a statement to a journalist of how her daughter was raped and how injustice had been meted out to her all along . The statement hastens justice , yet at a personal level , it opens a can of worms and Kalpana\u2019s mother is forced to see some ugly truths . By the end , she sees light and in calm undertones tells Urmi that her Kalpana is \u201cnot at all like that . she is a nice girl\u201d . In between her grief and Kalpana\u2019s case , Urmi manages to unearth the sordid past of her long dead mother in law Meera, who had been a victim of marital rape . Meera\u2019s poetry speaks directly to Urmi and to the reader in the four lines painstakingly penned in a moment of utter despair . Don\u2019t tread paths barred to youObey , never utter a \u2018no\u2019Submit and your life will beA paradise , she said and blessed mThese four lines sum up the essence of what every young girl is taught the moment she is betrothed to a man .And these lines Meera pens when renamed as Nirmala A glittering ring gliding on the riceCarefully traced a name \u2018Nirmala\u2019Who is this? None but I,My name hence, bestowed upon me .Nirmala, they call, I stand satue-still.Do you build the new without razing the old ?A tablet of rice, a pencil of gold .Can they make me Nirmala ? I am MiraEven as Urmi struggles to bring justice to the dead Mira , by trying to get her poems published , she knows she has to fight many personal battles . The book though primarily about feminism is also about the mechanics of grief and loss. I almost closed this book after the second chapter , because the terms were too colloquial ( the names of different characters and their relationship with each other in the beginning would have helped ) , the shift in the setting and scene was abrupt and sudden . But I am glad I stuck, otherwise I would have missed the compassion and love with which Ms Deshpande weaves her tale. A book fervently recommended to every feminist and humanist out there , I happily award 4 stars to this book ."}, {"userName": "Anuradha Gupta", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65732846-anuradha-gupta", "userReview": "The Binding Vine by Shashi Deshpande is a hard hitting novel about the concepts that surround women. Set in a patriarchal world, it is a narration of the protagonist, Urmila and the women in her life, some of whom she happens to encounter by chance. They come from various strata of the society and bind themselves together with the narrator.Showing the multi-faceted-ness of the central character, the story begins with a miserable Urmi, mourning the death of her beloved infant daughter Anu. Caught in an unhappy marriage where her husband is away on the sea most of the times, Urmi finds it difficult to cope with this loss. She struggles to accept the reality, both relating to her marriage with Kishore and Anu\u2019s death. She starts feeling emotionally detached to Kishore and also shuns her mother Inni\u2019s and friend-cum-sister-in-law Vanaa\u2019s attempts to help her, which makes it harder for her to deal with life at the moment. She also knows she ought to give attention to her son, realizing her accountability towards him who longs for her love and affection. Urmi, herself in her childhood, was sent away to live with her grandmother Baiaji to whom she was closer to than her own mother while her brother continued to live with their parents. She knows she shouldn\u2019t be keeping her son away the way her mother did to her.While overcoming her grief, Urmi crosses path with three women; Mira, her dead mother-in-law, Kalpana, a brutal rape survivor and her impoverished mother, Shakutai. As their story unfolds, so does their strength and courage blossoms.Urmi comes across Mira\u2019s journals locked away in a dusty trunk when she visits her Biaji\u2019s home when she dies. Curiosity gets the better of her and she opens it to find Mira\u2019s hand written notes, her poetries, most of which spoke about her torturous arranged marriage to Kishore\u2019s father and the life she desired. Married off to a man who fell in love with her beauty at a social function, Mira becomes a victim of domestic violence and marital rape. She conceived as a result and died during the delivery of her son and was ultimately emancipated from her miseries. But before that, being a gifted writer she was, penned down her beautiful poems, which years later capture Urmi\u2019s attention who finds an escape in them. Urmi makes it her aim to get the poems published in the honor of the woman, who was forcefully made a wife and the mother, who wanted to love her child but couldn\u2019t, irrespective of the way in which he was put into her.Urmi meets Shakutai at a local hospital where she has come with her friend Bhaskar. On seeing the woman upset and crying, she enquires and finds that her daughter Kalpana has been raped and is fighting for her life. Urmi sympathizes with her and to some extent identifies, since both the women are at a loss of their respective daughters. Urmi forms a mutual comfort with Shakutai, visits her room in the chawl where she tells her how her Kalpana would fight with her; her young, fierce energy oozing confidence. Urmi suggests lodging police but Shakutai refuses because she fears that no one would marry her girl. In-fact she should be worrying about her lying in a hospital bed, unconscious, instead she regrets not forcing her to marry her lecherous uncle, the husband of her childless sister Sulu, who preferred Kalpana over some other woman to bear her husband a child. Blaming Kalpana for her situation, Shakutai curses her for being so forward, thinking that she could be spared of the fate that awaits a woman. It is eventually found by Sulu that it was her husband who had revenged Kalpana as a punishment for refusing to marry him. Sulu, in shame commits suicide but not before exposing her criminal husband. While Shakutai still couldn\u2019t deal with her daughter\u2019s loss, she is pushed into mourning her sister as well.The central characters of this novel are women, some weak, some strong, all bound by a vine called Urmi, reaping it with love, concern, comfort and courage to each other. Each one of them has their own challenges and are trying best to deal with them. The author uses the themes of death, marriage, rape, loneliness and loss to highlight the plight of these women.All the women have/had challenging marriages, Mira was exploited by her husband, Inni and Vanaa supposedly were too submissive to their respective partners, sisters Shakutai and Sulu were abandoned, one literally, the other emotionally and Urmi had second thoughts about her relationship with Kishore. They are lonely despite having (had) a life partner each. Is it so important for a woman to get married?Rape is another violation that brings them closer, Mira and Kalpana both were victims, a generation apart, one married and another unmarried. Yet it is the women who get the blame for being a catalyst for her own horrific plight. Is it really the victim\u2019s disgrace and not the criminal\u2019s?Death is a truth of life that none will ever understand. It is eminent yet we are unable to accept it. Women of this novel are compelled to face it, both Urmi and Shakutai grieve the deaths of their beloved daughters. While Urmi also grieves her grandmother, Shakutai has Sulu to blame who leaves her in her time of need. Will we ever understand that death spares no one, timely or untimely?All the women are looking for their place in the patriarchal world. Being defined by her father or husband is not her only identity. She can be independent of them and make her own place if she manages to gather enough courage. When a woman can bring a new life into the world, she definitely can take care of herself. It is a question of being true to oneself. Urmi decides to publish Mira\u2019s poems while Shakutai decides to go public with Kalpana\u2019s violator. This sense of being liberated from a cage, to get their voices heard, truly is their victory."}, {"userName": "Sachin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3881655-sachin", "userReview": "The book underlining tales of females in India and their Status.they are shown to be completely dominated and instructed by their counterparts-the patriarchy and are blamed for things which are actually plotted by the males.A must read in order to get sensitized towards women.A book concernning feminist issues though its writer vehemently opposes the tag of being called a FEMININST.(STRANGE)A good Book overall."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1858868-anna", "userReview": "This is the most moving book I've ever read which describes loss - breath-taking..."}, {"userName": "Versha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7822147-versha", "userReview": "I can never get enough of Shashi Deshpande\u2019s tantalizing writing no matter how dark, how depressing her stories are , I always feel at home when I read them.
