It\u2019s not even past.\n William Faulkner\nIt is this notion, of the past steering the present away from a true course, that drives the narrative in The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow, and in at least one way, it is the past that helps steer it back onto the road. If you liked Edgar Sawtelle, the story or film of Benjamin Button, the TV show Pushing Daisies or the more imaginary tales of Alice Hoffman, you will love this book, a tale imbued with a few large dollops of magical realism. Like Edgar, Bonaventure is born somewhat different from other children. Like Edgar, he makes no sound. But while Edgar has a particular Mowgli-like talent for relating to his pooches, Bonaventure is possessed of an otherworldly sense of hearing. The medical term for one aspect of this is synaesthesia. He is able to hear color. But his gift goes far beyond the odd skills that as many as one in twenty-three humans might have. As he grows into his gift, he can hear the stories of inanimate objects. Eventually, Bonaventure is able to hear at a molecular level. He is even able to hear sounds that happened long ago. Bonaventure never met his father, William, at least while he was alive. Before the boy\u2019s birth, Dad was shot down on the streets of New Orleans by a madman known only as \u201cthe Wanderer.\u201d But William hangs around, having a few tasks to complete before he can graduate from Almost Heaven, and helps his unusual son adapt to the world and complete his own mission. Bonaventure\u2019s mother, Dancy, lives with a burden of guilt originating in the day her husband was killed. Dancy\u2019s mother, Letice, carries a heavy load of sorrow from her adolescence. It is only through Bonaventure\u2019s gift, with the help of his father, that these decent people can move ahead with their lives. Another force is at play here as well, in the person of Trinidad PreFontaine, maker of healing potions, and well versed in the potential of most plant life. She feels the presence of Bonaventure as if they are connected by a personal, psychic tether. She has a role to play as well in seeing Bonaventure realize his potential.It is easy for a story with a fair bit of magic in it to get caught up in the pyrotechnics (verbotechnics?) of the incredible. (See  The Night Circus) But that is not a fate suffered here. We are acutely aware of the humanity of these characters, and it is their emotional life that drives the story. The Magic takes an appropriate, supportive role. We follow the Wanderer, a physically maimed and mentally ravaged war veteran, from his constricted life in Detroit, as he sets out on a mission of unknown origin, to the point of his deed, and after that we see him occasionally in an asylum. He is very fixated on Alexandre Dumas, particularly The Count of Monte Cristo. One wonders what the wrong is that he is avenging.It is possible that there may be readers who are put off by the obvious religious perspective presented in Bonaventure\u2019s world. Like the Blues Brothers, some characters here are most definitely on a mission from God.  Bonaventure Arrow had been chosen to bring peace. There was guilt to be dealt with, and poor broken hearts, and atonement gone terribly wrong. And too there were family secrets to be heard; some of them old and all of them harmful.One cannot help but wonder if Trinidad PreFontaine, given her evocative name, might have some sort of baptismal relationship with BA. But take it from this atheist. It is worth the weight of Leganski\u2019s perspective to gain the benefit of this wondrous landscape. And she does offer an image, as well, of some who would use religion for unseemly purposes.Leganski feathers her literary nest with some lovely imagery. Sparrows flit in and out, standing in for, probably, a variety of things. Birds, as a group are a significant presence In the middle of her sleepless night, Trinidad experienced a vision. A scavenging raven circled the room, its beady eyes questing after death. The bird spread its wings to swoop and glide, its feathers sounding like rustling silk. From the bird\u2019s shaggy throat came a prruk-prruk call and a toc-toc click and a dry, rasping kraa-kraa cry. After the raven came a pure white dove, and after the dove, a sparrow.Later, Trinidad regarded circles as symbols of God\u2019s eternal love. Her favorite circle was that which is found in the small dark eye of a sparrow.And againTristan had rescued a bird\u2014a sparrow\u2014and needed her [Letice\u2019s] help. It was a life or death situation\u2026The bird seemed no more than a wisp, nearly weightless. She believed she could feel its bones and imagined them to be made of straw, all hollowed-out and light. Letice decided the bird was a girl sparrow, a young and delicate one. The tiny creature lay on its left side, breathing very fast. Letice could feel its heart beating in sync with her ownAre sparrows the souls of these characters? Angels? Don\u2019t know, maybe, or maybe something else entirely. Bonaventure associates another character with an eagle later in the book, keeping the bird imagery aloft. There are plenty more, but I will stop there. There is a lovely sequence in which a few of the characters incorporate some voodoo gris gris into their experience, in a very warm, nurturing way. No black magic here, thank you very much, but maybe a bit of the sympathetic varietySome characters seem to have maybe a bit too much of a vision, if not always an absolute road map, directing them toward their goals. Trinidad certainly has a finger on the pulse of the force. William seems to have gotten a bullet-pointed memo from the Almighty in his in-box, and Bonaventure has his father to show him the way. While this may be tactically a bit convenient, strategically it supports the emotional journey of others. Bonaventure struggles to adapt to a world that is not all that accepting of someone as different as he is, particularly in the social cacophony of school, where he tries mightily to feel normal despite his large difference. I wish that we had gotten to see more of that effort. But the boy remains a pretty nifty character on his own for someone charged with helping change others. Really, it is the women whose journey we follow most here, Dancy, Letice, and Adelaide, Dancy\u2019s awful mother, who could easily be a member of the De Vil clan, and who adds a layer of unpleasantness to the expression going postal.Along the way, Leganski offers a fascinating look at a time and place, New Orleans and the fictitious town of Bayou Cymbaline of the 1950s, primarily. The author, although from Wisconsin, and currently residing in Chicago, has a Southern heart. She has always been enamored of many great southern writers, Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Tennessee Williams, and Harper Lee, among others. That sensibility comes through. Despite her northern Midwest DNA, the soul of this book resides in the South. She all but strokes the landscape with her rich, languid prose. There are enough overt literary references to offer tethers to other works. Dancy is, like her creator, a huge fan of Faulkner. From a different, if no less wonderful world, C.S. Lewis gets a mention, as does Lewis Carroll. Leganski writes with conviction about a sense of god, but not in a good versus evil way, although there is a bit of that in this tale. Here the battle is, mostly, about good versus despair, belief as a tool to help one overcome barriers and find again one\u2019s better personal paths. Her notion of god, while clearly Christian in origin, extends the concept to a sort of areligious universality. Hers is not one of those church-bound deities, but a wondrous extra layer of existence that embraces profound beauty, kindness, forgiveness and understanding. The Sinners in The Hands of An Angry God sorts are anathema here. The story of Bonaventure Arrow takes place in a universe of love, a universe in which bad things certainly can and do happen, but in which there are forces at work trying to heal wounds and make things right. In addition to lifting up some of its characters, this is a book that will lift up its readers. Enjoy it as pure fantasy if that works for you. Embrace the religious aspect if you prefer. The characters feel real and their struggles are all too mortal. The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow is most assuredly worth shouting about.==============================UPDATES March 18, 2013 - I just came across this - lovely interview with the author.

This novel features some wonderful people, not least little Bonaventure Arrow who cannot speak but can hear things other people cannot. The prose is like liquid, it flows fluently and freely. Yet all is not sweetness and light, it is New Orleans in the 1950's, a place of root and voodoo and hoodoo and some strange going ons. There are family secrets, religion and sadness and one particular dark happening that will tragically effect the future. Ultimately there is a secret and once that is found there will be forgiveness and love and new chances at life. I often see authors asked what one novel did they wish they could read again for the first time. I wish I could start this one over but alas. I may have found one of the few books I can see myself reading again. One must suspend a little belief, and like the atmospheric New Orleans and quite a bit of magical realism to love this novel."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7821876-greg", "userReview": "Know what you're getting into: This is soooooper sentimental. Like a Frank Capra directing The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry from a screenplay by Paolo Coelho, starring Michael Landon, with a soundtrack by Andrew LLoyd Webber level of sentimentality. Rita Leganski has built a sentimentality amplifier that \"goes to 11\".That being said, this is a great read. The prose is beautiful and the characters are surprisingly real for a story that involves voodoo, ghosts, and super hearing. Leganski's sense of place is amazing, and her sense of wonder is breathtaking.Bonaventure wasn't a quick read for me. Not that I wasn't rushing to get back to it, but my page-per-hour rate was much slower than usual, because the prose demands it.This is not a book for the hipster crowd. If you're too cool for school, stay away. But if you want a heartfelt story of loss, pain, love, forgiveness, and redemption, you won't find a better book this winter."}, {"userName": "Miki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4082171-miki", "userReview": "This novel was absolutely fantastic. It took me quite some time to get over the fact that this book had ended. I did not want to leave the world that Rita Leganski had created in this novel. The story within these pages sucked me in from the first page and it almost hurt me to close the back cover at the end. This was one of those novels that is so well written, I had to read parts out loud to release the beauty of the language into the world. Not only is Bonaventure's world magical, but so is the writing of Leganski. She wrote so beautifully, I had no choice but to run away with Bonaventure, William, Dancy, and the Wonderer. Dancy and William fell quickly in love. They were blissfully happy and could not control their longing for each other. It wasn't long after their indiscretion, that Dancy became pregnant. The two were quickly married and began a perfect life together. That was until William was shot and killed on his birthday.The grief that Dancy feels after William's death is so deep and numbing, it actually changes her unborn child, Bonaventure. When Bonaventure is born, the family quickly realizes that he is very different. He doesn't cry, he doesn't fuss, he doesn't make a sound. Although some thought that this was a defect, Dancy knew her son was special. Indeed he was. Bonaventure didn't speak because he knew that he could learn more from the world if he just listened. Soon the world was talking to Bonaventure. He could hear his mothers guilt, his grandmother's grief, and even his father's ghost.This superb hearing wasn't just a gift, it was a fate. Bonaventure soon found that his hearing could help him heal his family. With the help of a hoo doo woman who understands Bonaventure's gift, he begins to unravel dark family secrets and release the hold they have on his family.This novel was so entrancing, I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves Benjamin Button, Like Water For Chocolate, or Perfume. I repeat, ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!"}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "2.5**Before he is born, Bonaventure Arrow\u2019s father is murdered by a mentally disturbed man known only as \u201cthe Wanderer.\u201d His mother\u2019s unspeakable grief affects Bonaventure\u2019s development \u2013 he is born mute, but with hyper-acute hearing. He can hear earthworms moving through the dirt and a bit of dust falling off a moth\u2019s wing. He can also hear the stories that inanimate objects tell \u2013 the sound of steamships comes from a wooden crate marked \u201cport of New Orleans,\u201d and the sounds of gunshots from a jar of sassafras. And he hears the sadness and secrets of his paternal grandmother\u2019s house. Helping him make sense of these sounds are two extraordinary characters \u2013 the ghost of his father, William Arrow, whom only Bonaventure can hear, and the family\u2019s cook, Trinidad Prefontaine, who is a Creole woman knowledgeable about hoodoo and root work. Leganski\u2019s work is hard to describe. It has elements of Southern gothic, as well as the supernatural and magic. When I first heard that the central character is a mute child, I immediately thought of David Wroblewski\u2019s The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. But this novel is nowhere near so fine a work of literature as Wroblewski\u2019s. I think Leganski got too caught up in the \u201cmagical\u201d quality of Bonaventure\u2019s extraordinary hearing. She spends way too much time crafting beautiful descriptions of his abilities \u2013 and they are beautiful. But, how does reading about a dust mote\u2019s story of being carried across the Himalayas on the foot of a goose help this story? The answer is it doesn\u2019t. These type of passages (and there are many) showcase Leganski\u2019s imagination and ability to write creatively, but they interfere with the story. They do nothing to develop the characters or advance the plot. They are unnecessary distractions. There is a nugget of a great premise here. I like how she used the innocence of a child to help the wounded adults around him heal. I liked that Bonaventure was surrounded by people who loved him and nurtured him \u2013 maternal grandmother notwithstanding. I wish she had spent more time developing the story, and less time expounding on Bonaventure\u2019s unusual hearing abilities. I was interested and caught up in the plot at the beginning, but then felt she would never get to the point. By the time the identity of William\u2019s killer was revealed I just didn\u2019t really care. Had I been her editor, I would have deleted close to a hundred pages. I would have deleted the maternal grandmother\u2019s storyline and expanded on his teacher\u2019s growing relationship with his mother. I would also have advised her to make more use of Trinidad, who doesn\u2019t join the family until half-way through the novel. I get that Leganski was going for an ethereal quality, but I think she went too far in that direction and forgot the story. NOTE: I don't usually \"round-up\" when I give a 1/2 star rating, but the quality of Leganski's writing shows promise, so I did in this case."}, {"userName": "Harpercollins Canada", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6962119-harpercollins-canada", "userReview": "I read a lot of books but rarely do I read one that reminds me of why I love to read.

On the surface, it should have been a favorite. After all, it's set in my beloved New Orleans and brimming with magical realism. I expected to find something I'd at least like, but I wasn't holding out hope of discovering a new favorite.What I actually found, however, was almost offensive. Style and content obviously cribbed from the awesome Sarah Addison Allen, only filled with heavy-handed proselytization to spice things up a bit. The omniscient narrator's descriptions of pregnancy and later, abortion, make it abundantly clear that this book should certainly be shelved with the Christian fiction. Not only is the description of abortion graphic and scientifically dubious; we're also forced to endure the hand-wringing and pearl-clutching of Letice's guilt as she struggles to come to terms with her remorse over a decades-old backroom procedure she was forcibly subjected to. This moral agony is so strong that she actually builds a personal chapel so she can keep begging for divine forgiveness. The character is defined by this guilt, until she becomes nothing more than a Roman Catholic cautionary tale in sackcloth and ashes. Bonaventure, the boy who can hear the pots in the kitchen telling stories about warming bottles for him as a baby (no, really) is the almighty vehicle that doesn't speak so that he can hear enough to heal the world. Pages and pages are spent on description of his ability to hear powder falling off of moth's wings, along with his advanced IQ and perfect disposition. He never misbehaves, he never gets angry and he reacts to the ostracism of his peers with blessed acceptance. Ugh.I will give Ms. Leganski credit for skillful exposition, I just hated her preachy tone. We're reminded over and over that voodoo is a bad thing and feigned Christianity is a bad thing and disbelief is a bad thing, while abortion is the absolute WORST thing. If you're into heavy-handed Christian rhetoric masquerading as something a bit more exciting, you might be pleased with The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."}, {"userName": "MomToKippy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631503-momtokippy", "userReview": "I suppose this falls under the category of magical realism. I actually never knew exactly what that was but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is fun to be immersed in a story where one might believe in guardian angels, that loved ones who have passed on can reach out to us and that some people may have other worldly gifts that can be used to help or heal others. Of course this only works if it is well written and this definitely is. Love the time period - 1950s, the Cajun culture and New Orleans setting. There is a great cast of characters. Many to love and only a few to hate. I always enjoy having a strong child character/perspective - it offers so much more. Even the names are magical. Bonaventure Arrow, Trinidad Prefontaine, Bayou Cymbaline. And how nice to have satisfying and happy endings/closure. There were a couple of incidents that were a little too graphic/macabre for me but thankfully the sweet and humorous aspects of the story helped to balance it.This was a nice change of pace - very different form anything else I have read. I will look forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "Okay book, I'm pretty sure it was me and not you. Listen, I saw you and you were beautiful, and I wanted you right away. I couldn't resist your allure, your magical realism. I had to have you in my life. Now, though, I realize that I should have gotten to know you better first, before we committed to one another in any meaningful way. You really are beautiful inside and out, but just not in a way I can fully appreciate.What I can say is that the writing in The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow is beautiful. Simply lovely. Leganski's writing style plays into the feeling of magical realism perfectly, and the way she puts together sentences has a magic all its own. Her debut proves her writing chops, and I would be willing to consider reading whatever her next novel is, solely on the strength of her prose.The book's opening captured me immediately, reminding me a good deal of Fitzgerald's short story \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" mixed with the southern charm of Sarah Addison Allen. The idea of a child, mute but intended for some big purpose, seems fraught with possibility. Unfortunately, the story then jumps back and spends almost the whole of the novel in the backstory of his mother and grandmothers. I never did find myself especially interested in any character but Bonaventure Arrow himself, and he didn't turn out to be much of a focus in the novel.Bonaventure, in addition to being silent, has super hearing. He can hear everything, from falling stars to his father's ghost. Supposedly, this will allow him to do something quite special and live up to his saintly name. His counterpart of sorts, in the sense that they both have special abilities, is Trinidad, a much older black woman. She sees visions, Knowings, and practices hoodoo, which allows her to help people with natural herbs. Her hoodoo is remarkably similar to the effects of Vianne's chocolates in Chocolat. These elements are fantastic, but I don't feel like they served any actual purpose to the plot whatsoever. They seem merely to be there to make the setting more vibrant.Actually, the only real plot seems to involve Bonaventure's father. William dies before Bonaventure's birth, shot by a mysterious, insane man. His mother and wife are trying to allay their guilt, the former by trying to figure out the identity of his killer. Meanwhile, William, in some sort of purgatory, watches over his family, and communicates with his son. The whole book seems mostly to be about him moving on to the next world. Rather than magical realism, this is much more of a ghost story.What lost me, most heartily though, was all of the Christianity in the novel. No, it's not preachy, but it's incredibly boring. As I said, I couldn't be bothered about the backstory of the grandmothers, and their pasts are all wrapped up in their fervent religious beliefs. Every character isn't Christian, and it doesn't seem like Leganski's trying to say anything about it, but I just had no fucks to give about any of it. Like so much else in the novel, I just don't see why I had to sit through all of that when it doesn't seem to have had a big impact on the plot overall.The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow is a gorgeously-written novel, but suffers from a weak plot that tries to do too many things without tying them together. I might read more Leganski someday, but this one did not work for me."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8772431-lori", "userReview": "I won this book from GoodReads!

And that's despite the easy read and yet beautiful language of the writing flow.First of all, I'm beginning to abhor magic realism. Not dislike. In our all too real world it's starting to feel not only silly, but mostly sappy to the point of dangerously dissociative. But just like the Dicken's orphans or other pure innocents of good intention fused with inborn wisdom, there does exist an audience (endlessly in all eras) for these extremely sweet and saccharine idealistic models. Or magically so in some regard of their identities. Pollyanna with super skills! And I can completely understand the attachment and their enjoyment of fairy tales. On top of it I wanted to hear much more about Trinidad than I wanted to hear about The Wanderer or his sorry tale.

This debut novel which is steeped in magical realism in a rich, Louisiana setting provides a charmingly entertaining read. The Southern flair and hints of magic function impressively well to make this book such an absorbing read. That Southern setting and flair is all the more impressive considering the author currently resides in the Chicagoland area and grew up in Wisconsin - hardly Bayou country. But the heavy-handed narration and the lush setting combine to create a really entertaining and lovely book.Leganski\u2019s style pays homage to Alice Hoffman (Hoffman is even listed in the \u201cbonus\u201d materials as one of Leganski\u2019s favourite authors), but this novel is a lot more enjoyable and skillfully put together than the last few Hoffman novels that I have read.

It will be one of those book-moments that haunt me forever. I tear up as I type this, just remembering that part of the story.I also loved the gris-gris scene. I must have read it over a handful of times before I moved on to the rest of the story.So powerful and lovely. Unique.I'd sure love to meet this lady Rita Leganski, someday, just to tell her in person how much I adored her Bonaventure Arrow.-- DBC"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607944-julie", "userReview": "I LOVE this book. It is a darling lyrical gem of beautiful language and gentle philosophy about how the characters deal with the currents in their lives. I remember thinking that the author must have had so much fun coming up with images for the things Bonaventure could hear. I am so glad I listened to the audible version; the narrator, Maggi-Meg Reed, was perfect and found distinct voices for the characters. I wish they had cast her to read the Hunger Games trilogy. I am adding this one to my favorites list and will look for more from Ms Leganski. One of the themes in this book is forgiveness, a favorite topic of mine. I especially like this passage, which comes toward the end of the book: \"The words fell all around her then like a kind and curing rain: Father, forgive them; they know not what they do. Right there and then, Letice Arrow knew in absolute clarity that forgiveness is unconditional; it is complete in and of itself and always rises above the facts.\""}, {"userName": "Elizabeth\u262e ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth", "userReview": "The protagonist is Bonaventure Arrow who can hear better than most people, but doesn't use his voice to share what he knows.The story revolves around Bonaventure's life without his father. His mother and his paternal grandmother raise him in 1950's Louisiana. There is healing that needs to be done on everyone's part (except for Bonaventure) and the unfolding of these story lines is done with congruity.I love the characters here and I love the lessons of acceptance and moving through grief to the other side and healing.

I couldn't put the book down. Some individuals may find fault with it for the way it \"suspends reality\" in giving Bonaventure powers of super-natural hearing. But having grown up with a father who was raised in the deep South, I know that the culture there sees things differently. Hearing about my dad's childhood, I learned that most people were quite religious, yet there was a belief in the ability of potions to cure or do harm, and visits were made to soothsayers to find missing items. This was an accepted part of his childhood. And so, for me, the idea that Bonaventure has incredible hearing, and other characters in the book have strange ways of doing things, was not unacceptable, but just an example of the culture.The way that Rita Leganski approaches Bonaventure's hearing, and her descriptions of what he learns as he listens to things, is incredibly lyrical and beautiful. It is some of the best writing I have ever read. I was impressed!The story is a romance, a coming-of-age story, and at the same time, a mystery about the happenings of Bayou Cymbaline and the identity of the wanderer and the reasons things occurred. It was so compelling. I had a difficult time putting the book down. The descriptions of the characters and the day to day life in the small town were fascinating. I was able to recognize why my father grew up feeling that there was a magic, another dimension to his childhood. It was verified when I read Rita Leganski's words. I have read other individual's reviews of THE SILENCE OF BONAVENTURE ARROW, and I believe they are wrong to assign a political leaning to the description of Leticia's experience in New Orleans. It's merely a description of the culture--the inability of people to fit into a society where black women were loved by white men, but not recognized by them as being equal. This is a book about the 1950's, a time when there was no equality of the races, and yet there was still that longing to be equal, to be accepted. There was also bitterness when one was rejected because of race.But that is a side issue in the story. Bonaventure is really about the magic of one boy's ability to hear all that the world has to offer. It's about his goodness, and his inability to harm anyone or anything. It's not a religious story, even though some characters in the book are religious. Rather, it shows hypocrisy, and the harm it can bring. And most of all, the healing that honesty and love can give.My congratulations to Rita Leganski!"}, {"userName": "Luanne Ollivier", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1621569-luanne-ollivier", "userReview": "I've been hearing things - good things - about Rita Leganski's debut novel The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow. And, after the first few chapters I have to agree wholeheartedly. I have my favourite genres, but sometimes there's something about the description of a book or the opening lines that grabs me and I just know that this is going to one of those special books that stays with me. Until I lend it out - because I'll definitely be recommending this one.\"Bonaventure Arrow didn't make a peep when he was born, and the doctor nearly took him for dead. But the child was only listening, placing sound inside quiet and gaining his bearings because everything had suddenly changed. His silence gave pause to the experts who examined him; here was a curiosity beyond their expertise. (They could never have explained Bonaventure anyway because there is no scientific word for miraculous.) They didn't know that through his remarkable hearing he would bring salvation to the souls of those who loved him.\"With those few opening pages, I felt like I was sitting down to hear a storyteller spin a magical yarn of what could be... or who knows - what is. I was entranced by the idea of a boy who could hear what inanimate objects were saying, their stories, hearing the unspoken sorrow and sadness, the joy and pain of people's lives, the sound of everything.\"Bonaventure Arrow had been chosen to bring peace. There was guilt to be dealt with, and poor broken hearts, and atonement gone terribly wrong. And too there were family secrets to be heard; some of them old and all of them harmful.I really don't want to say much more about the plot - it's just so much better to have it unfold before your own eyes.The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow is not a book to be rushed through; instead it should be savoured and enjoyed. Leganski's writing flows so easily. Her prose are beautiful and lyrical, and I often went back to read them a second time. The love between Bonaventure's parents was beautifully depicted. I very much enjoyed Leganski's descriptions of what Bonaventure hears. It's a nudge to remind us to stop and listen - and not simply hear. The book is set in 1950's New Orleans and I was fascinated by the setting, culture, description and exploration of the city, but also of hoodoo, voodoo and Catholicism. Leganski weaves a unique and magical tale exploring love, loss, guilt, forgiveness and redemption in an utterly unique and magical voice. A fantastic debut and an easy recommendation. Fans of Alice Hoffman and Sarah Addison Allen would enjoy this novel."}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081099-aimee", "userReview": "Magical realism has become my favorite genre and this book by Rita Leganski is a perfect example of why I enjoy it so much. This book is filled with love, faith, secrets, voodoo, and magic that feels very believable in this touching story. Bonaventure Arrow stole my heart from the very beginning of this story and I loved how he could not talk but could hear so much. Some of the most beautiful sections of the book are the ones that describe the wondrous things that Bonaventure can hear.Bonaventure has a good life living with his mother Dancy who adores him and his father's mother Letice who also loves him very much. Their is a sense of sadness that lives in the house also though because of the loss of Dancy's husbanad and Bonaventure's father William in a terrible shooting right before Bonaventure was born. The book was so interesting to read with the love that all three have for one another living along with the sadness and guilt that Dancy and Letice cannot let go of.Bonaventure's father also cannot let go and his spirit is constantly in the house, the only one that knows he is there is Bonaventure who can talk to him in his own special way. William realizes he needs to do a few things before he can go to heaven and he needs Bonaventure's help. The two of them work together to bring healing to their family.I can honestly say that this is one of the most moving books I have ever read. It is beautifully written and I loved how Leganski took so many different lives and wove them all together into a beautiful story about love, loss, and forgiveness. I know I will be thinking about this book for a long time and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories of families with a little magic put in to make a really wonderful story."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "This book is truly magical, and I'm so glad that I took the time to read it. It's unlike any other book that I've ever read. Little Bonaventure Arrow is a wonderful creation and even though there is a lot of magic, mystery, unexplained happenings, supernatural occurences, voodoo and hoodoo in this book, he is so realistic and so very loveable. The setting is a little place called Bayou Cymbaline in the 1950's. I love the deep south references throughout the book and the glimpse it gives into the rich Creole and Louisiana culture. I love the characters that live in this book. I just loved the book for the wonderful story, and for the sense of hope and happiness that permeates throughout. This is a book that reminded me of why I am such a bookaholic. Bonaventure is born from sadness, but there is so much hope and promise emanating from this one little boy. His father was shot down by an apparent stranger just before Bonaventure makes his entry into the world. This sudden violent act forever changes Bonaventure's mother and grandmother, and shapes Bonaventure's life. Bonaventure cannot speak, but his ability to hear and understand is beyond any normal human's. Even though he's only seven he manages to determine what the old buried secrets are that have hampered his mother and grandmother from living a normal, happy life. Bonaventure, along with a wonderful black woman called Trinidad, work together to heal these old wounds and to provide hope for these two women. A truly magical story that will leave me forever touched. If you love to read, then you absolutely must read this enchanting book."}], "description": "Conceived in love and possibility, Bonaventure Arrow didn\u2019t make a peep when he was born, and the doctor nearly took him for dead.

Growing up in the big house on Christopher Street in Bayou Cymbaline, Bonaventure can hear flowers grow, a thousand shades of blue, and the miniature tempests that rage inside raindrops. He can also hear the gentle voice of his father, William Arrow, shot dead before Bonaventure was born by a mysterious stranger known only as the Wanderer.Bonaventure's remarkable gift of listening promises salvation to the souls who love him: his beautiful young mother, Dancy, haunted by the death of her husband; his Grand-mere Letice, plagued by grief and long-buried guilt she locks away in a chapel; and his father, William, whose roaming spirit must fix the wreckage of the past.
