David was the sole survivor from his town Fall Creek and he joins as a civilian consultant, able to share his experiences to help in training. But as the situation deteriorates, the teams face more danger and the possibility that they might not win this war.Isn't that just a great book cover? As soon as I saw it I knew it was about zombies and that I wanted to read it. The book follows David as he struggles to survive a zombie outbreak in his town, losing his fiancee' Rebecca. It is only the intervention of an armed military unit that saves his life, prompting the setting up of elite zombie fighting units. With nothing left in his town, David agrees to be a consultant on the first team, helping them to adapt their fighting skills based on what he saw and experienced.We follow the progress of the team as they get to know each other and train, which is good for character development as we soon learn to care about these people. It makes things very tense when they start being sent out on small missions that often turn out to be more complicated and deadly than first thought. Zombies of course are not predictable in real life circumstances and the group soon witness this for themselves. They also have to face in fighting on the base when a prejudiced man on one team starts to cause problems when he discovers that another man is gay. I didn't enjoy seeing Reynolds, my favourite character, being verbally abused by this scumbag but this kind of prejudice is sadly too common in society as a whole.The romance part of the plot is probably going to divide opinion. Those of you who follow my reviews know that I don't really like seeing romance in my zombie apocalypse when we could instead be focusing more on the zombies. Personally I didn't mind the romances in this book as I liked all of the characters. I think it was to be expected that this team who train together every day on base and then fight together, are going to have very strong emotional bonds to each other that sometimes flow over into physical relationships. I get that and I accepted it in the plot only because I liked the characters. It is very much a story about people, who happen to be doing a pretty extraordinary job.There is an element of Day of the Dead about this, with a captive zombie being kept to assist in the training and research, something that very much divides opinion. We can see a bit of mad science going on and not everyone on the base is putting the welfare of the soldiers first. Would you like to be secured in a base where an actual zombie was being held? You know that these things never end well! The reader can also tell quite quickly that certain people involved in the military program are not to be trusted and that there is more going on with this plot than meets the eye. What exactly is going on and who is involved?The teams become aware that each mission is getting more dangerous and the commanders indicate that they are going to lose control of the overall situation. All the teams can do is try to kill as many zombies as they can while the government prepares military bunkers for the chosen few to hole up in until it is deemed safe to come back out and deal with the aftermath. And as the ordinary people realise what is happening, they are getting ready to rebel. The element of a sort of countdown clock to oblivion adds a whole new element to the plot.This book was a bit more complex than the usual gory zombie plot and I liked that it had a bit of depth, and that we really find the time to get to know the squad before they are sent out to tackle the zombies. That said, the zombie scenes are of the standard you would expect with a nice mix of tension and horror. There was plenty to like about this book and I look forward to the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "Full review on my blog: http://theaussiezombie.blogspot.com/The Dying of the Light: End starts with a prologue about David, who I would consider to be the main character of the book and a run-down of some recent US zombie outbreaks and how they were contained by the military. Fast forward a year, and David is recruited into the secret military group that is responsible for containing and covering-up zombie outbreaks.There is not a lot of zombie action in this book \u2013 the story is centered on the secret military group charged with keeping the outbreaks under wraps and the forming of their relationships, both positive and negative. Although the book is heavily militaristic in setting, it\u2019s not an overkill of talking about tactics, guns and other weapons \u2013 these are all, naturally, mentioned and explained, but for the reader who (like me) doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy this kind of stuff, there\u2019s no skimming required as the information is kept to the necessary minimum. There\u2019s also some information about the virus itself, which is interesting but not excessive.The Dying of the Light: End, does read a little like a movie script \u2013 it reminded me of Starship Troopers to be honest, but with far less battle scenes. The dialogue is a little cheesy in some places, but not overly so, and the characters that should be likeable are, and the ones that shouldn\u2019t be are not (no cheering on the baddies here). The POV does shift from David in the first person to other characters in the third person, which can be a little confusing.There are some emotional scenes, one had me particularly misty-eyed, but the overall feeling of this book is that it is a set-up of characters and relationships for the next book. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you\u2019re looking for a whole lot of zombie-killing brain-munching heart-skipping action, you may find this book slightly disappointing. I did like this one, quite a lot, and will be looking forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Natasa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5392188-natasa", "userReview": "I'm glad I gave another freebie a go. It was an ok read I guess, I would probably even read the sequel. I didn't particularly like the writing style, maybe the reason is that this is the first book by this author, I don't know...I certainly hope it will improve. Some scenes were also a bit unbelievable, but who am I to judge. I obviously endured till the end. It was interesting for a change to read a book where you follow the downfall of the humanity, being overwhelmed by zombies. Usually you get into the story where the zombies are already there (or I was just lucky enough to bump into these books). All in all, it was an ok read and if I get a chance to read the sequel, I will...especially as it seems that this 2nd book was Top 5 Finalist in Kindle Book Review's \u201cBest Indie Books of 2013\u201d competition."}, {"userName": "Susanna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2899247-susanna", "userReview": "It was okayI am sure it is not the book at fault for a 3 star rating. And I almost didn't rate it at all. This book was well written, had a good story. But I just did not care for all the military talk. The weapons didn't matter to me, either.I hated Gardner the moment he entered the book, and that says something about the author. He manages to make his readers get emotionally involved. I teared up at the end. I had to take a small break at each important death and I loved the main character and all the hell he went through. It was written very well.I hated the jumping around in point of view in the same chapter. Sometimes i didn't know which character POV I was reading. After a few lines I could figure it out, then a few paragraphs later it changed again.

Trust me there is only so many times you want to read the same in-depth explanation of such and such gun/ammo - some books have ended up reading more like a firearms manual than fiction!Upon finishing this book I have immediately purchased book 2 - I can't wait to see what happens next to the characters, with that said though I think I will read something else in-between, purely because I get so caught up in this book and what's happening that I end up reading until the very early hours of the morning (oh hello sunrise again"}, {"userName": "P.W.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9337058-p-w", "userReview": "Not a bad read if you dig the zombie genre.

The life he has built with his fiance Rachel and stepson Eric becomes nothing more than memories in a few hours. It through this tragedy he becomes acquainted with the US Army, and signs on to fight the newest threat to humanity: zombies. Blake is thrust into the world of tactics and weapons, finding that perhaps on the front lines is just where he belongs, not in a small town selling literature. Kristopher created an interesting universe with his first novel The Dying of the Light: End. Zombies are a real threat, the governments are working together to save man kind using elite fighting platoons and prions (you know, those proteins that are responsible for mad cow disease) are the cause for zombies. Essentially, Kristopher gives zombie literature a new way to categorize zombies: something in the realm of virology, which I can definitely get on board with. The author also includes links to prion research, and various zombie literature for the curious reader (suggested reading!). Although I was fascinated with the biological basis of zombie-infection, I found that the fresh point of view that Kristopher uses is also very relevant to the rebooting of zombie literature foundations. Blake is a man who is part of a ubber secret group of men and women who covertly attempt to stem off infection. Who are the people who are willing to risk their lives without anyone knowing? How do those on the front lines of the epidemic feel, react and manage such a monumental task? Instead of focusing on the Average Joe, Kristopher blazes ahead where most zombie fiction only treads lightly. Fantastic!This being said, why not a full 5 stars? Kristopher holds out the proverbial carrot for far too long. The introduction of the villain, the villain's plans and the catalyst to tie Blake to him all revealed far to too late into the story. The emergence of the villain alone took far too long to capture interest. I honestly felt the book started far too slow, and the ending took far too long. This being said, this also contributed to the world building which was important for the story to continue. The twist also happened fairly late, being almost tacked on mid-climax and was mentioned again only briefly in the end. It would have been a great idea to weave this revelation into the story post climax to keep the reader enticed by what the second book has to offer. Obviously, these are mistakes that Kristopher made while writing his first book, and cannot be reflected in his later work.Side note: this book can get cheesy. \"Damn you. Damn you straight hell\" and \"We will not go quietly into the night\" do appear and it certainly took away from the believability of the story. Of course, I just hate cheesy lines like that in non-satirical literature!In the end, if you're into the zombie literature craze, or like a good military-apocalyptic novel, you should check out this book - it takes a new spin and focuses on the lesser known elements in apocalyptic literature and zombie catastrophes. Ill definitely be reading book two, and cannot stress enough how fantastic it would be if Kristopher wrote a book concerning the rapid fall of civilization once the existence of zombies were made public."}, {"userName": "A.K. Klemm", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7345095-a-k-klemm", "userReview": "I don't generally read or watch a lot of zombie material. When everyone was on that craze, I was not. But I do love a good zombie story. Usually when in the mood I go on a Resident Evil binge. One of my all time favorite movies (top twenty anyway) is 28 Days Later, the first time I saw it I was impressed by the cinematography and the choice in music made me cry it was so lovely. I chuckled and snickered all the way through reading Pride & Prejudice & Zombies and just recently I was introduced to the movie Warm Bodies and absolutely loved it.So even though the zombie craze isn't entirely my thing - I'm not ignorant of the genre and I do enjoy it. I existed in the house when my husband was watching The Walking Dead, he watched too many episodes without me to follow the whole show, but now reading The Dying of the Light I feel like I got the better end of the stick.Kristopher's work is both an easy breezy read as well as an involved and intricate apocalypse novel. Current events are tied into the possibilities - which is always the best way to build a dystopian or apocalyptic world, in my opinion. The characters are real, the main one appropriately both strong and sappy. (Without a little bit of nostalgia and romance, what in God's name would anyone want to save?)Of course, that's always the best part of an end of the world story - it's why millions have fallen in love with Doctor Who. Any fight to the death for a whole world must involve a story of humanity and what it means to be human. Jason Kristopher pulls this off well, without overwhelming the casual reader with too much intensity.After reading several books lately that involve a lot of plodding and lengthy prologues (from biographies to novels), Jason Kristopher's opening sentence \"I didn't see Rebecca die the second time\" was just the clincher I needed to jump into a refreshingly fast paced story.I'm looking forward to Interval, the next book in the series.Read my full review/discussion here: http://anakalianwhims.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Ben Erickson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7376627-ben-erickson", "userReview": "I'll admit right up front: I was really skeptical going into this book. I've grown largely tired of the Zombie genre lately as we constantly have more and more just plain bad media thrown at us. Until this point, the only saving grace for me was the We're Alive radio drama. Now there's two. This book is an absolute delight. It's been a while since I've read a book where I instantly clicked with the characters, where I felt that I -knew- them, where I felt their joys... and their tragedies sharply. I'm man enough to admit that it's been a while since I cried while reading a book. That's what you're in for with Jason Kristofer's The Dying of the Light: End. It starts off at a dead sprint and only picks up speed until it's a runaway locomotive by the end. The novel follows David Blake, a civilian book store owner from the fictional town of Falls Creek Colorado, as his entire world is turned upside down, inside out, and eviscerated as an outbreak of a threat that is straight out of a monster movie claims the lives of everyone he knows and loves. Rescued by a combination of his own skills as well as his timely arrival at a military camp, he picks up the broken pieces of his life as he is asked to join a secret task force that will be humanity's last line of defense against the threat of \"the walkers.\" Though even the gathered strength of the walking dead isn't as bad as the evil that humans are capable of working...Jason Kristofer masterfully blends military fiction with that of the zombie apocalypse, yielding a genre that I was unfamiliar with, but unknowingly had been waiting for for a long time. He utilizes a lot of time and location jumps to keep the action moving, which was jarring at first, but I quickly grew accustomed to, and towards the end I couldn't put the book down. I needed to know what was going to happen in the next chapter, and the one after that... and the one after that, witnessing humanity's spiraling descent towards their own destruction. Absolutely worth picking up. I can't wait for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665393-rob", "userReview": "I enjoyed the overall story here. New take on the cause and history of zombies and most of the tale was about the human interactions and relationships, using the zombies as a driving force behind the story but not so much on screen action. Which is a good thing to me, as a huge fan of Romero's work.The author uses an interesting mix of first person (with the main character) and third (when the action focuses on anyone else). The story keeps a good pace, only lagging as things begin to wrap up towards the end. There is a good core group of main characters, fairly well developed and easy to care about.On the negative side, the military organization is horrible. The scale of fraternization amongst the members would never be tolerated in the actual US Armed Forces, yet in this book it is actually *encouraged*!!? The support characters feel incredibly flat and stereotyped. The 'homophobic' Ames is offensive, not so much because of his prejudice, but because he is such a cliched redneck. To the point of being ready to kill a man because he is gay... then he has a COMPLETE reversal and 5 minutes after having this man in his sights (literally) he is saying 'Oh, sorry I was such a jerk before. You're totally cool and I was wrong all the years that I hated you'.Editorially, there are some glaring issues with the kindle version that, as far as I can tell, don't exist in my hardcopy of the book. These are repeated words or lines where punctuation was changed or persons/units being talked about were swapped out, however the new text ended up being inserted with the old instead of replacing it. This is a fairly minor annoyance in most places where it is an isolated occurrence, but there are places where entire passages are riddled with these repeated words and it gets to be a bit distracting.I'd love to give this book 4 stars, as I really did enjoy the read. Minor issues add up though, and three it gets (possibly a weak 3.5)."}, {"userName": "Sift Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5059563-sift-book-reviews", "userReview": "I took a bit of a chance on this book because it I thought it might be a little too outlandish for my taste, and boy am I glad that I gave it a shot.

The cover art is gorgeous. Oliver Wetter, did a fantastic job and I have a feeling that many people will be attracted to this story by the cover alone. My intrigue didn't end there. Just a few pages past the cover, Jason Kristopher provides two very useful lists. The first is a list of notable characters, and it is followed immediately by a list of acronyms used throughout the book. I often have trouble remembering all the characters whenever there are more than about 5 major ones. This list of characters really helped refresh my memory when a character would reappear. Being a military story, there were also quite a few uncommon acronyms used throughout the book. Having the list at the beginning of the book allowed me to easily flip back instead of having to find the page in which each acronym was first introduced.See the in-depth review at Sift: http://www.siftreviews.com/2012/02/dy...Review by: Kevin of Sift Book ReviewsSift Book Reviews received a free copy for review from the author.

At first the zombie threat is kept a closely guarded secret, the team goes in, clears the zombies, and a cover story is given through the media. However, the outbreaks are getting bigger and more frequent. Underground bunkers have been built to protect some survivors and perpetuate the human race.

Part of the reason could be that you're expecting a large portion of them to become zombies and die on you so I suspect part of the detachment is self preservation.Despite that fact, I found this to be a surprisingly good book. I equate it to what Batman Begins did for the Batman genre (or perhaps the superhero genre as a whole.) The facts in this book are done very well with very few inconsistencies as far as logic goes.

Kristopher tries to subvert this convention by constantly commenting that the character is a \"spy movie villain,\" but simply pointing out that your character is a total clich\u00e9 doesn't excuse him from being a clich\u00e9.

It's the first of three books and I didn't like it well enough to read the other two."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33610967-ken", "userReview": "Dying of the lightThis was a very good book. I enjoyed it a lot, the character development was very good and the plot flowed very well. It has some twists and turns along the way but was entertaining. I this 5 stars because it was very well told and did not center around just one character which should missing from a lot the books in this genre. I will give one criticism in that this could stand one editing review. It is still very well written but could stand a few more checks as well as linking the table of contents in the ebook."}, {"userName": "Dave Poll", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25589488-dave-poll", "userReview": "An amazing first book in this genrefirst an amazing read, excellent character development as well as group development. the story was superbly written I've never experienced such a tightly portrayed or more emotionally tied together group of characters. I consider Jason's writing to be on a par with the writing in the TV show \" THE WALKING DEAD \". the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. An absolutely must read if you're a fan of this great genre!!!!!"}, {"userName": "George Wright", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6635194-george-wright", "userReview": "A fresh approach to the zombie genre.Premise: The government has been covering up zombie outbreaks since President Ulysses Grant\u2019s administration, but now the entire world is being overrun with them. The zombie apocalypse is not coming, it\u2019s already here! The book follows a Special Forces military group called AEGIS (which by no coincidence is the name of the shield that bore Medusa\u2019s head in the Iliad). This group attempts to suppress the rise of \u2018walkers\u2019 but time is running out \u2013 great suspense without having to wade through a lot of 'zombie-gore'."}, {"userName": "Michael Tuccillo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8283123-michael-tuccillo", "userReview": "Youll like this one!This book has likeable characters and the main character is someone you want to root for to succeed. Based on a special unit who is fighting zombie outbreaks throughout the country, we join a fighting force of good people trying to stem the inevitable, a total collapse of society overrun with zombies! I really like how the writer ties in events that occur today involving military action as a cover for the real problem in the book's narrative universe. I give this writer 5 STARS for a good and clever book!"}, {"userName": "Tracey Wiseman", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34527939-tracey-wiseman", "userReview": "Definitely a page turner!Well written, with a story line that is frighteningly believable. The flow is at times a little stumbling , with such a large character base, but it is never a matter of \"the writing getting in the way of the story.\" Only an occasional double check on names. The end did appear a bit rushed, though, after so much even paced flow. All in all, it was a great read and I can't wait to begin book 2. Fans who enjoy the stories of the living as well as the zombies will like this."}, {"userName": "Dennis Calloway", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40113478-dennis-calloway", "userReview": "I just finished reading Jason Kristopher's \"The Dying Of The Light - End\" and it was an enjoyable read! I'm a die-hard zombie fan and I was looking forward to Jason's take on the \"zombie apocalypse\", and he didn't fail to entertain. The zombie historical background, the slow buildup of tension and the inevitable conclusion were very well written. I'm looking forward to reading the next book, \"The Dying Of The Light - Interval\"!
