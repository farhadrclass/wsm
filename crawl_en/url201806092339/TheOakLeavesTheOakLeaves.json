This is a inspirational/Christian novel - I only came by it because I met the author, Maureen Lang, at a conference, and she's a super nice person. I put off reading it for a while because I was afraid it would be like Christian pop music - not quite as good as regular pop, with a lot more God thrown in - but I was pleasantly surprised. The bulk of the novel takes place in Victorian England, and was not terribly different than reading a Jane Austen book. I didn't connect quite as well with the Contemporary Chicago setting - those were the parts where, near the end, the discussion of faith sort of crossed my eyes. In the end, it was a compelling story, well told, and not overly preachy, even for someone outside of the target audience."}, {"userName": "Margaret Chind", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226769-margaret-chind", "userReview": "I read the first chapter of this book online several weeks ago, and was finally able to get it from inter-library loan this past week. I started the book last night, and could not put it down. I did sleep, but once I woke up this morning, I did not even get on my computer. I just read, stopped to make a PB&J and read. It is now almost four in the afternoon and I am finished. Maureen Lang has quite the affinity for story telling. I was completely entranced by the family heritage story that she was unrolling and could not stop until there was no more. (I'm glad there is a sequel!) As a genealogist myself, I'm very interested in learning of other peoples adventures into their heritage through newspaper entries, letters, or in this case an old diary. Natalie, or Talie as everyone calls her is the modern mom of America. She attends her contemporary church with her husband and enjoys having her mother and sister near. Mom and baby's social group turns out to be less than she expected... and then she finds a box of heirlooms including a diary. The family legacy lies within the pages and it is not what Talie expected, but it turns out to be a curse that Lord can make into a blessing. Other than genealogy, at one time I fancied a future as a nurse and genetics is something else that I have found intriguing. This story is one that all families should read. If something comes at you that seems terrible, there is a chance that there is good to come from it. Look for your lemonade in your lemons, and your blessings in your supposed curse."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane", "userReview": "Where I got the book: free on Kindle at publisher's discretion. Maureen is a friend in real life.This inspirational novel has an alternating-chapter two-story structure, the linking factor being the genetic ties between the two female protagonists, Talie in the modern day and Cosima in the 19th century. But in this novel genetics don't just mean familial ties; the Fragile X gene runs through the two women's family giving rise to cognitively disabled children.This setup would be bound to get me interested from the start, since I too have a child affected by a genetic disorder that causes a cognitive disability--although in our case there's been a \"random mutation\" rather than a hereditary disorder. The parallel structure of the novel allows the reader to explore changing attitudes toward disability and timeless questions of faith within a story that manages not to lay any of its themes down with too heavy a hand. It's definitely a Christian novel--I've noted that some reviewers found the Christian slant hard to deal with--but to anyone who is at all familiar with or receptive to the Christian faith, there are some thought-provoking insights into the nature of love and trust.I found myself more drawn, at first, to the modern story because I identified with the characters' fear and confusion as they realize that a happy little boy is simply not progressing, intellectually speaking, beyond babyhood. I was nodding my head--oh yes, been there done that--at so many of the steps through denial, anger, grief and acceptance as they gradually grasp that the unthinkable has in fact happened to them. (Until it does happen, disabled children are generally on the periphery of your awareness!) It rang true because it's written from experience, although I wish I'd had the faith perspective back then.The 19th-century story grew on me gradually; it came across as less real to me partly because it's a fairly straightforward romance plot, partly because it's set among the aristocracy and it's difficult to pull that world off on paper unless you're personally pretty familiar with it. Forms of address often give the writer away, and if anyone has a solid reference for writers about the nuances of class in British society, please speak up. In this instance the high-society setting had a point, because to a family expected to produce leaders of the country a less-than-able heir would be a considerable problem (although, from what I've read in and in between the lines, because of inbreeding it happened far more often than advertised). After a bit I warmed to this story line, mainly because Peter, the hero, was very nicely rounded out as a character with a lot more going for him than just being the inevitable broad-shouldered hunk. Also, Cosima's dilemma--revealing a genetic disorder that in those days was seen as a curse or stigma--was pretty interesting as far as obstacles to true love go. The one character who really didn't work for me was the rotter Reginald, Cosima's sort-of fianc\u00e9; I had the worst time understanding his motives and at one point found myself wondering whether he had a gay crush on Peter. I was wrong, of course; not that kind of novel.All in all I found The Oak Leaves to be quite a page-turner and a whole lot more substantial than many inspirational romances, hence the four stars."}, {"userName": "Shari Larsen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2751691-shari-larsen", "userReview": "This story weaves together two time periods - Regency England and modern day Chicago. Talie Ingram finds an old journal that belong to her great great great grandmother Cosima Escott. While reading through it, Talie discovers a family \"curse\"; children born with what was called in those days \"feeblemindedness\", but was really the result of a genetic disorder called Fragile-X. Talie finds this news very unsettling, as she has noticed developmental delays in her own son, but she is not ready to face her fears, so tucks the journal away to keep the secret away from her husband and her sister. Her husband urges her to keep reading it though, and through Cosima's faith in God, she finds her own strength to do what she has to do to help her son.I really enjoyed this story, it was very intriguing, especially Cosima's story; she is determined not to marry because of the curse, but then she falls in love and that of course complicates things. The dialogue and the emotions in the story feel very real, and that is because the author herself has a son who has Fragile -X syndrome. The story not only captured the trials and tribulations of living with a special needs child, but the joys too."}, {"userName": "Jen Hayes", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2347023-jen-hayes", "userReview": "Can't wait to read this - I've been recently going through all of my grandmother's photos and journals and am so awed but how much I'm learning about her and her ancestors, my family and myself! Thanks for the introduction to this book!OK, now that I've read it, how the heck did I miss the reviews that discuss the Christian part of this book? This is considered Christian writing. In fact, there's probably not a page that doens't mention God, or his blessedness, or god's grace, or doesn't have someone praying or knealing. I have no problem with spiritual writings - I love to get flavors of all cultures & religions, but I just felt this was a lot more than an introduction to it, or a 'flavor' of it, and in several intances, it was, in my opinion, totally out of place and contrived. I am not into being religious just to be religious, with no emotional backing to it, and I felt that this was the literary version of that style.Half of the book is of modern-day Talia, half the book is about her family in Ireland in the 1800's. I liked the Ireland part (I miss reading my Jane Austin and Madame Bovary).

It looked like another run-of-the-mill Christian chick-flick. But, after seeing the high ratings I thought I would give it a try. I was completely stunned by the depth presented in this book. The realistic characters grapple with some very difficult questions about suffering and pain and along the way discover some answers that are both satisfying and deeply encouraging. Maureen Lang weaves a story that is quite gripping with many twists and turns, alternating between two time periods and two branches of the same family. Although the two time periods are quite different, and the contrast is a bit jarring at times, the issues and emotions that the characters face in the two stories parallel and complement each other beautifully. This was a very inspiring book and helped me grow in my faith in God (something I think all Christian fiction should do). Many thanks to Maureen Lang for an thoughtful, uplifting piece of fiction."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511537-barbara", "userReview": "A very realistic fictional account of two different generations dealing with fragile x syndrome, the author skillfully goes back and forth between the past and the present. This story is definitely enhanced by the fact the author has a child with fragile x; she gives a great deal of interesting information about the syndrome in an interesting plot. The depths of love and what it can endure, the gamut of emotions a parent goes through when they find out their child's future will be different than what they envisioned, the innocence and joy a fragile x child can display, and the variety of reactions others will have, both good and harmful.

For some reason it was annoying in this novel. I preferred to stay in Cosima's world. Perhaps I didn't understand why the present day woman, couldn't accept the fact that her son was perhaps, not \"normal\". I thought our society was beyond that. And I have a disabled younger sister, so have never had a problem with people who are \"different.\" In fact, the longer I live, the more I think we are all \"different\". And some of us are worse off than someone with a diagnosed mental disability.So, it bothered me that she was as upset as she was as she was trying to figure out if her son was disabled. None of us know what we are going to get when we have children. Or in life for that matter. Isn't that the point? Take what you get, and do the best you can with it.

I should mention I picked it up only four days ago. Though I read it in an accumulation of probably less than two days. Crying kept causing a pause - to push book back and gather myself and utter some prayers and confessions and - it was rich and lovely. I was swept mainly by the 19th century storyline (this book alternates between current time (written in 2007) and the mid to late 1800s. It was the latter dealings where I found myself most engaged, though both families and story-lines were written well and with suspense of emotion and result and progression.  I enjoyed this very much! I chose this book (my first ever Maureen Lang book to read) due to the topic. I will contain no spoilers here, I will only say that it includes special needs children and adults and the effect of such on families. Having a special needs nephew, I was drawn instantly - curious to how this topic would be portrayed. One never knows if it will be handled in an appropriate, real manner.  Maureen succeeded on all accounts of presenting it truthfully, with emotion and honesty. She, herself, has first hand knowledge and my heart was right there with hers for being brave enough to spill pieces of herself on a page to allow others some understanding of that which most know very little about - and here I'm not referring to special needs as a broad whole (for sadly, I know many do have experience in such areas - broadly speaking) - but I speak of the specific disease she writes about to which her own son is diagnosed - fragile X syndrome. I, myself, have almost no knowledge at all of the specifics. I had heard of it, but beyond that, held little more. Read this. I highly recommend it. It's not \"cheesy Christian fiction\", for the emotions are not over the top, the responses to one another in relationship and interaction are believable. The faith is deep but not perfect (as is real life). Inspiring. I truly enjoyed it. *I should note I decided to read some of Maureen's earlier books because I am browsing for my next Tyndale book to review. A new one from Maureen is up as a contender, and I wanted to know a little more about her style before I committed to a choice. I'm glad I did.

A little like Morton's Forgotten Garden in that present day characters learn about themselves by looking into the lives' of their ancestors, but it's shorter, clips along at a much faster face as there is less to explore, just one journal to read through.The chapter alternates between a young modern family and the journal of the wife's great-great-great grandmother. The heart of the story is with the journal and these chapters take on the feel of a Jane Austen novel with their fancy dinners, holiday houses, and love story that always feels at the verge of not working out. The frame story of Talia worrying over her son's development, irritated by the history of a family \"curse\" of feeblemindedness she's just discovered in her ancestor's journal, is less developed, the character's flatter,* so the emotional journal of coming to her sons fragile x diagnosis is less impacting than the determined faith, love and patience shown by Cosima and Peter. *in the very beginning Talia talks about how happy she is to give up her pursuit of a career in higher education to be a wife/mother and supporter of her gorgeous architect husband. Um. Unrealistic. She seemed the stereotype of a shallow happy Christian and personally I've never met such a women - at least not by the time you get to that second cup of coffee/tea. Later on, once \"perfect world\" is shattered by fragile X, she becomes more real. I particularly loved the ways she explained the experience was like loosing a child. You have hopes/dreams/expectations for a child and then you realized you have to let go of that child, that child is gone. Instead, you have to learn to develop a new set of hopes and dreams for a different kind of child, a child you love, but now know will never become what you originally thought."}, {"userName": "Cafelilybookreviews", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643293-cafelilybookreviews", "userReview": "I can\u2019t remember where I first saw this book mentioned, but something about the cover made me want to read it. I had no idea what it was about or that the author Maureen Lang was writing this story from personal experience.I am so glad I read The Oak Leaves and consider it one of the best books I have ever found at my local library. I enjoyed the question and answer section in the back of the book, where Maureen talks about what inspired her to write this painful story. Although the story is based on fictional characters, Maureen\u2019s personal heartbreak is the backbone for the plot.The book intricately weaves the past, present and future of the main character Talie Ingram and centers around Talie\u2019s family tree and the secrets she discovers while researching it. Normally I am not a fan of books that go back and forth between the past and present because I find it confusing to keep up with, but Maureen did a great job of keeping everything sensible and easy to follow.I *felt* the characters emotions in this book and it was impossible to put down. I ached for them, hoped with them and found myself strangely attached to them by the end of the book! This story is about love \u2013 the ultimate kind of love that perseveres through heartbreak and less than perfect circumstances. As Maureen so eloquently writes it\u2019s about a love that survives \u201cAll and whatever.\u201d It is a beautiful, refreshing story of commitment and covenant between a man and a woman, who face hard choices.I LOVED this book!

It was different from most Christian fiction I have read so far. It alternated perspectives between modern-day Chicago and Victorian Britain, which sounds confusing, but it wasn't; the back-and-forth was handled very well. I'm really bad at writing reviews, so that's all I'm going to say!Historical inaccuracies:There is a major problem with titles in this book. Cosima's aunt and uncle should have been referred to as Lord and Lady X (X being the name of the dukedom; I don't think the book even said what it was). Her aunt should not have been called Lady Meg unless she herself was the daughter of a high-ranking peer. Even then, it probably would have been Lady Margaret, not Lady Meg. Cosima's grandmother should have been called the Dowager Duchess of X, not Dowager Merit or Lady Merit. Also, the name Merit is a male name, so I don't know why she was named that!Another big mistake is with the Hamilton family. Peter's father is a viscount, and is referred to as \"Lord Graham Hamilton, viscount\" several times. Peter is similarly referred to as Lord Peter or \"Lord Peter Hamilton, baron\". These are both very incorrect, and show the ignorance of the author on this subject. The Hamilton parents were usually referred to in the correct manner, Lord and Lady Hamilton (if Hamilton is the name of the viscounty). Peter should have been called Lord X (X being the name of the barony). He would never have been called Lord Peter. (If he was a younger son he would have been The Hon.

The book was long by around half it's current length! I mean, there's only so much repetition a reader can take! The already wafer thin story is stretched out, like some chewed up chewing gum that gets stuck on your shoe and refuses to come away no matter how much you pull. Yeah, disgusting analogy, I know, but you get my drift. I skipped entire pages of one character trying to 'convince' the next of something or the other. And, oh, I've heard sermons that are less preachy than this book. Excuse me if I'm just another non-saint human being who, once in a while, does get mad at God for throwing all these curve-balls my way.Insipid story, forgettable characters and boring narrative aside, some of the ideas/principles mentioned in the book are ones I'm strongly against.

Being in between books, this book seemed a good, quick read. And it was, quick and good but not great. The thing with what is known as Christian fiction is that, frequently, is just only good, rarely great. Once more this is true, at least in my opinion.The Oak Leaves is a book about Talie who brings home a box of memorabilia from his father's house with the intent of making some scrapbooks. In the box she discovers a journal. When she reads the journal, she finds a truth that will affect her life deeply and it will be very relevant for her life. The story is told alternating Talie's present day story with the story from the journal.The story is a good story and I enjoyed it. It was mind candy. Definitely. But, the dialogue is trite with each part that comes out of the character's mouth, sounding like a mini sermon you would hear in one of those mega-churches. Even the characters living in the 1800s, sounded so modern. Their conception of church and God so modern day. I don't know why Christian writers think that to be Christian a book has to mention God every single page. I guess there is a place in the book world for books like this. They put a flesh and blood perspective on a person's struggle to relate to and understand God. But, for me, if I want God in my literature, I stay with the great Catholic writers."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1138224-leanne", "userReview": "A moving story of a family learning to cope with the loss of the child they thought they had even as they love of the one God gave themone with fragile X syndrome, a genetically passed form of autism. There are two stories hereone in the present day where Talia tries to ignore the signs that her baby Ben is not like other children, and one in 1850s England where her ancestor, Cosima, expects to never marry because of the curse of feeblemindedness on her family. There is a love story here and a mystery and a lot of hope. Families dealing with any kind of cognitive challenge in a child will identify with the grief, the guilt, the questioning of Gods goodness, and the fear of what the future will be. The author includes information on fragile X, a tragic syndrome I had never heard of before this book.A journal is a somewhat clichd way to link the past and present, but Lang uses it effectively to introduce the chapters from Cosimas POV. She then moves into close third person to let us experience Talias great, great, great grandmothers life and learn from her insights. Talias chapters in the beginning would move slowly in their seeming ordinariness if we were not so certain that she is denying the devastating truth.

I've always been more of a historical fan, but Talie's story was boring. I didn't like the way she and her husband treated each other, and once she found out her son might be afflicted, she kind of fell apart, which I didn't care for.

Talie finds a journal written by her great-great-great grandmother (or how ever many greats it was) and learns that they had been cursed with feeble minded children. The story jumps back and forth between Talie and Cosima, the ancestor, and is quite well done. As the journal story unfolds, Talie is learning that her own son has problems. By the end of the book, she learns that her child has fragile X syndrome, which manifests symptoms similar to autism. As she learns how Cosima dealt with her issues, Talie finds the strength to deal with hers. The struggle with dealing with a child with special needs is well-done, as well as dealing with the issue of this being a genetic defect and the pain of knowing that other children could also be affected. Well worth a read."}, {"userName": "Olya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7160482-olya", "userReview": "This is a beautiful story, I didn't know what to expect when I first started but I was impressed right away how easy read it was and it did not confuse me.. This is a christian story or it does revolve around God and the Holy Bible. Its about two different story's that come together and they learn from each other, I think it was a perfect love story, one after another. I was deep into the story never bored out my mind..the character's were nice too. If there was a film on this book I would watch it.Now I do recommend this book for all ages, teens, adults. There is nothing in the book that you would think this is not right for a teen, anyways I don't want to say to much, you need to get this book and read it.. its great on a day where you want to just relax and take your mind off your troubles."}, {"userName": "Maribel reyes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5716506-maribel-reyes", "userReview": "This novel is almost like two stories in one, Talie(main character) finds an old diary and begins to read it, and in it she discovers a family history that she is not happy about. That secret in her family secret comes back and the victim is her young one year old son. What I liked about the way the book is written is that one chapter it is the account of Talie and the next chapter are sections (excerpts) from her ancestor, Cosima. It teaches people how to deal with problems that no one can fix and how to support each other as a family in hard time. This is not a hard read and not very long. It is also a very interesting story of love from the nineteenth century. I really encourage you to read this book, very good!"}, {"userName": "Lori Henrich", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5703400-lori-henrich", "userReview": "Talie Ingram was helping her mother go through some things in preparation for an up coming move. Talie brings home a box of things, including the family bible and what looks like a journal. As she is looking through the information written down in the bible she discovers that 5 people died at the same time. There is no other information so she decides to read the journal to see if there is a clue to what happened. She is taken back in time and the life of Cosmia unfolds. The information in the journal also helps her come to grips with a reality in her own little family.A very well written story that engages you from the first page. I just wish the parts of the journal that shows as handwritten would have been a bit easier to read. That is the only thing that bugged me."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1069993-melissa", "userReview": "This truly captured the slow process of realizing something isn't quite \"right\" with your child. Going from thinking he's just delayed to only seeing the things he does \"right\" and making excuses for all the other things he doesn't do.... Getting an evaluation , test, etc is best done early and not put off! It could put your mind at ease , better than wasting time worrying about what you do not know, and helping you to understand why your child is the way he is. One can sit around and say why me,but remember 1peter 5 6:7, and Proverbs 16:9.... Every creation is Gods and every creation has a plan, a purpose, we are not to worry about it but give it up to God to guide us all through life."}, {"userName": "Keely", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3884451-keely", "userReview": "I actually got this book as a free kindle book and read it for my 2013 A-Z title challenge. The synopsis of the story sounded very interesting, however, I had no idea it was christian fiction which is typically a genre I dont read. The story itself was pretty interesting, a little slow in places, but good enough to keep me wanting to read to find out how it would end. The beginning wasnt overly preachy, but the end was definitely getting there. I found myself starting to skim over these sections. Not a bad read. I did have a hard time with Reginald. His character didn't seem very developed and his story line not very believable. But other then that, this was an okay book."}], "description": "Two time periods\u2014Victorian England and contemporary Chicago\u2014are woven together when Talie Ingram finds an old journal belonging to her great-great-great grandmother, Cosima Escott.
