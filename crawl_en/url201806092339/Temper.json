Then I was lucky enough to get a super early version of this book to read and review. Which was awesome because as much as I was skeptical about LIFER, both Dani from Dani Reviews Things and I agreed we needed to read the rest of the series to find out what happened. And boy am I glad I did just that.Where I thought LIFER was your typical dystopian novel but too \"squished\" together to be unique, TEMPER blew it out of the water. The beginning 25% was a little slow for me and I found myself rolling my eyes at Asher's interactions with both brothers, but once the plot moved into what the story arc was for this book, it really shone.Everyone at camp is getting riled up over little things and it turns out that the Company was injecting the people of the Pelican with a serum that was keeping them well mannered, but now that they no longer are living on the Pelican, tempers (*wink wink*) are flaring and this is causing the Pelicanites (that's what I'm calling them now) to get so angry they want to beat on anyone and anything in sight. This is problematic for a lot of reasons. Asher volunteers to go to New City to get the serum from the Company with Davyd in tow; Samuai stays back to be the Pelicanite diplomat. And from here the story kicks into overdrive.I was constantly on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what would happen next. The best part of any story is being able to guess some of the plot points but be surprised by others. And boy did this one keep me guessing. There are so many twists and turns in this one, but the best part is that they all make sense. They don't come out of nowhere or have the reader saying \"Where did THAT come from?\"I thought Asher was much stronger this time. I liked that she was starting to question her feelings for both Dayvd and Samuai but kept coming back to the idea that she was her number one priority -- and her number one saviour. I can't wait to see where her story leads to next and what sort of conclusions she makes about what she should do for not only herself but also for her people. Because they are HER people.Samuai annoyed me at the beginning but I liked that he had to come to terms with his grief and also wasn't an epic douche by being honest with Megs that he couldn't be with her while he was still thinking about Asher. I am so glad that neither Asher nor Samuai jumped into a new relationship and acknowledged their lingering feelings for one another. And I thought Samuai's story made him all the more interesting. I was glad he had a storyline that I actually wanted to follow.The pacing and the story flowed so much better this time. I liked that the story picked up a couple weeks after the breakout because it made the tensions in the camp seem that much more believable. As well, I thought the dynamics of camp were interesting. I would have liked to see a bit more of Lady and her shenanigans because I think they will become important in the future for where the Pelicanites will eventually end up.I can't wait to see where this story concludes. If you're looking for a good science fiction read, I highly recommend this series. It is a bit slow to start but it picks up and leaves your heart racing until the very last page.Books and Ladders | Queen of the Bookshelves | Books Are My Fandom | Twitter | Instagram | Bloglovin'"}, {"userName": "Melanie McFarlane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29988282-melanie-mcfarlane", "userReview": "Even better than its predecessor LIFER , TEMPER had me chasing after truths and hoping for retribution. Back in the minds of Asher and Samuai, I found myself hating their counterparts, Megs and Davyd, at the start. But as the story progressed I felt sorry for Megs and starting to like Davyd. And though heart-wrenching, I'm glad Asher got an important truth at the end.The only thing I'm not looking forward to is waiting a year for the next book. I secretly hope Asher and Davyd break through their stubbornness and find a connection. There's so many questions I have about so many things! But now is not the time for spoilers!!

After continually coming up empty-handed, I began to despair that Lifer had been a stand-alone novel instead of the start of a series. Then, lo and behold, I got an invitation from Chapter By Chapter to participate in the Temper blog tour. Cue the \u201cHallelujah Chorus!\"Temper begins several weeks after the Lifers\u2019 and Fishies\u2019 escape from The Pelican. The camp the Lifers, Fishies, and Green Robes have established together is a simmering cauldron of fear, distrust, and tension. As Samuai notes, \u201cFreedom sounds great, until people who\u2019ve always lived a certain way are dragged kicking and screaming into a new way of life.\u201d Not only does each group have a very different opinion about how to proceed in their fight against the Company; they\u2019re also dealing with strange after-effects from the experiments the Company performed on them. Violent outbursts erupt and tempers flare at the slightest provocation; the camp is a simmering cauldron ready to boil over.In hopes of finding a cure for the strange behavioral changes, Asher and Davyd set off on a mission into the heart of Company territory. Samuai is left behind to keep the peace among the camp\u2019s factions until his brother and sweetheart return. This is a hard enough task in and of itself, but it proves even more challenging when Samuai discovers that the Green Robes have been keeping secrets, secrets that could change everything for the people in the camp.Something I really enjoyed about Temper \u2013 as terrible as this is going to sound \u2013 was watching Samuai shift from the bright, optimistic boy that Asher first fell in love with to a more practical, somewhat cynical young man. He\u2019s still the great guy I fell for in Lifer, but he develops a harder edge in Temper, growing more suspicious and more disenchanted, his faith in people shaken by the secrets he\u2019s unearthed. It made him an even more interesting character than he\u2019d been before.Davyd, too, remains one of my favorite characters in this series. He\u2019s just as unpredictable and fun as he was in Lifer, and I loved his role as instigator, charmer, and manipulator. You never know for sure which side Davyd is on or what his motivations are; what you do know is that he\u2019ll always keep things exciting.One complaint I had with Temper is that there wasn\u2019t quite as much romantic drama as I anticipated. One of the aspects I liked most about Lifer was the love square that developed between Megs, Samuai, Asher, and Davyd; to be perfectly honest, I was more concerned with their relationships than the rest of the plot. That being said, I couldn\u2019t wait to see what would transpire between the four of them when they were all brought together in Temper. I was hoping for some fireworks, or at least some confrontations and awkwardness. There was a little of this, but I can always use more relationship angst!Temper also suffers from a mild case of second book syndrome. At times I felt like its primary purpose was to set up events for Fighter, the next book in the series, and serve as a bridge between books 1 and 3. That being said, it was still an engaging read, and I remain a big fan of this series. I\u2019m anxious to find out more about the mysteries of the Company, the direction the characters\u2019 relationships will take, and what the heck will come of Temper\u2019s cliffhanger ending!I received a free copy of this book from Chapter By Chapter in exchange for an honest review.This review can also be found on my blog, Angela's Library."}, {"userName": "Anelise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39398154-anelise", "userReview": "DISCLAIMER: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewI loved this book so much! Temper is even better than Lifer in my opinion. This book had a great plot with everyone at camp getting riled up and fighting each other because the people have been injected with this serum thingy that kept everyone\u2019s temper in check. Since the people at camp weren\u2019t getting the serum anymore to keep everyone calm, Asher volunteers to go to the Company and get the serum to calm everyone down.There were definitely some places where you would be surprised at what happened, other places where you could almost guess what was going to happen. Temper had a good balance of the two, which makes the book a better read, and much less boring. I liked that the plot twists in the book make sense by the end because if they didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d probably be confused. Asher was stronger in this book than in the last, and she was being more of a leader to her people. She was coming to terms with what happened earlier, and started focusing on what had to be done from here on out.I can\u2019t wait to see if there will be another installment into this series because I have loved this entire series, and I believe there is room for another book."}], "description": "FREEDOM COMES WITH A PRICE.Free from the spaceship and reunited with Samuai, Asher should be happy.
