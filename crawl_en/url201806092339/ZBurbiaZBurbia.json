While it is not a truly realistic portrait of what the zombie apocalypse should look like it is a highly entertaining one. (Actually who really knows what a realistic portrait would be? Who has survived one?) I found this book to have realistic settings and plots that were presented with the dark humor I would expect may be found in an event like this. I know most people wouldn't expect that but I do. I think people are people and after the shock wears off the dark humor and sarcasm would set in. What wasn't realistic is the super human survival and/or skills of some characters. I, fortunately, am a reader who understands the concept of fantasy so this does not bother me. I mention it only because I know some people want only reality in this genre. I enjoy the mix and love humor so this book works well for me. There were some minor flaws in editing but those did not greatly affect me. I had fun with the book and am reading book 2 now. The cannibal family was absolutely brilliant. I just love Elsbeth! She is my female Darryl (from the Walking Dead TV Series). No this book isn't the Walking dead or World War Z. But it is an enjoyable read. If you are looking at a fun, fast, action packed, irreverent Zbook try this one. Two favorite moments from the book, (to give you an idea of the writing): \u201cI hate clowns,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to bring up clowns? Zs aren\u2019t enough? Gotta talk about the smiley creepy guys too?\u201d(Kindle Location 1414)Holy shit, I think I brought home some cannibal savant or something. Rain Man with a taste for people.(Kindle Locations 2158-2159)I would recommend this book to the older crowd for language, sexual references and violence. I would think most adults would investigate a little if they are looking in the z genre for a book for their child but you never know. I think clowns should read it too. Yeah they should read them all. Holy cow I just had a thought...there will be clowns who become zombies!! I just know that will the zombie chasing me!"}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "4.5 stars. Wow, just wow, I have no other words for this book. The book starts off and all seems normal, but then we quickly find out about the zombies, and how life totally changed for these people. Though, not that much, these people from Whispering Pines just live a relatively normal and calm life. They have power, water, they can drink tea whenever they want, play console games (yes, even that) and all in all I was at times wondering how these people will/would survive. Because it is still the apocalypse, and one day the zombies will come into their little neighbourhood and then what? These people are so pampered, I just don't see it ending well. Luckily the community has some people who are pretty kick-ass and who can defend the place. Add to that the location (which is pretty epic and I can imagine that they survived for as long as they did).But pretty quickly the story turns quite grim, with suicide missions to the outside world, with people threatening their little world, with zombies being herded, with a lot of stuff going on. Life for Jace (our main character) turns to something more than just being the brain. He is pretty hopeless, that is something that I have to say about him. Seriously, throughout the book he needs help all the time, gets hurt every time, and well, I do wonder how he survived for so long.I also really liked Jace, he kept going, even when stuff got tough, OK, OK he wanted to give up quite a few times, but still he kept going (or face the wrath of a very pissed-off, but pretty, wife). Jace really was a smarty pants and he thought of great solutions that no one else thought of. I liked that the book was through his eyes. I am sure I would also be interested in Elsbeth or in Stuart's story, but Jace is so normal, unlike Stuart who is ex-mariner and Elsbeth, well who is just Elsbeth. Elsbeth was my favourite character out of the whole book. Sure, when we met her I didn't like her, though I think it was mostly feeling sorry for her. Later when we saw what she could do, wow. I was just amazed. She isn't really good with the talking, but she can kick so much butt. Zombie, or otherwise.As we learn more about her, I just wanted to reach out and hold her. Tell her everything was fine. Poor girl.The book is really crude (lots of cursing), so if that isn't your thing then I would say stay away from this one. The word Fuck is really well represented throughout the book. Also there is quite some gore (especially after Elsbeth came into the picture), with graphic details of what happens to people who mess with our characters. Even my stomach was turning at times and I just had to skip through it for fear of puking all over the book.Brenda, urgh, I so dislike her. She is such a dictator, and I just wanted to shake the people who vote for her, who give her power. The story itself is really great and you are in for a rollercoaster of awesomeness. Don't get too attached to characters though, this is the zombie apocalypse, and the author isn't afraid to kill off people.There is a lot of comedy and great quotes/jokes to be found, at times I was just laughing my butt off. I do have to say, that I am sure pink Yoga pants and purple glittery tops are fitting for Jace. ;)All in all, if you are looking for a great zombie read/great Halloween read, this is the book to go to.Review first posted at http://twirlingbookprincess.com/"}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125315-colleen", "userReview": "Not a bad book--strangely lighthearted entry in the zombie genre, which sets it apart. Like how most zombie books/films (the good ones at least) try to look at lens of a particular genre driven to extreme by undead apocalypse, this one sets it in a Home Owners Association. You know, I'm not sure what entity is more loathed than HOAs--the IRS maybe? NAMBLA? So I don't think I'm spoiling anything by revealing that the HOA Is not a good thing. And that I think is one of the issues I had with the book, that kept this a solid 3 star entry versus something more. It's hard to think of the hero as entirely good (or redeemed in the instance of Stuart) when they're killing little children on order of the HOA (\"we had a vote last night\" etc) when they have plenty of space, playing PS4 with full electricity and water because they don't want to be bothered. Kind of makes you sympathize with the feral children more (and I found that section disturbing in a way I think the author didn't intend). That's another odd reader interaction with these zombie books--parts that are added I think for the \"cool\" factor that while FLASHY, inadvertently make the hero a bigger monster than the creatures--which is what makes these books dubiously interesting, but it's not a deliberate effect."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "ANOTHER ZOMBIE BOOK I REALLY LOVED.

Nicht, dass ich die anderen gelesenen B\u00fccher nicht mag. Doch \u201eZ Burbia\u201c stammt aus einem ganz anderen Genre. Eine Genre, mit der ich eigentlich angefangen habe und auch nie ablegen werde, weil es halt einfach mein Favorit unter all den Genres ist.Was mir in diesem Buch so sehr gefallen hat ist: die komplette Handlung, der Schreibstil, die Redensart der Charaktere und die Charaktere selber. Doch das, was mir am allermeisten gef\u00e4llt ist: das Buch Cover. Ein wahrer Hingucker! Wenn ich mich nicht irre, soll das junge M\u00e4dchen auf dem Cover Elsbeth darstellen. Wahnsinn! Abgesehen davon, ist es einfach nur sch\u00f6n dieses Buch in der Hand zu halten. Besorgt euch lieber das Taschenbuch und ihr werdet verstehen, was ich meine. Das hat sich definitiv ein Platz in der Vitrine verdient!!!!Ich konnte mich von diesem Buch nicht losrei\u00dfen, denn ich wollte unbedingt wissen wie es weiter geht. Also habe ich es auf einem Schlag durchgelesen. Es kam mir eher so vor, als h\u00e4tte ich mir einen Film ansehen. Durch diesen Schreibstil, hatte man wirklich alles bildlich vor Augen gehabt. Alles wird perfekt beschrieben und ganz geschweige von der Geschichte selber. Genial & Perfekt!!!Ich hatte eine Mischung an Filmen als Flashback vor Augen gehabt. Es war eine Mischung aus: Walking Dead, Z Nation und sogar eine Folge von Supernatural \u201eMenschenj\u00e4ger\u201c, etc. Genau aus diesem Grund, fand ich es ja auch so super, weil mir diese Bilder aus den verschiedensten Filmen und Serien vor Augen erschienen sind.Ich finde die Charaktere sehr interessant und total cool. Die Art wie sie reden ist total l\u00e4ssig und meistens auch vulg\u00e4r. Doch genau das, ist ja das witzige daran. Vor allem mag ich es, wie Jace, Stuart und Jon miteinander reden. H\u00e4tte jedenfalls nicht gedacht, dass Jon und Jaces Frau dieselbe Redensart haben wie ihre M\u00e4nner. Ganz geschweige von Jaces Kindern. Greta ist echt ein knallhartes M\u00e4del. Man, musste ich viel lachen.Meine Lieblings Szene ist die, in der Jace Anfangs von den Kannibalen Elsbeth und ihr Vater gefangen gehalten wird. Genau diese ganze Szene hat mich irgendwie an diese Supernatural Folge \u201eMenschenj\u00e4ger\u201c und an diese Kannibalen Szene in Z Nation erinnert. Doch die Stelle, in der Jace nach seiner Rettung gezwungen war eine rosa Yoga Hose und ein lila T-Shirt mit Schmetterling zu tragen, da habe ich mich nicht mehr einkriegen k\u00f6nnen vor Lachen. Beste Szene \u00fcberhaupt!Schade fand ich, was dem guten Jon widerfahren ist. Das habe ich nicht erwartet und hatte mir eigentlich erhofft, dass er noch weiter Teil dieser Geschichte sein w\u00fcrde.Dann kommt aber pl\u00f6tzlich eine neue Wendung. Jon verschwindet aus der Bildfl\u00e4che und Elsbeth ist im Vordergrund der ganzen Geschichte. Trotz all dem, was Jace dank Elsbeth und ihrem Vater durchmachen musste, wird Elsbeth sozusagen ein Teil von Jaces Familie. Bester Part ist, als Jace erw\u00e4hnt, dass Elsbeth ihm irgendwie ans Herz gewachsen ist.Es gibt viele lustige Elsbeth Parts und Spr\u00fcche, wo ich unendlich viel lachen musste. Die kann ich aber jetzt nicht hier erw\u00e4hnen, ansonsten w\u00fcrde ich zu viel Spoilern und vor allem die Besten Stellen schon verraten. Muss man auf alle F\u00e4lle selber gelesen haben.Es sind so viele lustige Szenen dabei und das ganze Buch im Allgemein, ist ein wahres St\u00fcck Gold. Ich kann und will es einfach nur weiterempfehlen und w\u00fcnsche euch viel Spa\u00df dabei. Ich hatte 1000% Spa\u00df dabei gehabt.Ich freue mich schon wahnsinnig auf \u201eZ Burbia 2\u201c.Ob ich Jake Bible B\u00fccher weiterhin lesen werde?! Aber sowas von!!!!!Und da ich von diesem Werk so fasziniert war, kann ich nur eins sagen: dass ich dem Luzifer Verlag treu bleiben werde.

The story is much different from many of the other zombie books out there and focuses more on survival - years after the Z-Day of the apocalypse. Jace and his family live in a gated community managed by an association group - the leader, seemingly a dictator type woman. There is running water, electricity, fresh vegetables and meat, Wifi and other benefits available in this suburban community. Everyone contributes to the success of this community by participating in different capacities - either individually or within groups that work to sustain the whole. Neighbors help in scavenging, killing zombies, battleground clean-up crews, traders who travel outside the gate, guard duty, teaching, preaching, carpenters, electricians, medical, et al. Rules were voted upon, implemented, and strictly enforced to keep this group safe.Jace and his best friend, John are asked to accompany another resident and former Army Ranger on a recon mission into the city of Ashville. What they witness is so different from anything they've ever seen. A group of bikers is holding thousands of zombies captive within the walls surrounding a dried lake bed. Discovered by guards, a chase begins. Reluctant to lead them back to the gated community, the three of them split up to lead the enemy in different directions before circling back. Only John doesn't make it back.Little does the community know that the enemy group has been aware of the gated community all along and is just waiting for the right time to take it over and kill all of the inhabitants. The leader of the enemy group leads his followers to the community and gives them 48 hours to vacate the subdivision, or the captured zombies will be loosed upon them. For emphasis that they mean business, the group had earlier captured John and now summarily execute him in front of his neighbors and friends at the main gate. The war is on!There are many surprises in the story as well as witty comments and conversations that take off the edge and allow readers a moment to catch their breath. There is some similarity to the \"Walking Dead\" TV series, however, Z-Burbia stands on its own two feet. I do recommend this series to anyone wanting to read a different kind of zombie book. There is still an abundance of blood and gore, cannibalism, and something for everyone. I will begin the next book in the six-book series once I finish here.

While I am a big fan of the zombie gene of movies, shows, and books, I didn't expect much from this freebie; I was pleasantly surprised. The characterization was decent (though at times pretty trite, none of the peripheral characters and even some of the main ones were never fully fleshed out) and it's clear that Bible is familiar with the terrain. The story was entertaining and I was eager to see how he would resolve the conflict. of course as I got closer and closer to the end I realized that he probably wouldn't resolve much of anything, since, as I suspected it it's part of a longer series.As entertaining as it is, I would likely only recommend this novel to fellow zombie aficionados who are fans of Walking Dead Season Three, as the story is very similar. Bible dissent break really any new ground; this is virtually the same zombie story I have read/watched many times before. I like how he has focused on the human element in lieu of just the gross out factor (their is plenty of Gore for those of you who prefer that side of things) but there just isn't anything new.I also found myself wondering if Bible is a Firefly fan, as one character is essentially River Tram.Good quick read, but I'm not sure I want to spend money investigating the rest of the story if it's all the same stuff I've seen already in The Walking Dead."}, {"userName": "Lee Murray", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7385944-lee-murray", "userReview": "Only my second ever zombie novel and I\u2019m still not immune to the black blood, severed sinews, and surreptitious shuffling, but if they\u2019re all as good as this then I can see a trend coming. High action, high tempers and high stakes, I\u2019m noticing the zombie novel is an excellent vehicle for a examining what it is that makes us human, for looking at our humanity. Sure, zombies present a problem because typically there are a lot of them, and they\u2019re hungry, but obviously, they\u2019re not the real threat. And for those still not convinced about the zombie genre, Z-Burbia is worth a read if only for its female characters: Jake Bible doesn\u2019t have time for vapid whimpering damsels in distress. Oh no. Bible\u2019s characters are thinking, acting, feisty sorts. As well as scheming cold-hearted Brenda, head of the most dysfunctional Home Owners' Association ever, there\u2019s Elsbeth, the zombie-killing Amazon, Jon\u2019s wife Melissa, who heads up the resistance, and Jace\u2019s own wife, Stella the school teacher, her bite is as lethal as any undead opportunist. And the teenagers are keenly drawn too; with dialogue as sharp as razor wire, I can almost smell their bored contempt. The good news is that there has to be a sequel to Z-Burbia and its battle of Whispering Pines, since the war for the suburbs is just beginning.

I will be picking up the other books in the series- and if you know me at all, you know I don\u2019t like to spend money ever. After the zombie apocalypse, the small HOA subdivision of Whispering Pines is still holding but barely. (I don\u2019t like to give spoilers but I will tell you just enough to entice you) They are not slow zombie or fast ones, but terrifying. One day Jace, Jon and Stuart are sent out on a mission for the HOA and then all hell breaks loose. They run into not only hordes of zombies, but nut-job bikers and cannibals too. (That has to be my favorite part- the cannibals) The character of Jace and the Elsbeth are my favorite. Jace (Jason) is strong minded, funny, and inappropriate, he\u2019s the modern MacGyver of the Z-Burbia. You got an issue, you go to him for ideas. Esbeth- wow.. she is bad ass and odd. So very odd, but funny and loyal. When those two are together so many things are possible. I like that this book takes a different approach to the death and destruction of life after a major event like the living dead. It\u2019s strangely lighthearted and it\u2019s funny, there\u2019s tons of violence and action\u2026 you never really get bored with it. Great book!

The main characters (and town saviors) run around with crippling wounds. Elsbeth is a teenage cannibal, ninja-assassin able to take on fifty zombies with only a spiked club, and she can sneak up on and \"take out\" trained Special Forces soldiers.

My real drawback was when the Hero of the story, Jace Stanford is severely wounded in a classic clash with the un-dead, he takes on a James Bond quality. Half his face is ripped opened. His leg is a bloody mess and he\u2019s losing a ton of blood. And his injuries only manifest as the story continues. No human, even Rambo or Conan could endure the pain or blood loss and keep fighting as Jace does. That was the big turn-off for me.

Why should you? What makes this different than the other stories out there?First, what this isn't. It's not World War Z. I love that book. It's a heart string rending look at what the world, Post-Z, would probably look like. While this book definitely gives us a look at what the world might be like, it's less about tugging the heart strings and more about disturbing you while at the same time making you laugh.This book is also not Dawn of the Day Before the Night of the Damned Undead. By that I mean it's not some kind of rehash of the Romero movies or even a rip-off of one of the remakes. Jake does do a bit of the kind of social commentary that Romero strove for. It's not front and center, but as the title suggests he does have fun with the notion of HOAs and gated communities.So what is it? It's something fresh while at the same time staying true to the tropes we all love about the Zed Heads. It's got the dark humor I loved about Shaun of the Dead, while retaining Jake's no holds barred, violent, thought provoking, and have I mentioned sickly funny signature style."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "Having read a previous book by the author and pretty much hating it, I nearly deleted this one without reading it.

Even the priest or whatever he was couldn't stop swearing while having a supposed normal conversation. I think that having swearing for the sake of it with no specific reason, adds zero to the book.

This is a major pet peeve of mine because it seems that every bloody author these days misuses this word. I posted on his blog explaining when cordite was used and when it was no longer used, that it does not smell like modern gunpowder and the words are not interchangeable, and he should have done more research instead of misusing a word he doesn't understand. There was nothing offensive in my post whatsoever, just information that he clearly didn't ever look up. Instead of taking the criticism in a mature way, this elitist snob instead chose to delete my comment, then close the comments section completely. Most authors have been welcoming of criticism, using it to become better writers. However, this one seems to have more of an \"I am a famous author! How dare you suggest I am not perfect in every way and suggest that I ever make any mistakes!\" kind of attitude. I got refunds for the next two books in the series and have to say I have no interest in reading any more of this author's work until he learns that he makes mistakes just like everyone else. He needs to learn to take criticism like an adult and not like a spoiled child, deleting anything negative that is said about his writing. Some advice \"Mr.\" Bible. Grow up and grow a thicker skin. If my little comment had this effect on you then I shudder to think how you would react to real criticism."}, {"userName": "Erin Penn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23498610-erin-penn", "userReview": "The author styles himself as a modern pulp-writer, putting out about a dozen action-pack stories a year. Quick, strong, gory, exciting, explosive, non-stop action. The opening part of the book does warn there will be gore, which if you are reading a zombie apocalypse book should not be a shock. Mr. Bible delivers all these.BUT he also delivers believable characters with different reasons for doing what they do. A developing political structure rising out of the ashes of civilization - from the Home-Owners Association tyrant to the constant battle between urban-and-rural. Big battles and little battles - zombies being weaponized, and parents raising kids in the Z-hellscape to be responsible adults. The layers take this book to the next level.The Z-Burbia series is 7 books long so far, and book 7 features Elsbeth (the awesome kicking cannibal savant first introduced in this book).Picked up during an Amazon special price sale."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18250908-lauren", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book. It was a well-written, fast-paced, adrenaline-inducing story that kept me up a few nights. I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could do half-stars. I think I have read too many zombie books or comics - the plots never feel original to me anymore. But if this were the first zombie book I read I would rate it higher. I also felt that the book should have been longer or even stretched into two in order to allow for more character depth and plot. It felt too rushed and I realized at the end that there weren't any characters I really cared about or connected with. In general though, I would recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Paulette Waters", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65319428-paulette-waters", "userReview": "ZombieI really enjoyed this book.

Which is good since the zombie apocalypse has come to Western North Carolina and really put suburban living to the test! Surrounded by a sea of the undead, the residents of Whispering Pines have adapted their bucolic life of block parties to scavenging parties, common area groundskeeping to immediate area warfare, neighborhood beautification to neighborhood fortification. But, even in the best of times, suburban living has its ups and downs what with nosy neighbors, a strict Home Owners\u2019 Association, and a property management company that believes the words \u201cstrict interpretation\u201d are holy words when applied to the HOA covenants. Now with the zombie apocalypse upon them even those innocuous, daily irritations quickly become dramatic struggles for personal identity, family security, and straight up survival.
