Dot is a speck of nothingness aware of her basic insignificance in the cosmos and her status as merely another \u2018dot\u2019 in the universe. She ekes out a depressive bourgeois existence in the suburb of Jaywick Sands (which is routinely savaged for its suicidal dullness), having unfulfilling sex and bumping off old ladies. She then decides, upon fleeing her philandering husband, to take her life by leaping off the Forth Road Bridge.Fair enough. Throughout the remaining 150 pages, she enters the bureaucratic nightmare of the underworld, haunts her former lover to retrieve proof of her ID, and wins the most exciting death contest. Her prize (after a brief and unsuccessful stint as a possum) is reincarnation in an equally depressive American suburb. Dot is, it seems, unsuited for this unfathomable world. She finds love, at last, through an incestuous union with her brother, but he \u2013 alas \u2013 goes on to kill himself despite being a scientific genius. So it goes.Ellmann punctuates this bleak-sounding tale with shards of LOUD and CAPITALISED humour. The NY Times compares this style to a friend who writes ranting letters which seem to have their own insane logic, and I find this accurate \u2013 Lucy wallops the reader with her blunt vitriol, which is wildly entertaining and witty, but which BEGS to be taken seriously.There is such FURY (I can\u2019t help it \u2013 it\u2019s addictive) behind Ellmann\u2019s wit that makes this novel highly re-readable for almost any occasion, but which forces us to confront what despicable, sagging lumps we are. She directs her spite towards scientists (there\u2019s a rant in here that will outrage devout realists) and tears impetuously through the innumerable inane quirks of existence \u2013 exposing the fundamental fraud of human endeavour. Often within the same paragraph.Ellmann\u2019s work is a strange cross between vicious stand-up comedy (Alexei Sayle or Bill Hicks springs to mind), Wodehousian whimsy, and the shrugging misanthropy of Kurt Vonnegut. Quite a cocktail! The packaging of her books suggests postmodern chick-lit, but the scope of this work is too broad, and Dot is too inscrutable a heroine to attract that audience. Plus, the central theme of this novel is DEATH (that old favourite), and the challenge this hurdle presents to people attempting to fill the LIFE portion they are allotted.Dot in the Universe is almost certainly a modern classic. An infectious and cantankerous romp through quite profound territory, handled with humility, moral outrage and cheeky slabs of misanthropy. Any novel dealing with grand themes that leaves me feeling ELATED when I should be feeling MISERABLE is pulling the right strings. As Ellmann indicates, there is a great deal of mirth to be mined in self-loathing.So I recommended this book to every mortal. If you\u2019re even remotely human, you\u2019ll take enormous pleasure in this dark, deranged and sublime com\u00e9die humaine. Ellmann has the closing WORDS! (From p13):\u201cDot in the universe. Dot was insignificant, but who isn\u2019t? So much EFFORT we put into life, all the feeding, clothing, educating, medicating, fornicating, masturbating, cleansing and conversing. All the ANXIETY. When it doesn\u2019t really matter if a single person gets happy. The universe DOESN\u2019T GIVE A DAMN.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "I can\u2019t RESIST writing a review in the style of THIS weird-ass book, as after two HUNDRED PAGES you start THINKING like the deranged narrator and can\u2019t STOP. Words are capitalised RANDOMLY throughout. That\u2019s odd enough, but now imagine the WORST-TEMPERED person ever, who is FED UP to the back TEETH and complaining about PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING, who won MISS CONTEMPTUOUS UBERGRUMP four years running, but who reserves particular VITUPERATION for favourite topics like SCIENTISTS and AMERICA. Then imagine this lunatic telling the cartoony story of DOT Butser, a sexy 40 year old English lady who likes to kill OLD WOMEN because they're intensely annoying and who then commits suicide. After which come her AMUSING ADVENTURES in the afterlife.( I\u2019d love to hear the audio book of this novel, to see if the reader YELLS all the words in capitals like they have Tourette\u2019s. That would be hilarious. For FIVE MINUTES.)So yeah, this is an extended stand-up comedy sketch. As for instance, Billy Connelly in his early days had a 20 minute monologue based on the idea that the Bible contained a misprint, and when it said Jesus was born in Galilee, it should have been Gallowgate, which is a rough suburb of Glasgow. He then tells the story of the Crucifixion as if it happened in Gallowgate. This book is like that. It\u2019s riffs, rants, and lists. THE NARRATOR TELLS US THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU FIND IN THE AFTERLIFE (which is not Heaven, not Hell, not anything really, but grimy and disorganised and unpleasant all round)People who WHISTLED (no need for this). People who worked for Disney in any capacity. Actors, farmers, nerds, fakes, sportsmen, cheapskates, world leaders, snobs, model train addicts, clingy types, tragic tots, evil grannies, people who specialised in OPERATIC LAUGHTER. Guys who believed in GAIA. Guys who TALKED about their belief in Gaia. The manufacturers of ARTIFICIAL FLAVOURS, people who cook nut loaves [and on and on]THE NARRATOR ON AMERICA (Americans \u2013 look away now!!)America\u2019s the only place in the world where fat people feel comfortable. In America fat people even get MARRIED. They exist only to stuff WHOPPER SUBS into themselves in order to achieve ever-greater INSENSIBILITY. In a spiral of EATING, TALKING ABOUT FOOD and GIVING food away to the POOR, they somehow convince themselves they have free will.So you see you get the comedy, but sometimes at the drop of a hat, it all veers off into something like genuine unpleasantness. Laudatory reviews tell you that this novel is very angry (like that's a good thing) and yes, it is, about scientists (they treat animals disgracefully, and they\u2019re smug) and Americans (see above) and the general pointlessness of human life. I think Lucy Ellmann is a bit like JAZZ \u2013 you get it or you don\u2019t. I kind of half got it and when I was getting it I thought it ROCKED and when I didn\u2019t I thought it was STUPID. But whatever it was, it was different."}, {"userName": "Megha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1727205-megha", "userReview": "Postmodernist take on existentialism, and so on.

It is such BULLSHIT that you can see nice sunsets from planes, the aurora borealis, UFOs, whatever. Nothing you see from a plane MATTERS. I once saw the entire ARCTIC CIRCLE from a plane, for HOURS, hundreds and hundreds of miles of cracked ice gradually turning blue as the sun went down. I searched it for Inuit. But none of this COUNTS. To really feel you've been to the North Pole you've got to TRUDGE, with sleighs and huskies, troublesome companions and weird food-stuffs. You've got to get frostbite. In fact you've got to be an IDIOT. There's a REASON why such places are uninhabited.\"Dot Butser is a bored housewife who collects tea cozies and enjoys sex with her husband John, who she believes is a swordfisherman (he is not, and the one time he tries it he is overcome with despair and begins sobbing, which causes the other swordfishermen to embrace him; apparently they see this all the time). After her fortieth birthday and the discover that John is cheating on her, Dot becomes a serial killer, murdering old women out of pity in their posh seaside resort of Jaywick, attempts suicide once, and gets it right the second time. There's more after that, notably a long section in the underworld, but I don't want to give everything away just yet! Go read a book, ya dummy!It feels like it might be overly-clever and twee when I type it all out like that, but the thing I liked most about this book was how much it didn't feel like that. The plot to Dot In The Universe is more or less inconsequential in comparison to its dominating theme of being small and insignificant in an uncaring universe. Words on each page are punched up with CAPITAL LETTERS with little sense of underlying LOGIC, giving the sense that the book was written by a narrator frustrated by the lack of inherent IMPORTANCE in the words they were writing DOWN. The narrator comes off like an intruder into Dot's life, a voice in the back of her head that leads her to ruin. This process of capitalization puts the reader on edge and makes them more aware of the smallness of the book's events. The outlandish parts of Dot's life, like the serial killings and her brief life as a possum, are given equal weight to the dull moments, like feeling uncomfortable at the gynecologist and trying a fancy new restaurant in a different town. Until Dot's suicide, the reader is reminded over and over again that Dot's life is small, and she knows just as much about the lives of other people as they do about hers. The universe does not revolve around her. When she does die, she is transported via airplane to the afterlife, and on the way she sees all the waste of her life stacked up in piles. All the food she ever shit, all the paper she ever wasted, all the trash she ever threw away (or recycled, it all goes to the same place), all the rage she ever felt in the form of a mountain, Dot looks at all of it without judgment. On the one hand, it reduces Dot to a filter, oxygen to carbon dioxide, food to shit, et cetera et cetera, just one of a billion trillion lifeforms with holes for \"in\" and holes for \"out.\" On the other hand, these piles are overwhelming and Dot's the only one who ever sees them. She even gets her own plane to look at them from, a plane that someone else is flying! A private jet's got to be an ego boost. Once she reaches the underworld it's business as usual, she's lost in the crowd, but for a brief moment it's all about her and her mountains and mountains of shit.The second half of the novel is lighter than the first, but it never makes an attempt to trivialize the existential crisis that came before. There's an eleventh hour plot twist that in any other story might seem obvious and cheap, but Dot In The Universe embraces the cheapness, putting a fresh spin on existentialism (existentialism having been in desperate need of a fresh spin for years now) that jives with its own weirdo philosophy."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216258-sean", "userReview": "This is a FILTHY, DIRTY tale of a woman who lived, DIED, and lived some more, and was an OPOSSUM in between. Don't read this if you're a PRUDE, if you have very strong RELIGIOUS beliefs, or if you work in the ANIMAL VIVISECTION field.There was no POINT to Dot, and that's the point. Sort of. The universe can't be BOTHERED to care.I for one didn't much care for Ellman's ANTI-SCIENCE rantings, because science alleviates SUFFERING, if imperfectly. I get that science plays a role in the PLOT, and that a little anti-science vitriol might be permitted on the part of the NARRATOR, but I suspect that's Ellman's own view.The use of CAPITALS wasn't at all distracting. I rather ENJOYED the device. I found, say, Mantel's overuse of PRONOUNS rather more off-putting (though I enjoy Mantel, too -- just as a comparison)."}, {"userName": "Heather Adkins", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2564411-heather-adkins", "userReview": "Hmm. I'm still reeling from this book, caught in a vortex of trying to figure out whether or not I liked it. While Dot is a very real, very strange, very screwed up character, her Universe (at times) can be very deep and heartfelt. I didn't care for the odd way Ellman used random words in all caps, though I'm sure she had a reason to do so; it just messed with my OCD sensibilities. I didn't feel very fulfilled by the book; it wasn't shaped up and given an ending (one way or the other). Right at the climactic point, Ellman changes gears and goes back to the beginning of Dot's life.

It begins as a deceptively simple story about an English rose perfectionist named Dot, and rockets from the mundane to the sublime at warp speed in this bizarre, fanciful, funny, dark, profound and occasionally rather dirty little book. I loved the ever-present exclamation points and ALLCAPS treatment of seemingly random words, as well as all the 'Britishisms', and Ellmann's viciously satiric take on American Suburbia. And the angry bit in the middle about the deification of Science (an opinion I share) only served to endear the author to me. Reminded me a bit of James Thurber in places, which brought back fond memories. I have a feeling people really like Ellmann's books or really don't; she's not one you can be 'meh' about. I definitely do. Here's Dot explaining how the Underworld works:\"The thing about the Underworld is that you have to fill out so many FORMS. And they're full of impossible questions, like your National Insurance number, your NHS number, your father's date of birth, your mother's mother's mother's country of origin. Not many in the middle of their death throes think to bring all this information with them--but they sure WISH they had.You fill out all the forms as best you can and hand them in to belligerent BUREAUCRATS who hand them right back, asking MORE questions. It is a silly and childish GAME they play with you, it's INTOLERABLE. As if you never existed if you can't remember your Vehicle Registration Number! They don't actually CARE who you are or what your Vehicle Registration Number is, they are just trying to delay your rightful progress toward REINCARNATION, for the HELL of it! The thing is, if you can't prove you were BORN, you might have to start over as a microscopic SPIDER or a PLANT. That's how they run things in that old Underworld.\"Ghosts, she explains, haunt houses because they're looking for their paperwork.

At first I found it distracting and annoying but got used to it and it actually worked for me after 30 or so pages in. Her style is blunt, very funny and sometimes lyrical, turning out a few beautiful phrases that redeem it from being totally depressing. It is less much less bleak than say someone like \"Women in Love\" by Elfriede Jelinek, which is like getting punched in the stomach repeatedly (but its a very good novel despite its harsh and unrelentingly dark depiction of the inner life of the characters). Let's just say it's not something you want to read before bed or if you're feeling upbeat about humanity. It will bring you right down like gravity.Ellmann is much less bleak and unforgiving but her spare style, raw description of inner life and brutal honesty is very similar to Jelinek. Also both these authors' reminded me of Brian Evenson in style and tone, and of Georges Simenon, Patrick Hamilton, a bit of Patricia Highsmith and Paul Bowles.
