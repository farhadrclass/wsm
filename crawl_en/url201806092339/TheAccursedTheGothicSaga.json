Something spooky that also sheds light on turn-of-the-century issues of race and class. Oh, and I'll do it from the perspective of a male historian who's the son of one of the characters and thus implicated in the whole story. Just, you know, to stretch myself a little.\" It speaks to the nearly freakish level of Oates' talent that she could pull this novel off, because it is a ridiculous feat of storytelling and craft. That said, this is not a novel for everyone. It's nearly 700 pages long, filled with period details and historical notes. If you haven't read JCO before, this is perhaps not the place to start. No, this is the work of a master who's done the \"conventional\" novel, to great acclaim, many times over. This novel reminded me of when football legend Deion Sanders did the 40-yard dash backwards at the Combine (allegedly at 4:57) because he was simply that good. In other words, the most supernatural element here is not the 'curse' or any of the Gothic elements. It's Oates' talent, which is frightening to behold.--Maya Lang is the author of The Sixteenth of June.

The one that rambles on about things that have no relevance to the current situation, to you, or to anything important. There were many parts like this where I found myself saying get on with it, huffing and wanting to stop reading, but continuing on in the hopes it would get better. It did not.The writing was beautiful but disconnected, wondering about, and all in all nothing to keep me wanting to turn the page. Usually with a book I have trouble stopping reading it to go do whatever I need to do but with this my problem was the opposite. I see what the author tried to do but it did not work. I do not need almost a full chapter going into random detail about diaries nor do I need long random bits about why the \"historian\" chose to interpret something a certain way or why the other historians did not do it correctly. If all that random and irrelevant stuff was taken out it might have been a good book. As it was the story kept being rudely interrupted by these snippets. I read on hoping eventually the story would develop into something and the snippets would cease but found myself at the last pages of the book still thinking, maybe this next page the story will really start.I have no issue with non-fiction history books or academic books but I did not pick this up looking for that kind of read. Though it has some paranormal, some is even pushing it, it read more like what I'd expect from a very old academic journal or non-fiction novel. I wanted Gothic, supernatural, and/or horror. I got none of this, only a teasing glimpse at a story that never really got satisfyingly developed."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie", "userReview": "I\u2019m a big fan of Joyce Carol Oates, so when I discovered she had a new book out, I was excited. I was even happier when I found that it was another volume in the gothic family saga series she started many years ago with \u2018Bellefleur\u2019, which is one of my favorite books. The 660 page length didn\u2019t bother me; she\u2019s an author who, at her best, can fill that many pages with brilliance. I greeted the book like it was a big box of candy. I\u2019m afraid I was disappointed. There are a lot of good things in the book-an extended patrician family living in Princeton is cursed. Voices say bad things to people, ghosts are seen, a shape shifting demon walks among them and leads them into tragedies. At the same time, they have to deal with the demons of their everyday life: racism, misogyny, classism, the Machiavellian politics of Princeton University. I liked having a narrator who only knew the story through the diaries and papers he discovered long after the events took place. Half the population of the book are real people: Woodrow Wilson is president of Princeton U, Grover Cleveland and his wife are part of the social circle, Upton Sinclair has a large part devoted to him, Jack London, Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain all make appearances. But the lessons about society are a little heavy handed, and I\u2019m really not sure that some of the historical characters added to the story. Upton Sinclair and Jack London didn\u2019t seem to be connected to the family and the curse but took up a lot of pages. The only way I could see that they added to the story was by showing the reader what the attitudes of people of the time were, but I know enough history that I didn\u2019t need that and I\u2019m sure there are many other readers like me. Oates has written a great story, but every story needs an editor. At least a hundred pages could have been cut without the story losing anything and the book would have been much sharper. I enjoyed the book, but got impatient with it frequently."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "This book - a (pseudo) historical, supernatural, mystery horror story - is supposedly written by M.W. van Dyck, descendant of one of the most prominent families of Princeton, New Jersey. Claiming to have access to newly decoded journals and other materials available only to himself van Dyck unspools the story of the \"Crosswicks Curse\" that took a horrific toll on some wealthy, influential Princeton families in 1905 and 1906. The first conspicuous manifestation of the curse occurs when pretty, young Annabel Slade absconds from her elaborate wedding immediately after exchanging marriage vows with handsome Lieutenant Dabney Bayard. The man she runs off with, Axson Mayte, is in town (purportedly) advising Woodrow Wilson - then President of Princeton University. As Annabel's brother Josiah Slade, a Princeton graduate who can't quite seem to find his role in life, relentlessly pursues the runaways Annabel is trapped in a filthy, hidden castle called the 'Bog Kingdom' - where she's abused, starved, impregnated, and eventually reduced to the status of a slovenly cleaning woman alongside previous Mayte victims. Mayte has no fixed appearance, looking tall and handsome to some and ugly and toadlike to others. Thus the wily Mayte is able to appear in different guises - including Fran\u00e7ois D\u2019Apthorp and Count English von Gneist - a great favorite with the snobby ladies of Princeton. Mayte is apparently able to exert a hypnotic effect on people, manipulating their thoughts and behavior. Mayte's most amusing incarnation occurs when he appears as Sherlock Holmes to Pearce van Dyck (the narrator's father) who's convinced that Sherlock Holmes' \"cases\" - which he believes are real - hold the key to the mystery of the Curse. The elder van Dyck's compulsive analysis of the Curse using Holmes' work as a guide are the funniest parts of the book.Soon after Annabel Slade disappears her pre-teen cousins Todd and Oriana Slade are also afflicted by the Curse as are other important Princeton families. Several husbands become obsessed with the notion that their wives are committing adultery, with unfortunate consequences and a woman decides that her newborn's 'deliberate misbehavior' requires a drastic solution. Reverend Winslow Slade, who was previously President of Princton University and Governor of New Jersey is especially disturbed by the Curse because he's grandfather to Annabel, Josiah, Todd, and Oriana, as well as friend and counselor to other afflicted families. Moreover, the Reverend has a shameful secret that's haunted him for five decades. The book is very long, incorporating a number of historic figures. These include grossly obese (former) President Grover Cleveland, who tries to jump out a window after seeing his daughter's ghost, but he's too fat to fit (ha ha ha); Jack London, famous author of adventure stories - who flaunts his mistress at a speaking engagement, then has a pub party and gets wildly drunk; Upton Sinclair, the painfully self-conscious author of \"The Jungle\" (which exposes the horrific practices of the meat industry) - who neglects his family and dreams of establishing a socialist colony in New Jersey; President Teddy Roosevelt, who invites the vegetarian Sinclair to an uncomfortable meat-filled lunch; and of course Woodrow Wilson - who has a plethora of health problems and an ongoing feud with Andrew Fleming West, Dean of Princeton's Graduate School. During the story Wilson, happily married with several daughters, also becomes victim to the Curse when he's bewitched by a beautiful woman. True to the time period, many of the characters exhibit (what would now be considered) atrocious behavior including rampant racism, sexism, opposition to women's suffrage, disdain for immigrants, disregard for the suffering of the 'lower classes', and way too high an opinion of themselves. By the end of the book the Curse has run it's course and the reader learns what it was all about in a satisfying conclusion. For me the book was overly long and spent too much time on ancillary characters like Jack London - whose speech to a socialist group and subsequent partying seemed to go on forever; and Upton Sinclair - whose personal life and socialist musings took up too many pages. Still, these are fairly minor quibbles about a book that's well-researched, well-written, and a rollicking good story. I'd highly recommend the book to readers who enjoy Gothic literary fiction.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "This is not an easy book to categorize. I have written and destroyed three reviews before settling on this uneasy summary.The Accursed is a sort of Gothic novel set in Princeton, New Jersey at the turn of the century. It is a novel disguised as a narrative history written by a descendant of one of the principal actors some eighty years after the main plot lines. But here, the thin line between narrative fiction and the supposed objectivity of this historical account blurs yet further.The stage setting is the sleepy little WASP hive of Princeton, New Jersey at the turn of the 20th century. Socialists make grand plots on scale for the year 1910, genteel families plan the marriage of their corseted daughters, the dean of the University, Woodrow Wilson, frets about his hypochondria and plots to keep down 'Negroes'. We have a firm sense of the structure and details of this little world, and Oates unleashes all the fires of hell upon it.The plot is something Byzantine and none of the characters' stories can be trusted. And to further complicate things, there is the stench of the supernatural - vampires with multiple identities, curses, deaths in the arctic and children turned to stone. Or were any of those past things true? Hard to say. It's a lot of fun to figure out. The story is also dotted with historical characters. Former President Grover Cleveland grows fat and indolent; future President Woodrow Wilson frets about the bad press of lynchings and his own imaginary illnesses, Upton Sinclair dreams of socialist revolution. History is a series of guideposts for the story, but it is by no means an exact parallel. The story here is extreme and grotesque, and that's what makes this book so fun."}, {"userName": "Eleni", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15611-eleni", "userReview": "The Accursed is trippy, in the best, most all-consuming sense of the word. I read it like an obsessed maniac--it's that much of a page-turner. That is to say, once you get into the unreliable narrator's pedantic/perverse voice. It took me about 60 pages to orient myself in his world and after that I hated to leave the world of the book for real life. The setting--Princeton, NJ, when Woodrow Wilson was president of the college, not the country--is very evocative and I totally bought into all the lurid, Gothic splendor/decay of it all. It actually made we want to go research the lives of some of the real people who pop up in the book--Sinclair Lewis, Jack London, Mrs. Grover Cleveland (who sounds like a real force of nature, sort of the Joan Holloway of 19th century New Jersey). But laziness and motherhood prevailed, so I'll probably just keep wondering whether these people interacted at all IRL. I wish I had to take a course in this book as I'm sure there was so much I missed in my galloping reading of it."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "\u2018The Accursed\u201d is the latest addition to Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s boundless body of work, and it\u2019s spectacular \u2014 a coalescence of history, horror and social satire that whirls around for almost 700 mesmerizing pages. Oates started the novel in 1984 but set it aside to steep in its own febrile juices for three decades. Now \u201cThe Accursed\u201d arises in full bloom, boasting as much craft as witchcraft.The book comes to us framed as a work of amateur history, the pet project of M.W. van Dyck, a member of one of the august old families in Princeton, N.J. \u201cI have been privy to many materials unavailable to other historians,\u201d he tells us, dismissing earlier scholars who have tried to make sense of the tragedies that struck Princeton in 1905. \u201cNo one is possessed of as much information as I am concerning the private, as well as the public, nature of the Curse.\u201dWhat follows is a \u201cmassive chronicle\u201d \u2014 a patchwork of narratives, letters, diaries, journals and sermons that together unveil the grotesque assault that once shed America\u2019s bluest blood. \u201cThe subject matter is disconcerting,\u201d van Dyck admits, \u201cif not frankly repulsive,\u201d but the truth will out.At the center of this spectral tale, spiked with a \u201cfrisson of dread,\u201d live the Slades, who can trace their lineage back to Plymouth Plantation. The living patriarch, the Rev. Winslow Slade, was once governor of New Jersey and now basks in the joys of retirement. As one of New England\u2019s wealthiest and most esteemed Presbyterian ministers, he\u2019s still sought out by men of influence. But nothing matters more to him than the happiness of his four grandchildren. How sad, then, that those beautiful children are torn from him, one by one, during a series of chilling events known collectively as the Curse.The first grandchild struck is beautiful Annabel, betrothed to gallant Lt. Bayard. Honestly, can anything worse befall a young bride than getting married in a book by Joyce Carol Oates? It\u2019s always something old, something new, something borrowed, something slew. This time the flowers don\u2019t just wilt, they emit a poisonous aroma that drives men to murderous rage. Nine years ago, Oates published a powerful novel called \u201cThe Falls\u201d about a marriage that ended on the first day of the honeymoon, but that was matrimonial bliss compared with the marriage in \u201cThe Accursed,\u201d which lasts about 30 seconds. It\u2019s such a masterly scene, elaborately foreshadowed, gorgeously festooned as only Oates can, and then run in delectable slow motion \u2014 with some dialogue in parseltongue \u2014 right up to the fantastic climax of Part I.The delights of this macabre novel gather thick as ghouls at midnight in the cemetery. I\u2019ve never been so aware of Oates\u2019s weird comedy. Through it all, van Dyck maintains his skeptical, scholarly tone, even when a lonely undergraduate is ravished by a self-loathing gay vampire, or a minister chokes on a giant snake, or a gossipy invalid is murdered with an electric fan. The scent of demons grows pungent, and viscera pile up at the bottom of these pages, but our narrator shuffles along, assuring us he\u2019s just clearing the cobwebs from a story too long encumbered by myths and rumors. \u201cWhere my objectivity as a historian is an issue,\u201d he tells us, \u201cI must err on the side of caution.\u201d Did I mention the boy who turns to stone?Among all the creatures Oates resurrects, she revives the spirit of Nathaniel Hawthorne \u2014 who, with a similarly dry wit, liked to suggest the most outlandish speculations, then dismiss them immediately. And his work isn\u2019t the only classic you can hear echoing in the dark forest of this story: The mysterious pattern of mayhem in Princeton recalls one of America\u2019s first novels, a tale of deadly mental influence by Charles Brockden Brown called \u201cWieland.\u201d In another \u201cAccursed\u201d storyline, a professor falls into madness by trying to apply the methods of Sherlock Holmes. Later, a handsome young man sails off toward the frozen terror of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cArthur Gordon Pym,\u201d while his lovely sister rides away in a creepy dramatization of Emily Dickinson\u2019s \u201cBecause I Could Not Stop for Death.\u201d Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d flaps around every corner.Those literary allusions are only a slice of this novel\u2019s treasures. Although a creaky ghost story with all its attendant specters would seem a strange frame for a work of historical fiction about the beginning of the 20th century, \u201cThe Accursed\u201d provides a compelling context to explore equally scary attitudes about blacks, gays and the poor. After all, to these nervous Brahmins, striking miners are just as frightening as vampires. In the twilight before World War I, the pious folk of Princeton are troubled by fiery debates about the nature of God, the rights of women, the power of capital, the future of socialism and particularly the role of blacks. Older residents can remember the good old days when Southern boys brought their own slaves to school. But now, that calcified structure of elitism is being challenged by forces earthly and occult, and the past will have its revenge. \u201cThere is a monstrousness in our midst,\u201d one well-heeled snob scribbles in her diary.Whereas the central, doomed family of \u201cThe Accursed\u201d is Oates\u2019s invention, familiar figures such as Mark Twain, Jack London, Upton Sinclair, Theodore Roosevelt and Grover Cleveland rise from their graves fully reanimated in these pages. Central among them is Princeton\u2019s most famous president, Woodrow Wilson, a brittle monomaniac shown here in all his paranoia and imperialism years before he ascended to the White House and made the world safe for democracy. Oates doesn\u2019t just knock him off his pedestal; she crushes him beneath the weight of his own bizarre habits and terrors. She takes special delight in detailing Wilson\u2019s penchant for demonizing anyone who disagrees with him, telling racist jokes and pumping his own stomach with a tube.A professor at Princeton for decades, Oates also luxuriates in exposing the school\u2019s ivy-strangled traditions in \u201ca claustrophobic little world of privilege and anxiety in which one was made to care too much about too little.\u201d Internecine battles threaten to tear the school apart, and the students are devoted to socializing, not scholarship. And there\u2019s a wickedly funny section about Princeton\u2019s obsession with homosexuality that foreshadows our current approach to prosecuting terrorism in a cloud of paranoia and secrecy.Charmingly, Oates subjects herself to the same wry appraisal. Van Dyck\u2019s narrative is spiked with self-deprecating jokes that allude to her own critical reception, her inexhaustible verbiage, even her tendency toward melodrama. When the novel\u2019s final pages veer into Shakespearean comedy and then rush into a puritanical sermon of Old Testament fury, it\u2019s clear that this is an author fully aware of her literary extravagances.Yes, it\u2019s exhaustive and exhausting as it sprawls across all this disparate material. It\u2019s no wonder the word \u201cfaint\u201d seems to lie on every other page. And there are a few dead patches \u2014 Wilson\u2019s trip to Bermuda never really comes to life, and the Jack London section drags \u2014 but those ragged edges only make the book seem more like something van Dyck has curated over his lifetime. With its vast scope, its mingling of comic and tragic tones, its omnivorous gorging on American literature, and especially its complex reflection on the major themes of our history, \u201cThe Accursed\u201d is the kind of outrageous masterpiece only Joyce Carol Oates could create."}, {"userName": "Cora \u2615 Tea Party Princess", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166936-cora-tea-party-princess", "userReview": "What did I just read?I think it's safe to say that this is NOT my cup of tea.

What a slog this was. And how it pains me to give it only two stars, 'it was [barely] okay', as I am a huge fan of the supremely talented Joyce Carol Oates.Never afraid to experiment, The Accursed has been touted as her take on the horror genre, with Stephen King hailing it as \"the first postmodern Gothic novel\". Huh?Horror novel it ain't. All it is, basically, is a novel focusing on Princeton in the dim and distant past, and how it was a microcosm of the racism and general prejudice, especially towards women and children, that was endemic to the fledgling United States at the time.Oh, and with some supernatural elements thrown into the mix. Following a lynching of wrongly-accused underclass representatives (of course, these are black), Princeton's leading families are suddenly subject to weird happenings ... and urges. These quickly escalate into violence, perversion and death (and not necessarily in that order).Oates has much fun presenting real historical characters in a less than salubrious light, such as Woodrow Wilson and Jack London.Actually, it is best to think of this as more of a social satire than a horror novel. The pacing is all wrong for horror, and the writing too old-fashioned and in love with its own intricacy and eccentricity (such as the peculiar and playful way Oates has with punctuation, especially her use of Italics). Not that the latter is a bad thing, of course.And Oates is not really interested in the mechanics and tropes of the genre either. One suspects that her publisher latched onto the convenient handle of 'selling' this to the Twilight crowd by appealing to their sense of the macabre. (Boy, are they in for a surprise. Stephanie Meyer cannot hold a candle to Joyce Carol Oates when its comes to perversion and bawdiness.)There are moments of ingenious horror, though, such as the bravura setpieces in the Bog Kingdom. But these are not enough to redeem what is an overlong, muddled pastiche of a novel that takes too long to get nowhere, in the end.And an entire chapter at the end, a religious sermon, no less, explaining THE PROVENANCE OF THE CURSE entirely in capitalised text? Maybe this is a horror novel after all ..."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30019-allison", "userReview": "No matter how great a book is, I am antsy. That's one of the reasons I have a hard time with longer books, in particular this one, because it takes many pages for very little to happen. Joyce Carol Oates is somewhat intimidating to me because she has such a large body of work that I don't know where to start. I started with The Accursed not intentionally, but by default--I love spooky stories. It's obvious that Oates is a fantastic writer. She created the world of Princeton, NJ in the early 20th century with such vividness, and weaved her gothic story into real history with such ease that I became newly curious about historical figures like Upton Sinclair, Woodrow Wilson, and Grover Cleveland. Still, the plot gets frequently bogged down by historical asides that go on for pages and pages.

I've read a fair amount of Oates' short fiction, so when this was suggested as a book club selection, I was enthusiastically in favor. However, I enjoyed this book less than anything else of Oates' I've read thus far.Don't get me wrong - the book is crafted with consummate skill. If someone told me they absolutely loved it, I couldn't argue that their feelings were wrong, or that the work is undeserving. A convincing case could easily be made that this is an excellent novel. It's just not one for me.Although billed as a 'gothic' novel, it felt a bit more like a 'family saga' where the 'family' is all of Princeton, NJ, in the early 20th century. The story is supposedly being told by an amateur historian in the 1970's, who is investigating the rumors of a 'curse' which affected the characters at that time. The 'voice' of the historian is intentionally intrusive, and while the way it's done is certainly clever, and might be found hilarious by some - I just found it annoying.However, the most disappointing thing about this work, for me, was not this faux-authorial voice, but the actual authorial voice. Joyce Carol Oates treats every single character in this book with disdain, painting each one in the worst light possible. Whether she's talking about the (pre-Presidential) university administrator Woodrow Wilson, or the Socialist Upton Sinclair, or a prominent socialite, or the author Jack London - all the characters we meet are bigoted, hypocritical, stupid, venal, insane, or a combination of those and other repulsive qualities. However, rather than feeling like, as readers, we're getting inside the heads of these flawed characters, we feel like we're simply being presented with flat caricatures of people. This caricature-like quality to the book made me feel distanced, and a bit bored, even when extremely dramatic and supernatural events were at hand. Which is not all the time, either. A great deal of the book deals in carefully crafted ambiguities - is there actually a curse at all, or is it all figments of the imagination of paranoid, hostile and high-strung individuals living in a time of racial oppression and sexual repression?It all wraps up with an ALL-CAPS epilogue which could easily have gotten its point across equally (or more) effectively with one-tenth the verbiage."}, {"userName": "Susan Rits", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11532992-susan-rits", "userReview": "Let me begin by saying I am a fan of Joyce Carol Oates.

It's difficult to even pin down what the book is about. Why is the snuff box so significant in the bewildering first chapter, yet never appears again? What exactly is the curse?

An attempt to patch together the story of those dark years, The Accursed is the manuscript of amateur historian (and descendant of a \"Cursed\" family) M.W. van Dyck II. He presents a series of excerpts from journals, letters, newspapers, even a coded diary, written during the time of the \"Curse,\" in an attempt to piece together the strange and horrible events that appear to have begun with the abduction of the innocent and beautiful Annabel Slade from the church on her wedding day. Between the covers you will find demon lovers, murderous jealousy, miscegenation, beckoning apparitions, even a fairy kingdom.

When I learned that her new novel was historical fiction set on and around the campus of the Ivy League University where she has been a professor of creative writing for over 30 years, I knew it was time to revisit both the author and the town.I first read JCO in the late 1980s. Languishing in Los Angeles, where I was involved in an attempt to \"go straight\" after years of rebellion and excess, by taking a course in management training, I haunted a used bookstore on Franklin Avenue and picked up Marya: A Life (1986). Plunged into a world of impoverished grit and abuse that shocked my soul, I began to suffer from delusions of being followed by creepy people. I even managed to get mugged one evening. The novel reawakened all my deepest childhood fears.Over the next decade I made my way through her first eight novels. I became aware of her mixed critical reception, including complaints about her overheated prolixity and the inevitable mockery that results from such relentless productivity. I moved on to other authors but never forgot her ability to take me to those dark places inherent in any human soul.I am here to tell you that she has not lost her touch. The Accursed chronicles a curse or horror that fell upon the upper crust of Princeton society in 1905-1906. Just beyond the Gilded Age, during which the rise of railroads and steel and coal mining created the most wealth our young country had ever known, the early years of the 20th century saw the stirrings of socialism, muckraking, workers unions and strikes. This novel captures it all.An array of well-known characters appear: Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University; ex-President of the United States Grover Cleveland; current President Teddy Roosevelt; Upton Sinclair, living just outside of town where he completed The Jungle; Jack London; Mark Twain; and even an individual claiming to be Sherlock Holmes. The main character though is none other than the Devil himself.The issue addressed is passion in its variegated forms and the manifestations that suppression of passion creates in society: illness, abduction, oppression, abuse, injustice, and madness. All of these roil beneath a veneer of wealth, privilege, religion, and intellectual pursuit amongst the wealthy businessmen and professors and clergy of Princeton, disturbing their families to the point that most are convinced a curse is abroad in the town.Oates speaks through the measured narrative voice of an historian, son of one accursed professor; also through the hysterical journal of a rich matron reduced to invalidism due to an \"unspeakable\" accident suffered during her honeymoon; and even through Woodrow Wilson's letters to his wife as well as to a love interest. When she is portraying the scenes of violence and degradation stemming from the curse, the voice is unmistakably hers.Not one character escapes the underlying satire wafting through this tale. While the novel masquerades as historical fiction it brings the reader face to face with our hypocrisies, our Puritan heritage, and our cruelties. As I said, Joyce Carol Oates has not lost her touch.I finished The Accursed feeling as ill as some of the characters, as insane as others, and as despairing. There are villains, there are heroes, there is evil and God, but who is who and which is which had confounded me for almost 700 pages. The world we \"see\" is not the world that is. As one of Oates' titles exhorts us, \"You Must Remember This.\""}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/906247-jean", "userReview": "This is not a modern 21st century novel. To read this book, you must put yourself mentally into the style of the book. If you read it this way, you will enjoy it. All the bad reviews are from people who couldn't do that. The book is the story of the mysterious supernatural events that took place in Princeton, New Jersey in 1905 and 1906, told from the point of view of one of the descendants of one of the families. He writes as if he were discovering all of this information through accounts, notes, diaries, etc. He digresses a lot, and has many asides and whole chapters of background, which bothered some reviewers, but it's all part of the premise. The best fun of the book is to see historical figures like Woodrow Wilson, Grover Cleveland, Upton Sinclair, and Jack London, interacting with fictional characters. Oates has done her homework on these people, finding interesting quirks. I now have to read a biography of Wilson to see if he was as nutty as Oates portrays him to be.The major plot line is the supernatural happenings focused on a fictional family - the Slades. There is a lot in the book about mysticism and religion the supernatural, which were popular at the time. There is a strong sub-theme about racism. And lots of other strands and sub-plots and mysteries. I enjoyed the book on several levels - historical insights, interesting plot and suspense. Oates is being ironic and poking fun at current (21st century) beliefs and prejudices. And the ending was excellent - a big surprise, only not really, because the author prepares the reader for the ending."}, {"userName": "Imi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi", "userReview": "This is a long, sprawling Gothic novel, with a mix of both fictional and historical characters, set in turn of the century, Princeton, United States. It's a mass of ideas, details, genres and political commentary, and, honestly, I found myself utterly overwhelmed at points. Part of me thinks that this novel needed a damn good edit, another thinks that perhaps if I was bit more well-versed in American political history then I would have done a little bit better at decoding the puzzles and mysteries. For a a novel of 600+ pages, the ending seemed a little rushed, despite other parts dragging. I'm pretty sure this was a bit of an odd choice for my first Oates' novel, but what I did like left me certain that I want to give more of her work a try."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17131437-peter", "userReview": "A local historian narrates this eerie tale of events in Princeton, New Jersey in 1905. The sleepy university hamlet is peopled by great figures--Woodrow Wilson (university president), Grover Cleveland (ex US president), Upton Sinclair (young Socialist writer)--as well as by the brahmins of New Jersey (the Slades, the FitzRandolphs). They are all intertwined in this ghost story starting with the abduction of a young Slade daughter from the altar at her wedding. People sight ghosts of loved ones gone over, there is a lynching, sleighs glide over (not on) the snow, a shape-shifting Fiend incites good people to murder, children die. Oh, its all so fun as the protagonists are drawn ever closer into a whirlpool of life and death. The Slade family seems to bear the brunt of the Fiend's malice: the four grandchildren of Winston Slade, (former New Jersey governor and Princeton president, and current much-loved Reverend) die in unusual circumstances. Others among the Brahmins suffer in strange ways. Some, but not all, is revealed in the Epilogue--miss that and you miss the point. There is a strong moral message here: Evil exists for the benefit of God and the faith of Man, and it is rampant because it is a win-win situation (God loves evil because its good for business; Man loves it because its fun). The characters are realized in fine detail, feeling true to the time and the scene. The prose is very fin de siecle American, the story is compelling--it all comes together to make a truly interesting read during which one gets a close view of the social tyranny, small mindedness, and provinciality of a small town inhabited by the best and the brightest."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "Why do I continue to torture myself this way?

I went in expecting a gothicky tale something along the lines of Oates novella \"Beasts\" but with some real \"beasts\". The blurb makes promises of demon grooms, ghosts, vampires and family curses. Do Not Be Fooled. It says nothing of dull old men with gout rambling on for what seems like a million pages.

Es gibt einen Lynchmord, dann wird ein Kind ermordet und ein seltsamer S\u00fcdstaatler dringt in die gesellschaftliche Elite des Ortes ein. Mit der Hochzeit von Annabel Slade, der Enkeltochter des betagten und angesehenen ehemaligen Universit\u00e4tsrektors Winslow Slade, mit einem Spr\u00f6ssling einer weiteren angesehenen Familie, steht au\u00dferdem ein gesellschaftliches Gro\u00dfereignis an. Und sp\u00e4testens am Tag dieser Hochzeit steht fest: Princeton wird von einem Fluch heimgesucht.Was soll ich zu diesem Buch sagen. Zun\u00e4chst einmal ist das Buch etwas ganz anderes, als die Inhaltsbeschreibung erwarten l\u00e4sst. Ich hatte es urspr\u00fcnglich als Gruselbuch f\u00fcr Halloween besorgt, aber gruselig ist das Buch kaum. Ja, es ist eine Gothic Novel, aber die \u00fcbersinnlichen Elemente sind eher grotesk als gruselig, sie haben etwas Expressionistisches. Au\u00dferdem stehen sie in dem Roman eher an untergeordneter Stelle, sie dienen vielmehr als Rahmen f\u00fcr die Diskussion mehrerer gesellschaftlicher Themen, und zwar Rassismus, Feminismus und Sozialismus. Mehrere herausragende Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten der damaligen Zeit treten in dem Buch auf \u2013 Woodrow Wilson, Upton Sinclair, Grover Cleveland, Jack London, Mark Twain \u2013 und keiner von ihnen kommt dabei gut weg, am ehesten noch der aufrichtige Sozialist Upton Sinclair. Ich wei\u00df nicht, mit welchen Quellen Joyce Carol Oates gearbeitet hat, aber zumindest die \u00e4u\u00dferst negative Darstellung von Jack London scheint mir nach etwas Internetrecherche \u00fcberzogen. Aber um hierzu mehr sagen zu k\u00f6nnen, bed\u00fcrfte es weiterer Recherche.Vor allem die Scheinheiligkeit der gesellschaftlichen Elite gegen\u00fcber Themen wie Rassismus und Frauenrechten stellt Joyce Carol Oates heraus. Ein Beispiel hierf\u00fcr sind die Gedankeng\u00e4nge Woodrow Wilsons in dem Buch: \u201cSo long as Negroes \u2013 darkies, as they were more fondly called, in Woodrow\u2019s childhood \u2013 knew their place, and were not derelict as servants and workers, Dr. Wilson had very little prejudice against them, in most respects.\u201d (Seite 18/19).Sicherlich ist dies es ein interessanter Ansatz, Gesellschaftskritik mit einer Gothic Novel zu verkn\u00fcpfen, doch was Joyce Carol Oates daraus macht, ist leider weniger spannend als nervt\u00f6tend. Denn es gibt keine gute Koh\u00e4sion zwischen den Kapiteln des Buchs, Oates erz\u00e4hlt mal hier, mal da, und verliert sich dabei in ellenlangen Abschweifungen, die von der grundlegenden Geschichte unabh\u00e4ngig sind und den Leser in zunehmendem Ma\u00dfe irritieren. Geschuldet ist dies teilweise nat\u00fcrlich auch der gew\u00e4hlten Erz\u00e4hlperspektive, denn Oates\u2019 Erz\u00e4hler ist ein Historiker, der die Geschichte des \u201cFluchs\u201d von Princeton anhand seiner verschiedenen Quellen schildert und dabei h\u00e4ufig Kapitel als Zwischenbemerkungen einf\u00fcgt. Diese \u201cAbschweifungen\u201d m\u00f6gen der Charakterisierung der jeweiligen Person dienen, beeintr\u00e4chtigen jedoch den Lesefluss und stellen die Geduld des Lesers auf die Probe.Sprachlich habe ich an dem Buch nichts auszusetzen, dass Joyce Carol Oates schreiben kann, ist offensichtlich.Der Schluss des Buchs ist erneut expressionistischer, grotesker Natur und die sich ergebende Schlussfolgerung eine eindeutige Religionskritik.Ich muss abschlie\u00dfend feststellen, dass ich die Motivation hinter dem Buch anerkenne, jedoch m\u00f6chte ich ein Buch nicht nur lesen, um es hinterher analysieren zu k\u00f6nnen oder zu m\u00fcssen. Ein Buch muss mir schon auch einen gewissen Genuss bieten, und der ist mir aufgrund er oben geschilderten Aspekte mit zunehmendem Lesefortschritt g\u00e4nzlich abhanden gekommen.Das Buch ist vieles, ein Lesevergn\u00fcgen war es f\u00fcr mich nicht."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17591646-lisa", "userReview": "There is no easy way to review this book just like there is no easy way to read it.The reader has a lot of work to do - it is up to you to decide exactly what happened here.Set in 1905-1906 in Princeton, New Jersey it follows the misfortunes of the Slade family with significant input from other families that surround them and including Woodrow Wilson who is president of Princeton University at the time and Upton Sinclair who had just achieved success with his book 'The Jungle'.The prose is meandering and seemingly random...some of it doesn't make any sense at all...but I do promise that if you stick with it right to the end there is a coherent story here hidden amongst the historical facts and supernatural inferences.I will admit to speed-reading some of the boring bits as the author encourages you to do so (there are lots of interjections from the author although you could ignore these bits if you wanted and not lose track of the story) because it is such a long book with so much information that you can choose whether you find it relevant or not.Kudos to Joyce Carol Oates for bringing all of this together with real historical content in addition to fiction and supernatural suggestions. This book is so full of information for you to make your decision on what you believe.This is as much a social commentary of the time as it is a Gothic historical fiction with supernatural undertones.Example of the questions raised in this book that give alternative explanations to the narrative - warning! - contains minor spoilers :-I think Todd Slade is one of my favourite characters as we suspect he suffers from autism which he and his family struggle with and is not identified but yet he is dragged into the supernatural too - which parts of his story are part of his disorder and which parts are beyond our world?

The story runs through the period of 1900-1910 this impressive tome deals with the issue of the moral hysteria that begins to wreak havoc within this claustrophobic community.As is usual with the wonderful Joyce Carol Oates this reading experience is akin more to a marathon than to a jog, and is all the more satisfying for it. Running at over 600 pages prepare to be immersed in a sprawling literary journey that is both breathtaking and masterful in its scope skilfully intergrating real life figures from American history, and unashamedly drawing the reader in to the less savoury sides of their characters. Many major themes of racism, sexism and mysoginism loom large throughout the book and Oates tackles these with aplomb and adopts a deliberately controversial viewpoint at times with the authorial voice resonating strongly. Oates is never one to shy away from the more controversial aspects of the characters she portrays and dares to challenge our preconceptions. Figures such as Woodrow Wilson, Grover Cleveland, Mark Twain, Jack London and Upton Sinclair himself move in and out of the plot, with Oates bluntly turning her pen, so to speak, on the less likeable characteristics particularly in relation to the political figures and within the greater context of the social issues of this period.  The plot is far too expansive to even begin to attempt to dissect in a review, but suffice to say that if you relish writing that reflets the Gothic tradition of the finest exponents of American fiction there is more than enough to sate your appetite. Opening with the elopement of a young bride with a man who may or may not be of supernatural stock the scene is set for further revelations of the demonic kind in this quintessential tale of terror and Gothic delights. Personally speaking, I found this highly reminiscent of Henry James- one of my favourites from the American canon- and I rather enjoy the experience of wading through literary treacle as it were, in the elongated descriptive passages, the incredibly slow burning plot and the minutiae of character detail that pays such close attention to historical fact.

I also think it tampers unduly with the suspension of disbelief and makes it harder to immerse into a story. I think it strains a boundary that really shouldn't be taxed for anything less than a clear and compelling artistic reason. And there is so rarely a reason. I didn't find one in Beautiful Ruins, I didn't find one in Loving Frank, and I don't find one here. Perhaps someday, fifty years from now, someone will write a novel about the demonic possession of Joyce Carol Oates and I'll find one there. That said...The Accursed purports to be a history written by M.W. van Dyck II - a native of Princeton, New Jersey and the direct descendant of one of the families afflicted by the strange and frightening events occurring in that town at the turn of the twentieth century. (Mr. van Dyck II might even be the spawn of the dark force in residence at that time - but that's not going to be anywhere near as exciting as it sounds.) This history, scribed in 1984 by the now-elderly, fussy and fairly pretentious van Dyck, revolves around the introduction of that dark force into Princeton proper and its impact on several well-heeled families, personages and famous authors with whom it came into contact. Woodrow Wilson has a central role, as does Upton Sinclair. Samuel Clemens, Jack London, Grover Cleveland, Teddy Roosevelt and the real Sherlock Holmes also make appearances - but the main focus falls to the esteemed family of Presbyterian minister Winslow Slade, his friends, neighbors and acquaintances, all of whom fall victim to eerie internal voices, evil choices and deadly consequences.Billed as a gothic tale of horror, Oates hits the mark with the miasmic tone. There are underpinnings of thick, nauseating suspense and outbreaks of sudden, relatively unexpected violence that satisfy the basic requirements of the genre. And if you are, as I am, attracted to the slow unfolding of genealogical drama, the book will hook you with its myriad minor, hereditary fascinations. I'm not sure the story needed its odd jaunts into discourse on racism, socialism, feminism, veganism and academic politics, but a case could be made that these served as elements of atmosphere.
