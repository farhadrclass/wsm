The Man Who Bridged the Mist won the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novella in 2011. a well-earned win.the story intrigued me, it saddened me, it made me happy and hopeful and it made me think about myself and the choices I've made in my life. it was excellent. smart prose, smart characterization, smart and sensitive author. also, a lot of technical detail about building a giant bridge in the sky, across a strange and terrible and fascinating mist.hey you can read this for free:http://www.kijjohnson.com/MistBridge.doc"}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "Every beginning is the end of something, but every ending is also the beginning of something new. Change will come everywhere, eventually. Bittersweet and hopeful and, more than anything else, inevitable. \n\"But it will still have been a wonderful thing, to cross the mist.\"\nI can't promise you that you will love this story. All I can say - I loved it completely, but I've always been a strange kid.It is an unusual story. It lacks the extensive worldbuilding we assume from the beginning it will bring us. It lacks the conflicts and the unexpected turns of events that we are so used to when thinking of a plot. Instead, it slowly but surely glides along in its own river of narrative, focusing not on the obvious that we can expect - the vast Empire, the strange mist and the ominous creatures it harbors, the potential conflicts between the bridge makers and the ferry drivers, the old and the new - but instead, through the bridge and its construction, it focuses on people and 'the invisible web of connections' they form when they slowly, through small and big actions change the world in millions of little ways.Kit Meinem, an engineer and an architect, comes from the capital of Empire to bridge the mist river on the sides of which, hidden by very tall levees, are the small provincial towns (villages, rather) of Nearside and Farside. We don't know what exactly the mist is - except that it's a strange pearly white corrosive substance that flows in the deep riverbed into an ocean just like water, and hidden in its depth are the 'fishes' and the 'Big Ones' (or, as a local joke has it, maybe just Fairly Large Ones). From the bits and pieces we hear, it's clear that the mist is dangerous, and the Big Ones are a clear source of well-deserved fear. The mist river, splitting the Country in half, is only crossed by select few in the ferries, each time setting on a journey on which they know they can perish any time, guided by little else but courage and a gut instinct that on this particular day they can cross the mist and live to see another sunrise.\n\"\u200bThe mist streams he had bridged had not prepared him for anything like this. Those were tidy little flows, more like fog collecting in hollows than this. From this angle, the river no longer seemed a smooth flow of creamy whiteness, nor even gently heaped clouds. The mist forced itself into hillocks and hollows, tight slopes perhaps twenty feet high that folded into one another. It had a surface but it was irregular, cracked in places and translucent in others. The boundary didn\u2019t seem as clearly defined as that between water and air.\"\nKit Meinem comes here with the plans to undertake a massive construction project - a suspension bridge that will cross the mist river, connecting the parts of the country, making crossing the river a mundane activity instead of a daring and often doomed feat of courage, eliminating the need for ferry crossing, and - as everyone knows - put an end to the world as it used to be, bridging it to a different future.\n\"\u200bAfter a while, Kit noticed that a large part of the pattern that made a bridge or a tower was built entirely of people.\"\nAnd so the story flows through the five years Kit spends slowly but surely planning and overseeing the construction of the bridge - a feat thought almost impossible and yet inevitably progressing to its completion. Kit forms the 'invisible web of connections' with the towns and their inhabitants - especially with Rasali Ferry, a woman for whom the perilous crossing of the mist river in a ferry boat is both a curse and exhilarating destiny, whose work will be made obsolete when the bridge is finished and the dreaded 'Big Ones' are little but the creatures occasionally glimpsed from the towering height of the bridge, left behind in the wake of progress. \nHe had a sudden vision of the bridge overhead, a black span bisecting the star-spun sky, the parabolic arch of the chains perhaps visible, perhaps not. People would stride across the river an arrow\u2019s flight overhead, unaware of this place beneath. Perhaps they would stop and look over the bridge\u2019s railings but they would be too high to see the fish as any but small shadows\u2014supposing they saw them at all, supposing they stopped at all. The Big Ones would be novelties, weird creatures that caused a safe shiver, like hearing a frightening story late at night.\u200bPerhaps Rasali saw the same thing for she said suddenly, \u201cYour bridge. It will change all this.\u201d\nThe entire story flows like a chronicle of sorts - a big feat to accomplish in a comparatively short novella. (It reminds me actually of the spirit of Ivo Andric's The Bridge on the Drina, the underappreciated in the Western world epic Nobel Prize winning chronicle of a real life bridge in Bosnia). Through the narration that at times has almost a dreamlike quality to it, through brief glimpses of the construction over several years we see the surrounding towns grow and change, people change, new connections grow and form - the people and the bridge alike - and through all of this the growth and change even in Kit, the quietly unhappy precise and measured man who set out to alter the world.\n\u200b\u201cI know. You do care. But inside the framework of a project. Right now it\u2019s your studies. Later it\u2019ll be roads and bridges. But people around you\u2014their lives go on outside the framework. They\u2019re not just tools to your hand, even likable tools. Your life should go on, too. You should have more than roads to live for. Because if something does go wrong, you\u2019ll need what you\u2019re feeling to matter, to someone somewhere, anyway.\u201d\nThis short novella has mesmerized me, has spoken to something inside of me that both embraces and fears the change, the movement, the flow of history and life. The inevitable movement of change of history, the progress propelled by people with the vision, the subtle and not-so-subtle changes moving forward creates in the community, the good and the bad and the unstoppable that comes with it, and the thought that every end is a beginning of something new, and every beginning is the end of something old.\n\u201cDid I change the world?\u201d He knew the answer already.\u200bShe looked at him for a moment as though trying to gauge his feelings. \u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly after a moment. [...] \u200b\u201cThese cables will fail eventually, these stones will fall\u2014but not the dream of crossing the mist, the dream of connection. Now that we know it can happen, it will always be here.\u201d\n------------You can read this award-winning novella free on Kij Johnson's website-: http://www.kijjohnson.com/MistBridge.doc"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The river of Mist, an almost living organism, divides the Empire in two. A few Ferries make dangerous and treacherous journeys across the Mist when they can, trusting in good fortune and the uncanny skills of those plying the trade. *** A bridge across the Mist will greatly ease the suffering of those who risk crossing the river. The last bridge builder sent by the Empire died while building it. *** Kit now comes to the town of Nearside to complete the task left unfinished by the dead bridge builder. Will he be the man who will finally bridge the Mist?My Review: My Goodreads friend Nataliya recommended this novella to me today. The title, as beautiful and evocative as this author's debut collection of short fiction's was (At the Mouth of the River of Bees), hooked me; the Doc's warble of rapture sealed the deal.There was for everything a possibility, an invisible pattern that could be made manifest given work and the right materials.Bless you, dear Doc, bless you and those whose hurts and harms you heal with that magiqckal ability to see and fix a pattern. This story was a piece of my own pattern that was missing, and you gave it to me.This tale of a man in a world not entirely like our own, a man whose purpose is to function and whose function is to build, that needs a way to communicate and connect its parts. Technology isn't advanced, and there's not even a HINT of majgicqk to sully the handsome, spare caternary curve of the story. It is a story of a world beset by troubles we know bone-deep, connection and confusion and longing and fear. And every character, no matter how fleeting their time or how small their space on the page, carries the weight of their piece of the pattern fairly and squarely. This is how I know I'm in the presence of top-quality writing. I see the pattern, I sense the supporting structure, and I am still *in* the story. Many writers write lovely sentences and many others imagine some strong characters, relatable and investible, and many many more create stories that bind and grip and sweep and carry me away. A very few do two of these things, and a vanishingly small number do them all. In this work, Johnson has done them all.In a fortyish-page novella, five years of toil and change and death and learning fold into a structure as deceptively simple as an origami crane. The slow and unhurried pace at which the folds present themselves belies the time it took to craft them as well as the conciseness of their delivery. It is never easy to be brief. It is much more demanding to satisfy the jaded, spoiled-for-choice reader in a compact package.\u201cThe soul often hangs in a balance of some sort. Tonight do I lie down in the high fields with Dirk Tanner or not? At the fair, do I buy ribbons or wine? For the new ferry\u2019s headboard, do I use camphor or pearwood? Small things. A kiss, a ribbon, a grain that coaxes the knife this way or that. They are not, Kit Meinem of Atyar. Our souls wait for our answer because any answer changes us. This is why I wait to decide what I feel about your bridge. I\u2019m waiting until I know how I will be changed.\u201d\u201cYou never know how things will change you,\u201d Kit said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you have not waited to find out.\u201dSimple, direct, truthful, and (for me anyway) resonant with truth.Perhaps the defining moment of the story, the bridging of the Mist River, came for me when Kit and Rasali experience a deeply, intensely frightening encounter with the Mist. Reflecting on it, and on the death that comes for us all at some time we can't know for sure, Kij Johnson rang my eyes like gongs:\u201cIf {Death} comes for you?\u201d he said. \u201cWould you be so sanguine then?\u201dShe laughed and the pensiveness was gone. \u201cNo indeed. I will curse the stars and go down fighting. But it will still have been a wonderful thing, to cross the mist.\u201dWon't it, though?\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "\u201cThe soul often hangs in a balance of some sort.

There is a river of mist that is caustic like acid and in it swims indefinable monsters. There is an Empire that is split in two by the mist, there are families and friends whose lives are defined by what separates them, and there are families who accept a generational sacrifice for the duties placed upon them by the obstacles.Like the best storytellers, Johnson shares with us what needs to be known and leaves a lot of mystery, we end with questions unanswered and ambiguities unexplained. I am sure there will be those who want MORE, MORE, MORE \u2013 a trilogy, a series of Mist with an accompanying graphic novels \u2013 but I hope not. Johnson has given us a wonderful gift, a beautifully written, minimalistic treasure, a work that stands alone.I cannot help comparing this to Lucius Shepard\u2019s brilliant The Dragon Griaule stories."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/642041-sarah", "userReview": "I like stories that lie on this particular border of fantasy and science fiction: stories set in strange cultures or places that are in themselves the fantastic element, allowing the focus to be on the characters and how they react to their environment.

Once complete, this bridge will join the Empire, currently split by the Mist, and herald significant changes to the two towns, including the end of the need for the Ferryfolk.Plot: Kit needs to build a bridge and get over it. No, I\u2019m not kidding, that\u2019s pretty much the entirety of the plot.Characters: What\u2019s lacking in plot is made up for in characterisation. We get significant insight and character development of Kit, who approaches initially as a somewhat aloof character trying not to alienate the townsfolk and ends up forming solid friendships and relationships with them. We also get snippets of characterisation from a number of townsfolk and people in Kit\u2019s life, including Rasali Ferry of Farside, the lead Ferrywoman, who\u2019s livelihood and meaning in life will be rendered obsolete if the bridge is completed.Scope: In one way, this novella is very small in scope, focussing entirely on Kit and the building of the bridge, with no coverage of the Empire, the Mist, or any of the rest of the world. In another way, the novella is wide in scope, and examines the importance of human interaction and personalities in completing large projects and the significant changes in Kit\u2019s life through the relationships he forms with the townsfolk and his lover.Writing: Nothing specific to comment on, writing wise.Pacing: The pacing is reasonable, with a steady build up (pun intended) towards the completion of the bridge. There are some appropriate interludes, cleverly done, based on emotions and events, which allow us to see even more of Kit\u2019s character development.Other Comments: I found the ending of the novella very anti-climactic and this left me rather dissatisfied with the story as a whole. I wanted to know more about the Empire, about the Mist and about the world, none of which was forthcoming.Overall: I suspect that for the reader who likes character driven stories, this would have been a very enjoyable novella. However, as more of a plot driven reader, I didn\u2019t enjoy it that much."}, {"userName": "G33z3r", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r", "userReview": "An extremely entertaining story concerning the construction of a bridge across a chasm filled with a strange mist, and of the man who oversees that construction, and the effect he has on the people on either side of the chasm.

Kit is a bridge builder who has come to build a bridge across the mist. This mist \"river\" slices the empire nearly in half. The only way to cross the mist is by ferry, which is more than a little treacherous. The mist is dangerous and mysterious. Its properties are neither thoroughly explained, nor really Known. There are dangerous creatures that live in the mist and it seems to be largely unpredictable.This story isn't about the mist, though, although it is almost its own character. The story is about Kit and not just his building of the bridge, but his life, his character and his relationship with the townsfolk and other workers, especially the ferry-woman Rasali, whose livelihood (and love) his bridge will destroy. I love the townsfolk, the characters, their feelings and acceptance of life. I love the environment and the weirdness and zen of it all.This work is complicated and deep, gentle and sophisticated. I've only read a couple of Johnson's other works and she's just a consistently phenomenal writer.

Et bien que le concept d'un pont sur la brume intense soit original et invitant, je trouve que l'on a mal exploit\u00e9 le sujet, car la SF dans cette plaquette devient plut\u00f4t un pr\u00e9texte pour l'int\u00e9riorisation et le d\u00e9veloppement du portrait psychologique des personnages.

The story is as the title suggested, but the mist is a thick, poisonous river that houses dangerous creatures. It also focuses on the bridge builder, Kit Meinem, and his relationship with the town-folk on either side of the mist, and with Rasali Ferry, one of the few ferry captains who cross the treacherous mist.A delightful and entertaining story dealing with the interconnection of people, and how we deal with change."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11024213-patrick", "userReview": "I asked myself why the hell I was reading this on every page. A man sets out to build a bridge; he builds a bridge; wins both Hugo and Nebula. What? Don't tell me one ought to read this for the characters. There are no characters here. Read Wendell Berry, Chekhov, Hilary Mantel, whoever. Those are characters. They cast shadows. They make hard choices. They achieve genuine insights.

The first impression was how it lacked that verve and immediate sense of purpose that \u201cSpar\u201d and \u201cMantis Wives\u201d have from their first paragraphs, even though the story is so deliberate that the lead\u2019s desire is its title. Here we follow an outsider, who was an anti-social bookworm as a kid and is now a frequent traveler and engineer of difficult structures, planning to build a bridge across a giant river of caustic mist, beneath which moves dangerous creatures only called \u201cthe Big Ones.\u201d The territory of the Empire is split by this river, and it will change the course of commerce if he can erect this great bridge.In terms of Fantasy, it\u2019s nice reading a story about simple construction, no war or epic destiny waiting on it. He\u2019s never besieged by orcs, though sometimes by bad weather. And he has an interesting side, particularly early on when he observes that \u201ca large part of the pattern\u201d of building a bridge is made up of people. It\u2019s exciting to get a sociological view on how to motivate the locals to yield materials and brave dangerous work to construct something the likes of which the world has never seen.But the sociology falls away very quickly, and while we meet some interesting faces, they\u2019re washed aside by tide of other non-recurring names. It\u2019s a bummer to meet the eccentric hands-on Liu Breaker and then have her never resume a speaking role again, especially when the dialogue begins to shift to our lead\u2019s pathos. He mourns the world he\u2019s changing, what he\u2019s taking away from ferry captains and the like, and does so exclusively in talking. There\u2019s never a revealing action; the novella devolves into the announcement of melancholy, which is not something I\u2019d cross a bridge for.What we come for is that Johnson verve, and there\u2019s still some of it keeping it above a typical story. That first page crinkles with details, with golden limestone walls and the schematics hidden in folios. And she lands some memorable lines \u2013 \u201cAnything is safe until it kills you\u201d could have been an alternate title."}], "description": "Novella.Nebula Award for best novella of 2011.Hugo Award for best novella of 2011.Sturgeon Award finalist for best short SF of 2011 (Johnson is a juror, thus withdrew it from contention).Locus Award finalist for best novella of 2011.Kit came to Nearside with two trunks and an oiled-cloth folio full of plans...", "title": "The Man Who Bridged the Mist", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554238-the-man-who-bridged-the-mist", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332267535l/13554238.jpg", "reviews": 64, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/110153.Kij_Johnson", "name": "Kij Johnson"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Short Stories", "Novella", "Speculative Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554238-the-man-who-bridged-the-mist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17086022-the-man-who-bridged-the-mist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31694093-un-pont-sur-la-brume", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29635545-the-dream-quest-of-vellitt-boe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12970063-at-the-mouth-of-the-river-of-bees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189022.The_Fox_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10452275-ponies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189015.Fudoki", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
