We are all scarecrows.Two boys and a dog are on the banks of a river, watching debris stream by--furniture, uniforms from past wars, clothing from other eras, the carcasses of cats and farm animals. In other words, German history.The two friends are Walter Matern and Eduard Amsel, who is not-so-secretly half-Jewish. Eddi is an artist and a thinker; Matern is the physical one, acting as his bodyguard. Together with a gang of friends, he was happily beating the overweight Eddi in the schoolyard, when for no reason he could understand, he suddenly switched sides. The two boys are inseparable, growing up in the flat farmland near the Vistula. One day, little Amsel discovers that he's an artist; he makes scarecrows out of sticks and pipes and discarded clothing, miraculous scarecrows that do an unnaturally good job of scaring crows away. Everyone wants one. But over time, the scarecrows come to resemble people Amsel knows, culminating in a fearsome bird monster. (This made me think Grass must have read Bruno Schulz.) The townspeople turn on him, making him destroy his collection and his studio, forcing him to leave town.Later in the novel, when Hitler is firmly in control of Germany, Amsel, now a young man, smiles and tries eagerly to fit in. In the novel's most chilling scene, Matern, seduced by the deadly tribal brotherhood of the brown-shirted Storm Troopers, leads a brutal attack on his oldest friend, viciously smashing every one of his teeth. A changed Eddi Amsel rises from the earth, packs a suitcase and slips away into the night.The second section of the novel is written as a series of letters from the morally ambivalent everyman Harry Liebenau to his beloved cousin Tula, detailing their childhood, his experiences as a soldier, and the history and pedigree of the German Shepherd Prinz, Hitler's favorite dog. The final part of the narrative belongs to a repentant Walter, with a hilariously vengeful tour through postwar Germany, eventually bringing him back together with his old friend Amsel. I don't have the words to properly laud this immensely powerful book. It\u2019s a distillation of poetic wordplay, human nature, philosophy, myth and history. It is, by turns, gentle, witty, wise, unforgiving, sorrowing, terrifying, compassionate, critical, pornographic, scatalogical, and savagely funny. Dog Years is a masterpiece of German literature, a deep, long, broad exploration of that terrible time in history when millions of ordinary people, all together, took leave of their senses--a book that manages to be an apology, a celebration and a warning."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/901128-john", "userReview": "I haven't read this book for a while now, but I have read it over and over. I had to put it on the list because it's my favorite book of all time and this seems like a logical place to say so. When Dog Years gets talked about it is generally said to be a lesser creation than The Tin Drum, which is kind of a companion. Actually the two are part of Grass's Danzig trilogy, which also includes Cat and Mouse. Anyway, I've always felt the critics didn't understand the most important thing about Dog Years, which is that it has an amazing underlying form that acts as a simultaneous interpretation of the events it relates. The story is about two boys, a Jew and a gentile, who become friends in the years leading up to WWII, and what happens to their friendship when the war intervenes. But the underlying form is about how the war was the end of time for Germany; everything that happens after the war in Grass's book is a retrograde of what happened before, as though the war eliminated the future and the only choice besides dying completely was for the whole nation to turn around and go back. So even though the narrative time continues forward, all the events after the war have their corresponding events in the beginning of the book. By the end of the book there's a scene where the two boys, now much older, are soaking in bathtubs in adjoining rooms, as though time had gone back past their births and put them back in their separate wombs so they would have another chance to make better choices in their lives. That's the most inventive strategy for drawing conclusions about a story that I've ever seen. Obviously, I recommend Dog Years highly."}, {"userName": "Manisha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29882975-manisha", "userReview": "I miss the brilliance that was The Tin DrumDog Years was a difficult read. It was dense, it was slow-moving, and by the end of it, I felt a sense of accomplishment and relief, and yet, I cannot for the life of me tell you what this book is really about. I could appreciate what Grass was focusing on, which was the aftermath of the war in Germany. However, as someone who knows precious little about that period, I didn\u2019t understand most of the story. I believe this book was written for those who know the history of Germany, because I felt like I missed something from the beginning and I never understood what I missed by the end of the book. The references went over my head, as they weren\u2019t referenced more than once (in some instances), or because they referenced something else that I didn\u2019t understand. Hence, if you know the history of Post-War Germany, you would probably enjoy this book more than me. Unlike his previous books where Grass took the time to explain what life was like in Germany during the war, Dog Years didn\u2019t take the time to explain what life was like after this horrible period of history. I could understand some aspects of it due to a personal experience. I only wish I understood the references."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cWhat does a river like the Vistula carry away with it?

I can only try and channel my impression of this book with whatever vividness I can muster.So, the Dog Years. It is not just a quirkily contrived novel about the German and the Jew, or a painful, touching journey into the worse half of the maddest century, or the third book in the Danzig trilogy by G. Grass the Nobel Prize winner, of The Tin Drum fame.It is not just a novel, it is as much a novel as it is a musical instrument, and a riddle to solve, a jigsaw puzzle of references both insidious and outsidious, with leitmotives and murder motives as resounding musical strings throughout the novel's length. One must confess, though, that it is indeed first and foremost a quirky novel with a plot which is not only non-linear, but curvilinear, with different points of the curve tied by those resounding strings of divers colours: in the most unexpected places you shall see the familiar syntax of a hundred pages ago, you shall see a seemingly random phrase spring up here and there like a skipping pebble thrown on the river's surface by a kid.I revelled in solving this puzzle like one would solve a Rubik's cube, in figuring out what exactly the \"dog years\" mean, and why is the number thirty two everywhere, and why the scarecrows and the twelve headless nuns. But that's only a part of the picture, not all. It's not simply about enjoyment or historical and literary allusions galore. I don't want to see and hear all these strings plucked simply for the sake of plucking. Technique, when lifeless, reeks of vacuity.It's the same as with music. There is rhythm, which one enjoys and then there is melody, which one feels resounding in one's own heart and without which the rhythm nigh loses its purpose. So it is with this book.The leitmotives are the strings for your own hand to touch and pluck. The depth is immense, the melody is echoing, the jest is infinite, the sadness is infinite, the world is within grasp, grasped by the author, nourished by the author, held out to us.Go no further. Read this book. I can never convince you enough. I can only channel my impression, which I did.Nevermind my nonsense.

I suggest tackling it the same way I did: read The Tin Drum, start Reddick's book at the same time you start Cat and Mouse (Reddick reads faster than Grass, and you'll get through a lot of Reddick while tackling Grass), and when you've caught up, read Reddick's section on Dog Years and the actual novel concurrently.Those of you who feel the revelation of anything having to do with a book before you get to that part in the book is a spoiler should probably avoid this technique; Reddick revelas the major \"mystery\" in Dog Years towards the end of his section on Cat and Mouse. However, one cannot really consider Dog Years a mystery, despite the various things that happen within it; while there are some elements to it that keep the reader guessing, Dog Years is, more than anything, a savage satire on Germany during the WW2 years. And as such, finding out the main mystery-that's-not-a-mystery should not detract at all from one's appreciation of the book itself.Dog Years can also stand on its own, without being read as a part of the Danzig Trilogy, but the reader's appreciation of many facets of this novel-- most notably Edouard Amsel's character and the satire itself-- are more easily appreciated when you have The Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse under your belt as comparisons. Amsel, the main protagonist of Dog Years, stands as a direct comparison to both Oskar and Mahlke, and his character is more easily understood when those two have already been assimilated by the reader.The plot of Dog Years is a simple enough one; it charts, through the use of three narrators, the frindship of Edouard Amsel and Walter Matern from grade school through their early thirties. Amsel, the intellectual one, is picked on constantly by his classmates (including Matern) until one day, for no apparent reason, Matern befriends Amsel and chases away the others. It's a typical buddy-relationship in that Amsel is the brains and Matern is the brawn, but we don't get the bonding we've come to expect from seeing too many Hollywood buddy films. The relationship between Matern and Amsel is far more complex than that, and Reddick has done a passable job of interpreting it, one which I won't attempt to recreate here (it would be ludicrous to attempt something that complex in such a forum as a review). In an odd lapse, though-- especially given how much emphasis Reddick has put on Grass' enmity and stire of the Roman Catholic Church in the previous two books-- Reddick seems to have overlooked one of the most obvious interpretations of Amsel's character (and also that of the more minor protagonist Jenny Brunies), as a christ figure. In the novel's central scene, both Amsel and Brunies (who are both made out, in the first half of the novel, to be almost comically fat) undergo a transformation that transforms Brunies into a ballet sensation and Amsel into another character entirely, the omnipotent Goldmouth; while there is no physical crucifixion here, the path taken by Amsel's character through the rest of the novel certainly implies the path of christ after the resurrection, until his assumption into, in this case, Berlin. For the next hundred or so pages, Goldmouth is never actually seen, only referred to in the good deeds he does for others, and he achieves an almost legendary status among the rank and file for his goodness, his power (in postwar germany, his power is in his connections; who he knows), and the fact that no one really sees him much, but everyone is aware of his presence and his acts. However, Reddick, in his attempt to (successfully) parallel Amsel's character with that of Grass himself, never examines this aspect of Amsel.This lack also leads to Reddick drawing the conclusion that Dog Years is the weakest of the three books, while still proclaiming that as a whole they rank as the finest piece of modern German literature extant today. I feel Reddick is giving Dog Years short shrift here; while the book does, in fact, have its faults, they are faults shared by the other two novels as well, and I came away from Dog Years thinking that, to the contrary, it was the strongest and most absorbing of the three. While it was more difficult than the other two, it was also more rewarding and more absorbing; it's not often I'll put in three months on one novel, but at no time did I feel that it ever stopped moving me along, and at no time did I ever feel that it was time to put the book down for good.Keeping this seeming oversight of Reddick's in mind, I still have to recommend his book as a perfect accompaniment to Grass' most famous three novels, and all four of them deserve the attention of every serious student of literature."}, {"userName": "Lorenzo Berardi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/183865-lorenzo-berardi", "userReview": "Arf...whoof...I did it!But it wasn't that easy.Now I feel like the dog printed in the front cover of this book and drawn by Grass himself. A dog with its tongue out after a long run all through unknown narrative woods.Just like \"Prinz\" did, escaping from his famous black moustached owner in the siege of Berlin crossing river Elbe somehow. Well, despite of its quick appearance \"Prinz\" the dog is the main character of this book standing as a symbol of quite many things:freedom, stubborness, human stupidity, struggle of life, disobedience. Those were the Dog Years. This book talks about them. The novel is good and interesting, but technically is not a novel. There are amazing and enjoyable parts as well as heavy and obscure paragraphs. You could look at the style used by Grass gere as a German way of the \"stream of consciousness\". You won't find any Leopold Bloom here, though. But at least there is some brilliant irony.\"Dog Years\" is undeniably a rather chaotic book, accumulating symbolism, historic references, peculiar ways of speaking and grotesque characters. And yet this novel was very stimulating way for my poor little brains albeit I would have preferred a clearer distinction among the different characters in this very original frame. But, hey! We're talking about Guenter Grass, after all... Anyway.I confess how I skipped over many pages of this novel. It was necessary. Besides, my Italian edition was printed in a very bad way, making the reading process strenuous and uneasy after page 80 (I had to bend the whole book for being able to read the end of each sentence on the even pages).For those who are not prepared enough, I warn you: this novel will probably make you stoned, but still is a goldmine of useful informations about life in that thin German/Polish line before the blast of World War II. Just read it with a strong preliminary K-ration of patience and your tail will have its dance."}, {"userName": "Martina Keller", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4946648-martina-keller", "userReview": "Whew! After finishing this book, I feel like what it must feel like when someone summits Mt. Everest -- an extremely difficult journey but a strong sense of accomplishment in the end. This is my 4th G\u00fcnter Grass book, and by far, the most challenging to read. On many different levels I feel that this is not a book intended for any audience other than a post-war German one. Without knowing the intricate details of post-war German political and social history, some of the material is simply unreachable. For those of us outside of Germany who know a little bit about the pre- and post war times through family and other literature, the book does offer that uniquely unfiltered perspective of the German collective psyche that only Grass can offer the English speaking reader. There is within these pages an actual story, though it is sometimes hard to find amidst the mountains of stream-of consciousness ala Joyce and other poetic conventions going on. In fact, the story is at times a compelling one. I found myself wondering what this book could have been if it had been told by a more direct storytelling voice - such as that of John Irving. In the end, it is not a book I would recommend to the average American reader."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133684-john", "userReview": "A boy throws a penknife into the Vistula, grinding his teeth.

and rich. Grass is a complex writer. He kind of reminded me of Faulkner in his style sometimes, although he's not exactly Faulknerian with run-on sentences and all. I just got the impression that his sentences and paragraphs sort of circled around into each other. At times his writing feels hypnotic. By the time I got to the end of the book, I realized that that was the point. German history had sort of circled itself. The whole book is a sort of a return--a circling back to what Germany had been before the war. But can one go back after visiting such horror on one's neighbor? How do you ever recuperate, personally and nationally, from the enormity of evil visited on Germany? On Europe? And yet, history floats past, just on the surface of the German conscience, just as it floats by on the surface of the Vistula River; it is reviewed, if not critically evaluated, the stuff in the river is there. The book ends with the two main characters bathing, cleansing. It didn't strike me until a couple hours after finishing what a fitting end it is to a book that begins with the flooded consciousness that was postwar Germany. I feel a little overwhelmed, having just put this book down. I can't quite wrap my head around what I've just experienced. Again, it was a difficult read, but that's no reason to put it down. Dig through it, friends.

I read the Tin Drum in 1964 and Dog Years 50 years later.Grass stands as one of the few authors willing to get to grips with Germany's past. His evocations of the multiple ethnicities of the \"germanic\" space never fail to impress and enchant. His accounts of the events until the demise of Hitler are excellent. Where he falters to my mind is with his social democrat interpretation of the wirtschaftwunder. He satirizes the hypocrisy and complacency of the fifties, but without giving credit to the real economic achievements of the era. But it was a shattered time. Much has happened since reunification. Germany experienced an economically difficult period. It has had to come to terms with the presence of a large non-German population and in many ways Germany is now the economic powerhouse of Europe. Read this book for insights into Germany's struggle with the past. And remember that there are plenty of scarecrows in every nation's closet. Not an easy read, but one I would recommend to every serious explorer of European history."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020845-robert", "userReview": "I determined to read the rest of the Danzig Trilogy after enjoying The Tin Drum a great deal, and I thought that if I wasn't overwhelmed by that epic, there couldn't be anything to dread in the others, could there?

The portions set in the Free City of Danzig and in Nazi Germany are the best; the postwar German episodes -- when the character Walter Matern takes his revenge -- start off strong, but they ultimately do not work as well.In the section section in particular, Grass is clearly having some fun at Martin Heidegger's expense, with amusing results. I might find this even funnier if I actually read Heidegger, but that's not worth it."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5958401-peter", "userReview": "[This is a truly great novel which warrants the effort and extra reading required to get under it's skin.It needs to be grappled with, given a little extra mental exertion in order to understand it's underlying themes, images and references. It's worth it! It needs to be read at least twice! It took me some time to get to grips with Herr Grass' rather dense poetic literary style; kind of like adjusting your focus of the whole in order to see the details. Once I tuned in, so to speak, I began to really enjoy this book and find it fascinating. It is a dense narrative recipe, steeped in German myth, legend, literature and history, with irony, sharp satire, allusion, allegory, symbolism, poetic imagery and a good dose of sardonic humour all cooked into a razor sharp historical critique(see link below);it is much akin and similar in style to The Tin Drum, and much said about that book also applies here, since the narratives interlink, tessellate and refer to one another, however, THIS BOOK IS FAR, FAR BETTER!This is partly because it is written from different perspectives, which subverts The Tin Drum narrative into itself rather than the other way around,(Oskar Bronski/Matzerath is mentioned several times whilst scenes described in the Tin Drum are retold here from another's perspective) but also, more importantly, because this novel is the spine of the Danzig trilogy essentially expressing Grass' understanding, critique and interpretation of Germany's pre and post war history. This is it's structure which essentially underpins it's own narrative and that of the other two novels ( 'The Tin Drum' & 'Cat and mouse').The central axis' which creates the underlying form (and indeed symmetry) of the novel is primarily the time line, de-marked by a lineage of pedigree black German Shepherds and the scarecrow creations of Eddi Amsel. Various relational narratives and character juxtapositions are written over this, creating depth, meaning etc... The Dog line begins in Lithuanian and culminates in the Fuhrers pet dog. The main characters and narrators all own or have some connection with one of the dogs of this lineage,( \"The dog stands central\" to quote the book). The dog's presence is symbolic, in the narrative, of a demonic, evil influence, an image from Prussian folk lore. Meanwhile, the initial type of scarecrows are caricatures of rustic local people, in the next stage they portray Prussian historical and legendary figures and finally they become caricatures of Nazi German citizenship in general; mechanised automatons that can only march and salute. This time line reaches a wartime peak then carries on in real time whilst the narrative through various episodes turns back on itself and is carried along with the story of Walter Matern; effectively the (anti)hero of the book, as he returns from the war, ostensible seeking his old friend Eddi Amsel and revenge on various ex Nazis. We are taken on a search; for pre war, united Germany, a lost home and friendship, and an attempt to culturally pick up where things were historically left off; this proves to be impossible. Consequently we witness a regurgitated replicated repetition, through various literary devices, of certain pre-war events, scenes and motifs. Several events constitute turning points or the centre of the novel; Hitler's Dog, Prinz, elopes just before the capture of Berlin by the Allied Forces and the end of the war, and chooses Walter Matern as his new owner, two children are magically transformed by snow and violence and, interestingly, Oskar Matzerath (narrator of The Tin Drum) drums whilst walking between two girls, Jenny and Ursula 'Tulla' liebenau,a thing that no other character would dare to do, thus illustrating my earlier point about this books place in the Danzig Trilogy.There are 2/3 important relationships, but central is the friendship between two boys; Eddi Amsel,a gifted catholic German Jew and Walter Matern an athletic German protestant and Left wing Activist. Both grow up kicking around on the river Vistula, which symbolically brings the flotsam and jetsam of history to their feet. Both are artists; Matern' an actor and Amsel, a sculpture/ fine artist. The latter makes scarecrow characatures of Germanic historical figures from the river debris. Neither is overtly Nazi; in fact Matern finds himself in repeated trouble for voicing his anti Nazi convictions and Amsel is forbidden because of his Jewish parentage yet both become, on the simple basis and pure fact that they ARE German,complicit in perpetuating or inheriting the Nazi legacy, which alludes to the moral anbiguity inherent in the human condition and the inadequecy of simplistic judgments of right and wrong when grappling towards an understanding of the period:maybe Grass is even saying that Nazi expression of fascism was inherent in Prussic culture? Ironically , the only anti-Semitic speech in the entire novel is spoken by Amsel and the only character to be publicly called to account for Nazism, and asked to answer for it is Matern. another relationship is that between; Jenny Brunnies, a gypsy orphan and Eddi Amsel. Again both are artists, Jenny is a ballet dancer. Both become mythically, magical transformed by snow and Nazi anti-Semitic violence (or just plain bullying) into magical, thinner, more focused reinventions of themselves. In their new persona's both become popular cultural, artistic characters in Wartime and post War Germany. Amsel changes his name and becomes an elusive figure whose influence is non the less wide ranging, even ubiquitous. There is also a juxtaposition between Jenny and the thoroughly unlikeable Ursula 'Tulla' Liebenau, a dog owner, both are the set against one another as objects of the narrators desire, the meaning of which has thus far eluded me.'Tulla' is a name given from Folklore and superstition, a nymph or demon.The story of these characters is the story of Germany. Grass certainly suggests that the war was a peak, a watershed for German culture which essentially disintegrated afterwards and became a superficial alliance of left and right wing politics, essentially a copy of itself.The story of Germany then; it's national identity,is that it was essentially destroyed by the war, that the War was the summation, the peak of Prussic culture and that, the Nazi nihilism evident in the final days of war was a cultural death; the final word on the culture that preceded it.This is a fascinating, extremely clever, complex, thought provoking novel.for some help in understanding the mythical elements follow this linkhttp://www.lituanus.org/1973/73_1_05.htmFavourite Quote from Text:-\" Slavish wisdom, Slavish fears!all, without distinction, cooked according to the same recipe.Bankbooks in their hearts, jungle without claws,hygienic pipedreams, neither good or evil, but phenomenal, all in one gravy.

In this one, the city of Danzig changes at a pace similar to the flow of Vistula, a crazy world where magic and realism are mingled, seemingly being told by eyes and mouths that see and speak everything. And in this overly descriptive, almost Bruegelesque text, one omission, the biggest one possible, stays as a wound: nazism. Two boys, bound by friendship and a pocket knife, one of them, Amsel, half-Jewish, a genius at creating scarecrows, the other one, Walter, his companion and blood-brother, are living that world with a complete disregard for it's logic, morality, values, which are just smidgens of rationality, as absurd as the minor things the boys see: headless nuns and knights, eels sucking cow's milk, scarecrows who can scare people. Once the hate settles and that hate seeps between the jew and the non-jew, the war starts and finishes, the world seeks justifications and forgetfulness, these magical elements become bound to explain the events on which that same hate prevailed: glasses who can show to the children the real past of their parents, God's message becoming manifest in the train station toilets as some stains are impossible to erase. Grass envisions also the future. And that future bound to those sins of the past, brings forth the same mindless scarecrows, now educated and ready to take over the world. The last part of a trilogy which is impossible to forget."}, {"userName": "Ilona", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58176016-ilona", "userReview": "Naujo leidimo proga i\u0161 naujo perskai\u010diau Dancingo trilogij\u0105.

Que no accepten lectures r\u00e0pides i intermitents al bus. Que toleren amb escepticisme ser deglutits abans d'anar dormir. Que t'imploren calma d'esperit, una concentraci\u00f3 total, el m\u00f2bil ben lluny per evitar temptacions i un context monacal per ser degustats com ell es creu que es mereix. A\u00f1os de perro, la meva primera aproximaci\u00f3 a G\u00fcnter Grass no \u00e9s un llibre f\u00e0cil de llegir. Les met\u00e0fores encadenades, el vers en forma de prosa, les enumeracions sense comes, les frases inacabades, els centenars de personatges esmentats... Tot plegat exigeixen un esfor\u00e7 notable, dif\u00edcil d'aconseguir quan el temps i les condicions per a la lectura no s\u00f3n sempre les desitjades, que no rep la recompensa que esperaves. L'evoluci\u00f3 de la hist\u00f2ria de dos amics a la ciutat fronterera de Danzig, des de la inf\u00e0ncia fins a l'edat adulta, amb l'ascens del nazisme i la Segona Guerra Mundial com a punts d'inflexi\u00f3 no acaba d'enganxar, en part perqu\u00e8 a la segona de les tres parts del llibre gaireb\u00e9 no s'esmenta, en part perqu\u00e8 l'autor la vol utilitzar com a met\u00e0fora de masses coses.Amb tot, el llibre cont\u00e9 fragments d'una gran bellesa, com la relaci\u00f3 inicial d'Eddie Amsel amb els espantaocells o el descobriment d'unes misterioses ulleres que permet veure les atrocitats comeses pels homes anteriorment. Lirisme mesurat, imatges punyents, narraci\u00f3 precisa amb un \u00fas del vocabulari envejable. Petits botins estimables, per\u00f2 insuficients per la inversi\u00f3 de 767 p\u00e0gines realitzades.Em sap greu posar-me a criticar tot un guanyador del Premi Nobel de Literatura, per\u00f2 encara m'esperava m\u00e9s brillantor i menys giragonses innecess\u00e0ries dels, diuen, un dels millors escriptors alemanys del segle XX. Tanmateix, el record de p\u00e0gines captivadores i colpidores em far\u00e0 donar-li una segona oportunitat. El tambor de llauna (primer cap\u00edtol de la Trilogia de Danzig que tanca, precisament, A\u00f1os de perro) passar\u00e0, en breu, a engreixar la llista dels to-read."}, {"userName": "Juan C", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49381939-juan-c", "userReview": "Despu\u00e9s de una eternidad, por fin pude terminar de leer este libro. En lineas generales me pareci\u00f3 innecesariamente denso, con digresiones descriptivas sobre lugares que solo a Grass podr\u00edan resultarle interesantes, y partes experimentales (sobretodo en el tercer libro), donde se nota la influencia del Ulises de Joyce, y no le hace ning\u00fan bien realmente a la novela. La trama principal, con Matern y Amsel y su relaci\u00f3n de amor-odio, me pareci\u00f3 demasiado aleg\u00f3rica y rebuscada como para sentir alg\u00fan tipo de conexi\u00f3n con los personajes y lo que se estaba contando. En el segundo libro cambia por suerte para centrarse en el tri\u00e1ngulo amoroso bastante bizarro entre Harry, Tula y Jenny. Esta parte se me hizo m\u00e1s amena, por momentos Grass recupera el nivel de genialidad que hab\u00eda logrado con \"El tambor de Hojalata\" (una de mis novelas favoritas, y la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que insist\u00ed en leer este libro hasta el final).Hasta la segunda parte pensaba en ponerle 3 de 5, pero las \u00faltimas 150 paginas se me hicieron insoportablemente pesadas. Si bien por momentos Grass logra estar a la altura de su pretensiones, durante la mayor parte de la lectura me pareci\u00f3 una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo."}], "description": "A novel set in three parts, beginning in the 1920s and ending in the 1950s, that follows the lives of two friends from the prewar years in Germany through an apocalyptic period and its startling aftermath.
