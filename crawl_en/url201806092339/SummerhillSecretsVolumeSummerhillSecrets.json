You know, wearing a short skirt and a thick make-up doesn't make someone lousy or bad. It was a clich\u00e9 thing to do to make readers feel oooh that character's amoral. *poker face*And no constancy in characterization. Levi's character was like this:rough, straightforward, naive, flirty.and he goes on a trip and returns and turns out to be like this:educated, gentle, nerdy, know-it-all.and that just happened. Imagine \"Catwoman\" from Batman went on a trip to somewhere and then returned home wearing granny's clothes and saying \"I'm not the Lady I used to be\" without no clear reason. That's something that happened with Levi. he goes to a trip and returns *tadaaa* a completely different person. It's not a character development, it's a character killer!"}, {"userName": "Jaime Aleshire", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14140655-jaime-aleshire", "userReview": "First things first I was so hoping Merry would've chosen Levi! He was a great loyal friend for many years and Merry had also grown to love him in a romantic fashion. Whereas Jon dated Merry's friends frist which made it seem like Merry was nonexisitent to him. Overall I absolutely love this book. It was a page turner for sure. I loved Merry's character she was genuine selfless sensitve caring and a lover of Jesus. The amish neighbors, the Zook's and the englishers the hanson's both had an unbelievably cozy warm loving safe home environment. Although they had differences in their religious practice, the most common thread that they both shared was Jesus Christ. He was the core foundation in both households which in turn definitely help them whether through any storms of life that came thier way. Jesus brings unity as he did on summerhill lane."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64111391-courtney", "userReview": "This novel is set in the eyes of a adolescent teenager as she begins to realize that not everything is always as it seems. This novel shows that even people, the one's that you trust, can betray you and there is nothing that you can do about the decisions that they make for themselves. Very moving and inspiring, makes me glad that I didn't face what she has had to deal with when I was her age."}, {"userName": "AlixJamie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3862413-alixjamie", "userReview": "The first one was good, this one fell flat on its face and further. I had to force myself to finish it. First of all, I was very disappointed to see that Mrs. Lewis had run even further into the ridiculously impossible with her \"normal\" teenager. Merry does not live a normal life. She can't get past a school year or summer vacation without running into a myriad of problems that receive interesting and varied action from Merry and her pack of friends. I was really angry that Levi didn't get Merry. He was ten times more interesting than Jon. Practically all these stories were fake and contrived. I especially thought that whole thing with their neighbor's \"mysterious\" computer room and the tacky and utterly ludicrous falling-through-the-ice-and-forgetting-only-about-the-boys-she-was-puzzling-over episodes were very stupid. For pete's sake, if you can't come up with a better way to solve a boy problem than temporary forgetfulness, I think you need to take a break and refresh your mind. Also, what in the world did both those boys see in Merry? She's nothing fantastic. In fact, she's really dull and quirky. Another thing that really frustrated me was the fact that they brought that whole grief issue over Faithie back into this book. I thought that had been resolved in book no. 1. She did take that picture of her tears on the gravestone and gave up her grief in \"Whispers Down the Lane\", didn't she? So why put us all through that again? I didn't care about Faithie. I had never been introduced to her personally, so when she wallows so much in grief, I just roll my eyes and scan the page for the point when she stops.The whole alliteration thing got me too. It's so tacky! Enough said. I'm just glad there isn't a third one."}, {"userName": "AlixNicolee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2666096-alixnicolee", "userReview": "This series of books was like riding a roller coaster. Sometimes the cart would take me up and above all so I could see everything that was happening, and then it took me down into a tunnel, and I became completely oblivious of the things around me. A part in this book made me want to cry and smash something, becuase it was so frustrating and I knew what was supposed to go on and the main character didn't have a clue-but she made an incredible turn around and I became content again. Merry Hanson goes through many challenges throughout these books, all coming together for a peaceful ending, one that I thought could be better, but was meaningful in a way, considering all that Merry had been through. And, like the roller coaster, it looped around and gave me butterflies, then came in to a sudden halt and it was over. And what good is a roller coaster if you don't go on it again and again?"}, {"userName": "Kaylie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3823552-kaylie", "userReview": "I hated the ending Levi should have ended up with merry in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Godsprincess", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5949683-godsprincess", "userReview": "love it relly enjoyed definetly recommend..helped me view some of lives chalanes in a different way...worth the read!"}, {"userName": "Tinydancer714", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3269177-tinydancer714", "userReview": "It was a really good book.

A general summary of the book is Merry Hanson and the aid she gives to her friends that are in need; even though she struggles at times with her own personal life she still gives all she can to help those in need. The author Beverly Lewis does an amazing job showing the internal struggles and fights that goes on in the inside; and we're able to see these personal struggles due to the first person view. This book is a genuinely good read that remains encapturing from beginning to the end. I enjoyed the book very much because although long, I was able to laugh and enjoy the large story line about Merry and her many triumphs. One factor I believe that should have been altered was the inconsistency with some of the characters traits, for example Levi and his changes from start to finish. I would recommend this book to my friends because of it's great detail and intense stories."}, {"userName": "Mary Painter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29193272-mary-painter", "userReview": "very good book"}, {"userName": "Hannah Schuck", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75350434-hannah-schuck", "userReview": "Well..... *gasps* That was an unexpected ending!

I would recommend reading the first volume before reading this one. In addition, please note that these volumes were originally released as small novellas, so this affects quite a few things--some mentioned below. 2. There were several parts during which I almost set the entire second volume down (never to return). I was simply bored--and with so much reading material available in the world, this will definitely drive some readers away. 3. The writing level fluctuates--in some sections, the writing is good (never great). In other sections, the writing is poor. Part of this is likely due to the fact that volumes were originally released as novellas. 4. Plot--To be fair to the author, she has quite a bit to juggle. However, some plots are overly-simplistic or overly-obvious. Others are handled poorly or left dangling. 5. In my opinion, the relationship between Levi and Merry drives the story--plus, the Amish characters add an excellent extra component to the stories. The relationship (or lack there-of) between Johnathan and Merry is an annoying distraction--not because many teenage girls are not fickle in real life (Boy, are they ever!), but because the author fails to develop Johnathan's character. This causes the reader to care little for their relationship or Merry's pining over him. 6. Do not get me started on \"Alliteration-eze!\" 7. For me, it is a disappointing ending, and the lack of an afterword is also disappointing!"}, {"userName": "J.E.B.

Both of my daughters read the series and have the same sentiments.I'm thinking that perhaps the publishers didn't want her to write a third volume?

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really, unless you love novels written about Amish folks or you love God. I did however enjoy the message of the book. No matter what happens in life God will always be there, pray and everything will be alright. I thought it was pretty boring at some parts and I wish Beverly Lewis would have had more story about *spoilers* Merry losing her memory, it was kinda forgotten and never mentioned again, I just wish there was more about that.

Mary is an inspiring girl, because she has such a strong faith in God. The book is almost like a diary, with entries in Mary's point of view.
