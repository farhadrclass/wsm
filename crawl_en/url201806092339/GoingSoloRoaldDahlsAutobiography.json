This man did more within a year than I have in my life.\n And the giraffes would incline their heads very slightly and stare down at me with languorous demure expressions, but they never ran away. I found it exhilarating to be able to walk freely among such huge graceful wild creatures and talk to them as I wished.\nThis is the second half of Dahl's autobiography. \nWhat a wild life! \nRight after high school, Roald packed up his belongings, got a job for the Shell company and set off for Africa. For three years. No visits home, no calling his mom, just up and leaves his beloved family for a life of adventure. And during his time in Africa, a lion carries away a woman, a black mamba attacks his servant and a green mamba invades a house to kill a family dog. It's quite interesting to hear an unfiltered account of that time. For example, all the men at the Shell company had a \"boy.\" Now, this \"boy\" was actually a full grown man. He had a wife (sometimes wives) to support and essentially acted as a butler. He spoke Swahili and so did Roald (it was not considered right to force the \"boys\" to learn English). Roald taught his boy how to read and write, and his boy tended Roald's every need. It was strange to read about.Only, before Roald could finish his time with the Shell company...the Great War broke out. And that was quite a story in itself. Roald joined the airforce and was trained as a pilot. As in, he was give 7 and a half hours of in-flight training before being declared fit for service along with fifteen other new pilots. Then, they were given fighter planes and told to get up in the air. Unsurprisingly, this happened:\nIt is a fact, and I verified it carefully later, that out of those sixteen, no less than thirteen were killed in the air within the next two years\nAll this before he turned twenty-five. The things he had to live through churned my stomach - e specially the account of how he crashed his first plane. Dahl spares no details and, as always, his stories were absolutely fascinating.The PopSugar 2018 Reading Challenge - A childhood classic you never read"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Going Solo (Roald Dahl's Autobiography #2), Roald Dahl \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0641\u0631 \u062a\u06a9 \u0646\u0641\u0631\u0647 \u061b \u0631\u0648\u0644\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0644\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0637\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0628\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u06a9\u0632\u060c 1379\u061b \u062f\u0631 200 \u0635\u060c \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643054780\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1380\u061b \u0633\u0648\u0645 1382\u061b \u0634\u0634\u0645 1386\u061b \u0647\u0641\u062a\u0645 1388\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643054786\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u0633\u0631\u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc - \u062c\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0645 - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0628\u062e\u0634 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0642\u0627\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u0642\u06cc \u0633\u0641\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0645. \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0645\u060c \u0645\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0646\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0634\u062f\u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Malbadeen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen", "userReview": "2).

I mean he could have easily died. It might not be true, but I think he came through all that mess so he could write these children's stories for the world. He should have died many times during the Battle for Athens and all the other times he went up in the air. There was a time he was talking about flying 300 miles and hour so low to the ground to escape being shot down that he had to lift up to not hit cows and walls on the ground. He did have a plane crash. He spent 3 years in Africa and Greece. I love the first part of this story when he is on a steamer heading to Africa and he tells of all the exotic passengers on the trip. Expats love doing dotty things and they did some dotty things. It was a great character study. The book starts out with the colonel and his wife running on the deck of the ship totally naked. No wonder he is so great with characters. He lived a really interesting life. I don't feel like I have done enough after listening to him, but my life is my life. Like he says, we don't travel the same way we used to. Flying somewhere is not the same as a boat trip that stops at many ports. He did some crazy things in Africa as well. He was 6'6\". He was huge. I had fun reading this and I was totally into his adventures. I also appreciate that he never took pleasure in killing people. He was always relieved to see people's parachutes open if he shot them down. I appreciate him and his works even more now. He is a hero of mine."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "\u201cA life is made up of a great number of small incidents and a small number of great ones.\u201d So opens the second and 'adult-based' portion of Roald Dahl's autobiography. He makes perfectly clear that this is not such a book, for autobiographies are full of useless and boring information. Dahl seeks to offer the reader some of the key memories he had during his early adult life, particularly serving in the Second World War. Accepting a job with the Shell Company, Dahl is soon shipped to the African continent, working particularly in Dar es Salaam, part of what is currently Tanzania. During his travel aboard a ship to reach the far shores, Dahl learns why the upper class held use of hands when eating in such low regard and the 'daytime entertainment' they found acceptable on deck. Arriving in Africa, Dahl uses all his patience and understanding as he undertook a complete culture shock, a world where wildlife ran the show and humans knew their place. While the scenery was spectacular and the people highly entertaining, the rumblings of war could be heard on the horizon. Dahl finds himself evacuated from the region, only to join the RAF to help Britain in the forthcoming Second World War. Lanky, yet determined, Dahl is an unlikely pilot-in-training before he became a key member of the effort in North Africa. While serving, Dahl is involved in a significant aerial accident, captured in a story he penned, eventually bastardised and published in the Saturday Evening Post. Dahl seeks to correct the narrative for the reader in this piece of writing, as if one might worry he was seeking to make himself seem overly heroic. The crash leaves Dahl with significant injury, his nose caved into his fractured skull (interesting for those who remember his childhood injury to the same nose), and he is required to remain in hospital for upwards of two months. While he convalesces, Dahl continues penning his weekly letters to his mother, though remains careful to censor his news, so as not to have the letters destroyed. Once healthy enough to fly again, Dahl heads out to serve in Greece, where he comes face to face with the Nazis, trying to hold the onslaught back and keep the Allies in control of the area. As the fighting intensified, Dahl dodges many a proverbial bullet and heads to the Middle East, where he sobers up to much of what was going on in the region and the European Theatre, learning of the extreme anti-Semitism or ignored undertone of the Nazi atrocities. As the reader is pulled deeper into the life of this wonderful author, Dahl uses his wonderful prose to breathe life into his life story. A must read for anyone who loves a story of humour and utter despair, all in short order.Having recently completed the first volume in this first-person narrative, I wanted to take some time to explore the adult life of this man whose stories tantalised me throughout my childhood. As Dahl continues the story, boarding schools are replaced with African-style boardrooms (open air villages) and a collection of characters that only Dahl could dream up. Those Dahl mentions turned from being men recollected into individuals with complex backstories or who shaped Dahl in his intense battles in Africa and the war zones he discovered. Using a collection of his letters penned to his mother, Dahl is able to recall some of the minutiae, which helps substantiate his many adventures. Dahl outwardly admits the need to use this letters, both because of his age when writing the tale and the number of events that can mesh together in wartime. Crisp and humorous, Dahl is able to tell his story while keeping the reader spellbound, injecting passion for his situations on every page while not getting too wordy in his descriptions. A contrast to stories about chocolate-makers, giants, and fresh produce, this story (and its first volume) is not one to be passed over. It is yet another gem in the Roald Dahl collection.Kudos, Mr. Dahl for this two-volume collection about your life prior to becoming the popular writer for which you are best remembered. I cannot wait to tackle some of your other works, adult- and child-centric alike.Like/hate the review?

The first book was Boy: Tales of Childhood. I suggest reading them in order, but it wouldn't be the worst thing ever if you didn't! Here is my review on the first book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...This book starts at the age of 18 (and the first book goes up to the age 18). I really enjoyed this book! BUT, it only focused on him fighting in the war. I was hoping it would cover more than that. The war only lasted for a couple of years... He did get badly hurt and almost die, so that was extremely interesting to read about. It was crazy to think what literature would be like if Roald had died in the war.However, this book left me with a ton of unanswered questions. Like, what happened when he went home after the war? What did he do for work? How did he start writing, etc? I felt it was only an autobiography about a tiny bit of his life. It was probably the most tragic part of his life, but still only a little bit of it. It made me feel like there was still a lot missing or that there should have been another book after Going Solo.

The strength of this book was its excitement. Dahl seemed crazy he talked to animals. One time he talks to the giraffes, \u201cHello, giraffes! Hello! Hello! Hello! How are you today?\u201d (Going Solo p79). The weakness of the book was that it was difficult to understand because of the unique British spelling and vocabulary. Dahl used several themes, including beauty and danger.  Bwana, it is a beautiful sword. With one blow it cut through his neck so deeply that his whole head fell forward and dangled down on to his chest, and as he started to topple over I gave the neck one more quick chop and the head came right away from the body and fell to the ground like a coconut (G.S p72).

The first half detailing his time in Africa working for the Shell Company is brilliant; a window to a life that no longer exists, with long boat journeys, quirky slightly mad Englishmen (and ladies) abroad, the culture and way of life. It's clearly romanticised; a big adventure, but then it's portrayed with such vigour and love that you can see the appeal to a fresh faced early-20 year old. I would have loved it (and probably still would). As a boy it made me dream of African countryside, baking suns, lions, deadly snakes and a different world.The second part, detailing his experiences in the war as a pilot is equally enthralling though very different in tone. This was my first exposure to the second world war in any real way (back at primary school in the late-80s - we didn't cover the wars until secondary school and my subsequent interest developed a few years after that) and Dahl makes it all seem jolly exciting. Almost over before he began, his initial adoration of flying is powerfully detailed before his (more truthfully documented) account of the crash that put him in hospital for 6 months. After, we have a series of raids and dogfights which become somewhat mechanical and repetitive in nature but still hold the interest. I wonder now though, whether his emphasis on a jolly adventure isn't quite as truthful as it could be; he states a few times that looking back he wonders why he wasn't more scared. I wonder the same. The horrors of war only really peak through at times and I suspect this was him writing for a younger audience.Put together though, both Boy and Going Solo are wonderful books for children to open their eyes to different types of stories and worlds. Dahl's relaxed narrative envisages a cosy fire and glass of whiskey, reminiscent of an afternoon with your granddad. Equally of interest to the adults too."}, {"userName": "M Razavy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26758006-m-razavy", "userReview": "\u062c\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0645\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646.\u0628\u0639\u0636\u06cc \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0634 \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0628\u0648\u062f.***\u0631\u0648\u0644\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0631\u06a9\u062a \u0646\u0641\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0622\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0642\u0627. \u062c\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0645 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0633\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0622\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0642\u0627 \u0631\u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634. \u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u0631\u0633\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0647\u060c \u0631\u0626\u06cc\u0633 \u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0647\u0634 \u0645\u06cc\u06af\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u062c\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u062c\u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0642\u0635\u062f \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u06cc\u0631\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u0646\u0647.

The book is all about his adventures in Africa while working for the Shell Oil Company, and while flying for the Royal Air Force in World War Two. The book also contains some of Dahl\u2019s encounters with animals. He wrote it to tell the reader what it was like to live and explore in the African Savanna. This book had some strong themes. The language can take a while to decipher, and can be quite annoying at times. At other times, it is easier to get the meaning out of a phrase. Dahl calmly states, \u201c\u2018I think that we\u2019re going to get killed\u2019\u201d (GS pg. 154), to his friend David Coke in the middle of the war. This shows that his view on life has changed throughout his experiences in war. Some of the weaknesses in Dahl\u2019s writing were when he made it seem like there would be a great description on what happened, and sometimes there was none. That was very disappointing. I would probably recommend this book to others if they have an interest in adventure, and true stories. Dahl\u2019s writing style really helped me understand what was happening most of the time. He writes in a very easy to understand type of writing. I like his style, and would read all of his books if given the chance. The plot also helped with his style. I am very interested in WWII, and that is what half of this book was about. This book has also given me a different view on autobiographies. I do not have any connections to the story, but I feel that I will develop some in the future, as I age and have more experiences. I will end on my favorite quote from the book. It is, \u201cBut there is a world of difference between falling in love with a voice and remaining in love with a person you can see.\u201d (GS pg. 115) This quote has a lot of meaning behind it, and that is why I like it."}, {"userName": "Calebishere", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519257-calebishere", "userReview": "I wish I could say I have been all over the world, have crashed landed a plane, or have shot-down German aces, which is why I really admire Roald Dahl. Dahl leaves England at age twenty one to work for the Shell oil company in Africa. Dahl worked in Africa until the outbreak of World War II, when he enlisted in the RAF and learned to fly warplanes. After becoming a pilot officer, Dahl fought in Greece as it was overtaken by the Germans. Dahl\u2019s book \u201cGoing Solo\u201d tells all about his adventures with vivid detail. He describes lion attacks and dog fights with a classic British style that portrays the attitudes of the characters he interacted with so well that you feel as though you new them. After reading the book, I felt like I had met ex-patriots from India, RAF veterans in the midst of battle, African natives chasing lions, and Jewish refugees dreaming of their homeland. While reading, I still laughed out loud during most pages at his characteristically British wit that is almost tongue-in cheek. Perhaps more than any other feeling the reader gets a sense of awe for the adventures of he and his generation, along with an inspiration to go on grand escapades yourself."}, {"userName": "Leif Fosse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9121803-leif-fosse", "userReview": "The book Going Solo is full of exciting, breathtaking, suspenseful, and defiantly worth reading. This book is about a young mans life and all of his adventures. The one thing that I really like about this book is that the fun never stops. First they talk about his adventures traveling with the Shell Oil company, and how he went to Africa and ran into many obstacles on his way. The second half of this book gets even better. Roald Dahl enter the Air force and encounters many different situations of life and death and is just lucky enough to come out alive. Another thing I love about book Going Solo really goes into detail when it comes to the dogfights with the Germans and Roald Dahl. He explains what it is like to be thousands of feet in the air spinning, turning, and having bullets fly by you. He expresses really well about how he feels when he is flying, or even after he has shot down his first plane. All in all the book Going Solo is one that I would not suggest skipping."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/717971-elizabeth", "userReview": "heh. recommended to me by Miriam, who noticed that it wasn't on my Flying shelf. That's because I read it long before I set up my Goodreads account! Dahl's account of the Battle of Athens is one of my touchstones - the desperation and exhaustion of the RAF pilots, their relative cluelessness about what's going on everywhere else, the hands that shake too much to hold a cigarette when you're back on the ground - it's incredibly vivid and has influenced my own writing. The rest of the book is jaw-dropping too, for its evocation of 1930s Kenya and Empire life there. Going Solo is perhaps not Dahl's most lauded piece of writing but it's certainly the one I recommend most often.There! On my flying shelf now!"}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32158137-kirsten", "userReview": "Dang, this guy had a crazy life! I really enjoyed the stories of his time in Africa, although the ones about snakes kind of freaked me out at times. It was interesting to get a snapshot of late British colonialism in Africa as well - it's easy for me to forget that it wasn't that long ago that Europe was sticking its fingers everywhere on that continent and elsewhere. Dahl's adventures in World War II, especially in Greece, were seriously intense, with numerous close shaves and narrow escapes. I kept thinking to myself how glad I was that he didn't die there, because then we would have missed out on all the books he would go on to write. The narration was also excellent, although now my mental picture of Roald Dahl as a young man looks like Dan Stevens, even though I went and looked Dahl up to find pictures from his RAF days."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21868582-paul", "userReview": "When I was a teenager this felt like an epic read. Now all grown up(some might disagree)it doesn't feel as long as I thought it was but it doesnt change how great it is to read Dahls representation of the world around. His way with words and what he picks up on and presents to the reader lead to such an interesting and fun read. All in all the book only represents a small portion of his fascinating life but it draws you in.His aerial battle scenes are so well written, never glamourising but still exciting. So glad I revisted this book from my childhood."}], "description": "Superb Stories, Daring Deeds, Fantastic AdventuresHere is the action-packed sequel to Boy, a tale of Dahl's exploits as a World War II pilot.
