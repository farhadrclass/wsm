All of these short stories apart from maybe 3, I had read before via the newsletter and on her website, so it was nice re-reading it all in one collection. As always, I\u2019m obsessed with this world. My obsession is actually unreal (help, don\u2019t know what to do now that there\u2019s no new books to read). So of course I had to give it 5 stars.

(Put together for Nalini's fans, a number of the stories do stand alone if you'd like to try her worlds).Note from NaliniI've written many short stories for you over the years, so many in fact that not every reader has managed to read every story. They've been scattered over multiple newsletters and the website.When we began to put them together into a single file, we discovered the stories came to roughly 275 pages. Forty-one different stories in the Psy-Changeling, Guild Hunter, and Rock Kiss worlds.While I was checking the file, I ended up reading some of the stories and they left me with a smile on my face. I hope you enjoy the collection just as much, and that you now have an easy way to read your favorites - and if you've missed a story, it should be in there.If it isn't, I'm sure it'll make it's way into the next volume in another few years time. Also, we didn't include the deleted scenes in this volume, as the collection was already a big one. They may turn up as a surprise another year. :-)", "title": "Newsletter Exclusives: Volume 1\n      \n          (Guild Hunter)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37708164-newsletter-exclusives", "average": 4.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514320237l/37708164.jpg", "reviews": 27, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/71688.Nalini_Singh", "name": "Nalini Singh"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Anthologies"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37708164-newsletter-exclusives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38388792-newsletter-exclusives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3819326-angels-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178476.Slave_to_Sensation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6582637-archangel-s-kiss", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/458034.Caressed_by_Ice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7307503-archangel-s-consort"]}
