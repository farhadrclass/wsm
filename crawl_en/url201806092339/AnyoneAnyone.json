Since page one, you're pulled in to an extraordinary story, fast-paced with such a narrative power, and the writing is impeccable!What I loved about the story?1. I love that you have a lot of questions and so few answers, I went through all the book guessing, imagining, making assumptions, until I get to the last page and I found myself literally screaming \"NO, NO, NOO\"2. The heroine has a Cat!3. Cole, Cole, Cole, I love HimWhat I didn't like?1. Tess, I know she's a young heroine, but some times I really wanted to slap her, I didn't feel related with her, but Hey! This is nothing, it doesn't ruin the book, it's only my personal opinion.So, I higly recommend this book to any reader, it's a clean story, so you can read it with your tween.This author is now on my \"Must Read\" list!!I received a ARC copy from the Author in return for an HONEST review"}, {"userName": "Amber Hetchler (\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32882104-amber-hetchler", "userReview": "Wow wow wow.

I have devoured all of her novels and Anyone? Is no exception. When 16-year-old Tess\u2019 world starts falling apart, literally, her doomsday survivalist dad ushers her into a bunker in her backyard. He orders her to stay put until he returns while he goes to get her brother. He promises her he\u2019ll just be a few hours not to let anyone in any circumstances. The problem is, he never comes back. After two months she finally decides to go find him herself but she\u2019s not ready for what the world has become.Tess is a great character. Her thoughts and actions resembled that of an average 16-year-old girl and how she might really handle a situation like this. Nothing felt fake or forced about her. Fairly early on in the story we meet Cole. I love Cole. Every author needs a Cole. He is fun, sarcastic, mysterious and tries to protect Tess from everything happening around them. The weather seems to be their enemy. They experience Extreme weather and all four seasons in just days. Tornadoes, electrical storms, heat that is so hot it burns your skin in seconds. While the idea of the apocalypse may be very popular right now, Angela Scott has made the story very original and fresh. I don\u2019t feel as if I know what\u2019s coming every second. I was left holding my breath to see what happens next. I am eagerly anticipating her next book.I received a review copy from the publisher in return for an honest review and all opinions expressed on my own"}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19857787-kristin", "userReview": "Anyone? Anyone? Hello?This book is so fun! 4.5 out of 5 stars for me!The author sent me an e-arc for my honest review and it was so fun!The apocalypse is happening in this book and its basically a race from the beginning to end. I love the way Angela Scott always has you guessing in this book! I just could not stop reading it! The characters are fun, though I took a half of a point off for not building them up, especially Tess in the beginning. She was a little flat for a while. However, Scott writes a funny book with a few pop culture references and a kitten side kick! :) I don't want to write too much, because I don't want to spoil anything!!

First is Tess. She really is a teenager and Angela Scott did a great job of portraying her as such. Second is Cole. An interesting character with an interesting view of the world now that there\u2019s no one around for miles. Third, I loved the tension between them. There\u2019s an incredible love/hate relationship that sparks in all the best ways. Fourth, I loved the cat as an important character. Last, I loved the adventure and the mystery of what happened. The mystery of what happened is reminiscent of The Road\u2026 No one really knows. There are hints at possibilities, but it\u2019s never really discovered. Of course, Tess\u2019s main worry is finding her Dad and brother. The why of what happened doesn\u2019t matter to her.There are other things that sat wrong with me. Okay, really only one thing\u2026 The ending. Poof! No answers. Not to who or what Cole is, not to what exactly happened (this is a double-edged sword with me), and not to where the government is. Why is the weather freaky all of a sudden? I\u2019m usually all for ambiguity, but there\u2019s a certain limit that I can handle. There should be answers to most of the questions that come up during the book, but I was left with only an answer to why the ONLY animal still alive is Tess\u2019s kitten. I contacted Angela to find out if there would be a series because that was the only possible explanation to leave so many open questions. She replied that no, this isn\u2019t a series (though she hasn\u2019t dismissed possibly coming back to write more about this world some other time).This book pulled me along and I couldn\u2019t put it down. When I did put it down, it was not with kindness. I still think about the story\u2013about Tess and Cole\u2013but most of it is disappointment that I don\u2019t know the answers to so many questions."}, {"userName": "Becky Stephens", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24779079-becky-stephens", "userReview": "I loved everything about Anyone?. From the title posed as a question, to the fantastic cover, to the carefully crafted characters, to the pace, and finally, to the amazingly satisfying - yet mystifying - ending.Because I subscribe to the author's newsletters, I read the first chapter of this book months ago. At least, it seems like that long ago. And it wouldn't leave my brain. Every now and then, I would wonder what happened to Tess. Did her dad come back for her? Did he find Tess' brother? What exactly happened on the surface to force her underground? So, I was ecstatic when I discovered that Angela Scott was looking for bloggers to read and review this book for its release.I'll be up front and admit that this review is going to be difficult to write simply because while I want to brag about this book and entice you to read it, I don't want to spoil it for you either. There are twists and turns along the way, and what a bummer it would be if I was to slip up and spoil it for you. So, I'll tread carefully.I'll start with Tess, our protagonist. She is the only character we meet for a long time. And, that's okay. Because it gives us time to get to know her. Though I admit I didn't care for her at first. She starts out as a bit of a whiny teenager who can't seem to make decisions for herself. But, as all good characters should, she matures right before our eyes, and becomes more independent and grown up. Is it due to her friendship with Cole? Or due to her father's military experience and preparedness? Or simply because she was a strong character to begin with, but it took a natural disaster of epic proportions for her to realize it?From the very first page, I didn't want to put the book down. There was always something happening. Even when there wasn't a strange weather phenomenon to escape from, Tess was getting to know Cole or simply figuring out how to survive, which was new to her. There really wasn't a dull moment. Every moment is there for a reason without slowing the pace whatsoever.There are so many reasons to pick up this book and read it, so I urge you to do just that!I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

I have read all of Angela's books, and it's hard to pick one as a favorite. This one easily battles for the top spot though!Tess is a typical teenager with typical teenage problems, until the day that she finds her world literally falling apart. The book opens with explosions rocking the city in which she lives, and her father telling her to get out of the house and into the fallout shelter that has been his obsession for the past few years. Telling Tess to stay in the shelter until he comes back, he races off to find Tess's rebellious brother.The book follows her journey through the next few months alone in the small shelter with her pet cat as her only companion, then through a perilous journey to try to reunite with her family. Angela does an amazing job putting the reader into the mind of this young girl as she deals with numerous post-apocalyptic challenges as she makes her arduous trek to a remote mountain resort where she believes her father took refuge. I found myself caught up in the \"just one more chapter!\" trap many times so I could find out how she overcomes the next obstacle thrown in her path. This is typical of Ms. Scott's books, as she has a wonderful way of drawing the reader into the worlds she creates. They are so real, so well fleshed out, that it becomes easy to lose yourself. Several nights I found myself looking at the clock in shock, realizing that once again I would have to boost my caffeine intake the next day to compensate for lost sleep.My only complaint about the book, besides the lost slumber, is that there had better be a sequel or I'll go crazy!"}, {"userName": "T.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9274125-t", "userReview": "While I enjoy this author's writing style, I was never able to connect with her young character, Tess; and I never understood the hot-cold dynamics between her and Cole.

So many unanswered questions, especially regarding Cole, why her dad didn't find time to return for her after her brother was safe, and a few other things I won't mention due to spoiling the story.

Doing so does not sway my review in any way.I just finished reading this book and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around much of it. Set in modern times, a catastrophic event has occurred, leaving the world as we know it in an apocalyptic chain reaction of many incredible and unexplained incidents. From the onset of the major event until a few months afterwards, Tess was holed up in a shelter made by her prepper father.

There are many other things that are left with loose ends that makes me wonder if there is going to be a followup book to this one. If there isn't, than as a reader, I feel very slighted. Cole is quite the free spirit but he also provides the comic relief needed when times are so tough that you need to lose focus for fear of losing oneself.

It was a little slow in the beginning for me and I put it down. But it kept nagging at me to give it a chance, so I picked it back up determined to see it through and also because the ratings were pretty good. Unfortunately for me I didn't actually read the comments under the ratings.#2. It grew on me till I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately when I reached the end (I checked before I started the book and as far as I could tell this was a standalone book. Some of the other comments have confirmed this for me. I hate starting an incomplete series, then having to wait and wait for the next book.) I was completely dumbfounded when I reached ---THE END---. What the H#$%? Am I stupid? Did I miss something? Is my kindle version missing a chapter? I fell in love with this book and then....nothing. Where are all the answers? I cant believe the author is going to leave me like this, so that means I must be an idiot and somehow missed all the clues, answers, whatever. Maybe I don't have the imagination necessary to read between the lines...blah, blah, blah. I am babbling. Does anyone know the answers? Maybe we aren't supposed to know, like the ending of Shutter Island (was he crazy or wasn't he? At least you had a 50% chance of being right and all the relevant information to make that choice). But if anyone knows anything, such as maybe there will be a sequel, or even your own interpretation I would welcome that information.I did like this book until the last page. If I had taken my frustration and I admit, anger at the ending into account I would have given it one star, but I didn't. PS Did anyone notice that Cole repeated Tess's comment (when she was with the other kid that Cole couldn't see) about \"apple and bacon\", but Tess herself did not notice it.

No, it's not The Road. It's not even a fluffy teeny bopper version of The Road. I couldn't let that comparison stand unchallenged. I'm surprised by all the high ratings. Teenaged young women are amazing, intelligent, resilient--the main character, who fits into this age group, was far from any of those qualities. The story both ends and begins too abruptly. There's little explanation as to what happened. There's not even enough resolution to warrant a sequel, which I suspect is coming. So, why did I read it? I'm asking myself that same question. My rule is give the author at least 50 pages before chucking it and I went well beyond that. I believe there was some well created cliffhanger at about my cut off point. I also seem to give books I've purchased much more forgiveness. And here lies the true reason I read this. I accidentally purchased it with a misplaced click of my Kindle. I hate to pan an author, but I believe she will survive. There is an obvious following. If you'd like to delve deeper into apocalyptic literature check out The Stand (King), Swan Song (McCammon), or Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam Trilogy.

The premise was pretty cool until about 3/4 of the way through the book and then it took some kind of paranormal route...I think. Maybe that's what the author meant to happen. Let the reader come to their own conclusion, but honestly it seems unfulfilling to me somehow. Normally I'm used to most dystopian novels being series reads. This was a stand alone with an ending that was making you guess. If you really looked at it, you could say it had an \"End of days..Jesus is coming back\" feel to it.

He tells her not to open the door until he comes back, so she waits . . . and waits . . . and waits. Several weeks after her father left, she can\u2019t wait anymore. Tess opens the door and discovers that everyone in her city has vanished.Throughout the book, the reader is kept just as clueless as Tess. She doesn\u2019t know what happened to the world or where all the people went. I loved trying to puzzle out the mystery with the characters. The twists in the story are surprising. I didn\u2019t see most of them coming. Once the plot gets moving, it goes quickly. Tess is constantly in danger. There\u2019s some crazy weather and a disease that she may or may not have been exposed to . . .Tess eventually does come across a few other people. One of them, Cole, is a strange dude. He\u2019s completely in love with the apocalypse and thrilled that he can do anything he wants. There\u2019s a big difference between his personality and Tess\u2019s. Cole would be happy if he never saw another person again. Tess is obsessed with finding her father and brother. She\u2019s convinced that the people will come back, and Cole will get in trouble for breaking into their houses and stealing their stuff. Tess and Cole make an unusual pair.There are a few issues that kept me from completely enjoying Anyone?. First, there are typos, which always distract me. I also thought the story took a long time to get going. Like I said at the start of the review, I have read a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction. The beginning of Anyone? isn\u2019t very original. The story does get more original as it goes on, but I spent a huge chunk of time wondering if the book was going to break out of the post-apocalyptic stereotypical formula.In addition to waiting for the original bits, I spent most of the book wondering where this story was set. For the majority of the novel, we\u2019re only told \u201cAmerican west.\u201d As someone who has spent her entire life in the American west, I know that it has an extremely diverse landscape. I wasn\u2019t sure which version of \u201cAmerican west\u201d I was supposed to be picturing. Eventually, we find out that the characters are in Utah, but I needed to know that right away.My biggest issue with the book is the ending. I don\u2019t want to give away spoilers, but I didn\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s rushed and abrupt. I hope there\u2019s a sequel. I have so many questions.I flew through Anyone? because the characters are engaging, but I was let down by the ending.I was given a free copy of this book as part of the #ReadIndie Challenge.

Sixteen-year-old Tess was grabbed by her father and taken outside to their bomb shelter. He leaves her there to go find her brother. Left alone, with only her kitten Callie, Tess waits, but her Father never returns. She can only wonder at what has happened. After several months in the shelter Tess ventures out to find an empty world, no animal and no humans.Where is everyone? She wanders and finally comes across Cole, a twenty something guy whose been surviving on his own. He is handsome and rugged with an amazing tattoo of wings on his back. Tess also recovers her old cell phone, and after charging it listens to a message her father left right after the disaster. He tells her where to go to find him. Even though its been months, Tess decides she's going after him. Cole vows to get her to her father.Along the way Tess tries desperately to figure out what happened to everyone, and Cole has no answers. Strange atmospheric conditions plaque them and contaminated water makes life a challenge. When Tess's hair begins falling out she knows that if she doesn't find her father soon, she never will.My Thoughts-Ah, one of my favorite things, an end of the world disaster book, and this one scored points. Why? Well, I'm going to have to go into SPOILERS, so watch out. At first I thought the book would take part in the bomb shelter, but surprise, the author only has Tess in there as long as necessary to wonder what is happening in the outside world. Once she gets out the mystery of where everybody went blew my mind. I kept thinking she'd find out, but again the author does a great job of pulling the reader along and only revealing hints along the way. When a big chunk of info is revealed mid-story it only caused me to wonder, what the heck happened. We find out what happened to the people, but not what caused the disaster, at least yet. And what happened to the people and animals is awful. Great visuals.And know the part that has me hoping for a second book- the relationship between Cole and Tess. The entire book it is obvious that there is sexual tension between the two, but Cole firmly keeps them apart and makes Tess understand that he is not going there. He says it is because he's older, but you begin to wonder. And then, nobody seems to be able to see Tess and Cole together. At first you can come up with logical reasons, but the very last chapter blows that away and left me thinking- Who or what is Cole?

I'll do it, though, to read this mysterious last chapter people keep referring to.The writing is mostly fine. I try not to read self-published books but this one apparently slipped through. The writing really is okay, though.It's Tess...and Cole. I hate them. Both of them. This means the only tolerable character is the cat.Cole repeatedly refers to Tess as a \"kid.\" He's in his 20's. Guys that age don't talk like that. Not REPEATEDLY. They might say \"you're too young.\" But \"kid\"? No. Sorry, but no. And he does it so much I want to kill him. For some reason, Tess doesn't mind being called a kid, though. No...she hates that he seems okay with this new world. But not once does she ever say \"shut the f--- up, Cole! I'm 17, which is hardly a kid age. And the world being what it is? Yeah, no...I'm not a kid, so stop treating me like one.\" Nope. She seems totally cool with his stupid comments.Otherwise, Cole is way more tolerable than Tess. She asks him questions...over and over again. To the point where COLE actually tells her she asks the same questions repeatedly. You know what my biggest problem with Tess is, though? She can't make up her god damned mind about Cole. He tells her he didn't like working for \"the man\" and he's doing okay in this post-apocalyptic world. And she just assumes that means he's totally fine with what happened. And she then tries to get away from him in her disgust. Uhhh...no Tess. He never said what happened was cool. What he said was that he preferred a slower way of living, essentially. HUGE F----ING DIFFERENCE! He is helping you find your family and repeatedly saves your life. Only an idiot would react the way she did. And I therefore seem her TSTL.I can only assume that these five star reviews are being left only by her devoted fans. It doesn't seem like a mix of random readers.

I have read a couple of Ms. Scott's zombie westerns. They were fun so I liked her on Facebook so that I would know when she wrote something new. Anyone? is nothing like those other books. From the start I didn't want to put it down and when I had to and couldn't get back to it right away I found myself thinking about it. There are very few characters in this story but she has managed to make me care about them all. I also couldn't wait to find out what the disaster was exactly and while nothing new, it was still satisfying. For most of the book I kept thinking I knew what was going on then something would happen to make me question it all. It definitely kept me guessing. The reaction our protagonist has to the situation is genuine and I feel like it is how someone really would react. I felt her loneliness, desperation and claustrophobia. I kept thinking of how I would react in that situation. It is always the sign of a good book when I put myself in the characters shoes. I have one complaint. What I feel is a plot hole that I am not completely able to get past and therefore could not rate this book higher. **Warning - minor spoiler** Why would her father send someone to get her from the bunker and not teach them the Morse code signal? Why wouldn't he leave his son with the good guys long enough to get his daughter? It was never believable to me that he wouldn't have gone back to her. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it to others!

I would recommend it to both young adults, as well as older ones. From beginning to end, it kept me reading. It was by no means predictable.I loved Tess, and yes she is the whiny, wishy-washy teenager in the end of the world. Her \"soldier/prepper\" Father goes off in search of the brother, telling her to stay put, and indeed she does, until a couple of months go by, where she comes out to find everyone gone. She does run into Cole, who we really don't get, but at least the dialogue is interesting.I am not posting spoilers, because this was a copy in exchange for a review, so that would not be fair to blow it for other people.

Not only because I have an undying love for anything apocalyptic/dystopic (because I do), but also because our main character's dad happens to be a prepper. Now if you knew me personally, you would know why that instantly catches my eye. But since you lot don't, I'll explain. I'm a little On the crazy side myself and I have also begun to low key prep, not like in the backyard insanity, more of a trying MRE's to see which ones I like and putting away some important supplies like extra water, food, flashlights, etc. away in my attic. You know, just in case. That way I'm prepared for the zombie apocalypse, but also prepared for the far more reasonable and (since I live in New England) far more likely event of a terrible blizzard that knocks our power out for days and buries beneath feet of snow.Obviously, any story about someone who's a little unhinged and prepares for the apocalypse, only to have the world basically end and for that person to suddenly not be crazy anymore... well I'm INTO that. (Especially because I find that a lot of books that deal with apocalyptic events at like no one's ever heard of that idea before, such as people in zombie stuff having no clue what zombies are (isn't that kind of a THING in pop culture? How do you not know that those are zombies? So it's wonderful to find a book where someone isn't completely baffled by an apocalypse, or at least where the possibility of one is addressed. Obviously none of us think that it'll randomly happen, but at the very least, there's all sorts of speculative fiction about in tons of different medias to at least get us thinking...)Anyway, about the actual book:In the \"About the Author\" section, Angela mentions that \"grammar is her arch nemesis,\" and sadly, there are a few moments where that is obvious in this book. To be precise, I found five grammatical errors (see bottom of review), and normally, things like that would really unhinge men, and detach me from the story, but this book was so captivating, I didn't even care.The whole idea of the story is captivating, and it starts off with a bang. We immediately jump into action and get our introduction to our characters as they're trying to run and hide for their lives. It's a thrilling and exciting introduction, and a great way to immediately hook your reader (and it worked.) After that, I was eager to see what happened, what Tess would do, and to find out what the hell was going on out there in the world. And also, as a reader, I like to know the \"why\" of things, and generally it frustrates me to have an apocalyptic event take place, but no proper explanation of what really happened or why that thing happened. However, this is written from Tess's point of view, and being that she hid in her underground bunker for the worst of the chaos, and has no clue what went down, it didn't bother me that I didn't get all those answers, because she didn't know them either, so in essence, I thought that was a very clever way to leave to questions open without frustrating your reader. It also makes for a good reveal process, because we learn what happens as Tess does, which eliminates info-dumping issues, because Tess trying to figure out what happened is a natural and important part of the story.And on the subject of Tess, for the most part, I really did enjoy her. Often, you get heroines that a lot of people deem TSTL (too stupid to live), and while I usually try to be forgiving, it's nice to have a heroine with some survival and self-preservation instinct, who does things like readying a weapon when exploring a potentially dangerous situation, and who stocks up on supplies because they could be useful. It was also an interesting dynamic to see our heroine be the one who was serious, and to have the make role be filled by someone who was less serious and approached things in a more juvenile way (since it's generally the other way around). And in no way was Cole TSTL, he just has a much more casual attitude about things than Tess, but I think they complement each other nicely.Cole really was my favourite character in this book, so much so that I found myself doing that thing where I wish a fictional character was real, because I have a huge crush on them. I enjoyed his laid back and somewhat childish approach to the whole situation, because I feel like that's how I'd more than likely approach an apocalypse too. Fuck it, let's have fun, the rules don't apply anymore, so might as well enjoy yourself. That said though, when shit got serious, Cole buckled down and managed it very well. And on top of it, he's a secret sweetie, taking care of tEss when she needed it, and teaching her to lighten up a little to ease some of her stress and worry, even his interactions with Callie, they had me melting. Cole was so awesome, and genuinely tried to be a good person despite the crazy ass circumstances, and I found myself shipping Tess and Cole HARDCORE. (On that note, I also appreciate that their relationship developed in a reasonable manner and didn't immediately fall prey to the inst-love cliche.)Callie was also a great character. I loved her, if for no other reason, than come an apocalypse, my cat would be my little survival buddy (as he's unusually well suited to that sort of thing. I already take him places and walk him on a leash. 100% true, he goes everywhere with me, Like a dog. Except he's a cat. And he's the coolest cat ever.) So any scene that Callie was part of made me super happy.All in all, everything about the book was awesome, but possibly my favourite aspect (besides anything Cole related) was the suspense of the later parts. There were moments that had me questioning reality, wondering what was real, what wasn't, if I had a serious case of unreliable narrator on my hands, if Tess was going crazy, and ultimately, wondering what the hell was going on. I think that suspenseful element of not being quite sure what's happening, and having to wonder if Tess is crazy or if something supernatural is afoot really adds to the story and gives it that something special. Because there are plenty of great stories about surviving an apocalypse, but as great as they are, they're ultimately very similar in that they're all just survival stories. But for me anyway, this extra mystery/suspense element to ANYONE? separated it from the pack of apocalyptic survival stories and elevated it to it's own special place, which might be one of the reasons I love this story so much.And THAT. ENDING. (Shit had me kinda messed up, not gonna lie.)I need the sequel, and I need that shit yesterday. Is ANYONE ELSE? here yet?GRAMMATICAL NOTES:1) p. 25 - phrase \"starting my decent,\" should be \"descent,\" with an \"s\"2) p. 39 - phrase \"optical allusion,\" should be \"optical illusion,\" with an \"i\"3) p. 128 - phrase \"brush threw it\" uses wrong spelling, should be \"through\"4) p. 216 - phrase \"train cars wasn't\" uses incorrect tense, should be \"train cars weren't\"5) p. 263 - \"\"I promise\" uses extra set of quotation marksI mean really though, they're just simple little mistakes, and definitely aren't serious enough or copious enough to diminish the quality of the book. I just happen to be kind of a grammar freak, so I have a specific eye for these sorts of things..."}, {"userName": "River Song", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27108610-river-song", "userReview": "3 Punkte f\u00fcr die erste H\u00e4lfte, 5 Punkte f\u00fcr die zweite H\u00e4lfte.
