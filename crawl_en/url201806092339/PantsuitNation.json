They are a more accurate representation of American greatness than any idealized non-existent past that some are eager to return to. America is already great, and these people prove it.The first half of the book contains pre-election writing, and I can\u2019t help but feel a sense of dread and impotent omniscience reading this along with the knowledge of what ended up happening on election day, and the continual trainwreck that has followed since then. The stories are hopeful and heartbreaking. It\u2019s wonderful to see so many different kinds of people coming together in an attempt to stop a disaster. Up until about 8pm that night, it seemed to be a sure thing that Clinton would be the next President of the United States, and against all odds (and the majority of Americans\u2019 votes) Donald Trump won.The day after the election was terrible. I live in a small university town that is generally a pocket of reason in an otherwise notoriously under-informed backwater state. Close to my work there\u2019s a small coffee shop that I walk to when I need to stretch my legs a bit. I usually get coffee and a bagel a couple times a week, and it\u2019s always a bustling, vibrant place. Cheery faces with kind, hopeful demeanors. Youthful, artistic energy. That early November morning everyone was still in a state of shock, thousand yard stares on their faces, envisioning what kind of future we might have now that the worst possible candidate that has ever existed, was elected to the office of President of the United States by a minority of the voting public. There was a sense of hopelessness in everyone I saw. I think we all felt like we were just going through the motions of our lives, unsure what we were doing. No one thought he could win, the whole thing was an absurd joke, until it wasn't. Now, everyone was on edge, and in the midst of an existential crisis.The second half of the book is post election, and these events are still very fresh in my mind. It\u2019s comprised of reactions to the news that our votes didn\u2019t matter this year, and yes, Americans really are misinformed enough that almost 46% of them thought a reality television character was the best option for Commander in Chief. And for some reason that was enough to elect him to office. This is where the stories became the most emotionally powerful for me. People pull together, we regroup, we redouble, we protest in large and small ways, and we keep working toward the type of future that we want. It\u2019s good stuff, and highly motivating.As I\u2019m writing this, Robert Mueller and his team are investigating\u00a0 the Russian interference in our 2016 election, and it\u2019s starting to look like Donald Trump\u2019s presidency might be one of the shortest in the history of the United States. I am very eager to see this monomaniacal bond villain caricature\u2019s tenure come to a quick and decisive end. Although, his line of succession is equally terrifying. Hopefully they\u2019re all tied tightly into his many crimes, and will go down together, RICO style. It\u2019s a beautiful dream, but I realize it\u2019s most likely just a dream. In reality, powerful people often get away with it.This is a difficult book for me to review because it keeps forcing me to imagine how things could\u2019ve been different in the 2016 election. As they say, Hindsight is 20/20, and looking back with some perspective, I don\u2019t think Clinton was the right candidate to defeat a monster like Trump. I\u2019m a humanist, feminist, atheist and generally liberal leaning dude, but I pay enough attention to history to never call myself a Democrat or a Republican. I know how quickly these divisions can mutate into something they were never meant to be. Just look at the neo-conservative, alt-right takeover of the Republican party in the last ten years. I feel terrible for legitimate conservatives who have no representation in our government anymore. The GOP has completely lost its mind, and I fear that the DNC may be in the midst of a similar problem.Personally, I\u2019ve never been an avid fan of Hillary Clinton. I think her statements against the LGBTQ+ community in the past have been appalling (something she\u2019s very recently started to change, thankfully). But she was undeniably the much, much better candidate of the two options that were presented to us last year, and I voted for her wholeheartedly.I\u2019m still very disturbed by both the DNC and the GOP\u2019s behavior in the primary elections. The best candidates from each camp did not make it to the general election; the most incendiary ones did. The ones that banks and plutocrats knew they could leverage for their own benefit. I understand how necessary representation is, and I genuinely hope our next President is a woman. Girls and women everywhere seeing themselves reflected in such a powerful position, would carry an unknowable importance and a far reaching, generational effect. If Clinton had won, I would\u2019ve been extremely pleased, but there would always be a sliver of disappointment that it wasn\u2019t someone even better. I can only hope that the DNC stops playing the games they\u2019ve been playing and realizes the only way forward is to let the people be heard with a candidate that is genuinely incorruptible and won\u2019t cower to money, or dogma's influence. That is, if such a candidate is allowed to exist within the realm of the established party in 2020.Whoever that ends up being, whatever their gender, sexuality, race, religion, I do not care. I\u2019ll support THAT candidate wholeheartedly. And in the meantime? Midterm elections are the most important thing we can put our energy into right now. We need better congressional and senatorial representation.\u00a0I want a president who represents the people of this country, and I can't accept that Donald Trump is an accurate representation of us."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "I wanted to read this book, even though before I started I figured I had probably already read most of it via the Facebook group posts, and even though I (correctly) predicted that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy reading the book as much as I did finding one timely post after another in the group. There are still new posts being frequently posted.It turned out that I had missed reading or don\u2019t remember reading a fair number of posts chosen for inclusion in the book. I\u2019d joined the group before the election and the mood there was excited and lighthearted. Since Election Day it\u2019s been more of a support group, but the posts continue to be heartwarming, inspirational, and worth reading, though I miss reading most of what\u2019s posted. There is just too much to take the time to read. The group is more fun and enjoyable than the book partly because I get more from them when I read the posts one by one, even if I sometimes read a bunch in a row. I enjoy the stories & photos and I\u2019m grateful that the group exists. For those who are members of Facebook I recommend following some of the group posts.For those who are not Facebook members and cannot access the group\u2019s posts, read the book. People\u2019s stories & photos are worth reading/viewing. It\u2019s uplifting to read about others\u2019 struggles, triumphs, and their resistance. I love the inclusiveness and collective (short story) storytelling and wonderful photos. I like that so many members of marginalized groups, often scorned by the current administration, are speaking up and telling their stories and the stories of family members. The participants are a true melting pot of people of various genders, relationships, religions, races, and ages, abilities/disabilities, individuals, couples, families, friends, simply telling their truths. I also realize that one reason the group\u2019s posts resonate with me more than those in the book is because one of the great things about the group is how each post gets different types of \u201clikes\u201d and many comments, and often those add immeasurably to the original posts. I love seeing the support the posters get and love giving it too. I\u2019ve never posted in the group and have rarely commented, but I do enjoy liking, loving, sad facing, angry facing, etc. people I want to support. When I joined the group I think there were maybe 100,000 people in it. (I don\u2019t remember the exact number; I wish that I did.) Now there are nearly 4 million people in it. I\u2019m so glad that it continued on past election day!: https://www.facebook.com/groups/pants..."}, {"userName": "Mina Neum\u00fcller Malhotra", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67436366-mina-neum-ller-malhotra", "userReview": "This book is equal parts moving and inspiring.

It is a fairly political book, so those that are strong Trump supporters would not like this, though I believe everyone should read this for the feel-good courage it injects into the reader.

The book is set up chronologically, starting just before the election, with hope and love. The transition through the book, from hope to fear to hope again, is moving and strong. There are parts that made me laugh, and parts that made me cry. It's emotionally evocative and very real. It ends on a note of hope- looking to the future, and knowing that we're part of making it what we need. I also felt very represented in its pages- as a mother, as a woman, as an adoptive mother, as a mother of a special needs child. This is a very special book, and I am so glad it exists in the world."}, {"userName": "Emily Moskal", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19120110-emily-moskal", "userReview": "Should be required reading for anyone seeking elected office at any level. Filled with stories that explain in clear and concise ways why the personal is political, with a through line that highlights why different layers of activism intersect with each other.This book provides a valuable look at the zeitgeist of late October 2016 through the Woman's March. Sociologists, therapists, political scientists and anyone who believes in the art of storytelling to raise awareness and impact change will especially enjoy this. Have a box of tissue handy. Some of these stories will make you cry."}, {"userName": "Rachel- Goodbye Borders", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3040686-rachel--goodbye-borders", "userReview": "I didn't know about this (and I believe myself to be well-informed) until I saw this at my library while browsing.

It is a lovely book - and reminds me how far we have to go and how many people are with us. Pantsuit Nation started as a Facebook page where people would share their support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and share their stories. Some of the stories are moving and full of love and others are heartbreaking stories of sexual abuse and discrimination. But all of the stories, all of the post are full of HOPE. The stories are of women and men full of love and acceptance and strength. Immediately after the election I couldn't read the stories, it was all so devastating. Now, a few months in, I can go back and feel empowered and strong. We have so much work to do. But I believe there are more of us who believe LOVE IS LOVE and equality for all and kindness is key.

I remember being highly skeptical when I saw Libby's initial post about how stories were going to be published (is she getting permission? Who profits? etc.) but with a platform, you can do good, and I'm glad to see the secret Facebook event has grown into a blend of online engagement via storytelling and activism. The book itself is laid out chronologically, and vignettes & photos are formatted beautifully- amazing what happens when content is pulled out of the FB format. From the note at the end, it sounds like users submitted their own posts for physical publication, and people are credited appropriately as they wish (some people with just a name & a state, others with their full name, etc.) What's missing is the engagement derived from being posts in the group- it's hard to have subthreads and dialogues in an organized way in vignettes, I suppose.

While I don't believe in facebook and have serious problems with its privacy and trademark policies, I was aware of Pantsuit Nation during the 2016 Presidential Campaign, and as a woman who worked for nearly a decade in an environment extremely unfriendly to her liberal, LGBTQIA+, feminist, environmentalist, equality-minded self, I was grateful that someone, in this case LIbby Chamberlain, had created an online space for people like me to come together and share their stories. I would argue that this book, and this group, is now more important than ever; it certainly made me feel more connected this week as I tried to distract myself from the path of absolute destruction the current administration seems set on continuing.Thank you to all the contributors, and to the folks who made its creation possible.

In October 2016, Maine resident Libby Chamberlain created a secret Facebook group encouraging a handful of friends to wear pantsuits to the polls. Overnight, the group of thirty exploded to 24,000 members. By November 8th, the group was three-million strong. Since Pantsuit Nation's inception, its members have shared personal stories that illustrate the complexities of living in a vibrant, oftentimes contentious democracy. Members turn to Pantsuit Nation as a place of refuge and inspiration, where marginalized voices are amplified, faces are put to political decisions, resources are shared, and activism is ignited. It is a dynamic, diverse community united by an unwavering commitment to building a more just, inclusive world.Now, hundreds of Pantsuit Nation members have contributed their stories and photographs to form this extraordinary book. An indelible testament to the idea that change comes first from the heart, and that the surest way to move a heart is to tell a story, Pantsuit Nation is a portrait of a moment in history and a rallying cry for our time.", "title": "Pantsuit Nation", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574274-pantsuit-nation", "average": 4.58, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1491331187l/33574274.jpg", "reviews": 43, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16231966.Libby_Chamberlain", "name": "Libby Chamberlain"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Politics", "Feminism", "Art", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574274-pantsuit-nation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
