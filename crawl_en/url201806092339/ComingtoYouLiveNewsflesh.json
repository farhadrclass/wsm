The ending was on par with the story.On the one hand, I do not really understand the point of having this story, on the other hand \u2013 of course, people are curious about the \u2018afterwards\u2019 part. It is somewhat unfortunate that the fourth book in the trilogy (heh) that followed a different group of people was set in the same time period as the first book in the series, otherwise it would have been the perfect book for a little cameo \u2018this is what they are doing now\u2019 to occur. That\u2019s \u2018easier\u2019, in a way, than a full on story. At least for me. Otherwise you get a story like this \u2013 one that many liked, but that I didn\u2019t. It was way too wordy, I mentioned in the same or different status update I\u2019ve already referenced, that the used 99.9% more words than it needed to (actually, I worded it differently \u2013 that it could have been told with 99.9% fewer words).Long and short \u2013 not a story I needed, and I realize that it is my fault that I read it. I read it because I generally like, no, love the short stories that got released along with the \u2018trilogy\u2019. But, not really a story I liked \u2013 and I kind of knew hat going in (and no, I am not rating it the way I am because of preconceptions, otherwise the short story I read between finishing this one and writing this review would also have a rating around 2 stars, instead of 5).ETA: putting this review into the review box caused me to look at my shelves. You know one of the reasons I probably didn't like this story? Spotted it when I spotted what I'd already put on my shelves. 'Zombies'. 'Horror'. There is psychological trauma and a bunch of PTSD going on in this story, but no horror, and the only zombies representation was one wolf (if I recall correctly - Shaun is mentioned going out and 'getting' various types of zombies, animal or human, but the reader doesn't see that, just told. So this really was a navel gazing story with no action. I'm going to have to take a ton of shelves off this book I'd put on preread. No this isn't a horror, no this isn't a zombie book, it's barely post-apocalyptic - only that because . . . it is, but . . . bah).Rating: 2.0March 25 2018"}, {"userName": "Clementine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100472-clementine", "userReview": "Goddamn, this is exactly how a Newsflesh novella should be. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s high-stakes, it\u2019s something new, and it gives me more time with Shaun and Georgia Mason, the most enjoyable action protagonists ever.

Previously published in 2016This is a great short story and a wonderful way to the up questions from the end of the Newsflesh series, but, contrary to the publication date listed on kindle and on Amazon, this novella was previously released in another collection. I love Mira Grant and her other pseudonyms and am always eager for something new to pop up, so I bought this as soon as I got an alert from Amazon. Apparently, this is the first time it is being published in its own as an ebook,hence the new, 2018, publication date. I am disappointed that the author would approve this slightly underhanded method of making more money, but I bet it was the publishing house and Ms. Grant has no idea of their shenanigans."}, {"userName": "saradevil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14527068-saradevil", "userReview": "Solid work, return of some favorite characters. Only real complaint is that I was hoping for more concentration on growth and less on one of the weirdest plot twists of all time. We don't seem to find away around that plot twist and the overall growth, considering the passage of time, leaves a bit to be desired. I love this universe and would truly enjoy seeing a few more stories set here, but perhaps it is time to engage with new characters, or really allow for the exploration of the world through a collection of works ala the short stories."}, {"userName": "Mike Pluta", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43681406-mike-pluta", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of the Newsflesh series by Mira Grant.
