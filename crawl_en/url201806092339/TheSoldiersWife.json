Something about books with an island setting always draw me in. I've become greatly intrigued with The Channel Islands in particular ever since reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. This book only served to reinforce that fascination.The Soldier's Wife had so much to say - about human dignity and perseverance and the make-do spirit and compassion (and yes, passion too). Sure, the inhabitants of Guernsey Island who survived the Nazi occupation between 1939 to 1945 provide a rich backdrop for a novel, but it takes a talented writer to transport the reader to that time and place. Margaret Leroy did just that for me.It seems to me that war disallows us to look at our enemy on an individual, personal basis, instead labeling an entire group as wrong and/or evil. And yet, we know that each side is made up of human beings with homes and families and pets and talents much like each of us. The Soldier's Wife gives us a glimpse into people forced through circumstances beyond their control to live side by side while technically remaining enemies. I believe this story will linger with me a long time."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "It's probably my fault for reading this after The Nightingale... I really did try not to compare the two or hold this up to any expectations, but I think that definitely still happened. I thought this story was kind of simplistic and wasn't that into the characters or the writing style. It seemed more like a brief play than a story with depth that could feel realistic.

Historically, we are perhaps guilty of forgetting about the inhabitants of the small islands caught in the crossfire - they were in 'no mans land' and felt the brunt of much of the Occupation. Vivienne is a mother of two young daughters - and a carer to her ailing mother-in-law - maintaining her home while her husband is away fighting with the allied forces during the war. Her island is gradually inhabited by German soldiers, who commander the homes and possessions of the islanders. Suddenly, the life of her family is dominated by the rules and regulations of the Nazi's; curfews are put into place, you cannot drive your own car and food is scarce. Meanwhile, a POW camp is set up on the island and Nazi's are committing such acts of cruelty to reinforce Hitler's agenda. With such a sensitive subject, I felt the author was respectful of the historical plot of her novel. She shows humanity on both sides of the war; how kindness can be found even in the midst of wartime. Vivienne is an amazing woman; I enjoyed the fact the novel was told from her point of view. The reasons for her actions are not always immediately obvious, but she is a kind and smart woman. Her forbidden love for a German officer is perhaps not too far-fetched; I'm sure there are untold stories of many similar events throughout the war.For fans of historical fiction, this is a pure delight. I particularly enjoy novels set in world war two with a romantic theme, so this was just my cup of tea. I look forward to reading more of the authors work; she is my new favourite historical fictional author!"}, {"userName": "Felice", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2507841-felice", "userReview": "Ever read The Summer of My German Soldier by Bette Greene? It\u2019s about a Jewish teenager named Patty whose town in Arkansas is to house a German prisoner of war camp. Despite the ill will and fears regarding the German nation, Patty befriends one of the young soldiers in the camp. Her friendship with him is an escape from her hard home life and from loneliness but when their relationship is discovered Patty has to choose between popular opinion, her family and this soldier who means so much to her.It is a wonderful novel. It made a huge impression on me as a girl and now I think I\u2019ve read the adult version. It is The Soldier\u2019s Wife by Margaret Leroy. The basic bones in German Soldier and Soldier\u2019s Wife are the same: two women involved with the enemy during wartime much decide where their loyalties lie. That is a good start to a drama, right?The soldier\u2019s wife is Vivienne. She and her young family live in Guernsey. When the war begins Vivienne\u2019s husband is off to fight and she is becomes a single parent and the caretaker to her husband\u2019s mother. Facing the threat of German invasion, many of the inhabitants of the islands send their children away for safety\u2019s sake but Vivienne feels compelled to keep hers with her in the island.The German Invasion does come and with it a harsh occupation. Normalcy is a thing of the past. Vivienne\u2019s life is quickly taken over by food, fuel and every other thing shortages and the increasingly strict restrictions placed on the citizens of Guernsey by the German soldiers. The kindness of one of the enemy soldiers occupying the house next door is the beginning of Vivienne\u2019s affair or her collaboration depending on how you look at it. Leroy is most successful and entertaining when writing about the day-to-day workings of Vivienne\u2019s life and Guernsey itself. She paints an evocative portrait of island life and a woman juggling multiple, complex relationships in an extreme situation but never captures the desperation this existence would have to bring on.Historically The Soldier\u2019s Wife is World War 2-lite. The author breezes through all that hard war stuff and fails to take any advantage of some of the real horrors on Guernsey like the use of slave labor. The heavy concentration on Vivienne's assignations that stay secret for years (Really? On and occupied island?) miss the intensity they could have had if Leroy brought more of the war into the novel. If you know nothing about the German Occupation of the Channel Islands not to worry you will finish The Soldier\u2019s Wife just as knowledge free. It\u2019s too bad. I like the setting and all of the ideas behind this novel but as it turns out The Soldier's Wife is no Summer Of My German Soldier."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3223980-sarah", "userReview": "2.5 stars, but I rounded up because I feel nice today. Also as a sort of atonement for this bit that I just have to get off my chest:PLEASE DO NOT EVER NAME YOUR ROMANTIC INTEREST GUNTHER. I am a child of the '90s and '00s, when I hear \"Gunther,\" I think this: . If you live under a rock and have never seen an episode of the hit sitcom \"Friends,\" that is Gunther, the comically creepy coffee shop worker who is obsessed with Rachel. So yeah. Gunther was supposed to be this intense, attractive, morally grey complex character, and instead, I couldn't help but picture him as creepy Friends Gunther. But alas. I guess I can't really get mad at the author for that. It did make it hard to take the book seriously, though. This is like the fifth book I've read like this, where the shy, quiet-yet-somehow-inexplicably-entrancing young woman draws the attention of a gentlemanly-yet-morally-confused and dashing-yet-wounded German soldier/officer. It's not a bad story, but I've grown a bit tired of that sort of plot. While the story was interesting enough to keep me reading, the characters weren't actually that original or well-rendered, and the pacing and focus of the story was inconsistent (the first half is focused a bit too heavily on a romance which is then almost abandoned in the second half to focus on the forced labor workers). The writing itself was decent, though a bit heavy-handed and preachy about the moral complexities of 1930s-1940s Europe. I'm not exactly sorry I read this book, but it made me realize I really need to stop reading these types of books - I've just gone through too many of them at this point. If you really liked this one, I would recommend Sarah's Key, Those Who Save Us, The Things We Cherished, The Postmistress, and The Kommandant's Girl. If you want a book with a similar setting and issues but a fresher take/different approach, take a look at Postcards from No Man's Land, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Gone to Soldiers, or Five Quarters of the Orange. Sorry for the lengthy book list, but I'm always looking for WWII fiction recs, so I like to try and return the favor.SPOILERS BELOW -Just one last note - I swear to God, enough with the \"cleverly\" \"disguised\" morning sickness written into books like these. If a main character is having illicit sex and then throws up at any point for any purpose in the story, I will immediately assume they are pregnant. I wish authors would stop trying to have a \"surprise\" pregnancy as like a little plot twist. We all see it coming like a mile off, it has ceased to be a twist (or interesting or original). Just had to get that off my chest. It really bugs me."}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "We all have such richness in us-the lives we have lived, the people we have loved, all the things we have longed for. Wherever we go, whatever happens, we carry this ruchness within us. Whatever is done to us. Whatever is taken from us. We should always be grateful for every gift life gives us, and cherish what we have.When the island of Guernsey is taken over by German soldiers during WWII, Vivienne worries that she will not be able to protect her mother in law and two daughters from the savage horrors of war. But when a small group of soldiers move into the house next store, and Vivienne and one of the officers begin to fall in love, she learns that life is more than just simple black and white.I absolutely adored this book, and for so many reasons. First of all the writing was just to die for. Such luscious and vivid depictions of the beauty of Guernsey, which made me completely fall in love with the place and feel as if I was really there. Here is one of my favorite passages;Blanche and I would cycle down the lane that leads to the shore, a lane that is shadowed and secret with branches that meet overhead and musical with the singing the streams that run down to the water there; and then suddenly wewould come out into light at the end of the lane, to the beach that is held between tall cliffs like a jewel cradled between cupped palms, to thr sleek wet sand and the glistening jade-green clarity of the sea.I also loved how very honest this book was. Despite the forbidden romance that took place, it was not a book that showed the war through rose-colored glasses, as they say. War is horrific and brutal, and that fact is demonstrated quite accurately throughout this book. But I honestly feel like the story was made even more beautiful, because of this. Because this is a story about people and human nature, and the way hope and love survives even in the darkest of times.\"The thing is-I'm not very practical,\" I tell him. \"It would be useful now, with the shortages and everything, if only I were more practical, if I were a different kind of person. I suppose I wasn't really designed for such times.\"He smiles slightly, but I see a kind of sadness in his eyes.\"There are few of us, Vivienne, who were designed for such times.\"And honestly, this book really summed up for me in one conversation between two characters, the stark reality of human nature during World War II, or of any time really. Not everyone who fought was an evil person. In many cases they were people who were made to commit evil acts, which is not the same thing.\"I have to tell you,\" he says, haltingly. \"We didn't know the things that were being done in our name. Many of us who served in the army, believing in our country-that we had to restore our pride, to recover the land we had lost-when we saw what had been done, we wept....Not all of us, but some of us.\"\"How could you not have known?\" I struggle. There are no words big enough. \"I mean-even here, on Guernsey-you could see the brutality.\"\"You do your job,\" he says. \"You do what you have to do. You don't always look around you. You don't think about everything. You may feel that is wrong, and you would be right to feel that. But that is how people behave. Most of us, most of the time. People behave how they are told to behave, as those around them behave.\"When you grow up you learn in history class that wars are black and white. This side was good, and that side was bad. But then when you look more closely at it, you find that isn't the case at all. It's just people, acting as people do, with all their varying shades of gray. So basically, this was a very human story. And it made me empathize with many of the characters, even ones I wouldn't have expected to.This was a book I absolutely loved! :)\"The world is so full of terrible things.

Usually I feel quite a bit of emotions when I read about WWII but this one didn't provoke any for me. I never became involved in the characters. I felt so distanced from them that it was hard to care about what happened to them. The writing was ok but there were hardly any actual conversations, all you got were little snippets. And because of that you never really got to know anybody. The main protagonist, Vivienne, was very weak. Who allows their 5/6 year daughter run around on her own with another small child in a German occupied place? The love affair between her and a German officer didn't make any sense. They talked a couple times and next thing they're in bed together. All you got from them were snippets of a couple conversations they had. Hardly a grand love affair, in my opinion. I guess I never saw any love between them---I just didn't get it. Writing was decent but the story was very blah. By the ending, I was feeling: that's it?What did she do for her family? She constantly put them in harm's way. What did she do for love? Nothing.

After her husband enlists, it falls to her to keep her daughters and her ailing mother-in-law safe in a world that has suddenly become alien to her. When German officers requisition the house next door and turn out to be rather neighborly, Vivienne finds herself constantly second-guessing her actions under their scrutiny. Other islanders may be high-minded about fraternization, but Vivienne simply cannot afford those same scruples when her family's well-being is at stake. Only when food from their their own scarce supply goes missing and her younger daughter regales her nightly with tales of the ghost in the barn does Vivienne realize that there is a moral burden unfolding that might become too heavy for her to bear. What I really liked about The Soldier's Wife is that unlike many wartime settings, it leaves room for people who are neither cowardly nor heroic, but somewhere in between. At first I was a little surprised about the rapport Vivienne develops with some of the German officers, but I think it is perhaps a more realistic presentation than the patriotic resistance narrated in The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society. It demands that readers reflect on what they would or would not do to preserve their family: Would you feed another starving human if it means your children will go without food? Would you risk your home as a safe house? Would you turn away from the torture or murder of a prisoner when interfering means deportment to a work camp? How do you raise your child to be a moral person when you cannot the example you want to, because to do so is to risk your life or your child's?And there's always the smaller, garden variety dilemma. If the kind German officer across the street gives you medicine to save your daughter, are you morally required to show him gratitude when it's the German occupation that is causing the dire shortage of needful things? If so, how much gratitude? If medicine is okay to accept, what about a loaf of bread? Clothing? More than anything else, I would say that this book demonstrates that for most of us who aren't cut out to play the noble hero, the lines we draw in the sand between what we are and are not capable of doing are ever-shifting under the weight of our complicated humanity."}, {"userName": "Kat (A Journey In Reading)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689255-kat-a-journey-in-reading", "userReview": "4.5 starsHave you ever wondered how far you would go to protect the ones that you love?

Her husband has been called to serve in the war and she has to decide whether or not to leave the island she calls home. This decision comes because of the rumors that the Germans are to occupy their island.Through the book we are shown the daily life of Vivienne, her best friend, and her children. Soon not only the island, but the house next door are occupied by the enemy Germans. Vivienne tries to avoid the soldier's next door but soon they become part of her life....she soon falls in love with one of them. Even though Vivienne eventually sees the harsh realities of war, from the work camps, starving prisoners, the rationing of food, the story is one that shows you never really know someone, no matter how close you are to them. It also shows that the ones you think are the worst, are actually some of the best.I loved the writing in this story. Some things were predictable and you could see them coming, but there were many more surprises than predictions.

Now I just want to go visit them. But definitely not during a war. Even more definitely not during a time they are occupied by another country working on a little genocide. Just to summarize, there are a few little islands nobody really cared much about that happened to be strategically located between the European continent and the British Isles. The Nazis invaded and built an airfield. This made it particularly convenient for bombing London.The residents of these islands left, for the most part. There were, however, a large portion who didn't believe the war would touch them. The Nazis bombed the crud out of the island to soften them up then peacefully docked their ships, landed their planes and walked right into town, found residences empty, unattended automobiles, etc. and requisitioned them. This is where we find ourselves with Vivienne, a thirty-something mother of two daughters, one a teenager and one a precocious grade schooler. She is also caring for her mother-in-law who seems to be suffering from dementia. Meanwhile, her husband, Eugene, is off fighting the war against the Germans.Enter the Germans who move in right next door. The rank and file German soldiers, including those with higher rank but not SS, are generally affable to the residents of Guernsey, although there is always the renegade soldier who forgets to be polite and shoots a civilian. Vivienne meets Gunther, a gentle man in his forties. She is lonely and recounts her orphan - like childhood, her hurried wedding to Eugene that she never loved, his probable affair and her continued loneliness. Suddenly, it seems, Vivienne and Gunther are having an affair.The most difficult conflict Vivienne finds herself with for the bulk of the book is not a moral dilemma of adultery but whether or not she should be, literally, sleeping with the enemy. Vivienne and Gunther find companionship, solace, friendship, and even love through one another yet Vivienne continues her struggles. The real question then is this; Can a person maintain their high moral ground when engaging in behavior that does not agree with their beliefs? Germany is at war with the world (except Italy). The German army is trying to kill Vivienne's husband, in a sense. Yet Vivienne has feelings for a member of the German army.Meanwhile, other information seeps into Vivienne's consciousness. Of course, there is always a threat of being sent to a prison camp on the mainland or possibly shot, but as a whole, the Germans are fair occupiers. They eat most of the food but it is much more apparent these are men who don't believe in the war as much as those who are actively fighting on the fronts. Yet there are other soldiers referred to as \"OT.\" These may be SS men but they guard the P.O.W.s on the island. It is quickly discovered that there are slave laborers who are being treated as subhumans. It is difficult for the Guernsey islanders to separate the two kinds of soldiers. The prisoners of war are being worked to death, beat to death, starved to death, or simply give up which is the same as the above. They are skeletons and only shadows of who they once were. They come from Poland and Russia and are being used to fortify the island (as if anybody cares about the islands). In order to not have to feed the prisoners, a blind eye is often turned when they escape at night to forage for food. This often means stealing or going through rubbish. This is where Vivienne crosses paths with a prisoner and learns details she wishes she did not.It is a beautifully written book that I highly recommend. It is not cut of the same cloth as the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society which is raw but also quirky and, at times, humorous. The Soldier's Wife is much more of an internal struggle which eventually finds its way to her external world, although it is not a story all told in Vivienne's head. Things happen all the time. Vivienne is constantly trying to balance herself precariously on the highwire of mothering her children, caring for her ailing mother-in-law (knowing these three people are completely dependent upon her), being a good neighbor to Angie, a friend who is falling apart, loving her German lover without revealing secrets she may know yet trying to understand the current world where she is existing. My only dissatisfaction is that I wanted to know Gunther better. Why did she love him? I know he offered her perceived safety and may have interceded on her behalf at times, but I never really knew him. I would also have liked to know more clearly why he and Max ended where they did. Blanche is also remarkably silent except to argue with her sister, Millie, who I absolutely adored, as I did Simon. Blanche would have also been an interesting character to further explore as she is at the cusp of womanhood during the occupation. On the other hand, I am reasonably certain the author did not reveal as much about Gunther as she could have on purpose. In the end, the questions Vivienne had to ask herself and the conflict she eventually needed resolution would have been the same. Wonderful book. Recommended for a book club.Swearing is mild but I do recall one \"f\" word.Sex is moderate but not described in detail.Violence is obviously present as there is a war going on. The book is not riddled with violence but is revealed to Vivienne, shaking her world."}, {"userName": "Emily Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5076891-emily-collins", "userReview": "Coming back into reality can be horribly startling at times. That's the best way to discern an excellent book from a simply okay book. It's the excellent books that make you forget where you are in time and space, entirely blocking out the clock, one could spend hours reading an excellent book and think it was only minutes. Perhaps, of course, in my particular office this may be a problem, but it's all worth it in the end.I hadn't, in a very long while, read a book that made me forget myself, become absorbed wholly in the story, the plot of another world beyond my own. It's a wonderful thing when such books are found, they are to be treasured for their wonder and remarkability. I finished The Soldier's Wife today, it was one of few books that I have read that come from the \"adult\" section of our library. I've been, little by little, trying to transition myself over from the teen section, but it's a scary change, the teen section has been my home for nearly ten years now, I know those shelves like the back of my hand. It was really an especially odd time to choose that book to read because I am trying desperately to finish off a 2011 reading challenge, of which I pledged to read 30 books in one year. I have a number of books from my ever familiar teen section checked out, each of which I could finish in less than a day instead of the three that it took to finish this one. Yet it was apparently a good choice, The Soldier's Wife was much more wonderful than I could have anticipated. I read most of it on our office during breaks between shelving books, and the cliffhangers were horrible when I found that I had to leave again to shelve. But the last section of it, the last bit of that wonderful book, was stunning. The last time I cried over a book was back in July, rereading the Harry Potter series, but this book more than deserved the tears that were shed to it. I cannot spoil it for anyone, that would be more terrible than the worst of crimes. Let me be the one to assure all readers, however, that I, at least, fell in love with this book. There were certain parts that I didn't approve of, which I expected after picking it out of the adult section, and there was one little plot tail at the end that has been a little overdone, at least in what I have read, but overall it was too enthralling, too engaging, to be put down for longer than absolutely necessary. It was after I finally read those last few words and closed the pages that I realized how much I had missed - the calm albeit dreary day had long since turned into a torrential downpour that threatened to break the window above me, and half the people from my office were gone, already having started another cart which I had completely zoned out of. These are the best kinds of books. For a few hours today, I was living on an island occupied by German soldiers during World War II.

Doesn't really conjure up images of a lovely romance for me but I think this is considered Historical Romance. The only thing I found romantic about it was the language and the setting but I did enjoy it. While reading it the star rating swung from 4 to 2 to 4 and finally settled on 3 but then just at the last page jumped it back to 4 again, at the last second. I didn't like the ending particularly but I didn't see it coming so it got an extra star for the shock factor.Vivienne, a soldier's wife, is living on Guernsey with her 2 daughters and her mother-in-law while her husband is away fighting for his country. When the German army come to occupy the island she learns to come to terms with restricted living. When a few Nazi soldiers commandeer her empty neighbour's house she's drawn to one of them in particular (Gunther), and so begins the 'romance'. Vivienne's marriage is an unhappy one and I get the impression that her marriage was over a long time before her husband left to fight but to be honest I still have no clue what she ever saw in Gunther. He didn't strike me as romance material but I think Viv was just miserably unhappy and lonely and whichever of the Nazi's had shown an interest in her would have had just as much chance to get with her.I didn't feel that the romance was actually the focal point of the story for me. It was always there in the background but I was more interested in the Historical aspects. The Resistance from the Islanders, the Prisoners of War, the shortages and rationing...in general the results of the Occupation on the island. There were some really touching moments and some harrowing moments, as you'd expect from a war-time drama and all the characters were really well written and I really cared what happened to them.I was frustrated with the ending though. I was all set to give it 3 stars overall and file it under 'a good read' but then I got to the end and I lost my footing. I'm still not sure how to deal with it. Not sure if I liked the ending, neither am I sure I disliked it. It took me by surprise and when I read it I wanted to know more and was annoyed that I'd never find out...then back pedaled and thought the shock ending was the right way to deal with it. Argh!

When we meet Vivienne she is caring for her mother-in-law and her two daughters while her husband is away fighting for the allied forces in London. From the onset, Vivienne is faced with agonizing decisions; the first of which is whether or not to get on the last boat to London. Shortly after deciding not to go, German bombers announce a takeover with a terrible airstrike that leaves many peaceful Guernsey civilians dead, and marks a change in island life as they know it. The Germans quickly march ashore and take over houses, businesses, and property as their need arises, and impose rules and curfews, putting the island under martial law.When a group of German soldiers move into the house next door to Vivienne and their lives intersect, suddenly alliances become confused. Struggling for an oasis from bad marriages and the horrors of war, Vivienne enters into a love affair with a complex and sensitive German soldier named Gunther. As rumors spread and work camps form on the island, the web in which the characters become entangled takes on life and death consequences, and Vivienne finds herself wondering how well you can ever really know someone.The Soldier\u2019s Wife is a tour de force and one of the best historical novels I\u2019ve read this year. It is reminiscent of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society and Those Who Save Us, and the courageous and sober Vivienne is a character I won\u2019t forget. A perfect blend of plot, tension, and history, The Soldier\u2019s Wife is the kind of book you\u2019ll pick up and not be able to put down until you\u2019ve read the last poignant sentence.Leroy is a gifted writer and I give The Soldier\u2019s Wife my highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "I was disappointed by this novel, the story had potential, the problem I had was with the way it was written. The author sets up a story with a variety of good juicy conflicts and then fails to explore the character's feelings about them. The characters were not well developed and I had a difficult time viewing the relationship between Vivien and Gunther as believable. I didn't feel the love between them, honestly I didn't feel the lust very much either. And the ending was just like the rest of the book, the author offers up a great bit of story and then does nothing with it. This was easy to read but I wish I had spent my time on something else."}, {"userName": "Angel Royal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13262027-angel-royal", "userReview": "Because this book was set on the island of Guernsey, I thought I would love it. But I didn't. Ethically, the plot made me angry--very \"Bridges of Madison County\"-ish. I gave it 3 stars because there was good character development--even though I. Didn't like the main character. It's books like these that make us want to justify affairs and blame them on circumstances. They make us want to believe that the end justifies the means.

It is beautifully written. The descriptions of the sights and smells of the island make you want to visit, but it is easy to imagine what it is like. It also shows that not all German soldiers are monsters like are portrayed in most. WWII stories. Some are kind people who had normal lives and had no choise about serving.

Having loved The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, I had high hopes for this novel and wasn\u2019t disappointed. The writing itself was stunning as was the depiction of Guernsey and the story stole a bit of my heart. The Soldier\u2019s Wife will definitely sit on my shelf to be reread. What stood out most for me was how astounded and left in awe I grew at how Margaret Leroy strung the words of this novel together so poetically and lyrically. This captured my attention even more than the story itself! I reread passages, studied the words and wondered at them the entire way through this novel. It has been a long time since I have read something so stunning and beautiful. I didn\u2019t become as absorbed by the love story as I would have thought which surprised and saddened me. If I had, this story would have blown me away. Because of their distant and seemingly forced relationship, I grew fascinated instead with the small details about the island and life during occupation. Vivienne\u2019s character drew me in and I loved watching her discover what kind of woman she is and how far she will go to protect and provide for her daughters as well as the compassion and kindness she has for others. Her character felt intensely real to me and I was loath to have her story end. Vivienne\u2019s two daughters provided an interesting perspective on the occupation. First, I loved the younger daughter who was so spunky and stubborn and boisterous and left me on the edge of my seat wondering what trouble she might fall into. Then there was the young teenage daughter\u2019s story, which I was left wanting more of. Teetering on the verge of adulthood during such a precipitous time when all the men had left and only German soldiers remained, Leroy touched on the issues with her character, but I would have loved more.I loved the depiction of Guernsey and particularly loved the intricate details about the struggles during occupation from the lack of material for dresses to the food shortages and how they survived by stretching out portions, having to turn into their lands into vegetable gardens and needing to find new foods to enjoy. I will definitely seek out Margaret Leroy novels in the future, and look at some of her previous works."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society opened my eyes to this Windward isle, but left me wanting more knowledge about Guernsey's role during World War II and what it's like today. Leroy deftly weaves that history into this story. She also presents a different social situation. Vivienne, the soldier's wife, is more affluent and not native to the island, but has lived there for about fifteen years when the story begins. She lives in a coastal center occupied by German soldiers. Her unfaithful husband is off fighting the war and not in contact with her. I do not want to give anything away about the book, but little glitches of unbelievability were scattered throughout the telling. For example, being a single mother with two daughters and a mother-in-law under the same roof, over a period of two years, with traumatic events occuring right in front of their eyes, don't you think there would have been more middle-of-the-night encounters with each other? I understand it was a big house, but wow! They were good sleepers! And, personally, I would have been much more protective. How could she let a seven-year-old child roam (even with a boy the same age) into empty buildings? Perhaps it's just that times have changed and the world has become a much scarier place. One other huge struggle I had concerned the amount of deceit contained in this book. She was trying to raise honest daughters but was consistently deceitful, to herself and to others. Under the circumstances of war some of this is a condition of survival. But she went way beyond that, to a point of fault. A fault that held her at a distance to me and dulled my emotion toward her entire story.  I have struggled with my rating for this book. I had settled on 3 stars until the last sentence of the book. I then dropped it to 2. But reflecting upon the value of the story historically, I've raised back to 3. People curious, like I was, about life on the island during WWII will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Vanessa Fenn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5274744-vanessa-fenn", "userReview": "A novel full of grand passion and intensity, The Soldier's Wife asks \"What would you do for your family?\" \"What should you do for a stranger?\" and \"What would you do for love?\"As World War II draws closer and closer to Guernsey, Vivienne de la Mare knows that there will be sacrifices to be made. Not just for herself, but for her two young daughters and for her mother-in-law, for whom she cares while her husband is away fighting. What she does not expect is that she will fall in love with one of the enigmatic German soldiers who take up residence in the house next door to her home. As their relationship intensifies, so do the pressures on Vivienne. Food and resources grow scant, and the restrictions placed upon the residents of the island grow with each passing week. Though Vivienne knows the perils of her love affair with Gunther, she believes that she can keep their relationship and her family safe. But when she becomes aware of the full brutality of the Occupation, she must decide if she is willing to risk her personal happiness for the life of a stranger.This was such a good story and was written beautifully! It was full of love- love for family, love for others, love for lovers, and love for yourself. Vivienne was such a strong woman to be able to give all of herself to everyone in need. I was touched by how much she gave up for her family, friends, and complete strangers.This was very different from other war stories. I appreciated that the author showed that just because someone opposes you, your beliefs, you country, etc.. does not necessarily make you a bad person. Vivienne found herself close to her \"enemies\", and discovered they, as individuals, were kind, compassionate, loving people too. My favorite part of the book was the epiglogue, which is very rare for me. Usually the endings of books ruin the whole story for me. Not so with this one, I feel it wrapped up very nicely, without leaving any questions in my mind. I felt at peace at the end, like it was the natural course for the story. Such a good read!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120940-sara", "userReview": "3.75 Stars. Vivienne de la Mare lives in an old farmhouse with her two daughters on Guernsey in the Channel Islands during WWII. Her husband is away fighting in the English army, and it quickly becomes apparent to the reader that Vivienne's marriage is a loveless and unhappy one. The island suddenly becomes occupied by German troops, some moving in in the house beside her own. Even though Vivienne tries hard to remain aloof for the sake of loyalty (to her country and husband), she eventually enters into an affair with a German soldier, Gunther. I read the plot and thought it sounded amazing. I love a good WWII love story. Yet, it is the love story that I had some trouble with. Even though I felt that the author's main storyline revolved around Gunther and Vivienne, their scenes together were so short and detail-lacking. This kept me emotionally distant from the characters, and I never really bought their romance or felt any depth between them. There were more details about Vivienne's garden or her friendship with her best friend than about interactions with Gunther. Many of the author's passages were very beautiful and haunting. However, I've always thought that the best books are those that make you feel as if you are living inside the story as it unfolds. The Soldier's Wife felt a bit like being told a story from a person who had heard it from another person who had actually lived it. Somewhere along the way the details become lost. It is a good storyline that could have been even better with more developed characters and more attention to detail in the right places. I would suggest reading this book for the historical value it offers and the moral questions it raises, not the romance. If you are looking for a great love story set against the backdrop of WWII, I would highly recommend reading The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons. It is unmatched (in my humble opinion)."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3613718-jen", "userReview": "slow going so far. I want to like this. Edited to Add....I could not finish this book. The further into it I read, the more annoyed I became. I feel like I need to read the sparseness of Hemingway to cleanse myself. Way too many words used to tell this story. The setting was lushly described. I was so intrigued, I looked up Guernsey on Google Earth. The author spends a lot of time and great detail on the food, flowers, and place. However, too much is gauzy and ephemeral. She barely develops characters. The heroine, Vivienne, is not really described as a person. Her children are caricatures. She's wishy washy. She is barely maternal. I don't understand her seeming conflict with her teen daughter. It's not really fleshed out and the daughter is a good kid. Her affair with the german soldier living next door is uninteresting. How can they not get caught in 3 years in a house where they can listen to the creaks at night? The bed springs never make a squeak? It's described in magical terms, again with the ephemeral imagery. The use of the MIL as a literary tool for morality became trite. She too is gauzy in her dementia. When there is clarity is is pinpoint accurate in her disapproval.There were too many \"snapshots\" of life, moments disconnected from advancing the story that unnerved her, such as getting the letter that she burned. Her behavior didn't change.Very little seems like life during war time. I'd rather read first hand accounts on the BBC's wWW2 People's War page.

The author didn't take the easy way out with the ending. Of course, to a large degree, history itself determined the ending, but the author's choices for the paths the characters took were unexpected (I was expecting sappy) and interesting.2. The author clearly has a talent for capturing the mother/child relationship within the pages of a novel. Fellow mothers will spot this immediately and because it was so beautifully executed in the first of the novel, I was hooked for the remainder.The storyline itself revolves around Vivienne de la Mere, a married mother living on Guernsey on the eve of Nazi occupation in WWII. Her husband (with whom she has a very complicated relationship) is off fighting for the Allies, leaving Vivienne on Guernsey to care for their two daughters and her ailing mother-in-law.The crux of the novel is ultimately about the decisions we make in life. There are rarely right or wrong answers and Vivienne's life is no different. When the Nazi's occupy Guernsey and requisition the house next door, Vivienne is faced with decisions that make us (and her) question our morals and values; what is right and wrong.I was never bored for a minute throughout this novel....the author kept me completely engaged. And just when I thought I had the plot figured out, things would change.Lovely novel, altogether.

I didn't want to put this one down. The writing is so descriptive and the wartime plot often made for a suspenseful read. This beautiful and moving story tells the story of Vivienne de la Mare. She lives on the island of Guernsey during WWII. Her husband is off fighting in the war and she is left behind to care for her 2 daughters and her ailing mother-in-law. Next door a group of German soldiers have taken up residence as part of the German occupation of the island. Vivienne quietly cares for her family all the while wondering how she can keep her family safe while German soldiers occupy the island. But then the unexpected happens. Vivienne finds herself falling in love with one of the German soldiers. What follows is a tale of hope, sacrifice, yearning and learning to trust. Margaret Leroy is a talented writer. Her descriptive images stayed with me long after I had put away my book for the day. The storyline moves along slowly, but beautifully. I was immediately pulled into Vivienne's day to day life and I found myself riveted by her fears, her dreams, her romance with Gunther.I have to admit, I even shed a few tears at the end of this bittersweet novel. There is an epilogue and so Leroy takes us from the beginning of this tale to the very end.

Like the Potato Peel Pie Society The Soldier's Wife also takes place in Guernsey during the German Occupation in WWII. Vivienne, who is a resident of Guernsey and has a husband who is a soldier fighting for Britain is left to care for her 2 daughters and mother-in-law while he is away. When Germany occupies Guernsey German soldiers take up residence in the house next door to Vivienne and she ends up falling in love with a soldier named Gunther. The situation becomes complicated when her daughter befriends a prisoner from the work camp and Vivienne decides to help him.The book deals with Vivienne's guilty feelings about her love affair with Gunther, what is right or wrong, the complications of war and her feelings for the enemy, and trying to make the correct choices for her children. It raises the question, What would you do in this situation? I really enjoyed this book and I will think about the story and characters for a long time."}], "description": "As World War II draws closer and closer to Guernsey, Vivienne de la Mare knows that there will be sacrifices to be made. Not just for herself, but for her two young daughters and for her mother-in-law, for whom she cares while her husband is away fighting. What she does not expect is that she will fall in love with one of the enigmatic German soldiers who take up residence in the house next door to her home. As their relationship intensifies, so do the pressures on Vivienne. Food and resources grow scant, and the restrictions placed upon the residents of the island grow with each passing week. Though Vivienne knows the perils of her love affair with Gunther, she believes that she can keep their relationship and her family safe. But when she becomes aware of the full brutality of the Occupation, she must decide if she is willing to risk her personal happiness for the life of a stranger.", "title": "The Soldier's Wife", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10518423-the-soldier-s-wife", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442718986l/10518423.jpg", "reviews": 1426, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/501929.Margaret_Leroy", "name": "Margaret Leroy"}], "type": ["Historical", "War", "Romance", "Historical", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10518423-the-soldier-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11253331-the-collaborator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4492399-yes-my-darling-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1349841.Postcards_from_Berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1349840.The_River_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108586-the-english-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28604824-a-brief-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40494988-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
