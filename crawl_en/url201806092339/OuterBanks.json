Miss/Mrs. Siddons has lovely sentences, and her characters are unique and human, but the book was bogged down by a decidedly gossipy banality, a lack of the poetry of the mundane that made it as much soap opera as a portrait of the human condition; the latter her failed goal. The drama and events are too contrived to be believable."}, {"userName": "Brennan Sigel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221214-brennan-sigel", "userReview": "I thougth this book would be a perfect beach read for my summer vacation in the Outer Banks. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I'd been in a sorority in college...I'm also kind of suprised that this was an option for one of the \"Modern Fiction\" choices during my Junior year of high school.

I saw this book on the sale rack last summer and grabbed it. I've never been to the Outer Banks but am itching to. The book is the story of enigmatic Kate Lee Abrams and her relationship with her 3 college suitemates. Their bond was intense and their eventual betrayal was paralyzing. Kate tells the tale by weaving intricate stories of her college years and giving us a snapshot into her present life as a 42 year old woman - happily married, forever scarred by the tragic death of her 5 year old son, and battling ovarian cancer.What the author did well -\u2022Kate is a well developed, interesting character. Unique. Complicated. Both as a college student and as a adult. There are many layers starting with her father's penchant for fabricating a glamourous lifestyle then his suicide.\u2022The supporting characters (Ginger, Fig, Cecie, and Paul) are also spot on. These are not your run of the mill, prefabricated college characters. \u2022The majority of the novel's action occurred during their college years in the 60's in Alabama. I was taken in by the girls' relationships and the ways their friendships ebbed and flowed.\u2022Kate's life is transformed her junior year by her love affair with an alluring, older student, Paul Sibley. I enjoyed the portrayal of the intoxicating and reckless passion of the love at that age. Weaknesses\u2022I wasn't sure what kind of book this was. Chick lit. Romance. It started off strong with an interesting psychological profile of a frustrated college gal. Then it ended overly dramatic and all Danielle Steele-y.\u2022The author tripped over her language sometimes. She'd be rolling along then get tangled in a few sentences or vocabulary that didn't feel congruent with her overall style and tone.\u2022The ending was off for me - interesting but different than I expected based on the rest of the book."}, {"userName": "Booknblues", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues", "userReview": "Anne Rivers Siddons, the author of Outer Banks is comfortable explaining the southern soul, but she also understands the depth of friendships that develop during a young woman's formative years. Many of us can remember the deep friendships we formed when away at college for the first time. We often look at these friendships with idealism and nostalgia.Kate who is fighting a battle with cancer is asked to attend a reunion with her three closest college friends, Cecie, Ginger and Fig. Kate is unsure that she wants to return or see these friends again. There was a time when she loved them dearly, but that time is long past and betrayals bridge that gap.Siddons presents a book in which things are not what they seem . There are numerous deceptions and undercurrents beneath the surface of the happy reunion. Each participate has developed their own agenda and their perception of their happy college life differs vastly.The setting of the outer banks is intriguing and the reader feels the attraction of the sun and ocean. Soon the reader also begins to feel the compelling and seductive force of the waves and is effect on the lives of those of the shore dwellers.I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy stories about complex relationships"}, {"userName": "Marni", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1029820-marni", "userReview": "OK, so the writing was good, even better than good--but I HATED the plot. I particularly HATED the ending. It was stupid, I felt manipulated, and it did not even tie up all the loose ends. I will never read another book by this author again....I really mean it. I actually re-read the last chapter to see if I had missed something, some clue, some word, that would have it make more sense--but nothing, not a shred of comprehension came from it. A cheap stupid ending with a heroine who was always weeping. So 2 stars for writing style but minus 4 for being ridiculous and totally unbelievable.

When a friend recommended \"Outer Banks,\" I bought it sight unseen, thinking anything Siddons writes will be good. \"Outer Banks\" is yet again another of Siddons' captivating reads. Its first person narrative from the voice of a woman, now in her early fifties, as she reflects on the people involved in the most pivotal phase of her life is resplendent with the kind of poignancy we all can relate to. It is a story that begins in college, where the narrator comes to a small Southern college and is befriended by a group of girls that leave an indelible mark. In the midst of this circle enters Paul Sibley, a slightly older, mysteriously handsome and rather exotic architectural student, who is a standout amidst this staid environment, and who overwhelms the narrator as they enter into a relationship that begins in ecstasy and ends with a wound that never heals. But life carries on, with its scars of disillusionment and betrayal, and although the narrator agrees to a reunion with the players involved in what we learn is her life's painful turning point, \"Outer Banks\" is a full-circle story with an uncanny resolution. Populated with singular and fully developed characters in a well-rounded group of friends, the reader comes to know each character intimately. We know their backgrounds, their motivations, their unique personalities and their hidden fears. As the setting, Outer Banks, North Carolina is the location of the vacation home of one in this group of friends. It is its own character; this vast, desolate beach terrain, where an opulent beach-side mansion hovers over the crashing waves in an area that feels like the dark side of the moon. It is within these walls that the characters revisit the dynamic set in play thirty years earlier. Though time has evolved, their way of relating to each other has not, and deep seated resentments come to the fore in a manner that provides eventual redress. This book has an ending I can only describe as utter fantastic, and I use this word in the truest sense of its meaning. It verges on gothic in its surreal, dramatic urgency. It frightens and shifts and catches the reader unaware. I recommend this book for its brilliant story development and because Siddons wrote the kind of characters one never forgets."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "Elegant Kate, walking a tightrope over an abyss of lies; Cecie, self-contained, sensitive and sensible; Ginger, the sexy, vibrant, richer-than-sin heiress and poor, hopeless, brilliant Georgina, nicknamed Fig - came together as sorority sisters on a Southern campus in the 1960s. Four women bound by rare, blinding and early friendship. They spend two idyllic spring breaks at Nag's Head, North Carolina, the isolated strip of barrier islands where grand old weather beaten houses perch defiantly on the edge of rugged cliffs overlooking a storm tossed sea. Now, thirty years later, they are coming back - back to recapture the magical memories of those early years, to experience again the love, the enthusiasm, the passion, pain and cruel betrayal that shaped these four young girls into vibrant young women and set them off on the courses of their lives.I really enjoyed this book.

Thirty years later, the group gathers again for a week at Ginger's place at Nag's Head to get caught up and reminisce about old times. All is not as it seems... I'm sure I read this back in the 90's when it first came out - I read several of her books about that time. So I added it to my Goodreads list without read dates or review. Recently, I found a second hand copy and thought I'd read it to be able to post my thoughts. The first two thirds of the book are the background information from the college years, with current experiences of Kate who is the narrator. It is only the last third which is the actual reunion week in Nag's Head. I'm giving this 3 stars because I enjoyed the majority of it. Yes, it's chick lit, but it was a diversion from heavier things I was reading at the same time. My problem with this was the ending. I can't decide if the whole book was building to that climax or if the author got to a point and didn't know how to finish it off and this is what she came up with."}, {"userName": "Kerry Hennigan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5941368-kerry-hennigan", "userReview": "I think this is the second Anne Rivers Siddons book I ever bought and read (on the strength of how much I enjoyed \"Hill Towns\").

Before she surrenders to another round of debilitating chemotherapy, she wants to enjoy one last magical summer with the three friends from her student years.\"Outer Banks\" is Kate's narrative of the heady days of Tri Omega sisterhood with Cecie, Ginger and Fig, of a devastating love affair that tore the friendship apart, and finally, of getting back together all these years later.As is typical of all her books,\"Outer Banks\" is an effortless read that is full of character insight and atmospheric description.

She is a middle-aged woman looking back to her college years in a sort of \"how did I get here\" experience. I always enjoy getting to know her characters and locations and have taken several East coast vacations largely due to the interest in the area that her books left with me. I read this book again when years later I finally went to the Outer Banks on vacation and found a tattered copy where we stayed. Having read everything ARS has ever written, the characters and places get somewhat familiar. She gets me involved and attached to her characters and then stirs everything up for the ending.

The story theme was about false appearances, people acting on the surface in civilized and splendid fakery, like the elegant dancing of 18th century Baroque minuets. The setting is four middle-aged sorority girls and a reunion at a grand house on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. We have Kate Stuart Lee, neither a Lee of Virginia nor offspring of General Stuart. Her boyfriend Paul Sibley, a prostitute's son whose mother took the last name of a construction company her brother worked for, who dumped her to marry the rich Ginger Fowler. Then there's Cece Hart, a girl we never really got to know, and the dumpling Fig Newton who was made fun of and grudgingly accepted.The story jumps between flashback and the present day, when a sick Kate Lee gets an invitation from Ginger Fowler Sibley for a reunion. Kate's husband, Alan, for some inexplicable reason urges her to go. This felt like a set up to me. Why would he want Kate visiting the very house she was supposed to marry Paul in, especially after Kate calls Paul's name in their last lovemaking session? Incomprehensible.Okay, so suspend disbelief of Alan, the hapless husband. Now the four aged cronies are gathered together and all they do is drink and reminiscence, while the enigmatic Fig watches and waits with catlike anticipation. The similarities to C. S. Lakin's Innocent Little Crimes begin to arise as the memories become more pointed, jabbing and setting off one friend against the other. The climax comes when Paul, who was supposed to be staying elsewhere, arrives at the eve of the storm. Literally the gloves come off and once again, four women fight their feelings at his presence.It turns out that underneath all the veneer of friendship and affection lay great ugliness. This book really does make you think. While you're feigning affection to me, can you tell that I'm pretending to like you? At the end, the one true friend is the one who would risk your displeasure and her own life to drag you out of the pretend world you mired yourself in.[4.5 stars] Up to 98% this book was 5 stars. But my biggest question is unanswered. Who shot ***? If anyone knows, please comment or tell me. It seems to me the author dug herself into a hole and came up with a convenient/cliched solution that does not keep with the character she created. I would have thought this character would want to stick around and enjoy the mayhem she worked so hard to cause. This little twist ruined the entire story for me. And honestly there are better ways to work the plot to achieve the same result. Instead, it feels like the story ran out of steam and she just wanted to end it. And sadly, the coverup and lies continues."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5492631-virginia", "userReview": "Anne Rivers Siddons has a gift for story-telling. Her use of language is unsurpassed in this era in which just about anyone can write a novel and get it published. Her stories have the ring of truth. You believe they could have actually taken place.Outer Banks was the first is Siddons novel I ever read. Actually, I listened to it probably 20 years ago and I never forgot it. Years later, I took it out from the library and read it again. Recently, I bought a first edition at a local library book sale and I just re-read it for the second time. Even if you know the story, even if you know the characters, even if you know how it ends, this book will grab you and hold you. You will have to force yourself to put it down. I read its 300+ pages in less than 24 hours although it was my third go-round.This novel tells the tale of four women - Kate (the narrator), Cece (Kate's best friend), Fig (the difficult and odd character) and Ginger (the girl everyone loves). They come together as sorority sisters in a southern college. They are friends, close friends, although Fig is an outcast, ugly, annoying, irritating. She constantly writes in a diary in front of others. Everyone, including Kate and Cece laugh at her behind her back. at least they think it is behind her back. Kate is the first to find a serious boyfriend and the first to graduate. Because of something one of them has done, they do not see each other again for 28 years until Ginger invites them to her home on the Outer Banks where everything comes to a head.

I'm so glad that I did, because I'm truly surprised by how much I liked this book, and for all the reasons that it appealed to me when I first read the reviews back in my Davis days. It is all about female friendship and the complex, unpredictable nature of life, but really the Carolina coast is central to everything that takes place in this book. It will make you want to rent a beach house in Nags Head on the Outer Banks, a place that I have never visited, but feel I can vividly imagine after reading this book. If you can't take a summer beach vacation, this book, along with a glass of Southern sweet tea, would be a good substitute.
