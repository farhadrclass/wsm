It had been out about a year at that point and so it's certainly not an older book, but it is very underrepresented in my opinion. I can no longer remember exactly where I heard about it and I'm pretty sure I picked it up based on the strength of the cover alone. Take a look at that baby. Just gorgeous. And an actual scene from the book--one of my very favorite things. The fact that it was YA historical fiction set during the late 1970s in Communist-occupied Poland certainly intrigued me. You don't get many of those, you know? I had never heard of Dandi Daley Mackall before, but my library happily had a copy on the shelves so I went and checked it out immediately. And I'm still surprised at how little I see this book mentioned around the blogosphere because it's really rather lovely and a thoughtful, well-researched coming-of-age tale as opposed to an flimsy excuse to hook the main character up with a Polish hottie and gallivant across the countryside amorously. Not that I wouldn't read that book! Don't get me wrong. But, in the end, I infinitely prefer a realistic and resonant tale such as this one.The year is 1978. Eva Lott is feeling pretty good about life in general. Her senior year is shaping up to be pretty close to perfect and she's just made the varsity swim team. Then her English professor father has to go and ruin it all by announcing that the two of them are moving. To Poland. Effective immediately. It turns out he's decided to join the underground movement and Eva has no choice but to tag along. She spends the first portion of the story coming up with increasingly far-fetched ways she can sneak back to the States or convince her father she has no business being in Poland at all. Meanwhile, her father settles in to teach his young compatriots about journalism as they work to smuggle an illegal printing press into their home in order to spread their message opposing the rampant oppression of freedom of speech and the Polish people. When Eva finds herself rubbing shoulders with political activists no older than herself, things take on a slightly different slant. And when she gets to know Tomek--one of the rebels living in the crowded house her father takes her to, Eva's perspective begins to change on so many levels it is difficult for her to take it all in and her life in Chicago seems a very far away, very tame place indeed. Until I read this book, I knew next to nothing about the modern-day Communist occupation of Poland. Following Eva as she leaves her home and friends in Chicago to follow her father to Poland, sharing a tiny room with him in a house full of rebels, I found myself quickly caught up. Though she initially sounds and acts like the stereotypical clueless, privileged spoiled teenager, she becomes curious and sensitive to the culture and history of her new home once the importance of what is going on around her begins to sink in. Everything about this novel unfolds slowly. So slowly that you don't at first realize how involved you've become. But it's certainly a journey worth taking. Their initial border crossing is vividly tense and chilling. You feel, along with the entire group of rebels, the suffocation and knife edge intensity of the occupation. Eva learns that sometimes life takes you by the throat and hurls you bodily into the middle of a war zone. She learns there are things in that war zone worth fighting for, that her life can be bigger than it was, that the seed of a plum can hold the spirit of a nation. And the ending is worth every page that it takes to get there. I finished it both satisfied and moved. EVA UNDERGROUND is a wonderful read about a harrowing and fascinating period in history."}, {"userName": "Tasha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028205-tasha", "userReview": "It's 1978 and Poland is still under communism's reign. The militia control everything from food to religion. How does this relate to American girl Eva Lott? Well her father has decided to uproot her from her perfect life in Chicago to a small village in Poland in order for him to lead an underground newspaper. Eva is devastated. She doesn't want to leave her amazing best friend and her awesome boyfriend, plus she just earned a spot on the varsity swim team. Eva is furious that her father won't let her stay with her best friend Melanie, but with no other choice she packs two measly suitcases and accompanies him on his journey. After an arduous and frightful trip, Eva and her father finally arrive in Poland and are greeted by Tomek. Tomek doesn't say much, but Eva finds him very handsome, although he seems very standoffish. He leads them to a house in Zakopane, Poland which will be the newspaper's headquarters. Tomek introduces them to all the other people living in the house, but Eva feels unwelcome and immediately starts planning an escape route. When it finally comes time to escape Eva feels that she has become used to Poland and it's strangeness. She also thinks that there may even be something pulling her towards Tomek. Will Eva stay, or will she go? Will her father be successful in creating an underground newspaper?This book was okay. To me it started out a little slowly. It wasn't until about the half-way point that I really got interested in the story. I had never really read anything about the \"Iron Curtain\" in Poland and this really opened my eyes to what other people, who were not free, had to endure on a day-to-day basis. The romance that blossomed between Eva and Tomek was cute - it wasn't unexpected, but it was sweet. What can I say, I'm a sucker for love!! I have to say the historical facts were my favorite part of the book. They are the only things I really remember."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/265580-vicki", "userReview": "Wow -- this is a really well done, really inventive story. It's the late seventies, and Eva Lott and her father head to Poland to help a group of students and a subversive Catholic priest set up an underground publishing group. They learn how dangerous life is for the average Pole, and they learn what it means to be without the most basic freedoms. But what I think the book's real strength lies in Mackall's ability to create interesting situations, and feelings -- the relationships don't feel like cliches, and the scenes are really beautiful. Just wait until you get to the plum harvest.A lovely story about love and loss of all kinds. Loved it!"}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7174-samantha", "userReview": "YA book.

I thought it was really sad how Eva had to leave American because she really did not want to. She had the perfect life, and although her mom passed away and things were rough for her and her father, she still had positives to live for in her life. Then, she is forced to move to Poland because that is what her dad wants. Once she moves to Poland she finally becomes accustomed to life there, and even beings to enjoy life there. She meets a man named Tomek who even tries to escape with her to help her father. She meets very many adults she can trust there and finally begins to like her life again. Then, in the end she is forced to move back to America. When she first had to move I felt very sympathetic for her and was happy when she was finally found a good friend and her and her father were able to find people she trusted. I was sad with how it ended because I did not like how she had to move back once she had created a new life for herself. Overall, it was a good book I just did not like how it ended."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Mackall, Dandi Eva Underground, 256 p.

Eva Lott, the 18 year-old main character, is dating the best-looking guy in school, and she just made the varsity swim team. So when her widowed father tells her its time to move, she is not happy. (pg 2) It says \"of course she wasn't all right\". Eva wasn't just angry, but she was also very scared while driving through the gates with her father. The guards had machine guns and were worried about their own people escaping to freedom. (pg 3) She also missed her friends in America and wrote lots of letters to them. (pg 35) Eva Lott is having a pretty good senior year in Chicago, until her father says she must move away from her friends to communist Poland to help with a radical underground movement. The government is watching their every move, and Eva wants to go back to the states. Will she stay in Poland or will she escape? As she was considering her escape, \"never once has she considered the possibility that a huge city like Krakow wouldn't have a flight home\".The novel is written in third person point of view. It allows you to see everyone's point of view and not just Eva's point of view. It describes conflicts between the characters so you can understand how everyone is feeling and not just the main character. The themes are change, family and adaption, because Eva had to leave everything behind, adapt to Poland, and change into a better person. While Tomek had to adapt to a spoiled american stranger in his home. The mood starts off all depressed because Eva's wonderful life is about to change and she doesn't know how its going to be. Towards the end it gets happier and hopeful because the two characters found friendship and she is beginning to think that she also found other people that can feel like family. I think this quote is the most important on pg 100: \"But for the first time in a long time, in spite of everything, Tomek Muchowiecki felt hope\". This quote is important because even though he should have felt scared, he didn't because when he was with Eva, everything was better when they were together. The way in which I connect the most with Eva is that we both are very good swimmers and we both live in a community that we wouldn't want to leave. \"She just made the varsity swim team\", Eva earned a spot on the varsity swim team and had the perfect life, and was so furious that her father wouldn't let her stay with her best friend Melanie. With no other choice she packed two small, pathetic suitcases and accompanied her father on his trip. This book was pretty good. To me it started out a little slow, and it wasn't until about the first few chapters that I really got interested in this story. I never read anything about the \"Iron Curtain\" in Poland and this opened my eyes to what other people who were not free, had to go through everyday. I would rate this book out of a 1-10 as an 8, because this was one of the best historical fictions books I have read. Mackall does a great job of showing relationships, suspense, and characters that stay with you even after you're done reading. I would say this is for all ages from 10 and up, because it is pretty easy to understand and it is a really interesting book that anyone would love. *SPOILER ALERT*Happiness does not last forever...or maybe for some people it does. The climax of the novel is when Eva must leave and get on the train back to her home in Chicago, but Poland really grew on her. Before she must go, Eva and Tomek walk around the town once again so she will remember Zacopane and her newly made friends. (pg 230) \"Could we go see Wawel one more time, Tomek?\" The time went by so fast with each other. As she makes her way onto the train, she must make a quick decision whether she will go back to Chicago or stay and help put the movement back together. (pg 234) \"The heart of Poland was beautiful! And in that moment she knew. She couldn't leave this country, not yet. She couldn't leave this man.\" So Eva runs back to Tomek yelling his name excitingly saying that she wishes to stay. (pg 236) \"He ran as fast as he could toward her.\" Eva's father would be back soon and he would understand why she did not leave, and in the mean time they had plenty of things to do."}, {"userName": "BOOK BUTTERFLY", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2341206-book-butterfly", "userReview": "It's 1978 and Eva Lott is just your average American teenager getting ready to start her senior year of high school. That is, until her dad drags her kicking and screaming to Communist Poland. He wants to help the local people with a radical underground literacy movement and Eva soon becomes a part of that world. She learns that the average Pole does not have basic freedoms and that their daily lives are downright dangerous at times. Forget about good old American pepperoni pizza, rock-n-roll and freedom of speech. The government is always watching and listening, ready to suppress and control. Most people are poor, with little coal to heat their homes and even less to eat. (To paint a picture for you, bread with lard is something of a delicacy!)If you were in Eva's shoes, wouldn't you want to hop on the next flight out of the country and get back to the good old USA? That was Eva's plan. Until she met Tomek. Ah...Tomek! The handsome, moody and so intelligent boy who draws her into his world and captures her heart. Through their unusual friendship, Tomek opens Eva's eyes to the sheer beauty of the Polish country and the brave struggles of those fighting for freedom and independence within.I absolutely fell in love with this book. I think the romantic cover captured my heart from the start! I really enjoyed Eva's progression from your typical self involved American teen to the soulful, passionate person she became during her time in Poland. My favorite aspect of the novel, however, was the manner in which Eva's and Tomek's relationship unfolded. The believable, interesting situations were all beautifully woven through Dandi Daley Mackall's skillful narrative. Alternating the chapters between Eva and Tomek's point of view was a smart move. I think it allowed for a deeper connection to both characters with the way we were able to get inside their different mindsets. If you do read this novel, just wait until you get to the \"plum harvest\". Those chapters were my absolute favorite. I can honestly say I still carry them with me in my heart.In a 2006 interview with Cynthia Leitich Smith, Dandi Daley Mackall described how she based this book on her own experiences in Poland circa 1978. After reading Eva Underground, I could really appreciate the authenticity of the novel. It was evident to me that Mackall had her finger on the pulse of the Polish heart and soul. I also must admit, I knew little about what life was like in that tumultuous time period of history. Eva Underground really opened my eyes. I honestly felt like I was right there with Eva, suitcases in tote, following along in her footsteps. Eva Underground is a novel that should appeal to readers of all ages, with its romance, suspense and universal issues of freedom and hope."}, {"userName": "Allison (The Allure of Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1637878-allison-the-allure-of-books", "userReview": "Eva Underground by Dandi Daley Mackall takes us back to Communist Poland. Our main character, Eva, and her father travel there from Chicago because Eva's father wants to help the radical underground movement. Eva is angry and afraid - she has no desire to be a part of the group or be anywhere but home with her friends in Chicago. Slowly but surely, she becomes immersed in her surroundings and begins to understand the importance of what her father and his friends are trying to accomplish. She also quickly becomes interested in Tomek, the 19 year old translator.I really felt like I got an inside view into a piece of history I had little to no prior knowledge of. I was impressed with the way Dandi was able to both keep things basic enough to be easily understood and intense enough to feel harsh and realistic. It doesn't take long for Eva to begin to face the harsh realities of life head on. As she becomes more interested in the people around her, she is introduced to her own shortcomings (namely, being a spoiled American) and ends up trying to grow into a person she can look in the mirror and be proud of.One of my favorite parts of the book is when she travels with Tomek to his family's plum orchard. She initially goes only to try and get in with Tomek, but once she is there - she falls in love, not only with him, but with his family and community. She discovers the beauty of people - even when under intense pressure from the government and from the simple fact of being poor - she sees people refuse to compromise integrity, honesty and basic human decency.This is not one of the books that is written in such a way that the reader becomes a part of the story. I always felt very much like an onlooker versus a participant. So, while I don't feel that the writing itself is extraordinary on its own, I do believe that the story it told is. There is a lot of intensity and tension packed into a fairly short book; I definitely recommend taking the time to read it!"}, {"userName": "Liz B", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179668-liz-b", "userReview": "This is a really good YA that has somehow been overlooked/ missed. I bought it a few years ago just based on the strength of the premise: an American girl goes to live in Communist Poland in 1978. Talk about unusual.So I just got around to reading it myself--a colleague read it and liked it, and the kids have been liking it. And now I think we might need to buy out Amazon because I'm guessing it's out of print, since it never came out in paperback. And it should have!The details of setting are fascinating and rich, and it is interesting seeing them through Eva's (spoiled American) eyes, which are--of course--our eyes as well. Nothing feels exaggerated; although Eva and her father are working with an underground group, the group is mostly about thinking and talking and writing (and coming up with a printing press). There are dangers, but they are not omnipresent.This is a coming-of-age story and a romance,, and Mackall moves between 3rd person limited through Eva's eyes and the eyes of Tomek, a young Polish interpreter and college student. They both have some learning and growing to do, and there is a gradual and sweet romance that grows up between them. Although the reader part of me wishes this were a bit more developed (hey, I like romance), with more interaction between Tomek and Eva, the teacher part of me thinks that it's fine as it is, so that the story can be more about the time and place than about the romance.Although the cover & content make it seem like a girl book, one of my colleagues says that boys in his class have liked this novel too.

I know the book was published back in 2006 but it seems in recent years that most YA novels are focused on vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and fairies (you get the point). While I love a good paranormal/supernatural story like the next person, I must admit that it's beginning to get hard to weed out the diamonds among all the coal (like that analogy? hehe).

I cannot think of a single thing that I did not like about this book. I had not really heard much about the subject matter (1970's Poland) and I found myself fascinated with the new world in which Eva finds herself. The writing and story-telling is pure magic, none of the interactions between characters seems forced and the story seems believable. This is probably due to the fact that the author based the novel off of her own life. I loved watching Eva's character change and learn to see the world through different eyes.
