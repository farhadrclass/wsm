Parental duty and earnestness are parodied and filial loyalty is mocked mercilessly. Families are termed 'dysfunctional' because it's members are certifiably neurotic.Bee Season turns the tables on this traditional slander. Its four characters - Mother, Father, Son, and Younger Daughter - come into the family, not so much psychically damaged as incomplete and certainly neurotic. Each strives for completeness in his or her own way, assisting or inhibiting the others along the way. But it is in and through the family that all recognise both their inadequacies and the effect of their strivings on the others. Families, in other words, are therapeutic. Families mitigate the neuroses of individual members.Father, for example, is a theological scholar who feels himself a failure for never having experienced the spiritual transcendence he seeks. Daughter is a prodigy at spelling who wants Father's attention and some social recognition. Adolescent Son tries to recapture an infantile feeling of the divine presence. Mother acts out her inadequacies in petty thievery. While the condition of the family is the arena in which they operate, none of these 'neuroses' has its origin in the family itself. Despite their apparently diverse, and uniquely personal, objectives, each member of the family is secretly pursuing the same goal of completion. And it is the gravitational field of the family, it is difficult to find a word other than love for this field, which gives them the strength and confidence to do this. Their forays into the world, sometimes bizarre, always end with a return to the touchstone of family life, including the routine weirdness of each other. Each in their own way is 'excessive' but their excess is simply accepted by the others, not encouraged.Eventually, secrets become public knowledge. And in the mirror of the family, everyone develops into his or her own person. They leave it. But this is not a failure of the family; it is its success. Not dysfunction, then, but precisely its function: to reveal what has been hidden and thrust it into the world. And the family persists in an entirely new form. An intriguing fiction that avoids cliche and provokes some interesting thought, therefore."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2499261-rachel", "userReview": "Sometimes when a person I've just met or a well-meaning family member talks about my future children, I stop to correct them. \"Oh, no, I don't want kids,\" I say, laughing breezily to lighten this very personal revelation. This answer garners one of two responses, neither of which are very polite. Either my conversation partner will look at me with eyes of wisdom and upraised chin and say, \"You're young, you'll change your mind,\" or they'll screech \"WHAT???!!! Yes. You do!\" But I don't want kids and probably never will, and it's not a shoot from the hip folly of youth sort of idea but a decision I've given a lot of thought to. My family history is a potpourri of unpleasant genes that I would hate to pass on to another human being. The world is overpopulated enough as it is. Plus I am almost certain that I would be the Ayelet Waldman mother who resents her kids at least half of the time for taking energy and focus away from her relationship with her husband. Above all, I have never had that \"maternal instinct.\" It's just not there. In my early teens I was sometimes forced to babysit for my younger cousins with my sister. I would lay on the couch and read and dole out snacks, counting the minutes until my aunt and uncle came home, while my sister picked up the kids and played and changed their diapers and talked so easily in those baby voices that I refused (and still do refuse) to use. Kids can be cute, but I don't want to spend too much time with them. Some of us are meant to be parents. Some of us are not. And I think it's better for those of us who are not to recognize that before we screw up the next generation. Bee Season is an entire book about what happens when two people who shouldn't have kids go ahead and have kids. Predictably, the kids are treated as appendages, unconsciously encouraged to compete with each other for their parents' favor (which isn't even favor so much as just attention) while their parents try to make themselves whole. The Naumann household is something of a worst case scenario. But it should be required reading for those You Really Want Children, Yes You Do! people.Goldberg's depiction of the brother/sister relationship between the Naumann kids, Eliza and Aaron, is perfect. Before they got to the age where they realized they were in competition to be the smartest, most worthy child, they were a team, scheming to get the best pieces of cake in the synagogue. It's heartbreaking (but true) when Aaron starts to ignore Eliza and can't even look at her face over dinner, once she starts winning her spelling bees and winning over their father where their father was previously Aaron's alone. That's exactly what happens in a family where love is based on merit. Resentment for that parent is only a speck of a seed, to bloom sometime in the future when the child is old enough for hindsight. I also liked Aaron's religious wanderings as a rebellion to his father's Judaism, once his dad stops paying attention to him. There is some interpersonal reason for everything that happens in this book, but the reasoning is never too annoyingly obvious. Goldberg is a smart writer that way. Bee Season is very well done. But I can't say I loved reading it, because the Naumanns are so much like a real, recognizable family that it's uncomfortable. Who loves reading about parents who shouldn't be parents parenting? I don't. But I do love reading about kids overcoming the issues born of their parents who shouldn't have been parents, and there is enough of that here to make the reading worthwhile. It's more like 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/243988-lisa", "userReview": "This book was masterfully written and extremely surprising. I picked it up off my roommate's shelf thinking, \"Oh, this looks like a sweet little book about spelling bees.\" I don't even know where to begin in describing how wrong I was. That was one thing that made the book so stunning: it completely circumvented my expectations. The story is complex, with overtones that are varyingly dark and bright and intriguing. I think you could have conversations for hours about the characters in this book--their brief perceived brushes with perfection/God, their sense of loss as it slips away, their longing to experience it again, and the isolation that results from their individual obsessions with recapturing that moment of wholeness . . . I gave it 5 stars because I felt like the writing was so very, very good. I would definitely recommend this book, with a warning that its tone of dysfunction is so vivid that it may pervade your personal life as you read it--but I wouldn't let that stop you, it's worth it."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1098783-bonnie-jeanne", "userReview": "So much is made in other reviews of this book of the family that seeks perfection only to fall further and further from it, but I think the story isn't so much about perfection as it is about just plain seeking. It didn't end like \"American Beauty,\" but I think the ending is just as it should be. I didn't see the Naumann family as at all eccentric. They are a family like any family, with communication trouble, secrets, and compulsions. What difference does it make if a compulsion brings you into strangers' homes to collect an item that is calling to you, or wash your hands a million times a day, or simply buy just one more book when you already have so many at home that you will never in one lifetime read them. Compulsion is the \"irresistible impulse to perform an irrational act,\" and I think it is the eccentrics who don't have that impulse. Those of us who recognize it, and perhaps change it, are perhaps luckier than those whose compulsions bring them terrible harm, but that is another story.his story is just a wonderful read that puts you inside your own kaleidoscope.

(And I must admit it's more exciting and disturbing than my family or my childhood...for one, my only brush with Hare Krishna was at the Crazy Wisdom Tearoom in Ann Arbor, where they played a soundtrack that chanted \"Hare, Hare, Hare Krishna\" all day long. Great for grading papers.) So yes, Bee Season is a great read (I devoured it in two hot-and-heavy days) and it makes some very groovy connections between spriritual and intellectual growth, between obsessions and possessions we can see and ones we can only conjure manifestations of. Goldberg captures beautifully the suffocating love and expectations (administered in special cases through skill-and-drill) that parents inflict on their children, as well as the cruelty kids inflict as they seek to aggressively distinguish themselves from their parents. As the book progressed, however, I felt the characters were retreating from me and turning into symbols/crazy people. I like symbols and crazy people and symbols for crazy people (see: the Artist Formerly Known as Prince), but I put the book down feeling a little disappointed, missing the people I had been delighted, for a time, to meet and follow."}, {"userName": "Nikoleta", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13362307-nikoleta", "userReview": "\u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc. \u0394\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1. \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac, \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03b4\u03c5\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 (\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1), \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2. \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5. \u039c\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf perfectimundo \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u2026 (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u03af \u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2)\u2026 \u03a4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1!"}, {"userName": "Bree", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/802619-bree", "userReview": "I picked up this book because I have liked watching or reading all these recent spelling bee movies or books. I thought this would be something similar. Surprisingly enough this is nothing like a \"traditional\" spelling bee story. Although I had a hard time putting the book down I am pretty sure I didn't really like it. It was like reading a book about a family of compulsive, delusional, fanatics. Miriam--who had to pretend to be a lawyer yet live off her inheritance so she could steal things to put the world right and compulsively clean her kitchen, ignores her children and husband she didn't understand. Saul--a man who is caught up in his own world of jewish mysticism, a man who has spent his life tryting to find that mysticism first thru drugs and sex and finally thru Abulafia (hebrew letter mysticism) which he believe will come thru his daughter who he has pretty much ignored until she wins the spelling bee at school, a man who pays attention to his son and then completely forgets about him while working w/ his daughter on the spelling and indoctrinating her into Abulafia's work. Yet he refuses to see the similarities between what he is trying to teach his daughter and the choice of Hare Krishna religion that his son has chosen. A man who doesn't have the slightest idea what is going on with his wife and is so caught up in his own persuits that he fails to recongnize that his wife is mentally ill and that his son has switched religions.Aaron--a boy who has been seeking experiences with god since he saw a flashing red light from a plane reflected in the clouds, a boy who wants to grow up like his father but is usually ignored by him except for the study sessions he has with him which disappear when Eliza wins the spelling bee. He finally finds what he is looking for with Hare Khrisna, and spends his days chanting for hours and wanting to live in the temple to escape the real world.Eliza--a below average student who has a talent for spelling words. She is basically ignored by both parents until she wins the spelling bee where she is then in the good graces of her father. She latches onto the theory's of Abulafia and wants to communicate with God thru letters. She too spends hours and hours chanting and doing word permutations in order to get closer to god (not much different than Aarons chanting). I think she is the only one that may go back to some semblence of normalcy when she purposefully mispells a word in the first round of the next spelling bee.I liked these characters in the beginning of the book but after they spent the whole book spiralling down in their own versions of maddness, I just wasn't really interested in their story...maybe it was all just a little too unbelieveable that really none of these people was remotely normal in any way. I am still not sure I understand the point of the story or even the ending. I think the end was Eliza's way of trying to regain some sort of normalcy back in her life.I don't think I could recommend this book to my friends as something I liked but it was interesting."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131529-jenny", "userReview": "I am hearby stating that my new rating policy will be based on whether or not the book moved or uplifted me in any way. I really was excited about this novel because I'm a sucker for any young-girl-coming-of-age novel, but this one left me flat at the end. I couldn't stop reading, but the entire time I read I had this \"yuck\" feeling. This family is dysfunctional beyond words. The characters continually misunderstand each other. I was always waffling between sympathy and disgust with the father. And I felt like Eliza's transformation from mediocre to genuis was underdeveloped. I was truly sickened by Aaron's entire religious process, in that it was rooted in a mixture of lack of self-esteem and rebellion towards his father. The Jewish mysticism (which by the way was a bizarre new way of looking at the Jewish religion (especially after reading so much Chaim Potok) and again left a bad feeling in my stomach) is out-right frightening, though the author does a rip-snortin' good job describing it. And the ending left everything wide open.

While guising as a simple plot involving a girl's quest to win a spelling bee, this book explores topics all the way from mental illness to religious awakenings. The heart of the story, though, rests in a young girl's observations of and interactions with her family. An omnisceint narrator threads the plot together, as s/he explains the inner-most thoughts of each individual family member through short vinettes. This format works well for the plot and what the book seemingly is attempting to do, yet overall I think the narrative as a whole falls just short of revealing its own intended truth.The major downfall of the book is also its key strength: it is painfully honest. I often got a sense that sometimes the narrator was TOO omniscient, telling me things about the characters that I didn't want to know. I often felt embarrassed for them and ashamed of their thoughts. While this of course speaks to the strength of the author's perception in observing human behavior, I was left wondering WHY the author wanted us to know these things about her characters. Are we supposed to reflect on our own attitudes about our family members and ourselves? Should our knowledge of their thoughts conjure our sympathies or malice towards one/all of them? Or was it meant to be purely a writing exercise, in which the author attempted to explore her flexibility in writing different characters? Whatever the answer, I feel that I would have had a much more gratifying reading experience had I understood the point of being made to feel like an incestuous peeping tom. Narratively, I feel that the book does not quite complete what it started, although in all fairness, the height of ambition is quite admirable. Nor does it encourage the reader to \"complete\" the story on his or her own. This loose plot ending, combined with both the narrator's penetrating eye and sensitive subject matter (involving the conflation of religion, sexual acts, mental illness, and family jealousy), left me with an overall eeriness upon finishing the book. While sometimes the sense of being \"haunted\" by a book is a delight to the reader, I would not place this in the same category. Yet while I shudder when I recall this story, it is a shudder due to the emotionally piercing honesty of its voice, one that seeks to speak truth even at the cost of human humiliation. And for that, Bee Season wins both my merit and my cautious recommendation."}, {"userName": "jess", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/670054-jess", "userReview": "Bee Season exists at the baffling intersection of Spelling Bees, Jewish mysticism, Hare Krishna recruitment, and mental illness. Each family member has a sort of unconventional relationship with the others, although it's difficult to see how very strange things are until they start to fall apart. (Oh, Chinua Achebe, you go everywhere with me). The very average, younger sister becomes the favored child when Eliza suddenly displays her surprising aptitude for turning words into carefully placed letters recited aloud. This provides an opportunity for the fissures of the family to become giant gullies straight through the middle of a very normal family. Her older brother starts spending time with people who shave their heads, smell like incense, wear orange robes, and talk about the illusions of the material world. Her mother drifts further and further away from reality. Her father misses the whole unraveling, caught up in his enthusiasm for Eliza's potential & the going-on's of Transcendence. I was captivated by the fumbling, ineffective parenting. I mean, no one really \"knows\" how to \"be a good parent,\" but it is always remarkable how best intentions can go so awry. When your kid joins a cult, is it your shortcoming as a parent? I also loved the very honest way that Goldberg explored the ways that Saul transfers his own dreams/goals onto a kid's life experience. Aaron & Eliza resolve that pressure in very different ways. This provides insight into their convictions & spirit. In the post-book interview, Goldberg says that she only knew Eliza's character and the final scene of the book, and that the rest of the story unfolded itself to her as she wrote it. Dang! What a ride through the fiction lurking in the back of Myla's brain. I read this on the suggestion of Ariel Federow. She said, \"I liked it a lot. I don't want to blow the ending.\" As a person who *loved* A Prayer for Owen Meany in high school, this sort of review with a mysterious, spoil-able ending really intrigues me. I not only requested it from the library, but bumped it to the top of my \"to read\" queue, getting it on audiobook because that is the fastest way for me to get through a book. I commute, okay?

There really weren't many options, and none of the those I'd actually read before would be worth talking about.But Bee Season had a compelling enough concept that I chose it despite only so-so reviews here on GR. Because at least people had found enough to talk about. And my group did talk about it. We talked lots about how it failed.To be clear, we all agreed that it wasn't a bad book, just a badly-executed one. There's something almost dishonest in the construction and manipulation of the characters, and the twist at the end failed for everyone, because of lack of setup and in the character type as portrayed. Goldberg clearly had something to say: likely about the pressure of academic success on children and father/daughter relationships. You could care about Eliza, and Saul was an interesting, but static, character study.The trip and fall near the end into the metaphysical wasn't really supported by the earlier plot, and again, the twist really only distracted from what the story had, up until then, been about. It's a build up of Eliza and her mother's story wasn't every really there, and didn't mean anything. And again, no one really changes in this book, though it seems intended as a character-driven work, the characters aren't enough to carry that description.If this one is already on your list for whatever reason, you may as well read it.

I couldn't get through this book fast enough and I couldn't resign myself to not finish it. Baiscally this book is about a disfunctional jewish family. Eliza, who is at first mentally challenged, soon becomes a spelling bee champ. Saul, her father, drops guitar lessons with his son to teach Eliza about Abulafia which is a sophisticated theory of language. He brother, Aaron, becomes disengaged and starts to explore his own identy outside the jewish faith. All the while, the mother, Miriam is completely disenchanted, leading a fairly large lie her whole life.While, the description may appear sound and interesting, the read was not. Too much time was spent on father and daughter studing Abulafia theory and too much time on Aaron looking outside the family. By the last 10 or so pages, Myla Goldberg, the author, neatly wraps it up with an explaination that is all together unbelievable and unacceptable."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany", "userReview": "Oh. My. God. To quote another literary work, this book is a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. Silly me, I went into this book thinking that it would be about a girl and spelling bees (despite the warnings that I now remember receiving)... but the book is so much more than that. I think a better description of the book is a family looking for/rethinking their spirituality: Aaron, the brother, who begins to question his Judaism; Miriam, the mother, who feels drawn to things for a mysterious reason, thinking that they will fill some hole she is only subconsciously aware of; Saul, the father, who drives his children to be faithful to their Judaism and who has trouble seeing and accepting the changes the family is going through; and Eliza, the speller, who uses her spelling talent to get closer to God. This book is so beautifully written... it flows and the language is so poetic and illustrative. I could not imagine seeing the movie, as I think it would ruin the magic of the book. The writing presented such PERFECT images in my head (like Miriam's \"kaleidoscope\" and Eliza's epiphany), seeing someone else's vision of it would absolutely kill it for me.I did often find myself, though, trying to figure out what age group this book was written for. The main character is in fifth grade for the majority of the book, but there are quite a few sex scenes and references to sex and drugs. Still, an absolutely amazing book that I think will stay with me and haunt me. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Angela Dean", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10341230-angela-dean", "userReview": "Words cannot describe how much i HATED this book. I will attempt it anyways. In fact, it doesn't even deserve one star. It started out just fine, a young girl who was never thought to be that smart discovers she has a talent for spelling and decides to enter the spelling bee. At this point, I thought \"Ok, so this is kind of cute I guess\". I was wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong. This book is messed up. The mother deserves to be in a mental facility, that dad is as vain as can be, and their teenage son is reckless in his own sense. There is not much more that could have been done to mess up this family. It's almost like Goldberg began writing and midway through thought, \"hmm...what can I do to make this seem like the worst family ever created?\" I mean, the family is so messed up that it doesn't even seem real. Goldberg attempts to paint a picture of a typical American household but fails miserably.Aside from the plot, the writing was horrible. When reading a book, I tend to analyze the characters. Upon analyzing these characters, I found nothing. To me, they were very one-dimensional. It seemed like they were simply photos of people, not actual people. I couldn't connect to any of them. Meanwhile, I was distracted by the terrible writing. It reads like thesaurus threw up on it. An 8th grader could have done better.

If spelling the knowledge and faith contained therein were a requirement for salvation, more than likely most of us would find ourselves cooling our heels in some form of remedial purgatory, seeking divine revelation in a book rather than in ourselves and our fellow sinners. Such is the downward path set before poor Eliza: she just wants to be loved by an attentive father; he wants to create a prodigy fed and nurtured on syllables instead of understanding. If cluelessness -- about what makes his own family members tick -- were a sin, he'd have his own special ring in Dante's Inferno, doomed to accumulate correct spellings that produce nothing but incoherence masquerading as scholarly virtue. His obtuseness strains credulity at times, but fortunately, the painfully believable struggles of Eliza and her brother make up for it.In this heartfelt exploration of family alienation and spiritual seeking, G. pits scholastic monasticism against communal knowledge and compassion, and if Goldberg stacks the deck against the former to an extent that would make Aquinas protest from his grave, she at least grants Pere Naumann the brains and heart to eventually figure out his mistake. Though this conflict threatens to lapse into a rigid rubric as the novel progresses, Goldberg is talented enough to develop complex characters that evoke our sympathies, partly through eye-raising but credible plot twists and partly through rich language. Like many talented first-time novelists, she tends to lay on that richness until it becomes more of a wearying distraction from the dream world of fiction than a means to enhancing it. But that seems like the kind of narrow-minded, technical criticism Mr Naumann would throw at his daughter's spelling errors.Is it a \"disturbing\" novel, as some have commented? Sure, if, like me, you're disturbed by a culture that can seem like a disorienting, if not destabalizing amalgam of theocracy and meritocracy, where success requires a near puritanical belief in self-reliance, and failure gives off a whiff of moral offense. But I would describe story as more compelling than disturbing. Overall, I'd rate this one 3 1/2 stars (rest of our local book club rated it one of best books we'd read in some time).

Not that it\u2019s so written so wonderfully that I\u2019m left speechless, not in the traditional sense. I am speechless, more than after anything I\u2019ve read before, but it is a experience completely different from any other time. If the author\u2019s intention is to \u201clull people into (a) sense of complacency and then hit them over the head\u201d, then I think I have to congratulate her on succeeding that so well.\u3000\u3000I guess anyone on reading the book\u2019s tittle would speculate it as a somewhat warm and loving little book, instead, it is about religions and gods and jews and about kaleidoscope and about experiences that only those characters in this book could ever truly understand. As for me, I don\u2019t think I can ever imagine anything like that. Miriam\u2019s morbid obsession of \u201cfixing the world\u201d, taking things she thinks that belongs to her to form her own kaleidoscope; Saul\u2019s devotion to Jewish religion and his children\u2019s own way of reaching to God; Aaron\u2019s experience with the god\u2019s revelation and his insistence of looking for and finding God and finally turning into a \u201cHare Krishna\u201d, to tell the truth, I still couldn\u2019t work out all these obscure terms. And Eliza, who is, in the beginning of the book, a sweet, if a little neglected little girl who has finally been discovered a talent and begins to shine, in the end becomes someone who has experienced such a terrifying feeling and sees God and becomes mature, and deliberately misspells a letter in the bee contest.\u3000\u3000I just don\u2019t get it. What is she trying to do? What if she loses the bee, how is she going to save her mother and her family? All those bizarre sensations, I just couldn\u2019t relate to. I can\u2019t deny that it is beautifully written, the language is flowery and the author does add to a magical touch to those descriptions, but they are too surrealistic, yet in the meantime too serious. I couldn\u2019t help but feeling confused as to the book\u2019s intention or even the book\u2019s real contents. Maybe I am just too ignorant, too oblivious to the larger context, about the religions and the letters of English, but I can\u2019t say I really like this book.

Meet the Naumann family: Saul, the father, is a stay-at-home dad and obsessive, self-taught Kabballist. Miriam, the mother, is a brilliant and massively energetic lawyer, but emotionally distant from her family and harboring a dark, potentially dangerous secret. Son Arron, at 16, expects to become a rabbi someday, but as nerdy outcast at school, he finds himself wanting something more (or at least different) from his spiritual life. Ten year old daughter Eliza appears to be the only mediocre intellect in the family\u2026until she wins the school spelling bee, and soon she\u2019s won the city and regional bees and is heading on to nationals. When Eliza\u2019s newly discovered talent changes her status at home and at school, the delicate equilibrium of her family is thrown out of order, and each of the Naumanns will suffer in his or her own way. A compelling story, interestingly flawed characters, and lovely writing. The only reason it didn\u2019t end up at 5 stars is that the last third or so of the novel, as both Eliza and Aaron become ever more wrapped up in their intellectual and spiritual quests, became a bit repetitive and slow for me. Probably it was an accurate reflection of the navel-gazing that typically accompanies such questing, but for me the book lost a bit of momentum towards the end.As an aside, I was surprised to see how many of the negative reviews of this book on Goodreads cite the fact that the story is depressing in places, and that the family is unhappy and Saul and Marion less-than-ideal parents. True enough, but if a messed up family = a bad book, there went a fair portion of the world\u2019s literature. Do people really think that novels are supposed to model good parenting and display only happy, well-adjusted children and families?

Saul, his wife Miriam, son Aaron and daughter Eliza are all people dissatisfied with their lives, who imagine that mystical experiences can fill the void. The closer each of them moves to their personal nirvana, the farther they move from each other, and from confronting the emptiness that propelled them on this path in the first place. I found it impossible to care about any of these characters or take much of an interest in their belated efforts to extricate themselves from the ruins of their dysfunctional family life.As a culture we are very comfortable sanctioning religious beliefs as a coping mechanism, while condemning secular delusions, alcohol, and controlled substances as a source of refuge from the harsh realities of a cruel world. It seems to me that people generally only succeed in abandoning one form of solace by replacing it with another. As I finished this book I was wondering if Saul, Aaron and Eliza would ultimately come to terms with reality, or would merely adopt a different coping mechanism.

Each of the story lines in the book was... interesting I guess. I didn't connect with them, but I was willing to go along with them. But none of the storylines felt quite right. Why were they there? What were they trying to convey? They didn't feel like they had the depth or soul to really become anything more.What's more, the conclusion of the book was unsatisfying. I imagined it was going to end where it did early on, but the book never really sold you on why it should be there.

But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness. In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment. When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family. The outcome of this tale is as startling and unconventional as her prose, which wields its metaphors sharply and rings with maturity.
