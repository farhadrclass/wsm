I really, really liked watching \"The Muppet Show\" and \"Sesame Street\". They were two of my favorite shows, and I still hold both in high regard. However, every now and then and completely out of nowhere, a Muppet would do something that genuinely terrified me. For example, I really hated that old \"Sesame\" sketch when a couple of mild-mannered puppets would calmly take turns whispering words that rhymed to a gently jazzy beat, and then this orange hairy guy would barrel up to the screen, and, without regard for rhythm or personal space, bellow an unwieldy sentence containing all the words the less-horrific Muppets had so charmingly whispered earlier. That SCARED me. Badly. I was scared of beards, yelling, and any pictures or toys depicting someone or something with a gaping mouth. Thus, I had serious issues with \"Monster at the End of this Book\". I was always very ill at ease with Grover, anyway. He caused terrible problems for everyone he encountered, and almost never showed remorse. Also, he couldn't seem to communicate without shouting and gesticulating wildly. I had real problems with the way he carried himself, so I knew going into the book that I probably wasn't going to like it much. What I didn't expect was to be profoundly affected, to the point of tears and sleepless nights, by a drawing of Grover, his furry mouth so wide with terror that his head resembled a blubbering halved blue grapefruit, positively out of control with horror and dread concerning the MONSTER that was about to destroy him, to destroy us all, because he'd spoken to me, personally, directly, about the effects the very book I held in my hands would have on the both of us in the immediate future. I never appreciated or even detected the pleasingly ironic denouement of this, the most devious Little Golden Book of them all, until 4th or 5th grade, when I finally dared to finish the thing. In my preschool days, as far as I was concerned, they may as well have entitled the book \"Grover Undergoes a Harrowing Mental Breakdown, and Will Implore You to Help Him Throughout (You Cannot)\".

In the story, Grover begs the reader to stop turning pages because each page brings us closer to a monster at the end of the book, and Grover is afraid of monsters. He tries to nail the pages shut, he tries to tie the pages down, he even builds a brick wall. But somehow the reader always turns the page. My mother used to read this book to me, and she was great at doing funny voices. I remember laughing so hard as she acted out Grover becoming more and more hysterical about the monster at the end of the book. (Children's Spoiler Alert: There is a monster, but he is a friendly one.)Somewhere on a flash drive I have a video of my mom reading this story. A few years ago, I showed her the book and asked if I could record her reading it. She performed it perfectly, and it was a beautiful scene.I have so many happy memories of my mother reading to me before bedtime. I am grateful for this book and for those memories. My sweet, brilliant mother. It is tragic that her brain has now been so damaged by cancer that she has trouble speaking and reading, but cancer can't rob me of those times.Like Grover, I wish I could nail down some boards or build a brick wall to try and stop what is inevitable. I just hope there will be some friends there to help me through the scary parts.

Oh joy.'Well, suck it up and deal.A-hem\u2026 While rifling through the book section at my local Goodwill; I came across this little gem. Copyright 1980, Little Golden Books\u00ae edition complete with all our favorite characters outlining the back cover\u2026 The Tawny Scrawny Lion, Tootle, The Poky Little Puppy\u2026 that famous gold-foil binding (seriously, it says so\u2026 right on the back!) A little girl even signed her name! Natalia (you just know she had one of those stage moms cramming her Airabesques down her throat before a Nutcracker performance... you can just see it...)Anyway\u2026 I grabbed this treasure and let out a little yip of delight. God, I LOVED this book! And what a cool edition! So, I paid my 99 cents and skittered on home to *share* with my kids. Bonding! Instant Memories! Up your a**, Norman Rockwell!Clearly, my children have been brainwashed by sponges named Bob and Hedgehogs wearing gloves and little pokey-things. But, I didn\u2019t give up\u2026 I found the correct remote(s), shut down all things electronic, sat them down in a semi circle at my feet---and with a relish unbeknownst to even myself--- read them this mutha-f**king classic!\u201cSo? Huh? Whaddya think? Huh? Well?\u2019Emily (15): What\u2019s wrong with you? Marley (11): That was weird. Isabel (9): I LOVED it! It was AWESOME!Satchel (5): Can I play the Wii now?Disenchantment. Exasperation. Fail.I reread the book again. I could taste the trust...the anticipation as we defy Grover and turn the page, the tickling blue fur and purple spongy nose that I fell in love with... I could feel it all. Then I read it again. Okay, why is this so endearing to me? I scanned my memory banks\u2026 did Mom or Dad read this to me? Hell no.. they never read to me\u2026 Was it a beloved teacher? My very own Montambo? Gah\u2026 no\u2026. where the hell did I first read this? Was it when I was older and thought it would make me cool to revisit my youthful Sesame Street Days? Could be\u2026 sounds a bit clich\u00e9 for me, but okay\u2026 Then I read it again\u2026. This book is freaking mental. I mean throughout the whole book you\u2019re being told that you shouldn\u2019t turn the page because there\u2019s a freaking monster at the end of it. Why do you keep turning the damn page? Is it the font? Is it the colorful print? Is it all the attempts that Grover makes to NOT make you turn the page? Rope and wood and bricks and nails and\u2026 Why didn\u2019t this book scare the hell out of me? I\u2019m a nervous Nellie by nature. Why didn\u2019t I throw this book in the basement with the crickets and the Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass albums? Okay, I get it\u2026 it\u2019s supposed to teach kids to not judge and to not be afraid and to take a chance. Okay\u2026 but after a lifetime of disappointments and negative illuminations\u2026 this book leads to an anxiety attack.

Today, there are hundreds of books, films and television shows which address man's incapacity to negotiate his own darkness. In many variations of the tale, we see the darkness within projected outward, cast onto another real or imagined character. Stephen King's Secret Window, even the latest season of Dexter reacquaints us with this age-old phenomenon, but never have they explored it with the depth and finesse author Jon Stone did in the chilling The Monster at the End of this Book.\tThe tale begins with the seemingly lovable Grover, whose ambivalence has yet to be revealed. He fears the monster, an entity which he believes he shares no association with. His dissociation from his own darkness becomes apparent to the reader on the first page when Grover Monster ironically proclaims, \"I am so scared of monsters\" (Stone).\tOn subsequent pages, Grover's fear grows. But what does he truly fear? Does he fear the monster at the end of the book, or the fact that, upon reaching the end of the book, we will see him for who he truly is? If we align ourselves with the latter of these two possibilities, then the futility of his attempt to hinder our progress is augmented by the fact that even the casual observer can see Grover for what he truly is: a monster. On the other hand, if we believe Grover genuinely fears the monster at the end of the book, the text becomes a testament to identities which have become so fragmented that an individual interprets different facets of the self as separate individuals. The various mechanisms Grover constructs throughout the book follow in the vein of the former of these two possibilities, for it is the industrial era which catalyzed such fragmentation initially, and it is Grover's attempt to reconstruct the industrial mechanism, and his inability to adapt to the requirements of industry, which allow us to finish the text.\tOver the next few pages, Grover treats the text as a serial killer might treat its victim, binding the book with rope, smothering the book with brick, and building a shack--likely in some remote location--in which he can hide the book away from the public eye. But all of his attempts to slow our progress prove only testament to his inability to adapt to the requirements of the harsh society whose growth is grounded in industry. Even the infantile readers can wretch victory from Grover's grasp simply by turning the pages. By turning the pages we leave him no choice but to identify himself with the only thing he can inherently identify himself as: the monster.\tGrover's attempts to stop the reader from moving forward are reminiscent of the behaviors we all exhibit when trying to hide our darkest impulses. We try to box ourselves off from others, or \"put up a wall.\" These very counterintuitive impulses are often what give us away. It is the hiding that reveals us.\tWhile this text could be said to be a grim portrayal of our own fears and impulses, it ends on a positive note. Grover learns to embrace the monster within, and realizes that it is a benign force once refutation of its existence comes to an end, showing us that we all must accept the darkness within, for repression can only result in physiological complications and self-inflicted damage that far outweighs what we might perceive our inner demons to be capable of. The final message left to readers is best encapsulated by Grover's closing statement, \"I told you and told you there was nothing to be afraid of.\" (Stone)."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "A favorite in my household! :)"}, {"userName": "Chris ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956959-chris", "userReview": "I bought this for my grandbaby, in the interest of getting him away from electronics and into real books.We read it 4 times in the first sitting.

How can he lose? We expect a twist ending. Surely, he cannot fail.

I'd forgotten all about it, but when I was a little kid this was one of my favourite books. When our twins came, and even when they started to like classic Sesame Street (they've still never seen an episode with Elmo and Zoe, or anything post 1979 ... what a proud Papa I am!), this book never crossed my mind. But when I saw the lone copy sitting up on that shelf, I snatched it and headed for the cashier.As soon as I was in my car, I had the book out and I read it out loud, as Grover, to myself. I love this book because Scoutie loves to hear me read it to her, and who doesn't love to have their babe waddle up with her favourite book in hand before climbing awkwardly onto your lap and saying \"wead!\"?I love this book because it reminds me that I was once a little we babe crawling up onto my Mom's lap so she could read it to me.I love this book because Grover is, for me, the most magical Sesame Street Muppet.But mostly I love this book because I love this book.
