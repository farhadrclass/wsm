I love how she can write such a genuine story that draws me in each time. I didn't think she could top the Wife Lottery Series, but I have to say I will probably have to eat my words. There is only one Carter McKoy for me, but Travis, now he certainly earns a place on my hero shelf. I enjoyed the complexity to Rainey's character. She wasn't unrealistically goody-goody or innocent. She made some decisions that weren't always highly ethical or selfless, although she is definitely a person of both strong morals and generosity. She led Travis a merry chase, however I can see why. I loved that Travis understood Rainey's issues and gave her what she needed to feel safe as a wife. While I was shouting, \"Marry him already!\", I could also understand why she was afraid/reluctant to do so. I think that even to this day, women do have to think long and hard about who they choose to marry, and moreso back in this time period where women had little rights or independence in a world that seemed to be wired for men. I like the way Ms. Thomas deals with these issues, not in a preachy way, but very matter of fact. She writes about several women who are in different situations, but all have to operate in a world that is dominated and controlled by men. With Rainey, the reader is able to examine that dynamic of a woman juggling the love of a man with a need for her own independence and control over her life, and I was able to empathize with and respect Rainey and root for her to gain both things in her life. Equally complex was Travis. He's that tough, capable western hero that I love to bits, but he also has vulnerabilities, not in the least as a man of mixed heritage, with an Apache heritage that is written on his features in a society where Indians are the enemy and hated and feared equally. Also, he faces a life-changing injury, which requires him to look seriously at what his identity is as a person. Will he be happy and productive if he can no longer work as a Ranger? What's left for him if that is gone? I liked that Travis fell hard for Rainey and he had to deal with his sense of awkwardness in how to pursue her and romance her as a man who never thought he'd marry and start a family. Would he be happy with a friendship with his 'fairy woman' or would he be satisfied with nothing less than her as his wife? He couldn't have been more appealing to me.I also liked how Ms. Thomas handled the issue of slavery. When I saw that this was set in 1854, I sighed. I really, really hate dealing with the slavery issue in historical romances. I'm black, so when I read these books, I think about how it must have been for black people to be slaves in this part of American history, and when I think about this, it makes it harder to enjoy the romance part of the book. In this case, Ms. Thomas managed to keep my conscience happy with those aspects of the book, and was able to keep that from detracting from the story, and it was realistic how she dealt with Mamie's situation.Can I say how much I adored little Duck? What a sweet little boy. I just wanted to hug him. And Travis was such a good adoptive father to the orphaned, traumatized little boy. Nothing more sigh-worthy to this reader than a tough hero who is good with kids! Travis' relationship with Duck brought another layer of fantastic to this book, which was already pretty darn fantastic to begin with.What can I say? Jodi Thomas has it when it comes to writing romance. She doesn't rely on a lot of bells and whistles. She brings simple to an art form. She just has what's needed: intriguing, lovable, relatable characters, an interesting storyline, great dialogue, and excellent western world-building and action that makes this Western-lover a happy camper.I can't give this book less than five stars. That just wouldn't be right! Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "In the end, I just did not care ... it dragged and dragged and just fizzled out!

So when I finally managed to laid my hand on this book, which is the beginning of the McMurrays saga, I really feel like a completion of the puzzle pieces of the glimpses here and there about Travis and Rainey (and Tobin's) stories that were told throughout the series. It was like finally I was told the real stories behind the legends. And, Jodi Thomas really did not dissappoint me. This was a great beginning for a great series. Entertaining and full of adventures that will make us excited to continue reading until the end. The story was about the second brother, Travis, which some people claimed as the wildest of the lot. He was the only one from the four siblings who favors the looks of their mother's people, the Apaches. And because of that, people always snubbing him until he took care of that and people learned to respect him for himself. Being a Texas Ranger really suited him until he was shot during a raid. Then, he became lost because he felt that there won't be anything he can do anymore and he might be a burden to his family. The story was about how he finally found his other calling after accepting the fact that he can't be a Ranger anymore. It was also about how he chased after the only woman ever who captured his attention and claiming his heart. And it was also about how Duck became his son (so tragic, I cannot even imagine how he felt at the time).Initially, I thought the climax would be a scene with Rainey's father since she really worked up to run and hide from him. From the way he was potrayed, I thought he would searched for Rainey to the very end and punished her. But, it seems that the father (which for me played an important part for Rainey' s decisions and actions) had been left off just like that, without a closure. And that is the one thing that makes me feel like the story was incomplete."}, {"userName": "Aoi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8479578-aoi", "userReview": "I enjoyed my first outing with Jodi Thomas..even though nothing much happened.

I enjoyed it but it was lacking some umph! The story is about Travis McMurray, a Ranger, who has taken a month leave to return home to his family. Once home, his baby sister drags him to a town dance so that she can finally find a man. While there he bumps into Rainey Adams who kisses him and runs off with his horse. Rainey is running from her father up North because he wants her to marry an older man. Watching how her mother was stripped of her freedom because she was married to Rainey's father, caused Rainey to hate the idea of being tied down to anyone. So she sets out to disguise herself as a boy. While he is out looking for her and his horse the following day he is injured. Rainey goes back to the McMurray's ranch after witnessing this and having Travis brother drag her back with them. The whole family believes she is a boy which works out for her. When he awakens he sees her and the attraction begins...Rainey run away again but this time she can't get Travis off her mind and she decides to write him letters. So while he is healing, he corresponds back and forth with her. Rainey begins to miss the man and he set out to find her while he is on a trip with his sister and a young boy(you have to read it to find out about the boy). Once they meet again, the emotions are flying all over the place and danger is not far behind. I liked the connection between the two characters. Was it steamy? IMO it was not but it definitely had romance. I loved the scene when Rainey is feeling insecure and asks Travis to be the man in those letters and say what he means. So he writes in the dirt he loves her over and over. When she question why he is repeatedly doing that, he tells her until she believes it. I don't know but he won me over at that point in the book."}, {"userName": "Missy Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3625257-missy-jane", "userReview": "I accidentally read the next three books in this series before finding this one, but that didn't detract from my reading experience. I LOVED this series, and I'm not big on westerns...until now. I really don't know that this is a \"western\" per se, but this series takes place in Texas in the 1800s. The McMurray family lives on a ranch called Whispering Mountain left to them by their parents. The three brothers and sister were orphaned as children and the oldest took over at the age of twelve. In Texas Rain, the middle brother, Travis, takes a break from his life as a Texas Ranger to return to Whispering Mountain. In a chance meeting he encounters Rainey Adams, who has no wish to mingle with a law man. They both leave an impression on the other that just won't die and eventually kills their resistance to each other.This was such a great book!

I think of reading this book as having been given all the ingredients for a wonderful dish only for my dish to be lackluster and less than exceptional. That's not to say that Jodi Thomas doesn't write well; she absolutely does! I just was not in any way invested in the characters or their HEA. Several aspects of the story, in theory, pulled me in: the spunky heroine that manages to pull one over on the hero; establishing a friendship via mail first; an independent heroine determined to make it on her own; revenge on the hero and his family. But, again, it fell flat. While the heroine initially came off as strong and independent, towards the end of the book I was not her biggest fan. At first, she was forthright and spoke her mind but once she could actually partake in a relationship with the hero, she started to come off as flaky and unsure. She could not make up her mind! She repeatedly told the hero she just wanted to \"be friends\" and yet she is forlorn when he stops kissing her and touching her. Um, idk about you but I do not make out with and feel up on my male friends...that's just not how I am. It became to annoying that I was starting to hope the hero would just forget about her, just leave her alone to give her enough time to make up her mind! Frustrating to say the least. Also, the story seemed to drag on with very little occurring between the more active parts of the story. And, then when you FINALLY get some kidnapping and killing and rescuing, it occurs in less than 5 pages!!! I was glad not to have the kidnapping prolonged, but the shortness of the separation just made me wonder why the author even bothered to include the kindnapping in the story. It didn't really add much other than provide an opportunity for our MCs to cuddle and grope. I've really enjoyed other Jodi Thomas stories, so I will not be letting this one dissuade me from continuing with this author.

It's really easy reads, there's drama and some small plot twists in there, but it keeps you interested throughout the whole book.It's your typical romance book with the girl and the guy and the happily ever after, but if you are in the mood for a feel good book, I always recommend her.It's innocent (sort of), sweet, and funny.Her characters have just enough depth to make them interesting, and it keeps you wanting to carry on reading.Her books are so easy to read, I read one of them in a day. I love it, I would not read it over and over again, since once is definitely enough for me, but it does cheer you up when you need it.Just on a side note, if you are a feminist, or you don't like the damsel in distress idea, then dont pick this book up. It does play on the traditional idea of man and woman, but I do like that about this book. The romance is also sometimes a little over the top (it's unrealistic), but what romance book isn't?I also like the fact that Jodi manages to write stories in series, where the women in the books are completely different in character, but they are also still likable. The same goes for the men.Also, even though the men has to (most of the time) act to protect the girls (yes, feminists, sorry for the spoiler), the women are still tough, and they are hardy and witty and I love that. So they are not these weak minded sheep.

He was met by his sister, Sage, and roped into taking her to the town's annual barn dance. While there, Travis literally backed into a girl who called herself Molly and was wearing a red wig. The girl, he found out much later, was named Elisabeth Rainey Adams, She had run away from her father who wanted her to marry a fisherman twice her age whom she didn't love. Her father ran a boarding school for girls and had taught Rainey to be afraid of everything, even going outside. Her father never thought she would leave. She worked at the school but her father never paid her and he beat her mother.Rainey ran away from him at the dance but Travis kept looking for her and noticed when she slipped outside. He followed her to where the horses were tied. As she un-tied them, he tied them back up. Travis followed her thinking she was preparing to steal a horse. He had seen it done before where someone scattered un-tied horses in order to steal one. It would take awhile for anyone to notice that one was missing. Since that wasn't going to work, she stole a horse from one of the wagons at the dance. The one she chose to take just happened to be one of Travis' matched set of bays.Travis set out in the morning to find Rainey and the horse. He thought that she might have left with a wagon train heading north. Travis caught up with the wagons and she wasn't there. He traveled with the wagons for awhile and they were attacked. His brothers, Teagen and Tobin, had found out that the wagon train was going to be attacked and went to help. Rainey wasn't with the wagon train because she had over-slept and the horse had run off. Teagen found the horse and had stopped at the trading post. Rainey went to the post dressed as a boy to see what was going on. Teagen asked her to take the horse back to Whispering Mountain Ranch while he went to help Travis. She did and stayed until they arrived back home with Travis, who had been shot. Rainey took another horse and ran off again to find work in Austin.Travis's wounded leg was shot in a place where it caused him a lot of pain and was slow in healing. His brothers carried him up to the summit of Whispering Mountain to see if he would dream of what his future would be. He dreamed of being surrounded by a bunch of books and a gun in a Bible.Rainey sold the horse she took and used the money to buy some new clothes. The lady at the store who sold her the clothes told Rainey that she could clean up and change into the dress in her house in back of the store. Rainey told Pearl all about her travels and why she was on her own. She told Pearl that she was looking for a job. Rainey spent a couple of days looking for work with no luck. Pearl came to see her and said that Rainey could use her kitchen to bake pies if she would watch her son. Pearl could spend more time at the store and her husband could make more money delivering items. Pearl also suggested she write to Travis to find out if he was alive. Rainey and Travis started writing to each other. Travis was spending a lot of time reading law books and trying to figure out what to do with his life now that he could no long ride a horse. His days of being a Texas Ranger were over.Teagen arrived home one day with a boy in a cage. The boy had been kept by the band of bandits that had attacked the wagon train. Travis let him out and the boy jumped out and clung to Travis. The family called him Duck because he arrived during a rain storm followed Travis everywhere.Travis and Rainey wrote back and forth to each other until Rainey wrote about two barmaids who wanted to kill their boss. Travis then decided to find Rainey. Sage, Duck and Travis all went to Austin where Travis using the excuse of taking his bar exam to become a lawyer. He found Rainey and she panicked when he asked her to marry him. She wanted to prove that she could live on her own because she was told for so long by her father that she couldn't. She wasn't ready to commit herself to a marriage like her parents had. Her parents were the only example she had and she wanted no part being owned by a man. Travis met up with some of the Rangers while in Austin and became friends with a lone Ranger named Mike Saddler. He lost a bet with Mike and had to buy him breakfast one morning. Sage and Duck went with him and there was an instant attraction between Mike and Sage. Travis found out that a group of outlaw brothers, one of whom he killed, were expected to come after him in Austin. The arrived and attempted to kidnap Sage. Sage had come to the boarding house where Rainey lived for a dress fitting. Three dressmaker sisters and a widow lady lived in the same boarding house. Rainey and the widow overheard the kidnapping plan but couldn't get downstairs in time to stop it. Rainey put on Sage's cape so they took her instead. The widow shot another of the brothers. Travis went after the two that took Rainey and found her after she had stabbed and killed another of the brothers. When Travis came back to town with Rainey, she went back to the boarding house and found one of the barmaids dead and someone was in the house and shot and killed the landlady. Sage and Mike went back to Whispering Mountain, making sure they weren't followed. Rainey and the widow went back to the restaurant the widow had owned with her now dead husband. They cleaned it up and Rainey used it to bake her pies that day with the Rangers watching over her for the last of the brothers to try and get to her. The last of the brothers was caught trying to come in through the cellar. The next day, Rainey found out that Travis had won the place in a poker game from the widow and gave it to Rainey for her pie baking. The slave of the landlady, Mamie, returned to town as a free and married woman and agreed to work with Rainey. That evening, Travis went to be sworn in and the father of the brothers was there and pulled a gun on Travis. Travis had told Duck to hide if anyone pulled a gun on him. Duck hid at the ceremony, telling Travis that someone had a gun. Travis remembered his dream and saw a Bible that the bailff had. He grabbed the gun out of it just like in his dream and shot and killed the father. Rainey came and kissed Travis and the judge told them that if they continued to act like that in public he would have to marry them. He swore Travis in as a judge and married Travis and Rainey."}, {"userName": "Garth Mailman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19664628-garth-mailman", "userReview": "First in a series titled Whispering Mountain. Texas, shortly after the Alamo 1854. A mother dying from childbirth not that uncommon at the time, a father dying with his comrades leaving brothersTeagan 11, Travis 10 and Tobin 6 with a baby sister, Sage to raise and a ranch to defend until the oldest could claim it. Add in their housekeeper Martha.As the book begins Sage has turned 18 and is looking for a male suitor at the yearly local barn dance and brother Travis has returned on leave from the Texas Rangers and walked into the task of squiring her, the other brothers having done a disappearing act. Whatever Sage\u2019s prospects Travis backs into an arresting red-haired, green-eyed Irish beauty named Rainy Adams he just might need to arrest for horse thievery. And so the romance is set and future outings in the making. What happens when a outdoorsy man of action gets injured and cannot sit a horse? In 1854 orthopedic surgery did not exist and for some surviving injury was a living death. As the pair finally get together the tonsil hockey begins but before the mating dance can complete we are treated to some action-adventure and thrills. Sage even finds her ranger.Alas, the book didn\u2019t get the editorial attention it should have resulting in spelling and grammatical errors."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10983379-chris", "userReview": "THIS SUMMARY/REVIEW WAS COPIED FROM OTHER SOURCES AND IS USED ONLY AS A REMINDER OF WHAT THE BOOK WAS ABOUT FOR MY PERSONAL INTEREST. ANY PERSONAL NOTATIONS ARE FOR MY RECOLLECTION ONLYPersonal note:I had a hard time getting thru this one. Maybe to Western for me. However, the ending was great. Will try the next oneAt first giving this one a 2 ...Rainey Adams is on the run. She's trying to get away from her father and his uncaring nature. His only interest is his bottom dollar and keeping his daughter under control. In a show of bravery that she doesn't have (or perhaps it was mostly desperation) Rainey runs out west. Out west she can become a new person and she won't have to worry about her past or her father's plans. Her greatest fear is that her father will come after her and drag her back to Washington DC.Travis McMurray was forced to be a man very early in life. Their father prepared them well but their mother couldn't survive without her husband. She joined him shortly after giving birth to his fourth child. He and his two brothers were forced to hold their land until the oldest turned eighteen and could claim it as his own. Travis helped his brothers keep the farm running but his mother's Apache blood demanded a life of roaming and living in the wilderness. Travis became a Texas ranger as soon as he could.Travis comes back to the farm for a long needed break. He hasn't seen his family in two years. His sister Sage finds him and hammers him immediately about taking her to the town dance. She's not getting any younger and she needs to find herself a man. She can't miss the only social dance of the year and her other brothers won't take her. Travis hates to socialize but he hates Sage being needlessly unhappy even more. Travis dances with a woman that night who will change his life forever. She clearly has no interest in the social events of the evening and that gets Travis' Ranger attention right away. He saves a horse from being stolen but it costs him one of his own.With the horse theft begins a novel of pursuit. Rainey doesn't want to (and repeats annoyingly often) lose her freedom. Marriage is nothing more than the submission to and relinquishing of all things good to a man. No good can come of marriage. Travis on the other hand has never thought of himself as the marrying kind. Then he meets Rainey and that theory goes out the door. The thought of Rainey with another man drives him mad. He'll do anything to prove to Rainey that they are meant to be together.My Thoughts:While Texas Rain is a good read it wasn't breathtakingly wonderful. Texas Rain is one of those books meant for a non-taxing, relaxing read. It doesn't make you feel like you can't put it down and walk away for a bit. That does not equate it to a bad book. It was a nice relaxing read through the historical west. Travis is a man of few words and while his intentions are sweet and in the right place he can come off as lukewarm in the relationship. Rainey on the other hand, got on my nerves at times. She had a troubled past but not anything that can't be risen above. She was controlled most of her live and not loved. She was made to feel plain and never fit in. Rainey was quiet and often didn't do things out of fear. Then in the west she becomes this outspoken \"it's my way or no way\" kind of woman. I'm glad she got past her issues but for as deep seated as these issues were she sure made a fast recovery. She's also an educated woman and taught in her father's school. For an educated woman she was pretty quick to lump all men in the same category as her father. It annoyed me that she assumed all men, including our hero, would want marriage only to have someone on a string.The rest of the book was very good. Travis is part of a well knit family due to tragedy earlier in life. They own a successful ranch that is turning a profit. The story had some suspenseful moments and there was just the right amount of secondary characters and involvement. It gave a good feel of the small town of Austin that was just beginning to grow. I cared about all of the secondary characters and I can't wait to read Travis' siblings' stories as well. The ending was probably the best part of the book. Rather than try and talk sense into Rainey, Travis decided to show his love to win her over. What did he do? I guess you'll just have to read the book to find out*****I enjoyed it but it was lacking some umph! The story is about Travis McMurray, a Ranger, who has taken a month leave to return home to his family. Once home, his baby sister drags him to a town dance so that she can finally find a man. While there he bumps into Rainey Adams who kisses him and runs off with his horse. Rainey is running from her father up North because he wants her to marry an older man. Watching how her mother was stripped of her freedom because she was married to Rainey's father, caused Rainey to hate the idea of being tied down to anyone. So she sets out to disguise herself as a boy. While he is out looking for her and his horse the following day he is injured. Rainey goes back to the McMurray's ranch after witnessing this and having Travis brother drag her back with them. The whole family believes she is a boy which works out for her. When he awakens he sees her and the attraction begins...Rainey run away again but this time she can't get Travis off her mind and she decides to write him letters. So while he is healing, he corresponds back and forth with her. Rainey begins to miss the man and he set out to find her while he is on a trip with his sister and a young boy(you have to read it to find out about the boy). Once they meet again, the emotions are flying all over the place and danger is not far behind. I liked the connection between the two characters. Was it steamy? IMO it was not but it definitely had romance. I loved the scene when Rainey is feeling insecure and asks Travis to be the man in those letters and say what he means. So he writes in the dirt he loves her over and over. When she question why he is repeatedly doing that, he tells her until she believes it. I don't know but he won me over at that point in the book."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71897533-heather", "userReview": "Great storyThis was a suspensful and exciting romance novel.

It's the story of Travis Rainey Adams, runaway schoolteacher from the east coast, who chose freedom over marriage, and ran away from her controlling, overbearing father. Travis McMurray, is half-Irish, half-Apache, and is a Texas Ranger, for whom the law is his heart. Until he meets Rainey at a country dance, where she steals a kiss from him...and then, his horse. The second time they meet, she steals another horse, and his heart, because Travis has been injured. In the shadows and at the peak of Whispering Mountain, Travis dreams of Rainey, his fairy, and his future, which is uncertain in his hands. Rainey rides to Austin where she makes some friends, and starts a pie business. But Travis' heart lingers in her hands. Travis finds his calling in studying law, since it's the closest thing to a Ranger (a Ranger on the plains: a lawyer in the courthouse). The novel shifts from Whispering Mountain ranch to Austin, where Rainey has escaped to. Travis finds her, taking along his sister, Sage (cool character), and Duck, a silent 3-year old who clings to Travis like a son. Will Rainey hold onto her freedom? Will Travis take her heart? Will they find safety? Will Travis choose being a lawyer over a Ranger? I, of course, know the answers, but you, my dear readers, do not (unless you've read the book), and I don't want to ruin it. I must say that I liked the allusion of Rainey as a fairy and I liked the characters, but it was exhausting reading about them kissing and being romantic, pulling away, chasing each other, so o and so on. I think I'm going to read the sequel, Texas Princess. There was one part I loved: She smiled as she pressed her palm over the beating. \"I feel the center of you. I feel your heart.\" \"No,\" he whispered as he kissed her ear. \"You are my heart.\" And I loved the part after it, where he is writing I love you, in dust, until Rainey believes it, he says."}, {"userName": "heather \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3924484-heather", "userReview": "Started out good, and I enjoyed the story itself for the most part, but Rainey ended up annoying the shit out of me. I know she had good reasons for her reservations about marriage and all that, but she never even opened up to him, not really. And then suddenly, after swearin up and down the whole book how she'd never get married, never be able to love a man, etc, she's suddenly in love and getting married within a few pages. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Travis's character, and she'd be a fool not to love him. But I don't buy how he went from clueless to knowing EXACTLY what she needed to be able to marry him with barely even a HINT from her. It'd have been more convincing if they'd at least have talked about things, and then he went about going the things to make her feel safe and secure in her ability to exist on her own if she had to. She basically caused him no end of grief and never once even felt bad about it.
