Her father worked as a Sandhog with men that built the underground train tunnels, and her mother worked in a garment factory. Both jobs ruined her parents' health and their lives. Vera grew up, and when she was seventeen, she thought meeting Angelo at their appointed time was going to be it. He was going to ask her to marry him, right? Unfortunately, that didn't happen. He introduced Vera to his fiancee.The good news, though, was that Pearl was a Suffragette, and she wanted Vera to help her. Being able to help Pearl would allow her to be close to Angelo. It was very difficult, though. Her heart ached every time Angelo smiled at her, but then Vera found out something that changed everything.THE WAY OF BEAUTY is a beautiful book about love, family, Suffragettes, the building of Penn Station in New York and has characters you will fall in love with. Vera was my favorite simply because of her innocence, goodness, perseverance with dealing with the trials she had to deal with as a woman at this time in both her personal life and public life.Ms. Di Maio has written another amazing, warm, heartfelt, well-researched, detailed book, that takes you with the characters on their journey and into their lives.All of Ms. Di Maio\u2019s books warm your heart and allow you to feel her passion about causes and the human race. THE WAY OF BEAUTY is a MUST read. You won't be able to experience all the emotions that are inside unless you read it.As for the title, it has the perfect word in it...BEAUTY. The book is a beautiful tribute to mankind, love, caring, and living a good life. 5/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by NetGalley and the author in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "I have never read a book by Camille Di Maio before and when I seen the beautiful cover of this book I just knew that I had to read this one! I am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beauty of a book! The story is just as beautiful as that cover! THE WAY OF BEAUTY by CAMILLE DI MAIO was a fantastic, informative, interesting, and heartfelt historical fiction novel that pulled me in immediately. I absolutely love the title of this book and it was extremely fitting to this story. The way that the title came into play within this story was absolutely beautiful and will stay with me for a very long time! I will let you experience that feeling for yourself as it really explained a lot to me and brought the whole story together for me! CAMILLE DI MAIO delivers a well-paced and beautifully written story here with interesting, compelling, likeable and believable characters that I absolutely fell in love with. This multi-generational story was told in two perspectives with the first half from Vera and the last half from Alice\u2019s perspective, Vera\u2019s daughter. I enjoyed both perspectives equally.In the end I thought this was such a touching and wonderful story which was vividly descriptive and I really loved following along the lives of these two women and reading about the women\u2019s suffrage movement! Would recommend!Thank you so much to NetGalley, Lake Union Publishing and Camille Di Maio for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of this book in exchange for a review."}, {"userName": "Reading.Between.Wines", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-reading-between-wines", "userReview": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f / 5Words really cannot express just how much I loved The Way of Beauty by Camille Di Maio. This is a heartfelt historical fiction novel that really pulls at the heartstrings.The Way of Beauty mainly tells the story of Vera and her daughter Alice, but also other people that are connected with their lives. There are quite a few main characters, but not in a confusing way (and we only see things from Vera and Alice's POVs). The book is set in New York City during the women's suffrage movement, and is spread across the years 1900 to 1963. We start with Vera's story in 1900 and end with Alice's story. There is a lot of history about Penn Station in this book which I found very interesting. I love reading books set in NYC, and I really didn't know much about Penn Station until I read this novel. And of course, it also talks about the women's suffrage movement. The whole time I was reading the book all I could think of was Mary Poppins and \"Votes for women!\" The author says she did embellish a bit in regards to things the women in the book did as part of the suffrage movement, but it was fascinating and very enlightening all the same.Final Thought: In total honesty I ugly cried a couple times during The Way of Beauty. It is such a touching book and I felt so connected to the characters that I didn't want it to end. Apparently there are almost 400 pages to this book, but I was able to read it in about a day it was that good. I highly recommend to lovers of historical fiction and people who love novels set in New York. I can't believe this is the first novel I've read from Camille Di Maio and I cannot WAIT to read more!The Way of Beauty in 3-ish words: Heart-Warming, Spellbinding, & Unexpected"}, {"userName": "Lindsay - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54886546-lindsay---traveling-sister", "userReview": "4+ stars!

The Way of Beauty was such a gorgeous book in every single way, it was so amazing that I\u2019m going to be reading DiMaio\u2019s other books ASAP.The first half is set in the 1900\u2019s and told from Vera\u2019s perspective beginning when she\u2019s just five years old and it follows her up until her early twenties. Much of her story revolves around the suffrage movement and while I had a basic grasp of what went on, this book definitely taught me more and it was fascinating. These women were warriors in lipstick, such strong and inspiring people, it was fantastic to read about this movement in detail. The second half follows Vera\u2019s daughter, Alice beginning in the 1940\u2019s so you still get to check in with Vera which was cool. I absolutely adored both of these women and DiMaio created such beautiful and heartbreaking stories for both of them. They were both incredibly well drawn, I felt like I knew both of their hopes, dreams and fears and I wanted what was best for them in the end.The setting of NYC was so vividly imagined, I\u2019m telling you guys DiMaio is an amazingly detailed writer and the style was part romantic, a dreamy type of wonder and part crisp, cool containment, it worked so well for me. There is some epic romance as well, swoon worthy stuff, but not the cheesy type, the kind that makes you sigh in contentment.

When she is in her teens, she falls in love with the young man who runs the newsstand but he marries a suffragette who later becomes Vera's friend. When Vera realizes that Angelo is also in love with her, she disappears from his life. One generation later, her daughter Alice has a dilemma because she is in love with two men.

I loved everything about Camille Di Maio\u2019s novel. From the descriptive historical perspectives of the culture, people, landscape and architecture to the colorful cast of characters through three generations, and the significant political statements of the times, the author has woven several stories and themes into an amazing , captivating, intriguing and enjoyable novel.I loved the generational stories of families, hope and love. The contrast between the have and have-nots and the disparity of the rich and poor are mentioned. I loved the romantic descriptions of people as time goes on.I appreciate the Woman\u2019s fight for the right to vote, and the consequences and heartache at that time. Also mentioned is War, and disabilities and hardships. There are also devastating conditions in factories and work.I am impressed at the way Camille Di Maio uses the comparison of historical buildings, and beauty to the emotions, sentiment, memory and history of people who lived during that time. The symbolism of the decorative architecture that reminds people of first love, and the ups and downs and the various stages in life.As modern time brings more conveniences, the buildings, the train stations, that men sweated to build seem to be pushed aside to make way for the new. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful for the past to merge and have a renewal with the modern world?I am left thinking of so many things that are brought up in this novel.

With The Way of Beauty, she is now three for three with compelling and memorable novels.The entire story was so beautifully written. I felt like I was inside Penn Station watching the characters interact. I could easily visualize them and feel what they were feeling. Both Vera and Alice's romantic conflicts were understandable and it was easy to sympathize with them. (I know many women who would gladly step into Alice's shoes.) Vera's situation was more complex, but definitely an emotional burden.The Way of Beauty reminded me of the Sunfire romance novels I read during middle school, but on an adult level. I loved these books, so it is a good thing that Camille could re-create the feeling of reading them. There was even a story about the women's suffrage movement! (Laura). I felt like I was getting a history lesson without even realizing it. The only concern I had was that the ending felt rushed, as time was sped up in the last chapter or so. However, that's only because I wanted the story to go on even longer, so I could spend more time with the characters!I was recommending this novel when I was only halfway through, and now that I'm done, I recommend it even more!

The novel traces two women, Vera and her daughter Alice. It begins in the 1900 with young Vera, whose father is a \"sandhog,\" one of the workers who helps build the tunnels leading to Penn Station. As Vera ages, she pines for the man who runs the newsstand at the train station, but he sees her as just a kid. Their story plays out in the shadow of Penn Station, as does Vera's daughter's story. In the midst of World War II, Alice finds herself torn between two men, one of whom has a dangerous secret.

Vera Keller is the daughter of one of those immigrant families and grows up watching her parents try to make ends meet by digging train tunnels and working long hours in poorly manned factories. When her mother dies she meets Angelo, an older boy working at his father\u2019s newsstand, whom she becomes best friends with. It is not until Angelo becomes engaged to a woman named Pearl that Vera realizes her true feelings for Angelo. Pearl is the exact opposite of Angelo and Vera. She is the daughter of a wealthy clothing manufacturer and has never wanted for anything. Despite having everything money can by, Pearl is not jaded by her wealth and actively participates in the Suffrage Movement. Pearl\u2019s passion for this work takes her away from Angelo and her young son from a previous marriage. As Vera plays nanny to this child, she finds herself growing closer to Angelo and the life she\u2019s always wanted is within her grasp. Vera\u2019s life and the decisions she makes through the years have played a huge role in the future of her daughter, Alice. Despite being a generation apart and growing up in vastly different versions of New York, these two women have much more in common than they could ever know. Alice is every ounce as passionate about life as her mother was at the same age and she soon finds herself in a battle of the heart as well. Will Vera and Alice make decisions that bring them joy or will they suffer immense heartache along the way?Driven by passion and love the coming of age stories of Vera and Alice unravel on the pages of THE WAY OF BEAUTY through elegant prose and vivid descriptions that truly transport the reader to New York through the years. Part one of the novel focuses on Vera and the events of her life that have brought her to be a mother to Alice. In part two we continue to see glimpses of Vera\u2019s life, but the story shifts to focus on Alice at the same age as her mother in part one. Initially when the book flipped over to part two I was heartbroken to be away from Vera after growing so attached to her in the first half of the novel, but once Alice\u2019s story started to build steam, I was over the moon with the direction of the book. Alice is every bit as determined as Vera and while love is the dominating overtone to the book, the reader is gifted with the unique ways love can impact a person through the split in focus. A few years ago I was an avid reader of historical fiction, but fell off the bandwagon somewhere along the way. Camille Di Maio\u2019s THE WAY OF BEAUTY reminded me of all the reasons I love historical fiction. The ease of her writing had me swept away to New York and walking beside Vera and Alice through their lives. THE WAY OF BEAUTY is truly a magic book that I would recommend to die-hard historical fiction fans and newbies alike.

The Way of Beauty is a literary journey through a minefield of love, heartache, social justice (and injustice), poverty, choices, patience, secrets, and family. This story comes in two parts: Vera and then her daughter, Alice. Even though the end of Part 1 is sudden and startling, it works. You blink, and it\u2019s twenty years later. Sometimes real life is like that too.Camille Di Maio is an amazing writer. She can spin a tale so real and so rich that you feel you know the people, the places, and the events, and you feel as if you are right there living it too. The beautifully descriptive prose brings New York City, especially Penn Station, to life, and your senses are filled with all those sights, sounds, and aromas that comprise the bustling city. The historical aspects are weaved masterfully throughout the story, eliciting the need to research those events and places even more.What I love most about The Way of Beauty is that it covers several difficult topics: the stark class line between the wealthy and the poor, the heart-wrenching line between the healthy and those who suffer both physical and mental infirmities and challenges, the tireless suffragettes battling for justice and the right to vote, and the melting pot of immigrants who helped build and shape this country in the early 20th Century (often at the expense of their youth and good health). Amidst these historical aspects lies a wonderfully written story about two women (mother and daughter) who live and love passionately and selflessly, both shaped by their families, their hardships, and their choices.Prepare to be charmed by this breathtaking tale and to marvel at the lyrical writing and well-crafted plot that satisfyingly ends where it begins. The Way of Beauty is a lovely story that you won\u2019t soon forget because \u201cOur wrinkles tell our story, etched out like a road map. That\u2019s the way of beauty. Birth, middle age, decline.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5246393-diane", "userReview": "The Way of Beauty by author Camille Di Maio is another heart touching book filled with emotion and generational history. The characters of Vera and her family, Angelo and Pearl, and later, Alice and William will lead the reader into the secret longings of their hearts and lives. It is important to understand the eras of time and the daily struggles of poor families in the US during times of war and social transition. The book is also about friendships and loyalty to those we love, even when it means putting our own personal dreams aside for the good of others who we care about. The story blends the youthful dreams of future possibilities with the disappointments of their current day. I won't post spoilers, but Vera has a very hard life growing up and is greatly relieved to find work as soon as she is old enough in order to help her family. After her mother dies, she is the main caregiver for her father who has severe health problems which are the result of his work in the tunnels of Penn Station. The one person Vera felt was her closest friend marries a rich young suffragette. Soon Vera is working in their home and refusing to allow her feelings for Angelo to cause problems for him and Pearl or to affect her admiration of Pear and her dedication to make rights for women a possibility.The way of beauty is a way of living in honesty and with love and respect between mothers and daughters. Thank you to NetGalley and the Publisher for allowing me to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "A.J.

Meticulously researched, The Way of Beauty is a fascinating homage to history, reminding us that nobody exists in a vacuum. Everything about our lives comes from the past and leans toward the future. We must remember those who fought and suffered for what we take for granted today \u2013 our ability to easily travel by rail, car or plane, for example. \u201cSandhogs\u201d built the railway tunnels deep under rivers and suffered from the bends for their entire lives. Suffragettes fought for women\u2019s right to vote and were often jailed and force-fed through painful nasal tubes. In the early 1900s, factory workers labored so hard and for such long hours, they sometimes collapsed and died of exhaustion. Intertwined with fascinating and sobering historical facts, the personal stories of the novel\u2019s vibrant characters kept me enthralled. The Way of Beauty is an immersive, enlightening story of love, loss, hope and renewal.
