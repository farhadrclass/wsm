However I had to know what happened so I fast-forwarded to the last 5%. If Katie had acknowledged the police sooner I might have changed my mind about her. The mystery was solid, the business rebuilding was really interesting, and the side characters were really good. Katie however was not likable at all to me with her judgement, condescending attitude, and \"know it allness\" (in this book). I am going to chalk it up to her life getting turned upside down. I will try Book 2 because of how this ended. It gives me hope that she is more likable in Book 2.Audio Thoughts: Narrated By Jorjeana Marie / Length: 8 hrs and 44 mins I really loved Jorjeana's narration but she sounded like she had a cold while recording. It was a little distracting. I went to listen to other snippet's of her narration and she is really good. So I think it probably was a cold and not a nasally problem. I will definitely listen to her again!Part of my Read It, Rate It, File It, DONE!

Like there is no way the case could be solved unless they butted in. I will reserve judgement till the end but right now the cop is grouchy and according to the main character not doing much.48%: #Listening Narrator definitely had a cold(or something)---I went to listen to other samples of her narration and she is excellent. This really isn't bad but I can hear stuffy!\"52%: #Listening I am having a real problem with the leading lady: her judgement of others (the cops, other shop owners, ect) is really getting on my nerves62%: #Listening she is growing on me a little bit now but still a wee bit judgmental.67%: #Listening Katie just went off on the cop and felt like she could do his job better. BIG PET PEEVE! She is a suspect exactly why does she think the cop should share all his information with her. I am really back to disliking Katie again.

I truly mean this as a dedicated and addicted mystery reader.\"A Crafty Killing\" by Lorraine Bartlett, sounds like it would be a cute light mystery with a touch of romance. The title is solid but the book is just so much more. Now, I can't figure out what I'd title it but let's consider some of it's elements.The book has a competent business manager who inherits an on-going business concern in the red, which just happens to be an artist co-operative. She inherits due to a murder and is thrown into the case due to the robbery/theft? of her new office. Her name is Katie Bonner and she is no fluffy maiden. The book has elements of grand theft, petty theft, art forgery, murder, and jealousies abound. Yes, there is a gentle romance but it does have surprises as well. This book is for persons who enjoy good, solid, valid, murders. The location is ideal and makes me interested in New York. When is a cozy not a cozy? When the book is a cozy plus more...it's \"A Crafty Killing.\""}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43755056-amy", "userReview": "I liked this book very much.

I have read one book from the author's Booktown series, and didn't care for the lead characters at all. Katie Bonner, MC for this series, is fairly likable, although she spends a lot of time jumping to incorrect conclusion then trying to make up for them in the book. Also, she has that flaw exhibited by many cozy heroines of thinking she's smarter than the police investigating the crime, and that drives me nuts. Several of the other characters are much more appealing, especially Rose, whom I could adopt as a grandmother quite readily. The concept of the story is a good one, and the action moves along pretty well. I found the ending to be a little convoluted, but all-in-all, it was a pretty good read."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca", "userReview": "Recently widowed Katie Bonner knew her husband had invested in Artisan's Alley, but didn't expect, when the owner was found murdered, that she would inherit half his estate and have to take over managing the nearly bankrupt institution. As she struggles to cope with the building, the vendors/artists, the other merchants in Victoria Square, and the detective who seems disinterested in investigating, Katie wonders if she will be able to save Artisan's Alley--and who might want to stop her.Another one I picked up because it's hard to find cozy mystery audiobooks. The reader on this one is good, but I found the story and characters fairly blah. I had expected it would have a lot of information about arts and crafts, which do interest me, but this is really for people who like books about how to run a business, which doesn't interest me. The mystery was pushed to the side a lot of the time in favor of business and legal information (boring! at least to me), and I also felt the author included a lot of unnecessary extraneous detail, like all the steps Katie took in getting into her car and preparing to drive and then exiting the parking lot--nothing like that should be in a book unless it serves a definite purpose. If she was preparing to get in her car and it burst into flames, or if she tried to put on her seatbelt and found a snake instead, or if a parade float barrelled down the road and exploded in a sea of fireworks and confetti just as she was turning out of the parking lot, then yes, describe! If not, yawn. I didn't really like the characters, either, and there wasn't much pleasure or happiness in the book to balance the depression.

Overall not a bad book, but not highly memorable, either.I loved most of the characters. Katie came off as arrogant in some parts of the book, but by the end she was likeable, and I especially loved Rose, I thought she was really funny, and she reminded me of my grandmother.The setting itself gave this book an extra star, I love stores like this and I loved how Katie became manager of a place like this.The mystery was semi-good, I guessed who the killer was a bit before the reveal, but it was pieced together nicely.Overall an enjoyable, quick read, that won't make it to my favorites shelf, but that can be blamed on it being the first book in this series.

First, all the characters were variations of people I know; very believable characters made the story more intriguing. Second, the mystery was truly a murder mystery from the very first lines of the book. Third, there were LOTS of possible suspects (including the protagonist), and plenty of red herrings. Fourth, the book had several surprises, not necessarily in relation to the murder, though in retrospect perhaps I should have paid more attention to some of them. And finally, when the perpetrator was finally discovered it was someone who had been right under my nose the entire book, but was not ever on my list of suspects.

She and her husband Chad had separated because of money issues. They had been starting to get closer again as they were dealing with this problem when he was killed in a car accident as he was driving home from work as a teacher on a snowy afternoon. Things go even more out of kilter when their good friend, Ezra Hilton, is found murdered at Artisans Alley, a art collective in their town that he manages.Ezra was definitely more of a friend to Chad, but Katie had stayed in touch with him after Chad's death. Even with this, Katie is really surprised to learn that Ezra chose her to not only be executrix of his will, but to also inherit half of his estate, along with a nephew who lived up in northern New York state.This means that Katie is now the impromptu manager of the Artisan Alley. Not only does she feel like she is up to this task, she is also already working full-time as an assistant for a local insurance agency. With that said, she has no choice, at least until she can get the Artisan Alley out of the red. She finds herself being drawn into the community of Victoria Square, which is the center of town that is dedicated to a group of small business that exemplify a feeling of Victoriana in their small coastal town. The Artisan Alley is at the core of this community, and it is definitely struggling.As she starts to try and get things in order, she is drawn into the center of the investigation of Ezra's death. This is largely because the local sheriff seems distracted and unable to fulfill the responsibility. the problem is that the more she learns, the more she seems to be drawn into danger to herself and others ... and it is particularly difficult to find out who is a friend or foe as she talks to the business owners of Victoria Square.I picked this book up because I have become a huge fan of another series written by the author, though under a different name: Lorna Barrett's Booktown mysteries. This series has a lot of things in common with that cozy mystery series, and I will definitely be reading more books in the series. It is a little slow because this particular book is not only focused on the mystery itself, but is also working on establishing all of the characters and the broader series that will continue in future volumes. It is definitely worth digging through, though, as the mystery is quite strong, and Katie and the other characters are both interesting and fun. I am definitely looking forward to reading more books in the series."}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "FIRST IN A BRAND NEW SERIES!A VICTORIA SQUARE MYSTERYA Berkley Prime Crime MysteryA Division of Penguin PublishingRelease Date: February 1, 2011ISBN-10: 0425239853ISBN-13: 978-0425239858Artisans Alley is the cornerstone of Victoria Square. It is an old applesauce warehouse renovated into a collection of booths for artists and craft dealers to sell their wares. Because her husband emptied their savings account to become a partner in this business Kate Bonner's dream of buying a huge Victorian House down the street and turning it into a Bed & Breakfast are put on hold.Then her husband dies in a freak car accident and she becomes the business parter of Ezra Hilton. She keeps her job at an insurance company and lets Ezra run the Alley. Hopefully she can recoup her investment and still open her B&B.This plan goes awry when Ezra Hilton is found dead at the bottom of a staircase at the Artisan's Alley. It's ruled a homicide by blunt force trauma and a bloody mess. This means Kate has no choice but to manage the Alley and she learns that the place is in serious financial trouble. Can she turn the place around and make it profitable? Was the financial status of the business enough to drive someone to murder? Does that mean she is working side by side with the killer? Why is it taking so long for the police to solve this crime. These are all the questions that push Kate into doing a little investigating of her own. Adding the question is she putting herself in danger? Of course she is, it's a cozy mystery.I LOVED IT!!!!! I rarely say I LOVE the first book in a series because I feel you have to get to know the characters and the setting and usually the debut story just really breaks the ice and starts to get you involved in the characters and their lives with a good mystery thrown in. That being said this author is a master storyteller and she pulled me in and wouldn't let go. Everything you want in a cozy mystery is found in this story in the perfect amounts. The plot is genuine and authentic. The characters are real and believable. The setting is delightful. Victorian Square is a place you will want to visit again and again.

Up until that time, Kate had a 10% financial interest in the business, but virtually no personal interest in its success or failure. While her husband was still alive, Kate had hopes of purchasing an old Victorian Home, just steps from Artisan's Alley, and turning it into a Bed & Breakfast. Those hopes were dashed when her now deceased husband put all of their life savings into Artisan's Alley. After Ezra dies, his lawyer informs Kate that Ezra had recently changed his will, making her the largest stakeholder in the company, and he also made her executor of the will, effectively cutting out his nephew, Gerald Hilton from having a voice in the future of the business.Kate ends up quitting her dead-end job with an overbearing insurance broker she had worked for over the past six years to run Artisan's Alley. Whether she is doing it for Chad's legacy, or because she sees a future in the business, Kate is committed to saving it from financial ruin. As she starts to get to know the other tenants and business owners, her commitment to Artisan's Alley grows, and she knows that even though her dreams of owning a B&B have been dashed, this is her opportunity to make a fresh start. However, there are plenty of people who want to stand in her way, and as Kate starts to dig in to try to uncover what may have happened to Ezra, she discovers that several of the people she has grown close to, may have had a motive to kill him. Soon Kate has another death on her hands, and she must find the killer before it is too late.A Crafty Killing is an intricate mystery with a cast of quirky characters, including a Colombo-esque detective, a group of highly-competitive (and even catty) middle-aged women, and a few who have long-held secrets to be revealed throughout the course of the book.

Katie Bonner has inherited a 10% ownership in Artisan Alley when her husband had died in an automobile accident. As she is on her way to work she notices police cars in front of Artisan Alley and stop be and learns that the owner, Ezra Hilton, has been found dead, evidently murdered. Katie soon learns that she will executor of Hilton\u2019s estate and will be majority owner in it. The other 45% will belong to Ezra\u2019s nephew.

Soon there is a break in to Katie\u2019s office and one of the artisans is found dead. Katie doesn\u2019t feel the police are looking hard enough to find the killer.

While I find I like a lot of these books - I don't get excited about them or love them. They are all so similar. They are easy reads for sure and I think that is one reason I keep reading them. They are great stress reducers - you can get into them and get away for awhile but not have to think hard. The heroine is very likable and a strong woman. Always a plus in my opinion. Katie Bonner is trying to save Artisan's Alley, which her late husband was a partner in and invested their small nest egg, much to her dismay and the ruin of their marriage. Now, the other partner has died and Katie steps in, not only to save the business but find out what happened - maybe even to her husband as well? Was his death an accident, as she thought? I guess Katie's meddling seems more like good business sense in this book, more than others. After all, she has to learn more about the business she was not a part of or involved in before.
