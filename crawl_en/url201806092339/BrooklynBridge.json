Running alongside this is a story of a child living a homeless life beneath the iconic Brooklyn Bridge that shapes the city skyline to this very day. How these two stories overlap really makes for something memorable and truly amazing, and the book also sheds light on other themes such as immigration, rebellion and a strange sense of longing for freedom and individuality. This is a great story about growing up and understanding life and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. :)"}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "Karen Hesse is back, baby! A person only gets so many golden opportunities in their life, you know. There are only so many times you get a chance to say that someone\u2019s back. Someone who may have taken a small vacation from writing for a while. Karen Hesse is a good example of this. She\u2019s done some picture books and short stories but her last novel,  Aleutian Sparrow came out in 2003. Now she\u2019s returned to the field in force and with a full-length no-verse-in-sight middle grade novel on her hands. I mean Hesse was always the queen of verse. Her  Out of the Dust won itself a Newbery, and I cherish in a soft place in my heart  The Music of Dolphins. I guess you could say it was my favorite Hesse book . . . until now. Brooklyn Bridge takes a fancy to the summer of 1903. A time of bears, Coney Island, hot nights, and sharp delicious pickles. To hear fourteen-year-old Joseph Michtom tell it, everything was fine before the bears. Yeah, his family wasn\u2019t rich or anything. His dad ran a candy store and they were like everyone else in their neighborhood. They made do. Then President Roosevelt had to go and NOT shoot a bear and everything went wrong. His Dad got this crazy idea about making stuffed bears out of cloth instead of wood or metal and suddenly everyone and his brother wanted one! Now Joseph\u2019s dad never has time to do little things like take his kids to Coney Island, and with all the family drama Joseph\u2019s feeling a little shut out. Paired alongside Joseph\u2019s thoughts are stories of a group of street kids that live underneath the Brooklyn Bridge at night. Haunted, both literally and figuratively, by a past tied unknowingly to Joseph's, their story highlights the boy's newfound status.The book has a large cast of characters, all of them single-minded and interesting. All three of Joseph\u2019s aunts act and react off of one another in ways that have become almost rote over the years. Pay close attention to when Hesse chooses to switch between their nicknames (\u201cThe Queen\u201d, \u201cAunt Beast\u201d, and \u201cAunt Mouse\u201d) and their real names. That\u2019s a lesson in narrative power right there. As for other family members, Joseph\u2019s younger sister Emily is the wise one in the family, a fact that both she and Joseph recognize without animosity on either end. Really, that was one of the best parts of the book. The sheer levels of affection between different family members. Even when they\u2019re fed up or frustrated with one another, you can feel a deep and abiding love there. The family of the Michtoms is also mirrored in the rag tag family of stray kids under the bridge. There\u2019s loyalty in both groups, though one seems like a pale knockoff of the other.As for the writing itself, Hesse using the two narratives (Joseph\u2019s vs. the kids under the bridge) to try things out. Joseph\u2019s story is straightforward with little poetic asides but nothing overly lyrical. The bridge kids get all the pretty words, maybe to make up for their crummy little lives. A boy who feels affection for a girl simply called The Bride is described as, \u201cclose to no one until The Bride came, the white-necked bride, who no longer wore her hair pinned up in the fashion of a lady, but down, in one thick braid, like a farm girl from Nebraska, like the mother he\u2019d never known.\u201d Or about a small girl who, for reasons unknown, once drank poison. \u201cShe just cried. Silent tears rolling down her cheeks, her eyes two green bruises in a dusky face.\u201d Simpler still, just the use of an adjective at the right point makes all the difference in the world when closing out a chapter. \u201c... and the sun rose, evicting the sharp-shouldered children from under the bridge for one more day.\u201dI say that the novel is prose rather than verse, but that isn\u2019t to say that Hesse\u2019s poetic sensibilities have taken a back seat. No sir! Not she. The novel splits into two separate narratives. On the one hand you have Joseph, his life, and his worries. And on the other hand you have the children that live under the Brooklyn Bridge and their stories. Now, when you compare Joseph\u2019s woes (woes = how his parents are too busy to take him to Coney Island) to the woes of the kids under the bridge (woes = drinking acid, sleeping with corpses, stealing, madness, and worse), you\u2019d be naturally inclined to think that Joseph was going to come across as a pretty whiny kid. He thinks HE has problems? Has he ever heard of Mattie, a boy who knew about \u201ceating things no one should eat\u201d? Hesse, however, is exceedingly clever. First of all, for a lot of kids reading this book, they\u2019re going to sympathize with Joseph. Having parents so consumed by their professional lives that they fail to spend enough time for their family? Not exactly a non-existent problem today. Fact of the matter, I\u2019d say that most kids that read this book would identify more closely with Joseph than someone like Mattie. But by pairing his frustrations alongside those of the homeless street kids, Hesse is able to keep returning to the notion of being lucky. The very first sentence in this book is, \u201cThe guys say I\u2019m lucky.\u201d For immigrants coming to America for the first time, you needed luck. The kids under the bridge don\u2019t have it and Joseph does, and on some level he\u2019s aware of this even if he isn\u2019t aware of the specific existence of the kids themselves. At one point in the tale Joseph\u2019s little brother gives a small girl his bear. Once he does so he\u2019s amazed by the amount of freedom he has. And then Joseph thinks to himself, \u201cWhat bear had I been carrying . . . And what would it take for me to let it go?\u201d Even the lucky ones amongst us have bears. It\u2019s the letting go that\u2019s difficult. Spoiler alert, by the way. I was also amazed that Joseph never ran across the kids under the bridge. There\u2019s one moment where he passes Guy on the street, but it\u2019s a throwaway moment for him. He barely registers the kid\u2019s existence. And yet, his own story, the one that waits until the end of the book to be told, is tied very closely to the story of the bridge kids. This, if anything, was the weak point of the book. The sudden reveal at the end that the ghost under the bridge is Joseph's cousin? It felt like it came out of left field. If Joseph had been feeling guilty about this role in the boy's death, shouldn't that have been alluded to in ways that are less oblique than the ones found here? It\u2019s an older book than Hesse\u2019s others. There are references to nasty things done by Cossacks to young girls, and children beaten until they almost die. It\u2019s never explicit and never described in any depth, but there's enough to cause me to suggest that maybe this book would be more appropriate for the older set. The 12 and up crowd, perhaps. This is perhaps one of Hesse\u2019s most accomplished novels. It\u2019s historical fiction that uses the past as a point of reference rather than as the point of the novel. Hesse is weaving together so many seemingly disparate elements and living breathing characters that the end result feels more like a film, a theatrical production, or a scene on a city street than a book for kids. I use the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d when describing works of fiction because it\u2019s a difficult term to justify. But this book is beautiful. Beautiful and weird and real in a way that will touch you. If five-year absences yield books as fine as this, I urge every writer to take an extended vacation pronto.

This story is actually based on the real, Russian immigrant family, that invented the \"Teddy Bear.\" It is set in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn New York. New York was a thriving, crowded city filled with recent immigrants. Joseph Mitchtom is 14 in the summer of 1903. His family ownes and operates a candy shop, until a story in the news paper about Teddy Roosevelt refusing to kill an injured and restrained bear on a hunting trip, inspires his parents to create and sell the first \"Teddy Bears.\" This story also has a darker side to it. In between the chapters about Joseph's family are short passages telling of the children who are homeless, some orphans, others the victims of abuse, who live under the Brooklyn Bridge. There is even a ghost who haunts the bridge and predicts the disappearance of children who live there. It is not a pretty picture. Theses children are literally \"throw-aways.\" The ones no one wants or cares about. They struggle every single day just to survive. Reading this story makes one wonder how caring people could have turned their backs on helpless children. But then, things like that don't happen now days...or do they? I would recommend this books for older elementary aged students or middle schoolers. It might be a little frightening for younger children or those who are more sensitive to \"scary\" stuff."}, {"userName": "Jodotha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283372-jodotha", "userReview": "This was not an easy book. I'm not talking reading level, but in terms of impact. It was in turns emotionally jarring, spooky, and I wouldn't actually read this to a kid because there were some serious, even scary, situations detailed (made harder to read because they were happening to kids). There were also lighter moments, but they didn't quite balance out the difficult ones.That said, this is one of those books you read and you don't soon forget, for all of those reasons. It was in turn a coming of age story, and a ghost story. A story about the kids who made it, and the ones who didn't, or just barely survived. It was well written, and I listened to it in one night. The narration was superb, with a fantastic Brooklyn accent used for the protagonist, and wonderful voices all around.This is a truly unique book, and if you are interested in this era, and/or like coming of age stories, and you want a kick to the heart, then this will deliver."}, {"userName": "Tasha", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929521-tasha", "userReview": "Joseph feels trapped in his Brooklyn apartment surrounded by the Teddy Bears that his family invented a few months ago. The bears have taken over their lives, their space and their toy store. Now Joseph spends his days stuffing bears, packaging them, and being responsible for his younger brother and sister. And all he longs to do is go to Coney Island, the symbol of all that is fun and all that is not his current life. But life isn't that simple, as he quickly finds out as he faces falling in love, a death in the family, and much more during the summer he's fourteen years old.Hesse has created a novel filled with characters that are so well written they come to life. Even the more extreme characters in the family ring true and have hidden complexities to them which are a treat to discover. Joseph himself is a true teen with a certain focus on himself rather than his family. It is when he faces hardship that his true character shines through. Hesse's voice as a writer is equally strong here with attention to period detail that make the setting as much a part of the story as the characters. Never intrusive, her voice is a guiding light bringing the period to life for children who may have no knowledge of it. Hesse has also blended humor, tragedy and a real family into this story. One never knows quite where the book is heading because of her skillful writing, elevating what could have been a simple quiet story into something with dramatic tension that is hard to put down.Highly recommended as great historical fiction that is very well-written and conceived, this book is appropriate for 10-13 year olds.

I am really impressed by Brooklyn Bridge. The setting of turn-of-the-century Brooklyn is vividly brought to life in the reader's imagination through 14-year old Joseph's first-person narration, excerpts describing Coney Island from actual newspapers from that time, and a parallel story of street children living under the Brooklyn Bridge that contrasts with Joseph's comfortable life with a large, loving family. The arc of the plot's action builds in layers with a final climax that I really did not see coming although in hindsight the foreshadowing and clues were there. Rich characterizations and subplots that initially seem unrelated to the main story are all expertly woven together by Hesse by the book's end, which I was sorry to reach.But...kid appeal?

Hesse introduces this immigrant tale with a quote by Isaac Newton:\u201d We build too many walls and not enough bridges\u201d. This quote could be considered \u201ca spoiler\u201d if one could interpret its relevance prior to reading the story. However, readers must finish the book in order to see what Ms. Hesse means by using this quotation symbolically in relation to the actual Brooklyn Bridge and humanity, especially in the special era she wrote about.In the early 1900s, the family of fourteen-year-old Joseph Michtom has come from Russia to settle in America where the streets are made of gold. His is the typical lively and colorful family who has come to live the immigrant life of 1903 Brooklyn. Joseph who has a pretty good life for a kid in those days, filled with stick ball, a good home, family and lots of friends, is blessed but his dream centers on going to the new and thrilling amusement park known as Coney Island. However, Coney Island must wait. The Michtom family, in Joseph\u2019s mind, is doing fine with their candy store when suddenly his Dad gets an idea that instead of making toy bears out of metal or wood, they should be made of cloth. Before you can say \u2018teddy bear\u2019, the idea takes off and the family is swamped with the demand for these bears. Joseph\u2019s family time is now devoted to this new \u201cinvention\u201d and there is no time for Coney Island much less his \u201cregular\u201d boyhood life of friends and frivolity.Interspersed between the chapters that tell of Joseph and his family and friends comes the haunting story of the kids who live under the bridge. Karen Hesse writes of these somewhat mystical children in a different, almost poetic way. Theirs is a life of suffering and misery which includes their individual stories of horror, starvation, pain, and even death. The central character under the bridge is one known as the Radiant Boy who glides in like a phantom spirit and frightens the children as they know that when he comes and takes someone with him, the child never comes back. How these children relate to Joseph\u2019s story is almost like a parallel universe in that Joseph doesn\u2019t seem to even meet any of these kids or acknowledge their existence for the most part. Their connection to Joseph, however, is one that is subtly alluded to throughout the story but it isn\u2019t until the end that the reader will see the significance of this story within the main story.What is the connection between the kids under the bridge and Joseph? As for Coney Island, does Joseph ever get there? As you read this remarkable work by Karen Hesse, the answers to these and many more questions just may satisfyingly and incredibly be revealed. I recommend this as a perfect book for children 11 and older, as well as for adults who want to learn more about a time when our ancestors migrated to this country and settled in that magical place in New York known as Brooklyn. For those of us who know the area, the allure and magnificence of Coney Island and the wonderful Brooklyn Bridge will never cease to exist but rather be enhanced and remembered by reading Karen Hesse\u2019s novel, Brooklyn Bridge. Chris Sheban did the wonderful cover art and adds to this amazing book with his interior illustrations as well.Submitted by Karen Haney, August, 2008"}, {"userName": "Hayden Neis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58994788-hayden-neis", "userReview": "I love this book better than most of the historical fiction books I have read.

His family owns and operates a candy shop, until a story in the news paper about Teddy Roosevelt refusing to kill an injured and restrained bear on a hunting trip, inspires his parents to create and sell the first \"Teddy Bears.\" The sub-plot of this book didn't really make sense until the end, and some characters under the bridge weren't even mentioned until the end of the book. This book was very well written and was steady as in the plot staying together throughout the whole entire book. I will definitely give this book a 5/5 stars. My favorite genre of books is historical fiction, and I love to learn the history of Presidents. So when I saw this book and read the inside cover, I fell in love.The reverse thought of not wanting wealth or fame certainly caught my attention as if is was part of the Mitchtom household, I would take advantage of it in some ways. I like how the author ties in the time period on how Coney Island was one of the most popular destinations in the country a the time and how he had a hankering to go. If it hadn't been for the awful sub-plot, this would have been an easy 5 out of 5 book in my eyes. This book pictures the business of a family hard at work each day, working and working and not stopping. This book is definitely unique as far as the Russian family who invented the \"Teddy Bear\". Some downsides of this book were some characters were hard to track and pin down it the subplot, one such example is the character Frances. She wasn't mention until the very end of the book. And when she was introduced, I had a hard time tracking the sub plot after that. Another fault is that the nick names used for some of the characters were used to often and sometimes confusing, especially the 3 three aunts confusing nicknames. Here is a list of the names:Aunt Mouse A.K.A Aunt LenaAunt Beast A.K.A Aunt ZeldaTante Golda A.K.A Golda a/k/a \"The Queen\"Lizzie Kaplan A.K.A real estate agent A.K.A Uncle Meyer's new brideIn conclusion, this book is very well written, displayed in my mind wonderfully.

I thought it was going to be about the apparently epic task of constructing the bridge, as in the McCullough history, The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge, that I want to read.Instead, it is about her fictional version of what life was like for the Russian immigrant family that invented the Teddy Bear, as narrated by a 15-yr-old son. This is all very interesting with funny and sad things about their immediate family and extended family, all escaped from persecution in Russia, as well as their poor immigrant community. However, it's the type of thing more adults will like than teenagers.The other thread is the tragic stories of the homeless children living in a semi-community underneath the Brooklyn Bridge. There are more than a dozen anecdotes, with these telling a separate story that eventually ties back into the main Russian immigrant family's story. These are very sad and sometimes hard to read for me even without being graphic at all. There's also another supernatural element like in Witness, though a bit more prominent. And there are also running quotes about the newly constructed Coney Island from actual period newspapers because the main kid wants to go there so bad. The problem was that these different parts didn't mesh together seamlessly. In fact, I didn't really think the Coney Island quotes added much even though the fact they're from the time period is interesting. The sad homeless kid profiles don't connect either until the end, and that rushed part didn't quite feel natural.That said, I still loved the main story so much that it overcame the weird plot appendages for me. It was a good, wholesome book that brought to life the reality of poverty and love and loss and change. Others may find the disjointed plot more jarring, and this won't excite large numbers of teens."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick", "userReview": "Hesse\u2019s novel is centered on a real life Brooklyn family, the Michtoms, an immigrant family from Russia, that became famous for becoming the American inventors of the Teddy Bear.

There is never time for his family to take him to Coney Island. Everyone says he is lucky but he doesn\u2019t feel so.Hesse has written many young adult novels, more than a few have won great acclaim and prizes. I read her wonderful verse novel Out of the Dust a bunch of years ago but, despite how impressed and moved I was but Out of the Dust gritty tale of a young girl\u2019s survival of personal tragedy and the Dust Bowl, this is only the second of her novels that I have read. Brooklyn Bridge is good but less successful than Out of the Dust. A more conventionally presented prose narrative, albeit with a touch of ghostly magic realism tossed in under the bridge where the lost children gather, there is something thin about the characters and the setting. The details are right\u2014specifically and generally, the Superbas are the precursor name to the Brooklyn Dodgers, for example, the conditions of immigrant neighborhoods, the mess of city streets, the waterfall in Prospect Par\u2014but the depth of presentation that provides shadow and light, nuance and conviction is missing in a way that it wasn\u2019t from Out of the Dust.Still, it\u2019s a diverting tale of how immigrant America struggled with the opportunity and its many accompanying obstacles. Disease steals lives by the handful, poverty crushes many, the pressure of cramped quarters provokes arguments, and dislocation and a ruthless competition for jobs leaves many by the wayside and brings out the worst in others, leading to violence and abuse.

I didn't really like it at first because I had just read Trouble by Gary Schmidt, and he is such a great writer that the language in this book paled in comparison. This historical fiction story is about a boy named Joseph, whose parents immigrated from Russia to New York. His parents invented the \"Teddy\" bear after they saw a cartoon in the newspaper about Teddy Roosevelt not wanting to shoot a bear cub. Joseph's life turns upside down with his parents' success. Their family is caught up in the work of making bears, and therefore no longer has time for play or to fulfill Joseph's greater wish--to go to Coney Island. Karen Hesse uses plain language, which is probably better for the younger readers, and the plot is fairly straightforward. However, she contrasts the main story with a subplot about a community of children who live under the Brooklyn bridge. Each of their stories explains why they have come to live under the bridge--some by choice, some because they have no where else to go. Each of their stories parallels Joseph's in some way, and highlights how fortunate he is to have the family he does despite their preoccupation with the bear business. The book also underscores the irony of America's promise as the \"land of gold\" during that period in our country's history. Hesse carries the bridge and bear theme throughout the book.I've been reading quite a few coming of age stories lately, and this is another one that is well-written.

The son of Russian immigrants his life changes, for what he considers the worse, when his parents invent the teddy bear, close their popular candy shop and turn their apartment into a bear making factory. All Joseph really wants is to go to Coney Island but his parent's are too busy making bears to take him. The main story of Joseph and his family is contrasted with the stories of children who are living under the Brooklyn Bridge and a mysterious ghost who haunts them.In the authors note found in the back of the book Karen Hesse wrote \"Brooklyn Bridge is one writer's musing on what it might have been like in the early twentieth century to sometimes have too little, sometimes too much, and sometimes, to have it just right. \"The kids under the bridge obviously have too little and were juxtaposed against Joseph's story, showing that he really did not have it all that bad, despite all the changes he'd been experiencing.Hesse has written a really great story with lots of layers, feeling and amazing attention to details of the period. I feel like I should have loved this book or at least really liked it but I just never got into it. The story of the kids under the bridge and the eventual connection to Joseph and his family just did not connect with me. The story lines I enjoyed the most were actually about Joseph's aunts and I would have loved to read more about them.I think maybe I'll try and read this again sometime down the road and see how I feel about it then."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/777339-vicki", "userReview": "I loved this book!! This is a wholesome book that can be read by any age 4th grade up. It is about the Michtom family who were the ones that created the teddy bear inspired by Teddy Roosevelt's refusal to shoot a bear cub. It qualifies as historical fiction, but don't tell the kids. They think they hate historical fiction. It also has \"interior chapters.\" (I borrow that term from the \"Grapes of Wrath\".) The interior chapters are about the children that live under the Brooklyn Bridge and they are written as vignettes about each child's particular story. They are somewhat supernatural/spiritual in nature, but come to play out in the fast paced, fascinating conclusion of the story of the Michtom family. It is a immigration story, an American story, a family story, a success story, a failure story - funny, heartbreaking, clever, poignant, and sweet beyond measure. It will be acceptable to both sexes, though it is not action packed. The narrator of the Michtom story is told by the son, 14-year-old Joe, who wants more than anything to go to Coney Island, but his family is just too busy making teddy bears. Through Joe's eye we see and \"judge\" all the people that make up the fabric of his neighborhood ( like Dilly the man with the pickle cart) and Joe's family.Karen Hesse is a fantastic writer; most of her novel have been written in poetry form and all are very good to excellent, but this is the best! I hope everyone will read this book."}, {"userName": "Karen GoatKeeper", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25032447-karen-goatkeeper", "userReview": "Theodore Roosevelt spared a bear cub.

It is so hard to realize children are left to fend for themselves not only in the early 1900's but today. This was the one part of the book, although eventually tied in as important to the story, that I found hard to listen to.The trials and tribulations of a Jewish teenage boy growing up in Brooklyn around 1903 was interesting and worth the time to listen to or read about.I heard this as an audio book, unabridged.

I did not expect that I would have loved it so much and that I could not stop reading it and pretty much finishing it in one \"fell swoop.\" It seems Dickensian, but that might not be a fair comparison because it is actually quite sparing and except for the intentional repetitive phrasing in those dream-like segments about the children \"under the bridge\" (and so effective, those poetic passages.. *sigh*), there is not that much repeated sentiment. I was drawn in, felt like I lived side by side with Joseph, and often was surprised at the richness and the vividness of the world I \"saw\" through the text. It doesn't hurt that I (and my family) adore the sense of place and history and the bustling life of Coney Island. I wasn't sure at first about the vignettes of the children under the bridge but found them so mesmerizing and expanding of the experience of the turn-of-century Brooklyn - not only those who \"made it\" but of those who struggled and failed... I imagine that I'll remember Joseph's story for a long time, but I will never forget the Radiant Boy's, or Mattie's, or Otto's, or the story of May who almost died from eating the poisonous meal, twice.

This woman has a true gift for taking historical facts and plumping them into characters and lives for us to enjoy, and I am so glad I found this on the shelf. One of the classes with whom I work is in the middle of their big immigration study, so I'm paying particular attention to stories about immigrant families in New York. Also, since I'm a resident of Brooklyn and have worked with traditional Jewish families, this book really piqued my interest. The protagonist is the adolescent eldest brother in the family which first created the stuffed Teddy bear, and it covers a stress-filled summer as the family goes through myriad changes. There's a little bit of a love story, some ghost story, some social justice and injustice, and a lot of family drama--exactly what made me want to keep reading! It's a great story to share with third- and fourth-graders, and a good independent read for kids who like historical fiction. The interview with Hesse at the end of the book is good, too, as she described how she built BROOKLYN BRIDGE out of a little blurb she read in another book about how things were invented. I highly recommend it, especially for young female readers."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/503678-barbara", "userReview": "In this historical fiction about New York immigrant neighborhoods, a Russian Jewish family invents a stuffed \u2018Teddy\u2019 bear after seeing the story of Teddy Roosevelt sparing a bear cub on a hunting trip. Life changes for 14 yr old Joseph Michtom as the Teddy bear changes their fortunes. The success of the bear business upsets Joseph's life: the whole family is now working so hard that there is no time for family life, and their success sets them apart from other struggling immigrants. All he wants is to have his old life back and to go see the new wonders at Coney Island. Interspersed with Joseph's story of aunts and uncles, first crush, sickness, and adventure are seemingly unconnected stories of children living abandoned under the bridge along with a ghost child. Overall, the rich details of Joseph's family and the time period draw one in to be able to taste and feel immigrant life in Brooklyn and make this a valuable historical fiction addition. Though the very separate children-under-the-bridge segments bothered and felt disjointed to some people, I felt they were a useful counterpoint to Joseph's family's relative success.

It wasn't a bad read, in fact besides being a bit wordy in spots it was an easy read. It was interesting and it does seem Morris Michtom is a real person, although Joseph does not appear to have been real. I agree with all the reviews that suggest the alternating stories made the text slightly confusing and the story of the people under the bridge, even when resolved, added very little to the text. The two stars is not reflective of the fact that I think folks shouldn't read the book, it is reflective of the fact that it was okay and just okay.For me there were three sweet qualities: 1) the relationship between Joseph and Emily, who is a real person it would seem, 2) Emily's books and her love for them -- that bit of character development resonated with the book lover, and 3) chapter fourteen in its entirety. If you managed to read that chapter without tearing up or feeling some sort of feels then you have never witnessed such an experience play out in real life.Every once in awhile it is nice to read a standalone book and this was a nice break from the trilogies and love triangles."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271355-jess", "userReview": "The story had an episodic feel to it that reminded me of Richard Peck's A Long Way From Chicago - historical fiction with vivid characters, a real sense of time and place, humor - although this didn't have the same sense of the absurd. Mixed in with the story of a family of immigrants was the story of children living under the bridge, all with tragic pasts, and told in a more mysterious tone than the rest of the more down-to-earth story. I almost liked the way the two story lines came together at the end - but it felt a little too out of the blue. Maybe I missed clues that would have made it feel like an appropriate resolution (I listened to most of this at work). Or rather, looking back I can see some of the hints, but I didn't feel an emotional foundation for what happened. I knew the family would have some tragedy in the past, but I thought it had happened before they emigrated, and the Brooklyn connection totally threw me. I'm not sure about the best age group for this book - Joseph is fourteen, and there is some darker material, particularly with the children under the bridge, but the rest of the story feels a bit younger."}, {"userName": "Linda Castano", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59369739-linda-castano", "userReview": "Joseph Michtom lives in Brooklyn with his family.

He resents his family's success because it makes them seem better in the eyes of the neighborhood and his friends defer to him in a way that makes him uncomfortable. His family is also so busy that they have no time to spend with him and his two younger siblings, or to take them to Coney Island, which is his big dream. The ups and downs of extended family life, death and illness, tragedy and celebration, along with the goals and aspirations of immigrants are all brought to life in this well-written episodic novel. Interspersed between the chapters of the main story are the stories of children who haven't made it--who are living (and dying) rag-tag lives under the towering Brooklyn Bridge.

So at first, I read in spite of Joseph. But that didn't take long to change. Joseph experiences so much growth in this story. It was wonderful to see that happen, and made me glad that we started where we did. I would have liked to see more of the sub-story of Stephen from the outset, and better fleshing out of the 'bear' on Joseph's back, but it really was such a rewarding story to read.

I rarely cry at books, but this one brought tears to my eyes on several occasions. I imagine it was because the book told the story of how class, family dynamics and money played a huge role in the lives of immigrant families coming to the USA in the early 1900's. This book did an incredible job of juxaposing the lives of children who came from an immigrant family who made a great deal of wealth after inventing the first teddy bears and the lives of children and young adults who grew up abused, orphaned, in poverty and discriminated against. The writing was so beautiful. This story would not have been as emotionally moving if the author had not been as gifted with crafting gorgeous sentences. There was just the right amount of magical realism that made this the perfect read for me. I highly recommend this book, not only for older children but adults, too."}], "description": "It's the summer of 1903 in Brooklyn and all fourteen-year-old Joseph Michtom wants is to experience the thrill, the grandeur, and the electricity of the new amusement park at Coney Island. But that doesn't seem likely. Ever since his parents--Russian immigrants--invented the stuffed Teddy Bear five months ago, Joseph's life has turned upside down. No longer do the Michtom's gather family and friends around the kitchen table to talk. No longer is Joseph at leisure to play stickball with the guys. Now, Joseph works. And complains. And falls in love. And argues with Mama and Papa. And falls out of love. And hopes. Joseph hopes he'll see Coney Island soon. He hopes that everything will turn right-side up again. He hopes his luck hasn't run out--because you never know.
