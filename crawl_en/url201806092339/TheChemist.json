I was genuinely curious about how Meyer would move from paranormal YA to an adult Spy Thriller. Would I find myself amazed as I typed out a positive review about how far she has come? Would I be rolling my eyes as I ranted about how terrible and offensive this was? Honestly, though, this book isn't as exciting as either of those options. For all Twilight's faults, most people would agree that it's a thrilling premise for a lot of teen girls - a hot vampire who will love you forever, oh my! But The Chemist is just not very good. And it's also really boring.It's about a former agent (and professional torturer) who's on the run after the agency made an attempt on her life. This former agent - whom I will call Alex for simplicity's sake - gets called in by her boss for one last case; one which she hopes will enable her to return to her former life and stop running. She's suspicious of their intentions, but follows their instructions by kidnapping and torturing Daniel Beach. When she realizes that the tall, gorgeous Daniel is actually a good guy, she teams up with him and proceeds to spend most of the following 400+ pages going googly-eyed every time he is in the room, or else talking about dogs or guns.Every turn the book takes is obvious in advance. Imagine this scenario: you have a photograph of a guy doing something illegal. The image looks just like the guy in front of you only he swears it isn't him. How could it be possible that this guy didn't do it and yet someone who looks just like him did? Come up with the least inventive answer to that question and you've already figured out the first \"reveal\" of the book. The characters are classic Meyer. A nondescript Mary Sue protagonist is a virgin surrounded by a cast of male characters, with no female relationships (never mind friendships) in sight. The love interest is textbook handsome and one-dimensional to the point of disbelief. Daniel is such a good, kind, sappy guy who is concerned for the safety of a person who just tortured him. I honestly didn't buy it. I don't care how much of a saint you are, if someone tortures you, you're not going to sit up and be like \"honey, are you alright?\"Don't get me wrong, I love nice guys. Nice, sweet guys are underrated in fiction. But not mindlessly self-sacrificing heroes who would cut off their own arm to save the enemy. I have no interest in those unbelievable creatures. Oh, and INSTAEVERYTHING:\nBut from the second I saw your face, I was willing to leap miles outside my comfort zone to make sure I saw it again.\nThere is no romantic tension. Meyer gives up everything instantly with the way she writes the first encounter between Alex and Daniel. Despite being a cold, calculating torturer, Alex feels so different about Daniel. And Daniel doesn't care that he's just experienced excruciating agony at the hands of this woman because HOT DAMN.But honestly the worst thing is the huge chunk of the book that is made up of Alex and Daniel hiding out at a ranch with a load of dogs. I'm not exaggerating when I say that so much of this book is made up of pointless chitchat about dogs, guns and cooking. They kiss and watch movies together and sing \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" in the kitchen. Maybe this is really funny to some people, but I do this all the time so whatever. Who wants to read a book that is almost entirely about a dull romance that has no drama, no questions, no will they/won't they?The main government spy plot is lost behind all this romantic filler, and its questions are not all that exciting. It was hard to care about what was going on because the stakes never felt high enough - I never got the sense that Alex's life was at risk. Rather, I felt I was reading a comfortable romantic chick lit novel, in which every bit of drama is superficial, and everyone is guaranteed to survive and end up together.And it's a small thing, but someone should point it out: why is our amazing, uncatchable, super-spy reading espionage novels for tips? Sometimes I wonder if Meyer is just kidding with us, but I suspect she isn't.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Kat O'Keeffe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672379-kat-o-keeffe", "userReview": "A bit of a different genre for me (adult spy thriller?!) but I ended up really enjoying this! I absolutely LOVED all the on the run/action bits. I also appreciated that the protagonist wasn't super physically strong, but she was very smart and resourceful and mostly used her skills with chemicals/poisons to take down enemies and stay alive. I found it all super interesting.I did have some trouble suspending disbelief regarding the romance--it happens really fast, the male character even (kinda?) jokes about \"love at first sight\"--but I still enjoyed it and found myself smiling and giggling at times.This is definitely a new direction for Stephanie Meyer plot and tone-wise. Some of the characters and humor and felt a little reminiscent of her previous books, but all the fighting/action scenes totally upped the levels of badass-ery.Overall, this was a fun, fast, and gripping read. More like The Host than Twilight, but still a different vibe and writing style. Recommended if you enjoyed the humor and characters of Meyer's previous books and/or you like adult spy thrillers (which I think I do now, so hit me with some recs!)"}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "You haters can hate all you want, I DO NOT CARE.

I'll start by saying that, yes, I do like TWILIGHT. The book, that is. Not the movie. I read it almost ten years ago, and I was at the perfect point in my life where it actually made a lot of sense to me. Because of that, I will always have fond feelings for Bella and Edward's admittedly self-absorbed world.Now, I love THE HOST. It's morally complex and features these creepy aliens straight out of the Animorphs series. (In fact, I've always said that the Souls are an awful lot like the Yeerks.) I've read it several times, and I'll be the first to admit that while the story has its problems, the writing and world-building make up for it. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that we're still desperately waiting on those two sequels. I mean she wrote four unnecessary follow-ups to TWILIGHT, as well as a gender-swapped retelling and part of Edward's POV. Come on!When I found out that Stephenie Meyer was writing something new, my first feeling was disappointment. Like, \"Oh, so you're too busy to work on my precious HOST sequels, but not too busy to publish a 500-page tome, I see.\" But my second feeling was excitement. This is the first completely new thing that Meyer has put out in years. Of course I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I counted down the days to its release date feeling giddy.The premise of THE CHEMIST is interesting, and completely different from Meyer's usual work. She abandons her trademark first-person narrative style for a removed third-person retelling, featuring a retired female assassin who tortures and kills people with various poisons and chemicals (hence her eponymous nom de guerre, The Chemist). One day, she ends up getting roped back into her old career. Her assignment? To stop a potential terrorist from spreading a man-made plague.This plot should be the bomb-dot-com. Female assassins? Political intrigue? Deadly missions? Yes, yes, and yes. Unfortunately, it was not bomb-dot-com. More like lame-dot-org.Despite a compelling opening, the plot of the chemist sinks hard and fast. It's boring. There's a marked lack of conflict. When the heroine encounters the love interest, she pretty much falls for him instnatly, even though she's not supposed to (surprise). Despite the fact that they meet under less than ideal circumstances, they have no misunderstandings or lack of empathy. This sounds like a good thing - in fact, I'm sure you're shaking your head at me, thinking, \"You're actually complaining about a relationship that doesn't have any misunderstandings or lack of empathy?\" - but it is not. The heroine tortures the hero, and he doesn't even care. Doesn't blame her, doesn't hold a grudge about it.Nada.Second, despite having a plot revolving around assassinations and bio-terrorism, there's pretty much no drama. The heroine and the hero make out. A lot. They talk about dogs and food. A lot. At one point, the heroine gets a makeover and becomes best-fray-frays with Alice's psychotic, non-vampiric twin. Then there's these long periods where pretty much NOTHING happens. All those scenes that the reader takes for granted and shouldn't have to be written into the story? Meyer writes about them.A lot.There are some unintentionally hilarious lines in this book, though. Like this one:\"Um, is this some kind of fetish fantasy thing? ...I don't really know the rules for that stuff...\" (14%)^Is Meyer kind of throwing shade at FSoG here? I wonder.She snagged the warm, bloody finger off the floor and backed to the bathroom, keeping her eyes on him as he writhed in his bonds; even the best zip ties weren't foolproof. She made sure he was watching as she dropped the finger into the toilet and flushed (46%)^I literally have no words.\"I don't need any satanic help to do what I do....And virgins aren't useful for anything\" (64%)^No. Words.Don't ask me how it ended. I started skimming at the 75% mark. Honestly, I would have DNF'd probably, except for the fact that so many people were asking about this book, wanting to know how it was and whether I liked it. I'm genuinely sorry to say that, no, I didn't. I was hugely disappointed by THE CHEMIST because everything about it, from the romance to the plot, was utterly devoid of substance. There would be flashes of good writing or clever dialogue, and I would sit up a little, hopeful, only to be disappointed again and again. If THE CHEMIST has any redeeming features, it's that it made me want to reread TWILIGHT and THE HOST, to see Meyer at her best.Hopefully her next work will be better. If you're new to her work, don't start with this one, please.1 star. :("}, {"userName": "Maddie ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55751376-maddie", "userReview": "THIS AUTHOR IS THE REASON I JOINED GR, SO in actual fact I need to thank her for joining GR searching for similar books like Twilight.

Alex is on the run from her former agency who is trying to eliminate her as she knows too much. She is contacted by her former boss, who makes a deal if she helps them they will stop hunting her down. And this is how she meets DanielAlex a complex character, clever, failure never an option, and she had the ability to save her own life more than ones, but the thought of ending it all was always in the back of her mind, one of her thoughts to explain why I am saying this \u2192 \nShe was alive, yes, and she had fought hard to stay that way, but during her darker nights she\u2019d sometimes wondered what exactly she was fighting for. Was the quality of life she maintained worth all this effort? Wouldn\u2019t it be relaxing to close her eyes and not have to open them again? Wasn\u2019t an empty black nothing slightly more palatable than the relentless terror and constant effort?\nThe hero Daniel Nebecker Beach, was perfect, twenty-nine, a history teacher, with an ex that cheated on him and had a child with her new husband a lawyer six months later, not hard to make calculations how this broke Daniel. He was kind, and for Alex to socialize with one of her subjects was a foreign feeling. . \u201cI see a woman who is more\u2026 real than any other woman I\u2019ve ever met.

I\u2019ve never been drawn to someone the way I am to you, and I have been from the very first moment I met you. It\u2019s like the difference between\u2026 between reading about gravity and then falling for the first time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any comparisons.

But I'm not sure if I will like this book because it's not my normal genre but I have been surprised in the past so we shall see =)I thought this book was awesome! I was worried at first because I'm weird about mysteries/thrillers, sometimes I love them and sometimes not so much. But I was pleasantly surprised that SM wrote such a great thriller. I just wished they could have taken all of the dogs and that's all I'm going to say on that because you need to read the book! Dr. Juliana Fortis has been on the run for some time. They want to kill her for reasons. She changes names constantly and keeps on the run. She booby-traps any place she stays in and they are some awesome booby traps. She sleeps in a gas mask and other things. Sounds like a pretty crap life. Then she is pulled back in to the fold in a sense with some information email to her by an old friend from the work place. She decides to go after the person they want her to find because it's a matter of life and death for millions of people. BUT . . . It was a lie and she tortured a sweet man for no reason. This bothers her to no end and said boys brother almost takes her out with the help of his dog Einstein. He found that wasn't so easy to do =) The sweet brother is Daniel and the special ops brother is Kevin. He's off the grid for reasons. And he ends up taking Daniel and Alex (Juliana) to his hidden compound where he has a partner, Arnie, that run a guard dog/house pet business. I love all of the dogs and all of the characters. But poor Daniel is an idiot. I mean you have all of these people trying to kill you in the world and he goes off and does something stupid. So now not only are people looking for Alex (Juliana) and Kevin but they will take out Daniel too and anyone or thing that gets in their way. Yes, a lot of people die and some things happen to the dogs. BUT, they didn't expect to run into Alex - The Chemist, a weapon of torture and how she can take you out. I mean there WAS these assassins but . . . . Back to Daniel, I wanted to smack him sideways for being so stupid. I mean yes, he's never been in situations like Alex or his brother Kevin. But I have never been in those situations and even my tiny brain knows not to do stupid stuff like he did! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.I digress! I still love Daniel because he's a really sweet person and he's a pretty decent learner and excellent with a gun =) They are all on the move to find and take out the target that is trying to kill them all. All kinds of stuff goes down and in the end some of them end up where they want to be. <-- Like that wasn't cryptic. LOL, just read the book and you can know the whole story. I very much enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down actually. I waited so long because I felt like I was going to be bored because these kinds of books a lot of times bore me to tears.

Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature: Stephenie Meyer changes it up fairly dramatically in The Chemist (2016), her second adult novel, where there is nary a vampire, werewolf or space alien to be found. It\u2019s a rather pulpy but absorbing thriller in the vein of a Jason Bourne novel (to whom she\u2019s dedicated this novel, among others). There\u2019s no real speculative element here, other than perhaps some new developments in chemical-based torture and some startlingly smart dogs.The narrator, a bright, rather repressed molecular biologist, was originally hired by a nameless government agency to do cutting-edge medical research, but ended up being pressured to use her medical skills to create biological compounds that cause severe pain without permanent physical damage, and then to use them for torture-assisted interrogations sanctioned by this agency. She justified doing this because it was for the purpose of fighting terrorism and major crime. But something she learned made her a liability for the agency: a poisonous gas attack killed her co-worker and just missed her.When our story begins, our protagonist, whom we\u2019ll call Alex since that\u2019s the name she adopts for most of the story, has been on the run and in hiding for three years, routinely changing her name and her address. Alex arms herself to the teeth each day, with guns, syringes filled with various useful and often deadly solutions, and readily breakable glass earrings containing a caustic gas. And she sets up an appallingly elaborate booby trap in her apartments before she goes to sleep each night, with a dummy in the bed (complete with a fake bewigged head) and with wires attached to it that will set off her homemade poison gas if the dummy is disturbed, while she sleeps in the bathtub wearing a gas mask every night. Her preparations have paid off: in this way she has killed three assassins that the agency has sent after her.So Alex is understandably alarmed when one of her old bosses contacts her via email, offering a chance to do a final job for them, capturing a nice-looking young man, Daniel Beach, who, according to the government\u2019s files, has a secret side job as a biological terrorist, and extracting needed information from him using her skills with chemical compounds. If she does this, her contact promises, there will be no more threats to her life from the agency. Knowing it could be a trick, but wishing for some peace in her life, and moved by the threat of a biological attack that could kill hundreds of thousands, Alex takes on the job despite her suspicions.She was right to be suspicious.The job goes south in a dramatic way (which is what Alex\u2019s handlers were counting on) but \u2015 despite some major bruises and a couple of really beautiful black eyes \u2015 it turns out to be a game-changer for Alex\u2019s life. Now she has some people on her side, and they all have a bone to pick with certain government agencies. The hunted turn into the hunters. And Alex now has a love interest that she\u2019s not at all certain is a good idea to pursue, but who intends to stick by her side despite a (literally) torturous beginning to their relationship.The Chemist is a fast-paced, light suspense novel that quickly sucked me into Alex\u2019s world. Meyer clearly did quite a bit of homework with respect to the molecular biology and other scientific and medical elements of the plot. These details are realistic and intriguing, without bogging down the plot. The preternaturally intelligent trained dogs occasionally perform eyebrow-raising feats, but they added a definite spark to the story.Meyer\u2019s characters are generally types that the reader will recognize \u2015 the geeky female scientist, the handsome and sincere love interest, the hostile and highly capable Navy Seal who is (almost) always prepared for whatever may go wrong \u2015 but their personalities are fairly well-developed, if not necessarily surprising. Alex is a much more proactive, take-charge person than Bella, Meyer\u2019s much-maligned heroine in Twilight. The gradual thaw in Alex\u2019s personality and her ever-devoted love interest will warm the hearts of Meyer\u2019s fans, though this earnest love story mixes somewhat uneasily with the torture plotline and the high body count. All of the main characters off several people during the course of the story, though more tender-hearted readers can comfort themselves with the thought that by and large the dead probably deserved their fate.Despite its length, The Chemist moves along quickly; I finished it pretty much in one evening and never got bored. This would be a good beach \u2015 or perhaps Christmas vacation \u2015 read.Content advisory: This is an adult book with violence and a high body count, not for the squeamish. There's also a non-explicit sex scene and some light innuendo.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a review.

Let\u2019s face it, I know that Meyers is no literary genius, but she did manage to get a nation or two of young adults and others, myself included, scurrying to the bookstore eager to read the next installment in her vampire saga. \u00a0Sparkly or not. \u00a0And I can admit that I have felt oddly complicit in my silence. \u00a0That said I only wish I had chosen a different book upon which to air these views, because The Chemist is not at all reflective of how well Meyer\u2019s can tell a story. \u00a0Sigh.The blurb for The Chemist gives a good summary of the nature of the story so I will not rehash that here, suffice to say it is about a former agent, of some secret government group, who is in fact a torturer, not of the plier, hammer and waterboard variety but one who employs chemical compounds designed to stimulate intense pain thereby encouraging her subjects to reveal whatever hidden truth is desired. \u00a0\u00a0Only now the chemist has gone rogue, running for her life from her one time employer who clearly wants her neutralized.Great ideas, pulled wet from a well, never nurtured or given the time to develop and realize their full potential. \u00a0The narrative does not flow very well. \u00a0It feels clunky and cobbled together. \u00a0At the same time it felt like the author was just trying too hard, most especially in introducing and fleshing out the protagonist Alex. \u00a0It was like she was trying to convince herself about the plausibility of this character and quite frankly the more she said the worse it got.

They rock! \u00a0For those of you who may have never read a Stephenie Meyer book, please, I implore you, do not start here. \u00a0\u00a0If teenage angst and sparkly vampires are not your cuppa then might I recommend The Host. \u00a0It is a highly enjoyable read. 2.5 praying for a comeback stars."}, {"userName": "O.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22294728-o-r", "userReview": "Hey at least she is trying new stories unlike Clare who only knows how to milk one skinny cow."}, {"userName": "Vane J.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19590155-vane-j", "userReview": "The title of this book is an offense.

Left: Twilight-Stephie, We'll wait til we get married cause I lurve you. Love you more. No, love you more. La-ti-da, beautiful happy life. Right: Stephie 2.0, BOOM. Sex. Drugs. Cursing. Torture. Now let's kill some characters.She's baaaaaaack and badder than ever. Gone are the peace-loving vampires and here are the half-crazed mad scientist on the run plus an equally psycho ex-agent....plus a soulful puppy-dog of a man?\n\u201cThis is weird, Ollie. I\u2026 well, I almost like you right now.\u201d \u201cThe feeling will pass.\u201d \n An oddly well-put summation of this book. I kept going back and forth with this one - did I like it? Is it good? I had a real problem with connecting to the main characters and I  think that's what kept throwing me out of this book. \nFirst we have Alex\n, or whatever her name was, she's this big, scary, on-the-run torture-chemist. And I just wasn't feeling it. Maybe its from the chemistry courses I've taken but I just couldn't take her seriously when she would wax on about her chemical traps and her gas mask. It just didn't feel genuine. Plus, right off the bat she completely trusts the evil corporation she spent the last few years running from and manages to torture the wrong person. \nNext there's Daniel\n, he's definitely  the fluffy white bunny of the group. I get that he's supposed to be an innocent in this, but there's innocent & trusting and then there's \nannoyingly innocent & trusting\n. He quickly became the latter. Sure, he doesn't have any fieldwork but I think we could expect him to have picked up a spy novel or caught a Bond movie on the television once in his life. AND the way he completely forgave Alex for her big \"oopsie\" in the beginning of the book - how could you not have an ounce of hard feelings towards her after that??\nAnd then there's Kevin\n - the not-dead twin brother who's actually a secret-agent-on-the-run. I liked him as a character - he was the only one with some sense in his noggin. He's rude, crass and a bit over-the-top but in a good way. Plus his dogs kept me interested in the book when I was about to give up. The whole trio had a very The Host feel from Stephanie's other stand-alone novel. \nKevin (Kyle)\n is the big scary brother who doesn't trust the girl despite ample evidence. \nDaniel (Ian)\n is the more innocent, trusting brother who can see into the girl's heart and knows she's truly good. And \nAlex (Wanda)\n gets beat up alot and makes the guys feel guilty by having lots of bruises on her face. Did this book drag on? Absolutely, the editor's red pen should have slashed about 100 pages.Was the plot engaging? Sometimes, but it had too many lulls which resulted in the interesting bits quickly fading from memory.Did I like it? Finnne, yes. I'll admit it. I liked it. Was it my fave of her books? No. But I enjoyed reading it.Audiobook CommentsWell-read but not particularly memorable. The female voice did that thing when she has to drop it pretty low to mimic the guy voices.

I was invested from the first chapter. It was action packed! The story drew me in and I really wanted to find out who was behind it all. There were a few slower chapters scattered throughout but they were still interesting. In other reviews, some people considered it too wordy but I didn't feel this way at all. I actually liked having all the information and knowing how much preparation and strife the main character went through to not be found and killed. Apparently it's friggin exhausting! I would've been dead in roughly three days. No thank you.The book was great for the first third and last third but it was a little wobbly in the middle due to the romance between two of the characters. Chapter 15 (where the romance started) was just not good. I felt like the author forced the romance instead of allowing it to happen naturally and that's never a good thing. Plus the intelligent and badass main character started slipping and losing her head, which was annoying. Contrary to what the author believes, love doesn't make people drool at the mouth and babble nonsense. As much as I loved this book I had to take away a quarter star for that. Luckily it gets better and that chapter was simply a speed bump in an otherwise fantastic book.The main characters in this one include Alex, who I liked for most of the book, Daniel, who I also liked for most of the book, and Kevin, who I hated at first but loved by the end. Secondary characters include Val, who slightly annoyed me but who grew on me a little when she became useful, Ernesto, who was just kind of there, and, of course, Einstein, Khan, Lola, and the rest of the dogs, who were amazing. A special mention goes to her PPK and Sig Sauer that were brought up about 100 times over the course of the book.Overall I'm really glad I decided to ignore my worries about the fact that this author wrote Twilight, and to give this book a go. I was pleasantly surprised and will read more of her novels in the future.*Side note: I also listened to this on audio CD (which I always play in the living room) because it's the only way to get my husband involved with what I'm reading.

Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet up to my expectations. I read THE HOST in one day, and this one took me six days to finish! There were some exciting moments to this novel and then at other times it seemed to drag and it was a little bit boring for me. I could put it down and walk away and then at other times all I could think of was reading this book. It was a strange feeling for me as I am usually totally engaged and invested while reading a novel. THE CHEMIST is a light romantic suspense and spy thriller which I found slightly challenging to follow along with some of the secondary characters. I had a hard time figuring out and remembering who was who and how they were connected to the ongoing storyline. The novels main character who goes by the name of \"Alex\" (most of the time) is a strong female lead who is an expert in her line of work and possesses a unique talent to get the job done. I found her first experience with Daniel was quite intense and exciting but that intensity just didn't continue for me throughout the rest of the novel. I think I was more interested in the relationship that Kevin had with his extremely intelligent trained dogs and their special abilities especially Einstein, as it added some extra life to the storyline.I found THE CHEMIST to have an interesting plot line which was executed in incredible detail and the main characters were well developed.To wrap it up it was an interesting, slower-paced, somewhat exciting read with a satisfying ending.Would I recommend?

I very much enjoyed spending time with a different kind of action hero, one whose primary weapon isn\u2019t a gun or a knife or bulging muscles, but rather her brain.\" -Stephenie Meyer Ms. Meyer's personal tribute comes through perfectly in The Chemist. It is impossible to not notice the blatant similarities of this female version of the death-avoiding, dangerously skilled antihero. Recruited as a young adult and trained to focus on nothing but the assigned mission... all the joys of youth, love, and femininity were lost. As such, this \"adult\" book resembles Ms. Meyer's YA fiction in that it features new experiences for the heroine which results in instalove, characters who go googly eyes over kissing and hand-holding, and references to intimacy that fades-to-black. I have mad respect for Ms. Meyer's choice to try her hand at a new genre and was desperately excited to see this new release available. Ms. Meyer's storytelling in Twilight is what made me first take notice of how engaging leisure reading could be. It was life-changing for me...not the story itself, but the act of losing myself in fiction. So, I did experience some disappointment while reading The Chemist to see that her writing style appears to have changed significantly in my perspective. One of the noticeable changes is that The Chemist is written in third-person versus her historically successful first-person narrative, and her overall storytelling, while fast-paced and engaging, created seventeen hours (audio) of observing and not experiencing (for me anyway). There are several well-loved authors who are wildly successful with similar styles but Ms. Meyer's writing has always sucked me in and let me live a different life for a while. I was gravely disappointed by this element; however, I am equally enamored by having another female lead in the thriller genre. So 3 stars it is. Most people will read this book out of curiosity and I won't deter you. Check it out! I'm sure there will be many who will absolutely love it.My favorite quote:\"Laugh about it or cry about it, that's the only choice.
