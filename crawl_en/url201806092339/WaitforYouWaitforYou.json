I'm going to work my way through some of the popular New Adult books and see if I can weed out the crap and hopefully find some surprising gems. Here's hoping!I'm almost tempted to just give Wait for You 5 stars because I haven't laughed this much at a book since I don't even remember when. I'm laughing while writing this review (there's no one else in the house, so that's kinda creepy I guess) and it's really not funny, to be honest. I just... can't. This book. And this author. It's too much. On every level. It makes all the usual cheesy mistakes that a NA contemporary romance tends to do, it uses characters I've seen too many times to count - good girl, reformed bad boy, gay best friend, evil slut who wants reformed bad boy - but it also does something that I don't see too often. Something that brought back memories of a book I read a couple of years ago. A book called Half-Blood. So when I discovered that Ms Lynn is actually the same author using a new name, I couldn't help letting out something halfway between a laugh and a choking sound at the sheer lack of originality in her books.Half-Blood is, I don't feel unfair in saying, a complete rip-off of Vampire Academy. Please, be my guest, read it if you don't believe me. Tell me that you can't spot all the main characters and scenes being regurgitated with different names. Tell me that the whole pure bloods and half bloods thing isn't taken straight out of Mead's work and planted in another. I would not make this claim lightly because it's a serious thing to accuse someone of, more or less, plagiarism. But I believe that's what it is. And plagiarism is not okay. I don't think quite as serious a claim can be laid against Wait for You, but yet again I see evidence of recycled scenes and characters that tells me on some level, originality has failed to surface in her work once more.Avery Morgenstern is a new arrival at a college in a town far away from her home. She enters on her first day and walks (literally) into the hottest guy in school. The reformed badboy/playboy/whatever. Everyone wants him. He could have any girl in their college. And yet, for some reason I have been unable to fathom, he only has eyes for Ms clutzy new girl. They naturally find themselves paired together for a class project (astronomy class - which offers much in the way of star-gazing material). He wants her. She says no because she has issues. She's \"not like other girls\". Needs saving constantly. Blah-de-blah. I've seen this all in a million different things. I don't think I need to point out the glaringly obvious one...Oh yeah, and did I mention that she meets him and starts going loopy over his muscles on page 2? And I really wish she wouldn't blush so much. What's with so many YA/NA heroines being so prudish? I'm not talking about Avery's personal issues with sex here (I'll get to those later), it doesn't take anywhere near \"sex\" to make her blush. I understand it when she walks into Cam (hot dude), I would have blushed in school if I'd walked into the hottest guy there. But I don't understand it when she's talking to her friends and they ask her if she thinks a guy's hot. I would have talked shamelessly with my girlfriends about the hotness of guys at twelve years old, never mind nineteen. Some of the things being thought/said in this novel are ridiculous. Hilarious for a while, but ultimately ridiculous. Cam lays it all out straight away with \"I'm used to having girls throw themselves at me\" and Jacob (flamboyant gay friend) bursts onto the scene with lines like this \"I don't want my fine ass to be tainted by sitting on that floor\". They're all like caricatures and I can't take a single one of them seriously. I also wish someone would inform romance authors that petnames suck. I don't care if it's sweetheart or sunshine or baby or kitten *vomits* - they all suck and infantilise women in a way that just irritates me.\"Blood drained from my face and rushed to other parts of my body in a really odd and confusing way.\"What exactly is odd or confusing about that? Are you twelve?Why is this hot: \"I'm a lot to handle, but I can assure you, you'll have fun handling me.\" I've met drunk perverts in bars with better lines than that.There's some crazy wish fulfillment thing going on here with Cam. He's one of those obscenely beautiful male figures with an arrogant personality that I assume we're supposed to find sexy (and clearly, from the ratings, many people do). But I just found the lines he came out with either cringy or hilarious. Or both. He walks around shirtless most of the time with his perfect muscles rippling (oh my god, I will not miss the endless descriptions of his perfect muscles). A beautiful woman called Steph spends her time hanging all over him with her breasts bursting out of her clothes, and yet he never notices(!). He says things like \"Avery Morgansten, we meet again.\" *eye roll* \"We have to stop meeting like this.\" *eye roll* And I don't know whether this was, for me, the best or worst bit of the novel:\nCam took a bite of his cookie and closed his eyes. A deep sound emanated from his throat - a growl of pleasure. My heart jumped and my cheeks heated even more as I stared at him. He made the sound again, and my mouth dropped open. A row down, a girl turned in her seat, her eyes clouded over.\nI laughed so much. It's a cookie! It's a fucking cookie! *Can't. Breathe. For. Laughing.*Most of what I've said so far has been on the funny side of bad but now I'm going to move onto a couple of things that really bugged me. One was the treatment of Steph's character. I know I sound like a broken record and that fact makes me very sad, but I think it's important to keep pointing out the way women are categorised by their sexuality in so many books. The way flirtatious and sexual women who wear revealing clothes are automatically evil and given no further character development. Steph is that character here. She's the one who Cam hooked up with before Avery ever came on the scene, and she's also the one that gets brushed aside like an old rag who can't possibly have any feelings when Cam decides Avery is a special kind of girl who's worth more than being screwed and dumped. It's okay to screw and dump Steph because she's \"that kind of girl\". This is Avery telling Cam how she's different from Steph:\n\"I'm not like that.\"\"Like what?\" he asked.So he was going to make me spell it out. Of course. Why not? \"I'm not like her.\"\"I don't just hook up with guys for fun, okay?\"\nThankfully, Cam calls her out on it. Well, he calls her out on the fact that she doesn't even know the girl she's talking about and so she shouldn't jump to hasty conclusions. Fair point. But then there's also that bit where she shouldn't place girls into categories based on how sexually active they like to be (whether she knows them or not).The other thing that really bugged me was when Jacob asked Avery \"are you gay?\" because she didn't want to have sex with Cam. It really bothered me that someone was made to feel like they had to be attracted to a certain type of guy because he was soooo pretty. And the only other explanation was that she must be gay? Stupid.I have one last comment and it's about the dark secret of Avery's past... are we really not supposed to know what's going on? We know she's running away from something. Something a guy called Blaine did to her. Something that makes her have issues with sex and physical contact. Something that made people call her a \"whore\" and a \"liar\". Oh, what could it possibly be? Er, no. I can't be the only one who had her \"dark secret\" pinned from the start, right?Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Blacky *Romance Addict*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict", "userReview": "[masturbation, going down oh him and on her, and a couple of sex scenes too.

I was swooning from the first page and didn\u2019t want to put it down till I finished it. Not to mention that amazing fact that it is a stand-alone!!! A completed romance with a happy ending that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy. I LOVED IT!! Now, while I fell into insta-love with this book, I very much appreciated that the characters didn\u2019t. I loved that their relationship took time to develop \u2013 it was so well paced. After they meet, its actually a little while before they officially become a couple so, as the reader, you get the time to connected with them, laugh over their banter, swoon over them flirting and you get to fall in love with them. And it made it that much more aww-worthy when they did finally get together. Kind of like a reward for you waiting. Again, I loved it!K, so what\u2019s the book about?The book starts out on the first day of class at University. Avery is rushing, trying not to be late, when she quite literally runs smack into Cam.  Racing up the wide staircase, I barreled through the doubled doors and smacked right into a brick wall\u2026Something strong and hard went around my waist, stopping my free fall\u2026A second later I was pressed against a wall.The wall was strangely warm.The wall chuckled.\u201cWhoa,\u201d a deep voice said. \u201cYou okay, sweetheart?\u201d  C\u2019mon\u2026 are you not in love already?? Just a wee bit?? I was.She finds herself hooked up as astronomy star-gazing partners with this gorgeous swoon guy who bakes her cookies and calls her sweetheart. Seriously, Cam was \u201cgorgeous in all the ways that made girls do stupid things\u201d and very into her but Avery was haunted by scarring events of a fateful night five years ago and was not ready for any sort of relationship. And despite his best efforts at wooing her, she tried to keep her distance romantically, afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out on a date with you.\u201dCam didn\u2019t look surprised by my response or daunted. \u201cI figured you\u2019d say that.\u201d\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d \u2026\u201cBecause I wanted to.\u201d\u201cOh. Well. Okay. Glad you got it out of your system.\u201dHis brows knitted. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten it out of my system.\u201dOh no. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d\u201cNope\u201d He flashed a charming grin. \u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d  But he didn\u2019t give up. He kept asking her. Kept wooing her. Until he finally got through her walls and into her heart.I\u2019ll say that there was a point where I got a little frustrated with how much Avery was rejecting him but I kept reminding myself that she was damaged by her past and that she had genuine reasons for her actions. And she really did. I cringed when the truth came out. But I loved that Cam stood by her throughout it all.  \u201cYou\u2019re not doing this by yourself. Hell to the mother fucking no.\u201d  The dialogue in this book is just BRILLIANT!! Brilliant brilliant brilliant!! The texting, the banter, the flirting\u2026 just pure GOLD! I have SO much of their interactions highlighted in my book. Some are funny, some are sweet, and some are just down right swoon-worthy.Cam\u2026 seriously. No joke, guys. He is making the fav\u2019s book boyfriend list. He just scored one swoon point after another! I swear, every time he said \u2018sweetheart\u2019, my insides would melt. He just had this effortless, magnetic charm that made him impossible not to love. He was thoughtful, flirty, confident, caring\u2026. basically perfect!  \u201cI have so many feels for u.\u201d \u2665 \u2665 \u2665  And COOKIES!!! I will never again be able to eat cookies without thinking of Cam! **melt** And just in general, I couldn\u2019t stop grinning at all the things he did. MAJOR SWOON POINTS!!!The whole book is told from Avery\u2019s POV. I liked her voice and enjoyed her perspective. If I had to make one complaint, it would be that there were a few time jumps (not huge, just like a week here, a few days there) that wasn\u2019t disorienting or anything, but I would have been a bit happier without them. That being said, I still loved the book so really, its all good The book reminded me a little of The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden. I think fans of that book will like this and vice versa. But, again, no cliffhanger here!! There is a happy ending to this book so if you are ever looking for a sweet, funny, touching stand alone with an uberly swoony guy, this would be a great choice! Definitely recommended!4.5 starsCASTING For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477946-kristen", "userReview": "Review posted at:  Swept Away By Romance Charming 4 1/2 stars!I very much enjoyed reading this book. It was one of the most endearing, touching, and fun friends-to-lovers tropes I've read in a long time. I adored and swooned over Cam (Oh, how I LOVED him), sympathized with and understood Avery, and felt they shined brilliantly together. I did feel this book leaned more toward Young Adult in content than New Adult, but that's why it appealed to me. There was a freshness and youthfulness to this book that I loved. It was refreshing to read a YA/NA plot where I felt the storytelling made sense and was neither manufactured nor contrived to elicit artificial rather than real emotions. I felt everything these characters experienced and I loved it. I had a great time reading Wait for You. This wonderful story overflowed with angst, laugher, and sexual tension.

No seriously, WHAT THE HELL!?!? It seems like lately my life has been nothing, but good books...decent books. Books that are just...okay. I have been drowning, completely submerged in 3~star books. I\u2019ve been sinking faster than the Titanic. Wait for You was my life raft! I\u2019m saved!! ~Cue the hallelujah chorus~Let me start by twat kicking some of the negative issues people are having with this book. Yes, you figure out Avery\u2019s secret early on, sort of...a little bit. But I don\u2019t think it was suppose to be some big mystery. I think the reader is meant to know, but not know, know...you know?? We know what happened, but not everything. We are given an almost completed puzzle...almost, but there are still pieces missing. Important pieces.The pacing and development of the relationship was perfect!! The buildup, the tension, the wait!! It was real. It was natural. It was perfect. It teased me. It hooked me. It reeled me in. It was the most amazing, amazing relationship foreplay! I couldn\u2019t tell if I was wrapped around the book or the book was wrapped around me. I almost don\u2019t want to write a paragraph about Cam because I may be forced to invent new words. He\u2019s peanut butter dipped in chocolate, a spoonful of funfetti icing, the left over milk after a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch. He, is raw cookie dough. He had me at \u201cWhoa.\u201d The commando scene! The cookie innuendo! Where are my panties?? Where the hell are my panties?? Wham, bam, thank you Cam! Not only did J. Lynn wow me with all things Cam, she showed me the funny. She showed me incredible banter. She showed me intimacy that made me embarrassingly giddy. I\u2019m 31 frickin years old and during the first moment of extreme intimacy she had me burying my face in the bed squealing, kicking my feet, and squealing some more...repeatedly. There were quite a few editing mistakes, but nothing that drew me away from the story. Just enough to make me go, \u201cHuh, wonder where the editor was on that one?\u201d They were easy to overlook, at least for me.I can\u2019t say enough about Cam and Avery's relationship. It was drawn out without dragging on.

I'm doing happy Jumping Jacks with glittery pom poms!!I think it\u2019s fair to say that my relationship with New Adult Romance has been rocky, at best. It promised me so much but, after a few casual and fun dates, I got burned by a bad book, totally betrayed by a hero that promised to be gorgeous, alpha and protective but ended up being a hero that I just wanted to throw rocks at and I retreated to lick my wounds so, yeah, me and New Adult \u2013 we\u2019ve been on a break, a trial separation as it were.It hasn\u2019t been easy \u2013 temptation is everywhere and then, there was Wait For You making eyes at me with it\u2019s Adam Levine lookalike cover model, flashing its five star reviews at me and generally saying \u2018Come on baby, you know you want to\u2019. I\u2019m a cautious soul, I tried to look the other way but another blogger whose judgement I trust, (Nat, that\u2019s you flower) dropped it into a book conversation we were having and I found my resistance crumbling and I slowly, tentatively reached out and Wait For You grabbed me by the hand and ran ahead with me stumbling along in its wake, slightly dazed.And dazed is the right word because Wait For You is just all kinds of awesome \u2013 full of goofy grin loveliness, I read this with a big cheesy smile on my face. It had a kind of magnetic hold on me \u2013 every time I tried to put it down I was sucked straight back in. Just. Could. Not. Put. It. Down!So we\u2019re right back on college campus, hotbed of new adult romances, with Avery and Cam, who could most definitely relight my fire, slowly getting to know one another. Avery has travelled right across the country to go to college but more importantly to get away from her past and her family. She has a secret which has far reaching consequences over her decision making and the way she lives her life today and this secret is only slowly revealed throughout the novel \u2013 it\u2019s drip fed to us gradually. Yes, you can guess but not the specifics and it held my curiosity all through the story.Avery kind of broke my heart at the beginning - she just seemed so very alone. She had plenty of coping mechanisms to get her through the day but she\u2019s not really living, just moving on from one day to the next. I felt so sorry for her \u2013 the people that should have been there to cherish her and care for her had really let her down when she needed them most and she\u2019s reached the point where she trusts no one and cannot comprehend why people are now being nice to her.She literally crashes into Cam on her way to her very first class and it soon transpires that they are neighbours and they get to know each other slowly. Cam \u2013 le sigh!! Cam is just wonderful. Every girl needs a Cam. He\u2019s funny, charming, endearingly over-confident, thoughtful, attentive, caring and HOT \u2013 I could continue to rain down superlatives but I think you get the gist, right? I pretty much adored him right from the get go. I loved the way he asked Avery to go out with him on an almost daily basis \u2013 he never gave up and just waited for her to slowly come around even though she took hard to get to a whole new level.This is very much a character driven novel, there\u2019s really no pulsating action plot. The two main characters take things very slowly, plenty of time is given to building their characters and their relationships and I really felt like I\u2019d got to know them very well and it felt completely believable. Never once did my attention waver: I was thoroughly engrossed from beginning to end and I completely lost a whole day in this novel and I really can\u2019t think of a better way to have spent it!Trust is the central theme here \u2013 Avery will need to learn to trust Cam and her reticence will threaten to destroy their fledgling relationship.Trust has not and will not come easily to Avery and it\u2019s going to be a rocky journey for her \u2013 she knows that to move forward she will have to learn to trust Cam with her secrets but will she be able to? Will she allow the love that is growing between Cam and herself heal the wounds left by the demons of her past or will she let her old fears shadow the warmth she shares with him?So, this is a beautiful new adult romance - it\u2019s captivating, engaging and very romantic. I adored both Cam and Avery as well as Avery\u2019s new friends Brittany and Jacob, Cam\u2019s friend Ollie plus the long-suffering turtle/tortoise (not sure what it was) Raphael. There\u2019s a whole gang of characters to laugh with, cry with and just fall in love with. I have to thank J Lynn (who is actually Jennifer L Armentrout) as she has pretty much restored my faith in the new adult genre and we\u2019re dating again now. I feel more hopeful again. It\u2019s a beautiful thing!I will share this with you. It really has nothing to do with the story, more my own experience in reading it. in particular the following sentence.After showering, I piddled around the apartment and debated texting Jacob or Brittany to see what they were up to.This is one of the pitfalls of being a British reviewer reading mostly American books. In that sentence, we would probably say I pottered around the apartment because to piddle over here means to pee and I had this bizarre mental image of Avery peeing in all four corners of her apartment, fastidiously marking her territory!! I laughed like a drain (British expression!!) and actually scared my cat off my lap!!Anyway I digress, this is a very special new adult romance and I\u2019m going to highly recommend it to all of our followers. It\u2019s endearing and quite simply unputdownable. Is that a word?

As soon as I started the first chapter, I knew I was in for a treat.The MC's, Avery and Cam, were exactly what I hoped for. Avery is sassy, determined and says whatever she feels like, but is emotionally flawed. Cam is adorably full of himself, fun to be around, and oh so confident and sinfully gorgeous. Girls clamor to be with Cam, but he sets his sights on the red-headed beauty, named Avery, and makes a constant pest out of himself until she agrees to go on a date with him. Stubborn to a fault, Avery soon learns the hard way, she can't live without him.\u2003\"Don't you have anyone else to bother?\"\u2003\"There are a shit ton of people that I could reward with my presence, but I chose you.\"I could not get enough of these two, and their lively, bantering conversations. Their chemistry is undeniably sizzling and their relationship is quite angsty. I love a slow burn romance, and this one had it in spades.A snippet of the storyline ......Avery Morgansten selects a college nearly across the country to get away from her parents and her hometown. She needed to go to a place where she knew no one and no one knew her. A place totally different from her high school days where everyone hated her. A place where she wasn't called a 'whore' and 'liar.' A place where she could start over and let go of the past, unfortunately the past doesn't want to let go of her.Running late to her very first college class, she literally collides into 'the' Cameron Hamilton. Later that evening, she discovers she moved into the same apartment complex he lives in and is just across the hall. He is overly flirty and extremely easy on the eyes. Speaking of eyes, his are the deepest blue she has ever seen. \u2003\"He was gorgeous in all the ways that made girls do stupid things.\"Although Avery is nineteen and a freshman in college, she doesn't do stupid things with guys. She has never been in a relationship before, never dated, never had her first real kiss. Cam makes it completely obvious he hopes to change all that, but Avery knows he would be way too much for her to handle. She hopes someday she can start dating and lead a normal life, because 'normal' was taken away from her on Halloween night five years ago by an older boy named Blaine.Cam, who doesn't have a shy bone in his body, is totally intrigued by Avery. She is extremely pretty, but doesn't flaunt it. She is smart and witty, but refuses to go out with him, which makes him all the more determined. He is also at a loss for why she keeps turning him down, because girls don't turn him down. She was proving to be quite the challenge, and he was intrigued enough to play the game. He also knows she is holding her past close to the vest, but understands all too well, as he has his own secrets he would rather not discuss.Unfortunately, relationships don't last when secrets are kept.If you enjoy a slow burn romance, and believe you me, this was s.l.o.w. b.u.r.n., I think you will like this one.This story was written in Avery's POV. I am anxious to read Cam's POV in \"Trust In Me\" next. Knowing Cam, it is going to be quite interesting and fun!"}, {"userName": "oliviasbooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843533-oliviasbooks", "userReview": "[At the moment I cannot imagine making it through to the end, though.

New-Adult romance at its best!My Cameron and Avery:Avery is starting college, far away from her home, ever critical parents and her past. She wants just one single thing - to start over and have a normal life with noone knowing what had happened to her five years ago when she was only fourteen and what made her closed and uncomfortable around others. But what she is not expecting is Cameron - popular, extremely good looking and real charmer who is determined to get to know her better. But will Avery be able to run away from her past forever?I just love books in which I can gradually reveal what had happened to characters and shaped them the way they are now. Wait For You maybe isn't the most unique story ever written but I enjoyed every single word of it. I had a huge smile on my face most of the time and I was completely smitten by hero - Cam. Oh, Cam... he was smart, funny and sexy. A very dangerous combination! I fell for him in a matter of couple chapters. He was confident, determined, sometimes cocky but never a jerk. On contrary, he was really nice and caring person. Perfection, right? Jennifer L. Armentrout just knows the best how to write truly swoonworthy heroes. Moreover, Avery was sweet, smart and adorably akward. Yeah, she was a coward, ignoring her problems most of the time but otherwise a very lovable heroine. Together, Cam and Avery created another fictional couple I grew to love and felt strongly compassionate about.Wait For You is about finding something in your life which is wort of facing your problems instead of running away from them. Wait For You is about coming to terms with decisions and concequences you are not proud about and finally being able to move on. Wait For You is beautiful and emotional page-turner in which Jennifer L. Armentrout proved what a perfect writer she is.

So I'm in the middle of literally like 6 books and last night i was like U KNOW WHAT I JUST NEED SOMETHING EASY AND LIGHT AND FUN AND SMUTTY SO HECK IT I'M GONNA READ THIS and i promptly read it in 2 sittings before i went to bed and right when i woke up. A history of my and JLA's relationship: I was obsessed with the Luxe series when I was like 15 but stopped liking them after book 3 when it got too smutty and weird. I've read a few of her more recent novels, but I just think her writing style is corny and her dialogue and characters are unrealistic, so I knew going into this that I wasn't going to like it, but it would still be fast and addicting.I was right. I did an instagram livestream while I read ~30 pages of this book and I was just making fun of it out loud because for the first half of this book, there were literally several things PER PAGE that made me go UGGHGGHGHHGHGHGHHHHHere's a list of those things, as well as some other problematic content I noticed:-the only gay character in the book is constantly sexualizing other men and saying \"girl\" and \"honey\" at the beginning of every sentence. Sometimes stereotypes are true, but it was just really uncomfortable for JLA to establish that one of her characters is gay by making him BLATANTLY. GAY.-woop, there it is. only took 60 pages for male character to say \"you're not like most girls.\" Later on in the text, he tells her that she's \"Different in a good kind of way.\" yikes.-the amount of times that Cam has to catch her or pick up things for her or buckle her goddamn seatbelt for her is so annoying. let the girl live. at one point he buttoned her coat for her when she was perfectly capable of doing it and it was just so infantilizing. women can do shit by themselves leave us the fuck alone-so much problematic.. -JLA commonly referred to certain characters as \"fucktard.\" it was meant as a joke, but the variation on the word \"retard\" could be considered offensive. -At one point a couple of the characters juggled around the phrase, \"I'd go gay for you,\" implying that being gay is a choice, not something you're born with. -The main character refers to someone as \"spaz,\" and I know some people with disabilities are uncomfortable with that word being used as a slur.One of my main issues in this is that Cam (love interest dude) asked her out. every day. for two months. that's uncomfortable, and that's harassment. jla posing it as a \"joke\" in this books just normalizes that girls should let themselves be treated like this and consider it a joke. furthermore, her friends bully and peer pressure her into going out with him. any time he would be like, \"hey, come with me to this thing,\" her friends would LITERALLY say stuff like \"i'll punch you in the face if you don't go.\" Again, posing it as a joke just makes it even more disturbing. Additionally, I just really didn't like JLA's message about rape and rapists. A lot of this book focused on Avery overcoming her trauma of being raped, but in the end, nothing happened to the rapist? She dropped the charges, never thought about testifying, and no one in this book encouraged her to tell the truth or go to the police. I just thought this aspect of the book was done really frustratingly and unrealistically, and I was disappointed to see that the way she \"moved on\" from it all wasn't to contact the police and get justice, but just to be like \"from now on, **I** control my life, and no one will tell me otherwise!!\" and I just don't think that's a realistic portrayal of how women overcome trauma, especially if their rapist is still on the loose.The reason this didn't get one or two stars, however, is because I gotta give it to JLA. Although this book was so corny it had my eyes rolling for 90% of it, I gotta admit that she knows how to write slow-burning love scenes. I think there's a really, really great basis for a heartfelt story here, but if I was her editor, I would have her fix a lot of the annoying and problematic dialogue and inner monologue, then it would be so much better. But needless to say, I couldn't put this book down."}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "+5 COOKIES STARS <3\"\"Are you sure?\" \"I have cookies.\"\"Cookies?\"\"Yeah, and I made them.I'm quite the baker.\"Amazing!!!I loved it so much!It was beautiful, emotional and at many parts hilarious!!I didn't want to finished reading it, the story was so addictive!And the part about the cookies...omg :)) It was hilarious!!!I will definately eat Cam's cookies!!!The book starts with Avery who was seeking a new life and she goes from Texas in a college to West Virginia.Something bother her from her past..so she she's introvert.But things will change when literally crashed in a handsome boy in the first day to school...Cam is opposite of Avery!He is very communicative and everybody knows him..when he meets Avery he wants to date her...\u201cYou want to say yes, but you\u2019re just not ready.\u201dMy jaw dropped.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d His grin turned cocky. \u201cI\u2019m a lot to handle, but I can assure you, you\u2019ll have fun handling me.\u201dHe has to wate a lot until she finally accepts his offer :) The chemistry between them was so sweet and hilarious!I absolutely loved them together!!Cam is exactly what Avery needs!What I loved more about their relationship was that first they start as friends and then they fell in love and it was so real!! *sigh* Cam showed all his emotions,something that we don't see often in male characters!The story wasn't something that I haven't read before,however Jennifer's writing was amazing that made it unique!Avery was sweet,funny,charming and smart!There were moments that she irritated me but in general I liked her!Cam,Cam,Cam....omg I loved him!!!He was amazing!He is definately one of my top book boyfriends!He was so adorable,hot,sweet,funny and so patient with Avery!I think he is exactly what a girl needs!

Don't think I'll ever see a cookie in the same way again ;DAnywho. GAH I couldn't really settle with a rating for this one because the first half of the book felt like a solid 4, but the second half starting getting on my nerves with Avery. And there's Cam and his pet tortoise Raphael who I would give 5 stars to. The thing with NA reads is that it's very hard to please with all the recycled plots and with this one, it's really no exception. This is a typical college romance where reformed hot player meets new girl in town running from a terrible past. They bumped into each other, guy tries to woo her and all that shenanigans that makes the recipe of a NA read. I really enjoyed the first half of the book, the dialogues were highly entertaining and there's Cam with his cookies. Cam alone would have warrant 5 stars from me; he was just super sweet, caring, understanding that he is literally too perfect to be real. And ladies, HE BAKES! And he would cook eggs every Sunday morning for you! But seriously tho, HE BAKES COOKIES. Chocolate and walnut cookies. COOKIES EVERYWHERE. But then Avery, ah geez *facepalm* Usually I'm very tolerant and understanding of damaged heroines, but I got superbly ticked off with Avery when she constantly kept pushing away Cam. Who the f*ck says NO to a guy like Cam?! GAHH! Also, it really doesn't help that the secret reveal of her past was dragged on forever till the end and frankly, that made it super difficult for me to be sympathetic for her throughout. She ended up coming off annoying for me after a good while because I wanted her actions to be damn well justified for acting that way. But nope, she just kept living in her little bubble. I'm not even gonna lie but Avery really doesn't deserve him. Where is the justice in this world right now?! Overall it was still a nice sweet read but nothing phenomenal when it comes to the plot. It does have its emotional moments and a great addition of side characters. Cam definitely is the highlight of this book but a tiny part of me is mad that he could be so fixated on a girl like Avery. If it wasn't for Cam, I may have totally ditched this book. *sighs*PS: Thanks Rachel for introducing Cam to me and ruining all men on the planet for me right now! \u2665\u2665"}, {"userName": "Beth Michele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16809610-beth-michele", "userReview": "(Tapping my finger against the side of my head) Where to begin.First off, I will never look at cookies and eggs the same way again.

He was incredibly hot, right down to that sun tattoo, absolutely, but it was something more. It was his sense of humor (love that), his playfulness, his thoughtfulness.

But simply basing it on friends\u2019 reviews, I know for a fact that JLA is one of our elite kick-ass writers. This book made me see why. She is naturally endowed with great writing skills, so that although this entire story is quite a bit familiar (as it reminds me so much of a mix across Hopeless by Colleen Hoover, Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson and the Lovely Vicious series by Sara Wolf- all of which are great books, BTW), she still managed to make it such an exciting read that it took me only a day to finish it. Her use of hilarious analogies and metaphors gets me all the time. The only thing that bothered me just a little is the abundant use of the f-word, like REALLY abundant ^^But though admittedly the entire story did not knock me off my feet, the characters (Cam most especially) thankfully did.

Armentrout is one of the best authors out there right now and by far, the most complex, because she can write almost everything in a flawless manner. Who can actually have 2 pen-names and nail it every single time? Add Jennifer to your list:)By the name of J.Lynn she developed such an amazing series, with important issues and adorable couple that just stick with you a long time. The first story belongs to Avery and Cam and I know you will love them to death, because Avery\u2019s innocence and Cam\u2019s hotness are hard to forget and bond perfectly to create an amazing story.Avery wants to leave behind a traumatic past that hunted her every minute of her life. After being left out by her family, she just wants to start over and maybe one day, forget. Without the love of her parents and true support in dramatic situations, Avery was almost all her life alone. She enters a new college and things will change when she will meet a blue eye boy called Cameron, the star and hottie of all the school. Girls want him and boys want to be him, but Cameron is very laid back and natural with this status. He likes Avery a lot and he feels she is keeping something important. What at the beginning was a puzzle needed to be put together, developed into something more, and slowly, Cam and Avery will fall in love. That love will be questioned by Avery\u2019s demons and inability of letting go, which will challenge their feelings and create a lot of drama for the couple.Avery was a great heroine for me and I love her mix of naivety and vulnerability. She was so guarded, but also so eager to feel something new, intense. Even if her chemistry with Cameron was off the charts, she was extremely cautious in having more than a friendship with him, because she was afraid of losing his respect. This element that Jennifer inserted in the book has fantastic but it kind of outraged me in the same time, because no victim of assault or harassment must feel guilty for anything that happened to them. Avery felt dirty and ashamed, this feelings harvested by her family and lack of love.Cameron was awesome and one of the best boyfriend from this genre. He was very patient, loving and kind. I liked that the exterior matched the interior and his gentleness towards Avery was heart melting. He knew something was not right with her, and even if there were time when he wanted to find out the truth, he considered that showing Avery how he felt was more important than telling her. This slow burn romance was amazing and Cameron won the gold medal for patience and awesomeness because he managed to pull Avery out of her shell and show her what an amazing girl she is, worthy of love and everything in between.This story is very touching, with a great message behind it and I know you will love the couple. A very intense and steamy story, about second chances, loving yourself and taking chances in order to be happy again.

Well, this is the story for you. Cameron(Cam) and Avery meet in college... he's two years older, handsome, confident and a ladies' man. She's innocent but traumatized and never had a boyfriend. How can she hold her own against Cam? It was really hard being in Avery's head because you know from the beginning something horrible happened to her five years ago. It just takes forever to find out what. On top of that, she comes from a family of money, who keep their secrets secret so there's none of those pesky psychologists to deal with. Avery's had to do it all by herself, the best she knows how which isn't always the best way.But Cam also has a secret...it just doesn't seem to affect him like Avery's secret does her. Cam seems to have it all...he's good looking, athletic, smart, popular, and can bake...and cook! What's not to like? Well, it could be a certain girl that hangs around...and all over Cam. Thankfully, Cam wants nothing to do with her. The cutest thing is that Cam asks Avery out several times a week and she always turns him down. She tells him its good for his ego and they have the funniest exchanges. Finally, she says yes and she's totally swept off her feet....romantically and sexually. Cam has some great will power and the patience of a saint!Of course, there has to be problems and it all comes down to Avery. The problem is she has to be ready to tell Cam her secrets and Cam gets tired of her not trusting him. My heart did go out to Avery when Cam saw her without her bracelet but it was necessary.The sex scenes are intense and steamy but not as detailed as the more adult books. One problem I had with the story was the lack of protection. I think I'm so used to it being in all the books that I really notice when it's not.There are a lot of great characters in the book and some who will have their own books. Teresa (Cam's sister) and Jase (Cam's friend) will have the next book, Be With Me and Brittany (Avery's friend) will be book three, Untitled for now. I'm predicting she ends up with Ollie (Cam's roommate). Jacob was the comedic relief and it's getting old having the one gay friend be the funny one. I loved Cam's parents though...they were great. I only wish Avery could have had better parents. The part with them at the end was a bit weird! I can't wait for the novella that's coming out in October. We get Cam's POV in Trust in Me and we're suppose to get a lot more info on Jase and Ollie. Favorite quotes: \u2666 \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of walnut and chocolate.

You think I don\u2019t want you?\u201d His voice came out low, almost a growl. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single part of you that I don\u2019t want, you understand? I want to be on you and inside of you. I want you against the wall, on the couch, in your bed, in my bed, and every fucking place I can possibly think of, and trust me, I have a vast imagination when it comes to these kinds of things.

Sometimes it pays off, other times not so much, with 'Wait for you' it paid off BIG time ... So thank you good people of GR's. I fell in love with this story and here are my thoughts...In a nutshell this is a story of love conquering all, with some very likeable characters thrown in and swoon-tastic writing style. I was drawn into and absorbed into the story. I couldn't get enough of falling into the lives of the main characters. I loved the authors style of allowing the reader to feel involved in all of the drama and romance. I found the story to be moving without being heavy and thoroughly addictive. For all the doubters of this story I don't feel it necessary to mention any negatives. For me this moving and romantic story ticked all my boxes. I won't be forgetting the story of Cameron Hamilton and Avery Morgansten for some time.My heart ached for Avery her story was almost painful to read, and her actions reflected her past. But I 'got her'. I think the author did a great job of making her awkward and affected, but not annoying.Cam was well ... Let's say I understand the hype. This boy was the very definition of swoon. I was all kinds of loved up reading about this dedicated fella.
