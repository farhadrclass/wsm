The setup took the first quarter of the book or so but after that, it really moved along. I found Isabells's tale more difficult to follow than Heathcliff's. Fortunately, the bulk of the book was Heathcliff telling his story to Lockwood."}], "description": "Something evil stalks Yorkshire. Traveling into the misty moors to investigate the dangerous vampire prowling for victims, the hunter, Lockwood, finds the strange owner of Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff, and becomes trapped in the evil enveloping all of Yorkshire.
