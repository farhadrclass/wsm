That's about the extent of my review because I don't know what other words I could use to justify how much I loved this book!Readers of Outpost will already recognise Bakers signature writing style starting this book, if you haven't read Outpost, don't worry these can be read out of order, the author has a really unique way of writing that really adds an extra effect to his chilling novels.Juggernaut is every bit as stomach clenching and nail bitingly scary as the first book and just left my head spinning at the end, I really had to collect myself before I could pick up another book.I will admit however, for me it took a little getting in to, not because it's bad just because I know nothing about the military so all the lingo and the different weapons just went over my head, I even had to find out exactly what a Mercenary is because I wasn't sure, but yeah, that was my problem lol At the same time though, I'm glad there wasn't descriptions of all the weapons and what the guys were talking about because I think it would have slowed down the story and added a big chunk to the book, I figured it all out for myself as I went and as the story was set up and the book started flowing I was completely hooked.As the pace speeded up I came closer to the edge of my seat, my stomach in knots as I awaited the conclusion, I could feel the desert heat sizzling off the page.There's plenty of 'infected' action and some really great insight into how the infection came about, something I know I was dying to learn about after finishing Outpost and I know others were to, and it's good!...I enjoyed all of the characters, we don't learn a whole lot of backstory about most of them but I enjoyed how they interacted with each other, you can tell that the core group have been friends a long time... although there are some great twists along the way! There was also a good mix of characters, good, bad and really bad that made a good dynamic to the book.Adam Baker is quickly becoming one of my favourite authors and for those that don't know there is to be another book to follow in this series, which I'm pretty sure is set after Outpost and I cannot wait to get my hands on it and be back in this world that sends chills up my spine.Favourite quotes'It's a matter of will. Put a man in a fiercely hostile enviroment like the desert or leave him marooned in Artic wastes and you'll soon see what lies in his heart.' - Jabril.'Lucy will have no choice. he will turn homicidal. She will have to kill him, or be killed.' - Jabril"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 StarsJuggernaut is a rarity in that it really worked better as a prequel read after the first book Outpost. I normally have a hard time reading things out of order, it messes me up....haha. In this book Adam Baker has decided to take a straight up action thriller approach to his novel, countdowns and chases included, rather than the survival horror theme of book one.In Outpost Baker centered the story on one main character, an amazing heroine named Jane. In this one, we get several strong main characters, led by the hard ass Lucy. I like that Baker does a good job at writing from both a male and a female perspective, even though it can be stereotypical at times.Juggernaut is just that as far as action and pacing is concerned. The setting in the deserts of Iraq make for an awesome and oppressive backdrop. I love how the plot unfolded and the keys behind Outpost were brought to light.My only real gripe is that I never found myself routing for any of the characters. Jabril, one of the real bad guys ending up being the most complex and easily identified with characters. I loved his backstory and his selfish actions. A true summer read, Juggernaut is a really fun prequel to Outpost and a great introductions to the bad ass zombies. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Hudson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11741032-hudson", "userReview": "Iraq. Treasure. Republican Guard. Zombies.A very fun read."}, {"userName": "Milo (BOK)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6106947-milo-bok", "userReview": "Original Post: http://thefoundingfields.com/2012/01/...Zombies. If you\u2019ve been a long-term follower of The Founding Fields, then you know that I like to read anything with zombies in it. That probably doesn\u2019t explain why I haven\u2019t picked up Max Brooks\u2019 World War Z yet, but I\u2019ll let you know when I do pick it up. But, back onto Juggernaut, the novel which I received an advanced review copy from the kind folks at Hodder and Stoughton. I also have another zombie related novel from them, The Return Man by VM Zito, so that should be a fun read when I get to it.However, I keep straying off topic so without further ado, here\u2019s the plot for Juggernaut.A group of mercenaries, lead by the strong female lead character that is Lucy, are searching for Saddam\u2019s gold in the year 2005, during the Iraq War. They\u2019re on their last mission, and look set to go in, grab the gold, and get out in a matter of hours. However, something goes horribly wrong, and they soon find themselves fighting for their lives against an enemy that they didn\u2019t think could exist. The mercenaries soon find themselves stranded in ancient ruins, confronted not only by an army that won\u2019t stay dead \u2013 but also the threat of greed and betrayal. Although at first, the novel itself may seem slow, but once Baker begins to increase the tension, the pace flies by, and you\u2019re sucked into Juggernaut and won\u2019t be able to put it down \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t read that much zombie-horror in the first place.Juggernaut certainly has an original background for the novel, and after all \u2013 there aren\u2019t many zombie horrors set during the Iraq war. The characters, both the supporting cast and the main crew, are well developed and well rounded, and provide a strong cast to the novel.Adam Baker\u2019s second novel is a mostly action-packed, and provides some pretty awesome set-pieces where you will soon learn that nobody is safe \u2013 so don\u2019t get too attached to a particular character. I\u2019d like to talk about the zombies here, in this review for a bit. Juggernaut is of course, set in the same world as Outpost, but can be read, as I found it could be, as a standalone novel without any prior knowledge of what happens in Outpost. What I like about the zombies in Baker\u2019s novel is that they\u2019re quite well explained, and the author manages to achieve this without spoiling the pace or otherwise. However, not every novel is perfect \u2013 no matter how much we wish it could be. Juggernaut\u2019s main fault and one that I hope is only in the advanced review copy that I got, is the constant typos, words missing and grammar errors littered throughout the novel, and where they were found \u2013 they were quite off-putting. Juggernaut however, despite the flaws mentioned above, has made me want to read more of Baker and I will probably buy Outpost sometime soon. That\u2019s always a good thing, when you enjoy an author\u2019s work so much that you want to get the next or previous novel in the series. The tone is pretty much serious throughout the entire novel, there are no z-word jokes, etc, no character that\u2019s thrown in there for comic relief, but this novel doesn\u2019t really need any as Baker manages to pull off a fantastic read and, with one book, is quickly becoming my \u2018go-to\u2019 author for zombie horror. Not that I\u2019ve read much zombie-horror, mind you...Before we finish off, I\u2019d like to say a big thanks to Hodder and Stoughton for providing me with this advanced review copy \u2013 I really enjoyed this novel.

Juggernaut is set in Iraq, 2005. Mercenaries Lucy and Amanda uncover a rumour of Saddam's hidden gold and after getting an Iraqi called Jabril released from Abu Ghraib prison who knows first hand of where the gold is hidden, they form a team along with Voss, Huang and Toon to journey into Iraq's Western Desert near to the Syrian border to what is only marked on maps as Valley 403. They enlist the help of unscrupulous men called Gaunt and Raphael who have two antiquated helicopters from the 1960's who help them fly into the desert.When they arrive at the valley they find an ancient citadel housed in a hidden ravine with only one entrance through a long natural tunnel. They find the burnt remains of many of Saddam's republican guards and without dropping any spoilers what begins as a hunt for gold turns into a living hell when the dead guards slowly sense human life is near and begin to move and attack the living. Whilst fighting for their lives, Jabril tells the group about a top secret Soviet spacecraft that had crash landed in the desert nearby and was brought into the citadel and was infected by a hideous alien toxin that has inadvertently crossed over into humans. What follows is a harrowing account of the group trying to survive, a double cross, and ultimately attempting to flee the valley if they can with their lives. An amazing read! A very fast, rapid page turner of a book, action all the way, quite grisly and horrific in places. I loved it! Adam Baker is an author to keep an eye out for in the future!"}, {"userName": "Janette Fleming", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2917516-janette-fleming", "userReview": "THEY SEARCHED FOR GOLD. THEY FOUND DEATH.Iraq 2005. Seven mercenaries hear an enticing rumor: somewhere, abandoned in the swirling desert sands, lies an abandoned Republican Guard convoy containing millions of pounds of Saddam's gold. They form an unlikely crew of battle-scarred privateers, killers and thieves, veterans of a dozen war zones, each of them anxious to make one last score before their luck runs out. After liberating the sole surviving Guard member from US capture, the team makes their way to the ancient ruins where the convoy was last seen. Although all seems eerily quiet and deserted when they arrive, they soon find themselves caught in a desperate battle for their lives, confronted by greed, betrayal, and an army that won't stay dead.Second book in the Outpost series and another rollicking, rollercoster page turning read. Baker excells at writing strong female protagonists and I loved the female lead in the last book \"Outpost\". In Juggernaut Lucy, mercenary leader and general all round kick arse makes a refreshing change to have a female in the kind of role that's usually reserved for pumped-up action men.In fact Lucy Whyte is so hard she makes pumped-up action men cry:*Lucy and her team were wearing full body armor. Lucy had a cheery Sheraton conference badge pinned to her flak jacket. \u201cHello, my name is \u2026 F*** YOU.\u201d*Lucy shot him through the left eye and blew out the back of his skull.

Juggernaut is set in the same world as Outpost, but serves as a prequel. Like Outpost, Baker gives an unique setting, this time a desolate Iraq desert. First part gives a really good feeling of Saddam's regimes last days, there is no politics, just telling how it was a good place to all those mercenaries to make a good living. Novels 'heroes' are a small time mercenary team and 'villains' are the black ops type guys, but it is not a black and white stuff, one of the main character is Iraq soldier, Jabril, with a shady past.My main problem with Outpost was lack of deeper characters, same here, deepest one is Jabril, if the same amount time had been put to main guys, the mercenaries, then we could be in the 5 star territory. A prose style, that i found somewhat jarring in the first book, is here, but oddly enough now it feels better and fit's the fast paced action like a needle in the eye. More good things: Baker knows his weapons, and that makes action scenes more realistic. Best part was the section describing origins of the virus, puzzle piece fitting together nicely with Outpost, making you want to know more.

How, you may ask, is this something that could contain zombies? Here\u2019s how it works. In the book, and as part of the plot, the rumor is that sometime before the second invasion of Iraq, Saddam had his personal fortune shipped to the Western Desert. This is where he had previously released chemical weapons against the Kurds who live in that region and following that release created a fence and renamed it the Contaminated Zone.This is where Baker\u2019s Juggernaut comes in. A second string, Private Military Company (PMC), hears the rumor about Saddam\u2019s gold and decides to track it down. Unknown to them, one of the people they contact for assistance has already been contacted by a shadowy CIA agent who wants something that is also in that convoy. What awaits them in that desolate place is more than just gold and some super secret intelligence item. There be zombies in that there wasteland. Heralded as a cross between Three Kings and The Walking Dead, Juggernaut is a taut zombie action adventure with well developed characters and a solid plot. It has moments of terror accompanied with moments of tense dialogue that sets the pace throughout the story.But, and this was coming from almost the first page.There are some serious technical issues. What stands out to me and by now most of the people who have read my reviews know what I\u2019m referring to, the ever present disease known as poor research. Within the first chapter there is a major issue with a soldier who is sitting in the doorway of a low flying Black Hawk. That\u2019s Black Hawk; two words not one as in Blackhawk. This soldier apparently does not have a sling on his rifle as he tosses it to another soldier who is inside the helicopter. Let\u2019s look at that action for a moment. Sure, that sounds kind of cool and puts a real Hollywood feel to the scene but, tossing a live weapon inside a helicopter while said aircraft is in flight is not only a direct violation of safety, it\u2019s the most stupid thing someone could do. Moving on, we have another character introduced as a marine. Sorry, that\u2019s Marine. Marine is a title and needs to be capitalized. Said former Marine somehow has a West Point ring on his finger. Some of you may ask why that\u2019s an issue. Here\u2019s the problem with that. West Point is the U.S. Army\u2019s military academy. Marines don\u2019t attend that academy because they aren\u2019t part of the Army. Marines attend Annapolis, the Naval Academy because Marines are part of the Navy and are considered to be Naval Infantry.That being said, no way would a former Marine lieutenant be wearing a West Point ring. Then there is the lack of capitalization when referring to the U.S. Air Force. That is a proper noun and title therefore it needs to be capitalized. Throughout the story there are constant references to clips and magazines and the ever present reference to STANAG magazines which the author appeared to be fixated with. Let\u2019s address the whole clip/magazine issue first. A clip is a term that refers to the old stripper clip from the M1 Garand rifle of the WW2 era. It was a simple metal clip that rounds (those are bullets) were attached to and then inserted into the rifle. Modern military rifles do no use a clip, they use a magazine. The term clip has seem life inside several books, movies and even badly researched television shows and is an incorrect term when referring to a modern military, magazine fed weapon. Now we have the whole STANAG magazine issue. A STANAG magazine is simply a Standard Agreement magazine adopted by NATO forces, hence the whole acronym, Standard Agreement = STANAG. It\u2019s not a special magazine, nor is it a really high quality magazine; it\u2019s simply a standard 5.56mm compatible magazine. Oh, and that 5.56 not 5:56 when referring to the caliber of the M16/M4 rifle and the M249 SAW. Later in the book, there is a mention of one of the PMC contractors going full auto with his AR-15. Really? The AR-15 is the semiautomatic only version of the military M16 so it would not have a selective fire switch that would allow it to fire fully automatic. Just not going to happen. There is a mention of the M249 SAW using a 200 round drum. That\u2019s not going to happen either. The standard drum magazine for the M249 is 100 rounds. There is a 200 round ammunition box that the linked belts are stored in but there is no 200 round box or drum magazine. There is even a mention of one of the contractors feeding shells into his shotgun then racking the slide. Maybe he racked the pump action but definitely he didn\u2019t rack the slide. These are all reasons why I offer my services as a Military Technical Advisor for authors. There will always be a few issues no matter how well someone researches but this many? While Juggernaut is a tense zombie thriller that had a relatively believable cause for an outbreak, to me, it really lacked the tactical and technical savvy required to make this an outstanding novel set within contemporary times. If you can overlook what I mentioned above and just read it as it stands, a zombie thriller, then Juggernaut is an outstanding story that uses a real world cause for the zombies and tosses in some political thrills and plenty of action."}, {"userName": "Campbell Mcaulay", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay", "userReview": "It's 2007 and a small team of mercenaries travel into the heart of peace-torn Iraq, in search of Saddam's gold. What they find, however, will change the world forever.Imagine a cross between, let's say, Three Kings and Resident Evil with, perhaps, a bit of Jarhead and 28 Days Later thrown in (not to mention a goodly helping of Tomb Raider - the game not the film) and you'll have a reasonable idea of the plot. This is what I believe is known as \"survivalist fiction\", action/adventure with a dash of techno-thriller military porn thrown in. Billed as it is, i.e. the prequel to Baker's Outpost, I suppose that it will be fairly clear where the story is going. I however had never heard of Baker and this is really not the sort of genre that I would ever have considered picking up before now. Indeed, until reading this book, the zombie survival genre had pretty much passed me by and I had little idea just how big the market actually is. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Juggernaut actually turns out to be a well written, fast-moving, engaging and enjoyable read.Outpost was knocked somewhat for Baker's excessive use of terse, truncated sentences. Things ain't changed. Sentences are still short. He hasn't learnt. Still damn annoying. Damn. Actually, this style has its place and it can be used to inject pace into fast-moving scenes and/or give a clipped \"military\" feel to things, but used excessively it IS irritating. The style sort of fits the story in this case and it certainly doesn't kill the story but it is overdone. Overdone to the extent that not only is the prose written this way*, but also the dialogue. Apart from that, the writing is clear, accomplished and evocative with plenty of pacy, well-choreographed action scenes.The characterisation is good, if a little superficial and patchy. It's nice that the story is led by a female protagonist: Lucy, the leader of the merc team, is an interesting character, enigmatic, cool (in both senses of the word) and a little bit sexy but by no means stereotypical and much the same could be said for most of the rest cast. I would have liked to have learnt a bit more about her past and I have to admit that I was hoping for some sexytimes to spice up the interplay between the characters. I know, I know! That makes me a bad person, a shallow MCP and no better than a slavering animal. I must admit, though that I got the distinct feeling that Baker almost felt like adding a bit of naughtiness but decided that it would be crass. Score: Baker one, Me nil.One danger with military porn is that, unless the author is a recent member of the armed forces, there will be techno-howlers to negotiate. I have some experience of military matters, occasionally spot these slips and find them distracting. While Juggernaut is by no means perfect in this respect**), it is actually quite convincing. In fact, Baker's description of the Baghdad suburbs and of the Iraqi desert was also persuasive, redolent even (I will point out that I have not been there so I'm taking him on trust!)In the end, I had a lot of fun with this book and, overlooking its occasional shortcomings was sufficiently taken by it that I have added Outpost to my \"To Read\" list.I'm hovering between a 3 star rating (\"It's OK\") which seems most appropriate but doessn't quite do it justice and a 4 star (\"I like it\") so I've given it the benefit of the doubt and plumped for four. In either case... reccomended.* \"Bare rooms. No plumbing. No electricity. A couple of beds. Some cushions and rugs. A back room. Scattered shoes. Broken tea glasses. An old black bloodstain on the carpet.

A group of mercenary soldiers, led by Lucy Whyte, hear of a rumour that millions of pounds worth of gold have been left abandoned at an old temple in the middle of the Western Desert. Realising that they\u2019re not getting any younger and their time to make \u2018the big deal\u2019 is running out, the mercenaries plan to make their fortune and hire helicopters, go in and fetch the gold out in a couple of hours. They arrange the escape of Jabril Jamadi, a Republican Guard and the sole survivor of the original abandoned convoy, who can show them the way to the temple. There are all sorts of rumours for the demise of the initial Guard group, but all seems quiet and deserted upon their arrival.Unbeknown to the soldiers, the crash-landing of a Russian space satellite years ago, Spektr, has led to the dispersal of an active bio-weapon, and it is this that causes the creation of the zombies. Our \u2018heroes\u2019 arrival cause the reawakening of the lost legion and much of the book is spent dealing with these infected soldiers and trying to escape, whilst also avoiding the CIA who have been searching for Spektr for years.This is a no-nonsense, straight-forward thriller tale, admittedly with added zombies. The action scenes are thrillingly done, with enough bone-crunching, biting and beheading to satisfy most gore-fans. Adam manages to make this un-, which is impressive considering the limited number of living cast and the number of zombie encounters they have to endure.Its style is very straight-forward, though clearly knowledgeable, and its tale told in a very matter-of fact manner. Sentences are short, yet the action fast. As a result, the characters do not spend too much time contemplating their navel, and consequently can read as typical stereotypes: the hard-nut mercenary, world-weary and emotionally detached, yet doing their difficult job as professionally as they can, the faceless evil corporation determined to keep things secret, the ancient torturer determined to atone for previous sins. This allows the focus to be on the action sequences, which it does in spades.In the end it\u2019s basically Three Kings meets The Walking Dead, with enough intelligence and panache to make what could\u2019ve been predictable a great page turner. For a second novel, it\u2019s quite impressive."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5108317-mark", "userReview": "Now that was quite a ride.

Both of them want to get their hands on a mysterious but deadly bio-weapon stashed away with the gold.

Intrigue and treachery, an infected Republican Army brigade that just won't stay dead, an alien plague, ancient ruins, and a handful of mercs standing between the rest of us and disaster, all add up to an action-packed story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Juggernaut is Baker's second novel, a worthy follow up (and nominal prequel) to Outpost but with the pace and tension ramped up to provide a frenzied mayhem. The writing captures the tensions and paranoia of life in post-war Iraq, conveys the weary cynicism of the brutal truth behind the headlines of occupation, and then transfers the brutality into a desert storm of undead ferocity that guarantees a thrilling page-turner of a novel.Simply put, this a cracking novel that grabs with all the single-minded purpose of an infected soldier, but when this story bites, you won't mind at all.Mark Cantrell,Author of CITIZEN ZERO."}, {"userName": "Amy Lignor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6259268-amy-lignor", "userReview": "All the undead fans unite! Although that probably will never make a great billboard (unless it\u2019s for the TNT show), this is one book that will bring in fans from almost every genre. Suspense, mystery, action, paranormal (I\u2019d probably rule out Austen romance fans), but Adam Baker definitely overwhelms the rest.The dictionary tells us that juggernaut is \u201can overwhelming, advancing force that crushes everything in its path.\u201d For this review, that definition is right on the money. Rife with war, violence, science-fiction and just plain horror, Juggernaut lets even more readers delve deeper into the parasite/virus that was cleverly written about in, Outpost. Lucy, the main character, is still at the \u2018head of the class\u2019 as the leader of a group of soldiers who work for the highest bidder. The location is something all are familiar with - war torn Iraq. Suffice to say, after all the incredible workload and strain they\u2019ve been under, early retirement is a definite goal. And to be fabulously rich on Saddam\u2019s gold that was already promised to them, makes this goal even more fun to finally have come to pass. Sadly, things do not go as planned. Along with the mercenaries come a gallery of spooks, who are the zombie soldiers; undead machines that are also on the hunt for a convoy that contains much of Saddam\u2019s gold. Heading to the place where the convoy was last seen, both groups seem to arrive together and find themselves caught in a ruthless battle to see who will come away the winner. The author is so very good at what he does that as a reviewer - with every ounce of action being placed on every page - it is hard to reveal any \u2018moments\u2019 of unparalleled success or defeat because readers and fans would be highly disappointed to learn everything ahead of time. For those who loved Outpost; for those who are simply happy that the \u2018vampire\u2019 reign has come to an end, it is a huge recommendation to alert you to delve into these books full force and disappear into a world you will not believe. Zombies are front and center, along with a lot of blood and gore. A great night time read for all who have the courage - this is a great recurring puzzle!"}, {"userName": "Tina Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3596740-tina-taylor", "userReview": "Set 5 years before Outpost I wondered if this was going to be a prequel and lead us to Outpost but it can be read as a stand-alone book (as there are no common characters unless you count the zombies). A very good one at that, although it gives some clues as to the origins of the outbreak in The first book. Adam Baker does what he does best, takes time to build the scenario before the real action begins. A group of mercenaries go into the Iraqi desert in search of Saddam's gold, they're done being guns for hire and want a big paycheck so they can give up the life and grow old, period. You just wonder when he's going to introduce the zombies and when he does its slowly at first but quickly all hell breaks loose and it's a fight for survival not just from zombies but each other. I enjoyed this, maybe not as much as Outpost but it's probably more to do with me than the book. I read it quickly although felt bogged down at times, again, I think that was me. The female lead is strong, she's head of the group, and kick-ass but being a mercenary she pretty much has to be. I think this is why I preferred the first book. They were civilians, stranded, no real weapons etc whereas these guys are prepared. Okay, prepared for hostiles of the human variety not zombies but still it was more action and military tech than the desperation of Outpost, I cared more for those characters than these ones, don't shoot me for saying that! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this, I'm no book reviewer, I don't get paid to read books (I wish) it's just my personal preference, I don't usually go for military action books so I guess that's probably why I found it less enjoyable but I'd still recommend it. The bad guy is a right evil b*stard, pulling strings from behind the scenes, and through him we find out more about this virus and possibly how 5 years later the outbreak began. Needless to say i'll be waiting to see what Mr Baker releases next, whatever it is i'll read it but I do hope he continues in his zombietastic tales."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Lee", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5829964-jennifer-lee", "userReview": "I didn't like this as much as I liked Outpost, that's not saying I didn't like it, because I did.

The characters in this story were more fleshed out than Outpost, and the action was great. The only reason I didn't like it as much was the military (or mercenary) theme it had.I mean take some of this:\nand add some of this:\nand it's bound to be a great edge of your seat creepy fest!You learn quite a bit more about the mutant/alien/virus thinger in this one, which is great, and like I said that action scenes (albeit how ridiculous some are) are amazing.

But he delivers again. This time, proving once more that he's that rarest of rare supernatural horror novelists, the kind that not only creates strong characters, writes well, has a distinct voice and narrative style and most of all, knows how to set up, build upto and deliver blockbuster action sequences. To sum it up: Baker out-Hollywoods Hollywood. He doesn't just write like a screenplay writer: he puts flesh and bones and a living breathing zombie corpse, complete with glowering eyes and a ragged scorching breath into the script. His ability to stage and pull off action sequences on the page is Hollywood. The unique way of looking at stuff, people, ideas, is his own. This is 3D action horror at its best.

Rumors swirl. The fog of war reaches everywhere. Rumor of abandoned Iraqi gold out in the desert leads seven mercenaries into the deep desert. Tons of Saddam\u2019s gold, greed, betrayal, and an army that won\u2019t stay dead. Escaping the desert and the web of intrigue being drawn tight around them may be more than the seven of them can survive.Genre:fiction, zombies, militaria, horrorWhy this book:The blurb referred to this book as being Three Kings meets The Walking Dead. I was in.This Story is About:courage, working hard, doing the right thing, duty, hard times, pragmatism in the face of horror and disasterFavorite Character:I like the core group of Lucy\u2019s mercenary family, hard bitten(ha) assholes, the lot of them, even though, they act like idiots who have never seen a zombie movie in their entire life.Least Favorite Character: Koell is the by-the-book black ops asset who will end up letting an apocalypse run free across the world while trying to make a profit for himself and feed his ambition.Gaunt who in the face of an army of reanimate creatures follows through with his orders from The Company to betray his fellow travellers, even though that will leave him on his own to face the Republican Guard zombies and try to escape.Character I Most Identified With:Jabril, who leads the mercenaries into the enclave in the deep desert; them for gold, him to make sure that the evil that he has seen in the desert doesn\u2019t have a chance to escape back into the world, this despite the evil that he did earlier in life as a member of Saddam\u2019s secret police. Jabril is a complex character.The Feel:The story feels too open. I wanted close and claustrophobic in the ancient ruined city and temple where Saddam\u2019s Republican Guard hid the gold and the virus containers.Favorite Scene:Love the train scene that opens the story.Settings:Runaway train in the deserts of Iraq; Baghdad; Abu Ghraib; the deep desert; the temple city;Pacing:Really like the short chapters. They move the action along.Plot Holes/Out of Character:Gaunt is a Swiss army knife character. West Point graduate, 2nd Lieutenant when he arrives in Iraq, leads a door knock crew searching for insurgents, wet behind the ears. And when next you see him, he is washed out because of something he took part in in the past, but he is also running a small two chopper private airlift company on the Baghdad airport apron. So, West Pointer, 2nd Looey to washed up, mercenary chopper pilot...and he has the skills to find a trip wire between two ancient columns in the desert during a sandstorm...and he can drive a diesel electric locomotive. He\u2019s a bit much to take, too deus ex machina.Last Page Sound:Sigh.Author Assessment:There\u2019s a feel that there is something missing. Can\u2019t put my finger on it. Like when mashed potatoes don\u2019t have enough of something in them.Editorial Assessment:See above.Did the Book Cover Reflect the Story:Soldier standing face to face with the zombies Would have been better served with the train being the juggernaut instead of the oncoming horde. The train with a zombie horde following behind it or overrunning it would have made an awesome cover image for this story.Song the Story Reminds me of or That Plays in my Head While Reading:Renegade by Styx. There\u2019s a lot of the feeling that the \u201changman is coming down from the gallows and I don\u2019t have very long\u201d here.Hmm Moments:The intimation that the black hats in the dark shades walk around in the warzones looking for advantages and stuff that they can use for profit.Voss\u2019s pragmatism in the run up to the climax feels right, horrible, but right.Knee Jerk Reaction:meh!Disposition of Book:Irving Public Library, Irving, TXWhy isn\u2019t there a screenplay?How this isn\u2019t in the pipeline to be a movie is beyond me. Just on concept alone, this should be in the works, rapidly, while zombie fever is still strong. Could end up on Syfy easily.Casting call:Pauley Perrette could play Amanda, the hardnosed mercenary, California girl, ex-Meth-head who found absolution with a rifle in her hand and getting lost in mercenary ways.Gaunt could be Sam Rockwell. Almost washed up, ex-soldier, lost in a deadend, looking for a way up or a way out, wanting into the covert life and the invisible opportunities that lurk there.Jason Staitham could be Voss, South African mercenary expat ready for retirement, tired of the grind, fighting his last war..If they went the Syfy route, they could cast Debbie Gibson and Tiffany as Lucy and Amanda.Would recommend to:zombiophones"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164688-paul", "userReview": "They searched for GOLD. They found DEATH.Iraq, 2005 Seven mercenaries journey deep into the desert in search of Saddam\u2019s gold. They form an unlikely crew of battle-scarred privateers, killers and thieves, veterans of a dozen war zones, each of them anxious to make one last score before their luck runs out.They will soon find themselves marooned among ancient ruins, caught in a desperate battle for their lives, confronted by greed, betrayal, and an army that won\u2019t stay dead\u2026Outpost, Adam Baker\u2019s debut novel, was an unexpected highlight of last year. Creepy, action-packed, with a cast of memorable characters and a darker than dark story it most definitely earned its spot on my book of the year list. When my copy of Juggernaut arrived, I have to admit that my expectations were extremely high.Like its predecessor, Juggernaut features a strong female protagonist as its main character. Lucy leads the group of mercenaries from the front and she is just as tough as any of her male counterparts. She is ex Special Forces and her calm under pressure makes for an engrossing character. She doesn\u2019t panic, she doesn\u2019t flinch, and she just does whatever needs to be done. Like the lead character in Outpost, there is an inherent inner-strength that starts to shine through as the plot unfolds.The rest of the mercs are a rag tag group. My personal favourite was the South African team member, Voss, who has a habit blowing things up and chewing tobacco. I have to admit I kept picturing Jesse Ventura as Blain in Predator every time he appeared. My only minor disappointment was that Voss never delivered the line \u201cI ain\u2019t got time to bleed\u201d in a South African accent.The northwestern Iraqi desert is an ideal backdrop for this story. While war rages far to the south, the blistering heat, inhospitable terrain and desolate landscape creates a sense of isolation. This isn\u2019t just mercenaries against hordes of undead but also against their surroundings. As the action escalates and the odds of surviving reduce by the second there is a palpable air of desperation.I continue to be impressed by Baker\u2019s work and Juggernaut expertly showcases a rising talent in the genre. Be prepared for a tale featuring zombies of mass destruction that seamlessly blends together political intrigue with shockingly graphic body horror.Juggernaut functions as a prequel to Outpost and fills in some, but not all, of the intentional blanks that appeared in the first novel. The reader gets to learn at least a partial origin to the virus that is causing all the mayhem. There are also some insightful flashbacks that shed light on the shadowy government officials who are trying to control it. There are, however, still enough gaps and a tantalising epilogue that makes me think there may be at least one more novel to come. If not, I will be happy to start the campaign here and now that demands that Adam Baker writes one. Juggernaut and Outpost are both masterful works that I would recommend to any reader that enjoys absorbing horror. Mr. Baker is an author that has a flair for the apocalyptic and I\u2019m already looking forward to his next novel.I have my own mental checklist when it comes to zombie novels like this. I\u2019m looking for seemingly hopeless situations, futile gestures made by characters that know they are living on borrow time, small groups facing insurmountable odds and a climax that takes has you sat on the edge of your seat. The good news is that Juggernaut delivers all of this and more. Sure there are a plethora of zombie books out there but there is a world of difference between a zombie novel and a zombie novel done well. This falls firmly into the later category.Juggernaut is published by Hodder & Stoughton and is released on 16th February 2012. I urge you to seek it out, especially if you enjoyed Outpost, you will not be disappointed. In fact if you haven\u2019t read Outpost buy that as well and enjoy them both."}, {"userName": "David McDonald", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076543-david-mcdonald", "userReview": "After the brilliance of Baker's Outpost, I undertook to read Juggernaut as soon as possible; and found myself with an initial nagging doubt... as I started to read (and coupled with the outline of the plot from the blurb), I had a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in that the spectre of the characters and storyline of Predator, Outpost (movie, not the book!) and Three Kings would hang heavily over this book. Superficially, I would say that is an accurate comparison since Juggernaut starts out with a team of second rate/ over the hill mercenaries on one last mission, heading into Iraq to salvage Saddam's gold and then encounter a malevolent force that lies in wait for them. Therein, the comparison ends as Baker blew my doubts clear out of the water with his desert horror tale.Much like Outpost, Baker succeeds yet again in creating a wholly believable storyline and world for his survival horror prequel to Outpost to play out in. His characters are again complex, flawed and very individual. There are no square-jawed Gary Cooper type heroes in Juggernaut and every one of the characters has their own personal demons to deal with; in addition to the living hell that Baker drops them into. Additionally, Baker's villain of the piece is not only wonderfully hateful but also very realistic.Baker has chosen a desolate landscape to set the proceedings in, using the barren, hadean terrain of the Iraqi Western desert, as opposed to the frozen setting chosen for Outpost. Baker again conjures up set pieces that would require a large Hollywood budget and CGI to genuinely do any real justice to.The author pays attention to detail, rendering a greater degree of reality to his storytelling. My only real fear was that readers with less than a passing acquaintance with military gear may spend half their time looking up weapon specifications online but I believe that Baker's narrative negates the need for this.As the second in the series of books, with an intended third novel in the pipeline, Juggernaut succeeds where many sequels/ prequels fail; not only is it a natural companion piece to Outpost, developing the reader's understanding of the outbreak; it is also a solid stand-alone title that requires no knowledge of Outpost in order to understand or enjoy. Many sequels/prequels fail to satisfy both criteria set out above and instead act as a recap of the first novel and/ or act as a bridge to the gap to the final tale.I would submit to you that your appreciation of Juggernaut will be greatly enhanced if you have read Outpost prior to tackling Baker's second survival horror novel; but your enjoyment will not be diminished if you choose to go straight to this tale of mercs fighting zombies!"}, {"userName": "David Proffitt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14971670-david-proffitt", "userReview": "Although it is not unusual for a prequel to be come after the start of a series, it is not so common for them to come so close together or without demands from fans (such as Asimov\u2019s Foundation series). Not that reading the books in the wrong order makes are real difference as they are both self-contained, with no linking characters or plot, other than the pandemic\u2019s victims.What is it about zombies and vampires these days? The horror/fantasy/sci-fi section of book stores seem to be awash with them. I am not fan of zombie stories and am beginning to find them tedious and boring and generally avoid them. However, in Adam Baker\u2019s case I will make an exception. Yes, there are hordes of mindless zombies trying to eat and infect everyone they can get their hands on. And yes, the heroes have to fight them off and try to escape to safety. But in both Outpost and Juggernaut the stories are set in remote locations where the environment itself poses as much of a threat as the pandemic being unleashed.Set in the Iraqi desert in 2005, a group of mercenaries set out in search of a truck load of gold, only to find themselves in the middle of a covert operation that threatens not only their lives, but the whole population of planet earth. It was supposed to be one last adventure that would earn them the money to retire. But what Lucy and her team of mercenaries find in the remote Western Desert of Iraq leaves them fighting for their lives in a way they could is never have imagined. And it is not just the zombies they need to watch out for as there are other people involved who have agendas that do not rely on Lucy and her team getting out alive.Juggernaut is more of an action story with the zombies thrown in as a bonus. The characters are excellent and consistent and the story is exciting and well-paced. There is a lot of detail in the descriptions of the military hardware and it seems to accurately portray the middle east of 2005. There are numerous flashbacks to events leading up to the central story with allows the reader to piece together the background to the characters and the plot. Adam Baker is an excellent story teller. The pace of the book remains constant throughout and although not quite as good as his first, it kept me enthraller right to the end, with plenty of twists and an unexpected end. The only disappointing think about the book was that I don\u2019t yet have the next to read.

I unfortunately am reading these books in reverse order having first picked up 'Terminus' from the library and not realising it was the third and then coming upon this one which is the second. Luckily- although they are nominally sequels in a trilogy- they do not share characters or location so one can treat them as separate entities- they are set in the same universe in time sequence but that is all.This is great thriller writing beyond doubt. It reads very fast in short clipped paragraphs and breathless sentences (which often aren\u2019t grammatical sentences at all), the overall effect is filmic- one can learn a lot from this style of prose- this is the way to write a page-turner.The plot is highly compact (after a flash-forward and a false start involving a fire fight), largely unfolding over 2 days in a great location (a ruined temple in the deserts of Iraq). There isn\u2019t a great deal of characterisation but they are all well differentiated even if you don\u2019t feel much for them.One does have to suspend considerable disbelief but that will always go with the territory in a zombie book I suppose. The sense of silliness is largely kept at bay by the non-stop action. I loved all the logistic problems that are set up which leads the characters into exploring every inch of the fantastic location.
