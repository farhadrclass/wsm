I \"encourage\" all my friends to read them and even managed to trick my entire romance group into doing a buddy read of an especially terrible one (spoiler alert: everyone hated it). Bodice rippers have a bad reputation. When people think \"bodice ripper,\" they tend to picture a Technicolor book cover featuring a buxom women swooning in the arms of a shirtless hunk and a plot that contains more cheese than the state of Wisconsin. The book I tricked my romance group into reading certainly fell under that category. But while some of them are awful, there are some genuinely good ones that are either extraordinarily well-researched or else so cracktastic that the anachronisms and politically incorrect terms become, if not amusing then morbidly fascinating. (I encourage anyone interested in exploring bodice rippers for themselves to check out my bodice ripper shelf on Goodreads. Anything 3+ stars is v. good(!), and yes, I do try to discuss trigger warnings.)The Eden series falls into both the well-researched and the cracktastic camp, which makes them extra special. The series is being rereleased for Kindle (books 1 & 2 are currently free if you have Kindle Unlimited), and Netgalley recently approved me for a copy of book 3 in the series, THE EDEN PASSION. Once I stopped screaming with excitement, I immediately picked up my ***hard cover editions*** of the first two books to binge through. The first book, THIS OTHER EDEN, is more of a traditional bodice ripper, with the hero and heroine coming to blows (literally - and it involves a public whipping) and going through about sixty different kinds of hell, before reuniting in what is more of a satisfactory ending than a truly happy one. It had its flaws, but I loved the detail and the fact that all of the characters are morally grey.The second book, THE PRINCE OF EDEN, is a family saga - which were quite popular in the 80s, and often turned into the more \"unisex\" version of bodice rippers. THE PRINCE OF EDEN is about the children of Marianne and Thomas, the main couple in the first book. This book is set several decades later. Thomas is dead, Marianne is an old woman, and their two sons are middle-aged. Edward is a bastard, because despite having the same parents as his brother, he was born before his parents were married due to a technicality (read: marriage!pranks). Out of guilt, Thomas Eden bequeathed to Edward the entire Eden family fortune, as well as the estate. The legitimate son, James, received the title - and that's it. Everything he has is dependent on his brother's good will.Obviously, there is bad blood about this, and James and his sinister and incestuous servants, the Cranfords (read: Lannisters) are planning a lawsuit with the help of the family lawyer, Sir Claudius. All of them want the Eden money for themselves, and it fills them with Impotent Victorian Rage\u2122 that Edward is going out to the slums of London and using the money to help poor orphans and prostitutes. Edward is an idealist, and, despite seeing the darker side of humanity on a daily basis, painfully naive, cushioned by the wealth and privilege that he takes for granted and gives away freely. When that reality touches him personally with tragedy, he turns to opium for solace, and ends up having an affair with his brother's bride-to-be, Harriet Powels.There isn't really much in the way of plot in this book, apart from the will-they, won't they matter of the lawsuit. But this book is peopled with such a broad spectrum of intriguing characters that I really didn't care. The Cranfords were so sinister and conniving. James is weak and spineless, but has occasional moments of kindness. Edward wants so desperately to do the right thing but constantly reverts to the sins of the father. Marilyn Harris is really good at making you feel things about her characters, and when bad things happen to them, it hurts. THE PRINCE OF EDEN wasn't as crazy as its prequel, but there were still a few bits of OTT that surfaced, such as baby torture, a woman who \"gets off\" by riding her horse without underclothes, Mr. and Mrs. Incest, Bad Things Happening in Prisons, and of course, a gritty portrayal of drug addiction, withdrawal, and relapse.I would have given this five full stars if the ending hadn't disappointed me. I was ready to pump my fist in triumph, but Marilyn Harris yanked away my joy before my outstretched fingers had scarcely brushed it. I can't forgive her for that. I'm a very petty individual, and thieves of joy are the absolute worst criminals in the literary cannon. This is a well known fact.Apart from that, the Eden series is amazing, and it's on Kindle, so please, please read these books, and tag me in your reviews so I can stalk your updates, because everyone knows that watching your friends read your favorite books is the next-best thing to reading them yourself. :-)I CAN'T WAIT TO READ BOOK 3! 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2846441-karla", "userReview": "Marilyn Harris continues to amaze me with her ability to weave a compelling story with a cast of very flawed characters. I know it's clich\u00e9d to use words like \"enthrall\" etc., but really, that's how I can best describe it. This second novel in the Eden series is very different from the first in structure, but I enjoyed it just as much.Opening over 35 years after This Other Eden ends, the reader is tossed into the mid-life of Edward Eden, first-born and illegitimate son of Thomas Eden and Marianne Locke. His parents did an awkward Solomon split of the Eden Legacy: Edward got the money and land, and James - the younger, legitimate brother - got the title of Lord Eden. He is not at all happy with the situation, an attitude that has been shaped and fostered by the conniving Sophia Cranford, head housekeeper, and her brother Caleb. Youngest Eden child Jennifer is also a creation of the Cranfords, and the entire Eden family has plenty of misery and tragedy in store for them.Whereas This Other Eden was a dark romance with one character ruthlessly pursuing a goal and the plot was kept very linear, The Prince of Eden sprawled more in scope. It is really more of a family saga type novel -- but what a family, and what characters. Edward Eden holds it all together, as he makes a tremendous journey from rich and reckless wastrel who brawls so he can get tossed into Newgate for a night for fun, to a man cast into the depths of existence from opium and lost loves, to a man deeply-conscious of the world and his obligation and desire to help those poorer around him while creating a new Eden legacy from his own sweat and labor.It's impossible to distill it down to a pithy sentence or paragraph and do it justice. There is so much in this book. The early Victorian era really comes to life here, and the way the story is told has a very retro Victorian flavor to it: a man's life and influence, a vivid cast of secondary characters, melodramatic tragedies and devices, the scenery and atmosphere of both rural and urban England, the author's unflinching hand at crafting misery, etc. It was a book that I couldn't bear to continue reading because it was so dark and gloomy and tragic, but I couldn't stop reading because the characters got under my skin and I had to see what fresh hell would happen next.And there is plenty of fresh hell. I never thought it got oppressive, but I love sweeping, gloomy tragedies (even though I sometimes read them from between my fingers in a crouched, defensive position). The happy ending in This Other Eden is wiped out early on with the fair heroine Marianne now a woman over 60, lost and heartsick at the death of her beloved Thomas, and totally incapable of running the castle and her children. It's tragic, but I liked seeing this flip side to the HEA, where a couple's all-consuming love with each other can turn their children into collateral damage. While Thomas and Marianne went vacationing in Europe year after year, the raising of their children was left to the servants (as was common), and the Cranfords have cultivated the Eden crop into very bitter little seeds. It's a crushing failure that Marianne has to live with the rest of her life.Special mention here for the character of Jane Locke, Marianne's half-sister and bane of her existence in Book 1. Here, Harris has turned her into a geriatric firecracker who is wholly sympathetic without losing the hard-nosed toughness that propelled the character in the first book. The author knows her characters and knows how to write them naturally, even if decades separate their appearances.I loved every bit of this book and didn't think there were any dull spots. The history was woven throughout, from King William IV's death to the construction of the Crystal Palace and Exposition in 1851. It has everything one could want in a family saga: birth, lust, death, sacrifice, envy and greed, corruption, love, and a doozy of a moody cliffhanger that made me immediately grab for Book 3."}, {"userName": "Misfit", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375548-misfit", "userReview": "Edward Eden is the eldest son but unable to inherit the title since he's illegitimate, but instead his father Thomas left him everything else - the lands, the castle and all that money. Edward lives what appears to be a dissipated life in London, but to the poorer residents of London he's known as The Prince of Eden for all he's done to help them. Edward pours much of his great fortune into a Ragged School in his London home, much to the ire of younger brother James who would like nothing better than to wrest away the money he feels rightfully belongs to him. At Eden castle, Edward's mother is now a lonely widow, estranged from her children and paying a very high price for loving her husband too much and leaving them to be raised by the conniving (and incestuous!) Cranford siblings.Upon the death of a very dear friend, a grief-stricken Edward accepts a carriage ride from a stranger, along with the offer to drown his sorrows in a bottle of opium and well...another opium eater is born.\"Laudanum,\" De Quincey said softly. \"The only passage a man needs to get from here to Heaven. Will you be so kind as to accompany me, Mr. Eden?\"During a visit to Eden Castle, Edward falls hard for his brother's betrothed, Harriet Powels, and they spend an afternoon of passion in the glen (which brings unforeseen consequences on future generations). Harriet knows her duty, and that is a duty that breaks Edward's heart and sends him back to the opium dens.\"Five days and nights of tranquil oblivion, floating out of touch with reality on the wings of opium, had been sufficient to dull the memory of what he had found in the dungeon cell of Newgate. It had not been enough to obliterate it. He doubted if there was enough opium in all of India to accomplish that.\"That is a very bare bones summary of the beginning of this book and you don't want to know more before going in, just kick back and enjoy the ride because it is a seriously bumpy one. There are unexpected twists and turns on every page with treacherous servants, thieving lawyers, opium dens, a night in Newgate prison, a secret birth, a missing infant, all heavily peppered with appearances from real historical characters and events (even the Bront\u00ebs). Top that off with some of the most heartbreaking scenes I've come across in a long, long time, and you've got a perfect recipe for an unputdownable book. I warn you - do not read the last 100 or so pages on a plane, train, bus or in any other public place - you will need that box of tissue handy. I haven't cried like that since you-know-who died in Penman's The Reckoning. I am still sucker punched 24 hours later and no idea when I'll recover from it.Fans of big old family sagas with plenty of angst and drama should feel right at home. Those readers liking their fiction on the lighter side with sugar coated heroes and heroines getting that picture perfect HEA should look elsewhere.

Have no idea how to review this...After some thought:I thought I could let things sit for a few days before I tackled a review, but any kind of coherent thoughts refuse to form. So it'll be slightly messy and without bunnies like the first book.One of the best books I've ever read. So different from the first, which had some rather ludicrous moments interlaced with the gloomy doomy death and carnage. This one was all seriousness, and a long, dense seriousness it was! So many times I wondered aloud, \"How much more shit can these poor people take? What else CAN there be?\" And oh yes, there was always more to endure.I can't tell if Marilyn Harris hates her characters or loves them. They're all seriously flawed, and in a way that makes them \"perfect\" human beings. If someone can make a Poor Life Decision, Harriet makes it. Or did she make the best one? Was Edward perhaps better off? We'll never know, but we can guess.Perhaps the most brutal facesmack that Harris delivered to us, the emotionally involved reader, was how close characters came to happiness over and over again, only to have it yanked away. Simultaneously I was on the verge of tears for these characters and total incredulity that Harris actually went there and did that. No one is spared from agony in this book. No one.And although the book ends on somewhat of a high note, there is much dread and foreboding of the young John Murrey Eden. Because 2 generations of Eden men have messed up the lives of those around them. Why should this boy be any different?After this incredibly draining read, I need a breather with lots of fluffiness and bunnage before tackling Book 3.Ah, better."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1632609-anna", "userReview": "Wow.

The latter is a claustrophobic gothic-style romance. It has very few characters & centers around three points of interest (foremost being Eden Castle & its grounds). Despite a gut-wrenching web of plots & counterplots, there is a HEA -- though it comes with great consequence, the aspects of which are known to the reader more than the characters....Or so the reader assumes.PRINCE OF EDEN has a few gothic elements, but it's primarily a Victorian-style novel of sensation. There is a nominal protagonist -- Edward Eden, the bastard infant from Book 1, who is now grown to adulthood -- but this is a book that uses the protagonist as a folcrum for the other major characters, & those characters range from Newgate to London opium slums to Eden Castle to Shropshire to Roe Head School (attention Charlotte Bronte fans, watch for her cameo :)) to bitchy innkeepers across the way. Edward's own story affects all these people in a significant fashion. But like a Collins or Dickens novel, the ways he affects them aren't made clear to the characters. Harris frequently watches from a safe distance as her creations bumble around in the bleary fog of fate.The quickest way to describe this book is \"flip-side to HEA.\" The reader knows Marianne's happiness in THIS OTHER EDEN must come with a price...and that price is THE PRINCE OF EDEN. Our hero is a lovable scamp. He's tender-hearted for the scum of the streets & generous with his friends, yet he has no concept of his blessed position in life. He's a bastard with little social standing, yet he holds the purse-strings & property of his long-standing family -- a footnote of Thomas Eden's guilt that allows him to do whatever he wants, even if what he wants has unintended consequences. (Very like his father, is Edward Eden.) He loves his mother. He tries to be kind to his brother. He encourages his sister to marry their childhood friend. He rescues hookers from Newgate. He funds Ragged Schools for orphans.But if Edward has a major flaw (besides that pesky opium addiction :P), it's too big a heart. He gives & gives until it causes a rift with his son, a haughty young lad who can't understand his father's passive approach to money. Such vehement charity also frightens his weak-willed brother James, who inherits nothing but the title \"Lord Eden.\" James, for his part, is a supremely unlikable character...but it's not all his fault. Anyone in his position would resent such dependence. He has the will to be a Lordly-Lord-o-Doom, but not the spine; even his most token rebellions (e.g., attacking a servant girl) are pushed aside by the aging Marianne, a heroine who has grown tragically soft in her years of pampering as Lady Eden. Here, then, is another price of the HEA in Book 1 -- Marianne's fiery independence has been slowly eaten away by passive acceptance. The most she can do is be certain James marries a woman of wealth & respectibility, & that unfortunate young lady is Harriet Powels. Harriet is an unusual heroine in that she's sympathetic but not entirely likable. How much of this book's tragedy could have been prevented if she'd swallowed her pride & run away with Edward like they originally schemed? The book offers no answers. There are several other memorable characters floating around this sprawling plot: the incestuous Cranford siblings, Marianne's elderly sister Jane, Edward's bipolar sister Jennifer, the poncy solicitor Sir Claudius, the rescued harlot Elizabeth, the gentle giant Daniel Spade (another flipside from THIS OTHER EDEN, in that his father was Thomas Eden's enforcer & the man who whipped Marianne's back to shreds), the loyal coachman John Murrey...and of course John Murrey Eden, the blooded fruit of Edward's bastardy. It's with sad finality that the book closes around John Murrey Eden instead of his father Edward...but a fitting prologue to the next three books, or so I'm told. ;)As with all of Harris' earlier work, the writing is superb. I did think this one dragged a little in the London sections...but I'm wondering if that's because I was expecting a THIS OTHER EDEN clone of claustrophobic gothicness. Don't expect that here. Instead look for a tribute to elegant sensation novels -- with cameos from Bronte & Dickens, no less -- and a tangle of family drama. There are no easy answers to the problems posed in this book, nor should there be. Easy answers make for boring stories. ;)Recommended for those who enjoy epic historical doorstoppers & (sometimes) overwrought drama. This book contains incest, violence, & much tragedy that is just barely offset by (very) brief snatches of mellow happiness -- no HEA here. If any of these caveats offend your tender sensibilities, either bring your big-girl panties or avoid it altogether."}, {"userName": "Mermarie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8250586-mermarie", "userReview": "[Thankfully, half through the book, I stopped marking specific quotes and admirable points, as there's no logical way to highlight the greatest aspects of it; unless, I want to simply distract myself by picking it apart, bit by bit, instead of the entirety of it all together. I won't delude myself by believing that some parts outshine the others, because that just isn't true. This book is overflowing, brimming and frothy with history -- and immersive story. Harris truly puts, 'every line must be magic and as great as possible' in her diet, and doesn't relent till the very last page; where I felt the urge to immediately open the next book in the series.The novel is based on the Prince of Eden, Edward Eden, the bastard son of Marianne Locke and Lord Thomas Eden from This Other Eden. Due to his illegitimacy, Thomas Eden bestowed the wealth/land unto Edward, and James was given the title. Obviously this would cause great strife between a household so deeply afflicted by parents who take lavish vacations and set the housekeepers to raising their children. Unfortunately, the children were raised by housekeepers, the Cranford's, who were siblings, and secret lovers, with a penchant towards twisted religious zealotry, which they inflicted on the children (specifically Jennifer) from childhood. Jennifer seemingly remains within that state of underdeveloped emotion throughout her life, and pointedly blames her mother for everything. Of course, through the careful guidance and brainwashing of Sophia Cranford. Sophia took great measures to ensure Jennifer was completely dependent on her for damn near everything, wouldn\u2019t dare leave those little girl brains at work, after a bout of childhood curiosity with the boys, and strapped her to a chair, where she drilled in sermons on sins of the flesh, and all that jargon. Because you sure wouldn\u2019t want Jennifer growing up like you, Sophia, would you, you old battleaxe!? Meanwhile, Harris still represents every character lifelike and realistic, and you never felt a moment of organ shrieking attentions drawn to their entrances or speeches. SO NATURAL!!! They\u2019re all so believable. Whilst the Crandford\u2019s busily coached Jennifer to their defenses, James was a weak-willed insufferable sort who meekly followed into their footsteps, being puppeteered by the two, in hopes of gleaning the Eden fortune from Edward\u2019s less than conservative use of it. In fact, he\u2019s a free spirit, snatching child prostitutes and orphans from the streets, to send off to his childhood friend Daniel Spade\u2019s Raggedy School; where forgotten children of society are educated, housed, and so forth. Being a bastard to society, with close-knit good influences such as William Pitch and Daniel Spade, and even Marianne\u2019s humble beginnings, Edward is thereby fleshed out, in my opinion. His love is plenty, his arms large enough to encompass the world! No one is really above Edward\u2019s love & affection, and I think such fulfilling life generally gets used up early on.\u201cHere, put your head on my lap. Let\u2019s close our eyes together.\u201d \u2013 he tells Elizabeth, a child prostitute with a mutilated hand who plays a huge role in the latter portion of the book. Edward\u2019s ties to people run deep, so deeply, and it seems as though everyone he loves tends to perish. The adulteress Charlotte, who knew only love through the hands of Edward, and died in Newgate after he had tried on several occasions to pay for her release. His bouts with depression lead to an opium addiction, which nearly cost him his life after weeks of opium den binges. Early in the book he loses William Pitch, a mentor and great friend, and Charlotte, therefore setting the opium addiction as a means of escapism.Edward\u2019s nature frequently permitted him to confuse \u201cimminent\u201d with \u201cnever\u201d.  Poor, sweet Edward, always out to save the world. Always late, running behind, disappearing into thin air. It's like he's got a premonition for a deadline for life, and he's striving to get a checklist complete.I wanted to respond to the cover's quote: He was a prince among men, a god among lovers. I\u2019ve read in a few reviews, that they couldn\u2019t begin to imagine where \u2018god among lovers\u2019 came from, well \u2013 did you read the love scene between Harriet(Edward\u2019s brother James\u2019s fianc\u00e9e)? It was likely the most idyllic and breathtaking love scene I\u2019ve ever read, and I\u2019ve read some pretty steamy smut, too. That entire scene was like Van Morrison\u2019s gypsy lyric, combined with the temperament of a Dave Matthew\u2019s Band sonnet. It just stripped me down to the core, itchy spots forever inserted beneath my epidermis\u2014and I felt the need to claw myself to the bone to appease, in order to read through it. The sexual roleplay and whatnot was extremely enduring, and I think I can speak freely, to say that every girl wished their first time was in a moorside glen surrounded by nature and beauty and an abundance of love!But Harriet's love had an expiration date, as Edward's life did: \u201cAhead of me is a lifetime of lies,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI can play the role, I really can,\u201d she exclaimed with grieved astonishment. \u201cI\u2019ll work my way through the years, obedient and docile, if only I can have a now, one perfect, honest now.\u201dYet you realize that Edward, who fell for Harriet within the first few moments of their personal exchange, that he has a propensity of believing anything is possible. You, as a reader, believe how beautiful life really is, by one who rejoices in such abandonment.\u201cHe wondered sadly how often that harsh word \u201cforbidden\u201d had been supplied to her instincts.\u201d Nevertheless, Harriet doesn\u2019t believe in such magic, and has resigned herself to duty to honor her parents\u2019 wishes.So yes, Edward was a god among lovers(He loved EVERYONE that deserved it?), as he need not claim them sexually to derive the same sensation. He held more women in this novel, than he sexored them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a regret so enormous as to encompass the world and everyone in it.Edward\u2019s life was full and fruitful, with its heavy supply of misery, albeit in the end\u2014he won where his real demons lie and his charitable acts were the foremost, and I considered it a fitting curtain call, therein. It would have been unbearable had Edward sparked out early on, unfinished and in such a wallow of misery. In the manner that Harriet dealt with her own offspring, I believe Edward was justified to quill his love for her, and his solitary lifestyle was not unbearable, all in all. I enjoyed this novel moreso than the first in the series, and I'm most eager to start the third installment!

After that, the story picked up and kept me reading. Things I liked about this story:How Harris made Edward's character so real, so flawed, so tortured and human. How it incorporated history into the story and gave you a real feel of what London was like during those times. How great all of the supporting characters in this book were so good.

He ends up getting addicted to laudanum in the novel.In the beginning of the book, Edward meets a girl at Newgate prison named Elizabeth. He\u2019d go there to bring the inmates treats and stuff. Elizabeth is a teenager, I think, and helps Edward and his friend run a school for poor kids. Edward and Elizabeth are never together romantically. Edwards younger bother James is not a bastard like Edward so James is to inherit the title and lands and all that. Harriet is to marry James and she and Edward begin an affair. She gets pregnant by Edward, no one but her parents and a nurse know. She\u2019s kept prisoner in her home until after the baby is born. It\u2019s born and given away.Coincidentally, Edward and Elizabeth are at an inn and they see the baby, and they don\u2019t know it\u2019s actually Edward\u2019s and Harriet\u2019s, being branded with the word \u2018bastard\u2019 by some man so they kidnap it and Edward raises the boy as his own.

Neither he nor Harriet know that he is her son. That\u2019s how that book ends. I think his mother Marianne, from the first book, dies in this one.MAJOR SPOILERS BELOWI started but never finished the third, though I still have it and the fourth, and I can already guess what\u2019s about to happen in the third one. It\u2019s looking like the teenage son is going to UNKNOWINGLY begin an incestious relationship with this own mother!! Remember, Harriet doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s her son, since he was taken from her at birth.This series is pure fiction, not romance. This book was boring. But I know with book three this series will take a disturbing turn. I rate it 3 stars/C.Here is the reading order for the series:\u2022This Other Eden\u2022The Prince of Eden\u2022The Eden Passion\u2022The Women of Eden\u2022Eden Rising\u2022American Eden\u2022Eden and Honor"}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4131782-elle", "userReview": "If you're looking for a little light reading, this is not for you. If you're looking for a romance, this is not for you (there is a five-page hookup that ends in predictable misery; that's it). If you are looking for a a heavy, depressing orgy of self-centered angst in all its varied manifestations, maybe you'll like this. It's, well-written, historically insightful, but unrelenting in its gloom. The only reason I may read on to the next book is that I kind of want to see Harriet take it in the teeth. Problem is, I don't really trust Harris to deliver a satisfying story after reading this--and the first book in the series This Other Eden was among my favorites.This sequel gets two stars because Harris wrote well and the book is historically authentic. But she never did get me to actually empathize with any of the wretched characters. Instead I wanted to strangle most of them because there were obvious ways out of their afflictions and they chose instead to wallow.Maybe it's me--other ratings were much nicer. But if I weren't so compulsive, I wouldn't have finished this. If I want to be depressed, I do not need a book to help me get there.Now here's my dilemma: I bought the whole series on the strength of the first book. Should I read on hoping that the next one will be as good as the first, or assume that the story just goes downhill from here and ship the rest of them off to Goodwill unread?ETA, just reread the blurb on the front cover: \"He was a prince among men and a god among lovers.\" HUH? I could get the prince among men bit, but as a lover... Exactly what happened in the book that would justify that?"}, {"userName": "Dendera", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33373863-dendera", "userReview": "Read in 2014. WOW! What a beautiful, yet sad and strange book? Why haven't I read this book before and why didn't I discover Marilyn Harris in the past??? This is my 1st read in the Eden series, & I have yet to find 'This Other Eden' which I have been searching all over for but to no avail. As I'm reading I realised the 1st book must have been very rich in descriptions & plots & the storyline itself. Reading the sequel first is usually confusing with any series, but somehow I was able to comprehend fully and put the pieces of the puzzle rather quickly. I think Marilyn has a unique skill in making her readers achieve this. I was definitely hooked from the first page! I absolutely know this book has acquired a special place in my heart and will always remain there!"}, {"userName": "Linda Rice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30295594-linda-rice", "userReview": "Took me longer to get through this one compared to book #1, but ready to read the next sequel."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864654-lisa", "userReview": "the prince of eden by marilyn harris (1978)"}, {"userName": "Anneceleste", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2507040-anneceleste", "userReview": "I liked the first book of the series.

I had my doubts as well, just from looking at the cover, as well as seeing what other books it was placed w/. It's historical fiction, w/ a little romance. Not romancy-gonna-make u puke! Main character is Edward Eden. Even very rich, wears the title of\" bastard\" throughout 18th century England. Very honest, kind hearted man whom helps set up schools/homes throughout London w/ his vast fortune. Of course, their must be a villain!
