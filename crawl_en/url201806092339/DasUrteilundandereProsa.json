We also find out the young man, Georg Bendemann, lives with his elderly father and is engaged to a girl from a rich family. It\u2019s not until the dialogue between father and son that something begins to feel amiss \u2013 it\u2019s like suddenly getting a whiff of an unknown scent coming from a place we can\u2019t pinpoint. It\u2019s unsettling, slightly disturbing, and forced my mind, which until that point had a fairly linear thought process, to take a leap. I felt like I had to take sides \u2013 is it the father who has lost his mind or is it the son? Even the last sentence of the story adds more to the uncertainty and I loved that about it.\"The Metamorphosis\" (Die Verwandlung) is my favorite story from the book. I could very well argue that this is a horror story because how can it not be? Can you imagine waking up as a human size bug one morning?Gregor Samsa\u2019s nightmare begins when he realizes his shocking change just as he wakes up to go to work. The cause of the metamorphosis is never explained but through plenty of detail the reader is introduced to Gregor\u2019s life following this amazing misfortune. Or is it not a misfortune after all? If you have read the story you might think I\u2019m slightly off (or more than slightly) but it is clear the whole family went through a metamorphosis. Perhaps Gregor, as the dutiful son and breadwinner got the short end of the stick; it is however just as captivating to see his family\u2019s reaction and the changes they go through as they adjust to their new life.Interestingly enough, both The Verdict and The Metamorphosis begin in the morning. I found this clearly defined frame of time to add a realistic tone to the story ahead.\u201cBug\u201d may not be the best term to describe Gregor\u2019s transformation. The edition I have refers to it as an \u201cinsect-like\u201d creature. We have a specific word for that in Romanian which perfectly fits Kafka\u2019s description.On a personal note \u2013 I\u2019ve had a couple of unfortunate encounters with bugs, the most recent one when I found one in my jacket pocket while taking a stroll through a park, not long after I finished reading this story. Maybe it was a reminder.In \"A Country Doctor\" (Ein Landarzt) the author present us with a moral dilemma told from the point of view of an elderly country doctor who is called away suddenly to the bedside of a patient. An unexpected help presents itself \u2013 a man with two horses, ready to replace the doctor\u2019s own horse that had died the night before. The doctors\u2019 housemaid, a young woman named Rosa, helps the man with the horses but it\u2019s clear the man can hardly wait for the doctor to leave so he can abuse the girl. The doctor doesn\u2019t want to leave Rosa behind but somehow the horses take the carriage away before he can get down and he can hear her screams as the man breaks down the door. From this moment on the story takes a fantastical turn \u2013 the horses become agents of evil, and the patient, a young boy, is dying of a terrible wound.Has this been just a wasted call? Did the bell, which rang in the night and whose voice the doctor always obeyed, lead him not to save a life but to lose two? Is this an allegory for something that happens in life? I found myself totally captured by the story and utterly immersed in the doctor\u2019s predicament.Some of the stories are quite short but not less powerful. \"Up in the Gallery\" (Auf der Galerie), which is something that brought to mind an \u201cif \u2013 but\u201d story (a term I just came up with), is a two page story that describes a scene at the circus. The urgency of the image presented is not less potent than a story sprawled across a dozen pages. It is the precision of every word and their capability to surge forward that create an emotion which cannot be explained easily. Not by me, at least.\"Before the Law\" (Vor dem Gesetz) is the story of a peasant trying to gain access to the law. The way is barred by a guardian who, every time the peasant tries to go in, comes up with clever excuses to delay him \u2013 from warnings to accepting bribes to other ways in which he shows his power. This goes on for years when, at last, the peasant asks the one question which prompts a revealing answer from the guardian. The end is abrupt, and while we don\u2019t find out why the peasant wanted to see justice done, it is, somehow, satisfying.\"Eleven Sons\" (Elf S\u00f6hne) is a father\u2019s description of his sons. It\u2019s a case of a man who is never satisfied \u2013 one son is clever but not good looking, another is very handsome but lacks courage, yet another is nearly perfect but for the fact that he travels through the world, self sufficient and content, ignoring his father\u2019s wish of starting a family, and the list goes on. Reading this story felt like watching a man who, no matter how many gifts is given in life still finds fault with all of them.In \"A Report to an Academy\" (Ein Bericht f\u00fcr eine Akademie), a man is called to recount his experience as a monkey in front of distinguished members of an unnamed academy. He launches into lengthy descriptions of what he calls \u201chis past life as a monkey\u201d, starting with allowing himself to be captured by people, then talking about how he finally learned to do whatever was necessary to please his captors. I find this story more than slightly ironic, as if Kafka was poking fun at the origins of the human species by claiming the man\u2019s life as a monkey ended but five years prior to this confession. Also, the amount of detail makes it hard not to believe the man \u2013 the story seems entirely plausible.At first glance, \"In The Penal Colony\" (In der Strafkolonie) is a story of an execution. A famous explorer is invited to witness the execution of a man whose offense is punished by death. But beneath this obvious story there\u2019s another layer, deeper and even more troubling than seeing a man being crushed to death by a man-made machine. It\u2019s the story of a belief, an absurd belief, and a man willing to go to great length to show his devotion to it. Aside from The Metamorphosis, this was the most disturbing story in this collection because there was no way I could have guessed the horrible turn it took. And I could also argue that this one as well is a great horror story.\"A Hunger Artist\" (Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler) is the story of a man who fasts for days while being exhibited like some kind of freak in a cage, while people come to watch him. The fasting goes on for forty days, a period of time set by his manager as being the maximum time people will take an interest in this curious form of art. Of course this brings to mind the famous \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d so prevalent these days. This could also be interpreted as a man choosing to display himself in front of others, risking their admiration, distrust and revulsion. It could also be a way of trying to get their attention by choosing to stand out from their midst, a person who\u2019s doing something others don\u2019t. I find the title very apt \u2013 aren\u2019t many artists after all courageous people who are willing to brave people\u2019s displeasure by displaying their art?I loved my first encounter with Kafka. He scared, delighted, and surprised me. He\u2019s fascinating, bold, and his attention to detail is worthy of the highest praise. I didn\u2019t know what to expect from his writing and I confess to reading next to nothing about his books because I like to start on a new author with a blank slate and form my opinion of them with as little influence as possible. I will, however, read more of his work in the future, although I confess I\u2019m a little uneasy (but also delighted and fascinated) by the prospect."}, {"userName": "Katja", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12506273-katja", "userReview": "\"Das Urteil\" - eine scheinbar groteske, surreale Erz\u00e4hlung, die wie ein R\u00e4tsel f\u00fcr jeden Leser subjektiv erfahren werden muss.

It contains five short stories: The Judgment. A Story; The Stoker. A Fragment (You will find out it's the first part of Amerika); The Bucket-Rider; In the Penal Colony; Great Noise; The First Chapter of \"Richard and Samuel\" by Max Brod and Franz Kafka and The Air Show at Brescia.I very much enjoyed reading them all but the ones I liked the most (besides In the Penal Colony) were The Judgment and Richard and Samuel which, as stated before, was written by Max Brod (Kafka's friend and responsible for showing the world Kafka's works -THANK YOU, MY LIFE WOULDN'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT FRANZ KAFKA). Sadly, this is the first and only chapter for Richard and Samuel.These next few lines may contain spoilers, depending on your standards.But let's talk about the story that I was really eager to read.When I visited the Franz Kafka Museum the animation (if we can call it so) they had for this short story consisted of a very small window. You would have to get very close to look inside and what you would see was someone's back getting slashed and the fresh wounds would form a word or sentence. For some reason I couldn't decipher it (I think the message was in Czech or German). So I decided to read the story!I had (as usual) high expectations for this one and I wasn't disappointed. I absolutely adore how Kafka writes about law (The Trial is one of my favorite books ever). It's absolutely brilliant, scary and, of course, Kafkaesque (there's not in this entire world a suitable synonym for that word).You will find out, while reading it, that the way the law operates inside the penal colony is definitely unfair, ridiculous, inhumane and unique (or at least I hope so!). So much so that the people who are condemned don't know how it operates. To aid the legal process, the penal colony has a machine who takes care of the sentence and the punishment. The officer, who takes great pride in the machine conceived by the old commandant, will give a exhaustive explanation on how it works. The reader eventually finds out that this officer is the only one that actually agrees, supports, and adores the infamous procedure. Fortunately, it seems that that legal system is ready to be completely revoked. But before that, Kafka shows us how \"the law is the law\" and it applies to the ones to make it as well. I have to admitted that I wan't not expecting that ending, but it definitely brought a smile to my face."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58022338-julia", "userReview": "Kafka ist kein Pessimist.
