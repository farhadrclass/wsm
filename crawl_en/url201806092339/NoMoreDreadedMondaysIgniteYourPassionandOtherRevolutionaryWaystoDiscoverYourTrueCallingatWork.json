That in the next 5 years 50% of the U.S. workforce will be employees and the other 50% will be contract workers, temp, outsourced, etc.2. It will be up to the individual to furnish their own - health insurance, 401k, dental insurance, etc.3. Generation X (1965-1981) people most likely seen their parents work for one company for 25 years and then lose their job (i.e. through buyout of the company, downsize, etc.).My thought:This book is very well done. In some ways it is similar to the \"4-Hour Work Week\", but better. I also heard Dan Miller on the Dave Ramsey Show and he said that the average work stay for Gen X person is 14 months. Change is on the way for the workforce, which can be kind of scary, but also great. So if you lose your job, you are suppose to look at as a new opportunity in life."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6399409-kayla", "userReview": "I have often heard Dave Ramsey tout Dan Miller (the author) as having written some great books. Well, here was one of his \u201cgreat books,\u201d expanded edition. (While this book has Scriptural references, I\u2019m not sure if the original, un-expanded version does or not.) I began reading it hesitantly\u2026 not sure what to expect. Not sure if I would like the book. And not sure if I would ever finish reading it.Fortunately, the first chapter broke some of those mental barriers I had. He doesn\u2019t promote a college education; he emphasizes determining what your passions and skills are and effectively using them to contribute to the marketplace. No need to be tied down to a 9-to-5 job sitting behind a computer, \u201cdreading Mondays,\u201d when you could be doing something you love. He addresses common concerns like \u201cWon\u2019t I lower my income if I do that?\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s too uncertain for me\u201d both directly and through examples. His examples aren\u2019t obscure ones either; he uses both everyday people he has interacted with as well as famous people, those we all recognize when we hear their names (like Thomas Edison).Another great thing about the book is the format variety. He has small \u201cRevolutionary Insight\u201d tidbits as well as quotes from a variety of people throughout the book. This breaks up the monotony; it\u2019s enjoyable to read because it is not simply 12 point Times New Roman text on a page.I had several qualms throughout the book though. As I read through it, the book as a whole focused on \u201cyou.\u201d What \u201cyou\u201d can do, how \u201cyou\u201d can succeed, steps \u201cyou\u201d can take to break out of \u201cyour\u201d mold. And this book is advertised as Christian? Yes, there are Christian cliches sprinkled throughout (\u201cAs a man thinketh in his heart, so is he\u201d and \u201cGod-given\u201d to name a couple), but the book it not overtly Christian. This bothered me. For example, in a sentence on page 74 talking about whether choosing not to have a victim, \u201clife happens to me\u201d mentality, Miller says, \u201cYou\u2019ll know you are in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d Another example on page 98 where he talks about changing your perspective on the situation so you can see new opportunities, he says, \u201cI choose to believe that everyone is out to bring me happiness and help me reach my goals.\u201d Whoa! A bit of egotism, selfishness, and just plain error in that sentence \u2013 man is sinful from birth, and no one is \u201cout to bring me happiness\u201d \u2013 each seeks his own (Rom. 3:10-12)!So, while I have benefited from this book in many ways, from his perspective about what a \u201cjob\u201d can look like to how to create a plan for developing a home business (as I begin to brainstorm about post-graduation home businesses and adoption fundraisers), I cannot recommend this book. It\u2019s too fluffy and \u201cme\u201d centered. I suppose most business books are that way (though I wouldn\u2019t know, since this is my first book to read in this category), but if that\u2019s the case, I guess I won\u2019t be reading much of that genre. It\u2019s not all about me or even about what I can accomplish for God. It\u2019s about what HE chooses to accomplish through me \u2013 the glorification of Himself."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2660919-lisa", "userReview": "This book is supposed to be about helping you start your own business doing something you love. It gets off to a slow start because the first half is all inspirational (You can do it! Don't be afraid to quit your job and follow your dreams!) rather than practical. Starting with chapter 7, he has some good, practical things to say. He discusses how business builds on other business, how different kinds of businesses grow in different ways, and how to tell which business types (freelance, franchising, licensing, etc.) fit your personality and comfort with risk. There are also stories and brain-storming exercises to help you come up with business ideas.If you've ever though about being self-employed or owning your own business, I'd suggest chapters 7 & 8 for practical advice, and chapters 9-11 for suggestions on overcoming the usual barriers to starting your own business. You can forget the rest, unless you really need some encouragement."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Young", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1602265-tiffany-young", "userReview": "If you're questioning your line of work, Dan Miller does a great job at giving you options for your future. In this book, he gives ideas for starting your own business or becoming a freelancer or contractor, but he doesn't ever tell you exactly what you should do. He makes it clear that everyone's answer to \"what should I do for a living?\" will be a little different depending on their wants, desires, skills and passions. There are plenty of ideas throughout the book for passion seekers to explore their ideas and at the end of each chapter their is a list of things you should have learned from the chapter and some questions to ask yourself. Miller also explains that while many people believe being an employee is the safest route, it, in fact, is not. Some of the reasons he gives is that many businesses are using cost-cutting measures to eliminate giving some of the benefits people are used to in a position, that many businesses are eliminating employee positions to save money and that if you lose your job you must replace 100 percent of your income, rather than losing one client of many, where you would only be losing a percentage of your profits. I think even those who are not thinking about leaving a job in the next year or so should look into this book and begin exploring ideas in the future about what measures they could take to rely less on their 9-to-5 job. I think it's a great career exploration book as well as get you thinking about alternate ideas and using your imagination to find a passionate career that is likely to bring in more money than what you are making working for someone else."}, {"userName": "Hoan", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1144058-hoan", "userReview": "This book is truly inspiring for anyone who wants to take the unconventional route in life.

I only live 23.8 miles from the office but still, there I was, between the hours of seven and nine AM, stuck in the daily northern Virginia rush hour. Fortunately, this is not my normal routine. About a year ago, my work environment changed such that I can work from home most days and only go into the office for meetings, appointments, and the occasional \u201cstir crazy\u201d day, when I\u2019m so out of my mind that it seems like it might be a good idea to drive in.Looking around at the stressed out masses of commuters reminded me all too well of how blessed I am and how many others out there need to improve their circumstances. Therein lies the rub. Most of us don\u2019t think we actually have the ability to affect our work situation. Too many of us believe it\u2019s out of our control and it\u2019s just something we have to deal with to get enough money to pay for all the pleasures of life. We punch in and out every day, putting in our work hours, hoping to make it to the weekend, where we can actually live. The trouble is, schedules are getting so full these days that the line between work and \u201clife.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. It can be better.As Dan Miller discusses in his reissued and updated book, No More Dreaded Mondays, we can take control over our employment. It\u2019s not only possible to improve your circumstances, it\u2019s essential to find the right work environment to suit your interests, goals, and passions. It starts with a change of perspective \u2013 from that of a victim to one who is empowered. Beyond that, change stems from understanding yourself and adapting each of your daily tasks to ensure you\u2019re performing meaningful work that enriches your life and aligns with who you want to be. Some of these changes may require drastic measures \u2013 quitting your job, starting your own business, or reworking your schedule \u2013 but the results are certain to inspire your very best and most fulfilling work.For all the benefits I enjoy by working from home a lot, I\u2019m still not at my ideal working environment. Working from home saves me on average 3 hours each day, but I still have a lot of work to do if I\u2019m going to break through the limitations placed on my full potential. The advice in this book (and others) is helping me take the next steps to shaping my career in the direction it should be going.-from trudatmusic.com/raw"}, {"userName": "Jasonlylescampbell", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156872-jasonlylescampbell", "userReview": "a friend suggested it ... in keeping with my theory \"while looking for work, read business books to stay fresh.\"I could almost give this book three stars even though I was annoyed with it much of the time ... it has a ton of the positive thinking feel and doesn't seem to be realistic at all with the possibility of failure and anything like the danger and messyness of striking out on your own. (That is what the book is all about, by the way ... a short, pop version of the changes in the work world and the shift toward subcontractor/free lance work and how that can be a good thing). Typical is statements like \"I believe the world is plotting to do me good.\" I don't follow such comments so well.BUT it challenge me to think about what kind of work I would love to do, be good at and fit my personal tendencies ... I really don't mind structure and working with a team, so striking out on my own as an independent doesn't necessarily sound good to me.

After reading this book, no one should have trouble finding the work to live a great life. He offers tons of examples of how others have done it, with simple ideas. He says that when we look closely around us and identify a need, we can create a business around it. But we're not going to get that done sitting on the couch watching reality TV or complaining.

After reading the first several chapters I certianly had a desire to leave my job and pursue my \"true calling\". So, to this extend it did the job. The only problem is that it doesn't account for the fact that most of us are surrounded by our spouse and children. To cut yourself off from your current job just because it isn't your \"calling\" neglects the concept of a struggling economy and a lack of realistic professions to match that \"calling\" in your head. Aside from what the book suggests, I would rather work the rest of my life in a dead end job that doesn't satisfy my dreams and ambitions so long as I am able to provide a stable environment for my family.
