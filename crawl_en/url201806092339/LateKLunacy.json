I very rarely stop reading a book, so that alone speaks volumes. While the opening is set in a dystopian future, this ecology-based fictional novel is set in the present and focusing on a professor encouraging a group of student to consider the damaging effects of climate change. There is also fracking starting in the local woods. I tried to keep reading it several times until I finally gave up.It was a chore to read right from the start due to the overabundance of descriptions and a preachy-lecturing tone to the narrative - all to the detriment of the plot. Everything is over-described, even minor characters. Early on I was muttering to myself, \"Just get on with the story.\" I can accept lecturing me when you also provide me with a compelling set of main characters in a well-paced plot. Then throw in some suspense and intrigue. Develop those compelling characters and establish more of the setting along the way.What didn't work: immediately lecturing the reader about your environmental concerns; setting the novel in an almost utopian small Ohio college town and providing all the history of this fictitious campus ; declaring a love for Millennials making everyone who is not one or all pro-Millennial bad; making the \"bad\" guys all stereotypical caricatures, either in descriptions of them (they are never looking good, or even okay) or in their speech patterns; making fun of areas of the country that you consider less intellectually developed than you.... I could go on but the gest of my point is that this reader gave up on Late-K Lunacy pretty early on because the writing wasn't worth the effort. (And it's not that I innately dislike environmental issues, college towns, and young adults - I live in a university town, am environmentally conscious, and have much-appreciated Millennials working for me.) Messages in novels are fine; almost all novels have some message in the plot, but make sure the actual quality of the writing can carry your message-laden plot.Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of the publisher/author through Library Thing\u2019s Early Reviewer Program."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62621904-lauren", "userReview": "This is a spoiler free review and will be updated after the books release Late K Lunacy is a beautifully descriptive book setting up the books world in a scarily realistic manner that blurs the lines between the books world and the real world.  The book is set in a university town, in a fictional pre- and post-apocalyptic environmental incident in the lead up to the mid-2030s. 15 years from now, which in nothing in the grand scheme of apocalyptic or foresight novels most are usually set 50+ years from publish. I found the book thought provoking as it makes you ask the yourself the questions will climate change, over fishing the oceans, devastating the rain forest or a global pandemic will finally push the world over the edge and cause irreversible change that we may not be able to recover from. I will be honest after reading the book I did a little research of my own and the facts are shocking and worth a look into. Ted Bernard challenges readers through a new vision of the future, a view that we could possibly learn from. It might not be world global warming that\u2019s pushes earth over the edge it might be the fracking, over fishing of the oceans or destroying the rain forests. It is worth a read for a new insight or to try a new book genre"}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1174931-david", "userReview": "I really wanted to love this book. The topic and theme are both timely and frighteningly parallel to my own view of mankind's future - that there is a tipping point out there that, once we get there, we will be unable to recover from. That said, I was hoping that this book would tell the stories of the characters after the collapse. The author spent much time discussing student activist groups, their meetings and subsequent activities. I realize that some background information is important to any story, but I waited and waited for the apocalypse and the aftermath and other than a brief mention of them at the beginning and a very spotty timeline at the end, not much was mentioned. What I enjoy most about PA fiction is reading about how the survivors adjusted to a new world order. There was very little of this in this book.For all that, the writing was well done and the topic was well researched. I just felt that there needed to be more development of the theme and a bit less emphasis on details of meetings and rallies. The author has a good thing going here if he would flesh out the post apocalyptic part of the story. This is a story that needs to be told because it could be reality. This one just doesn't quite get there."}, {"userName": "Tanysha Harry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51215994-tanysha-harry", "userReview": "An entertaining and engaging read. The blurb, however, does not accurately describe the actual content of the book.Focusing mainly on a group of University students fighting to prevent climate change and its related natural disasters and damage to the flora and fauna. Bernard writes in a manner that is vivid, compelling, and descriptive. All loose ends are satisfactorily tied up and you find yourself relating to all characters in one way or another. I definitely recommend this book to those who are interested in Dystopian fiction: this book however describing events prior to."}], "description": "Set in a mid-west American university town, fictional pre- and post-apocalyptic environmental events lead up to the mid-2030s. Will climate change, the breakdown of myriad systems, and a global pandemic take the world over the cliff? Complexity science lends frightening authenticity as the story unravels, while Bernard challenges readers through a new vision of tomorrow. \"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, opens with a dystopian portrait of a fictitious town dying from pesticides. Mocked by corporate agribusiness, her non-fiction best-seller, became the generative force for the modern environmental movement. Late-K Lunacy follows in this tradition with fiction, this time the threat to human and ecological life being a climate change-induced pandemic. It will frighten the complacent and arm climate justice advocates. Ted Bernard has an engaging and imaginative gift for ecology-based fiction.\" \u2014 H.
