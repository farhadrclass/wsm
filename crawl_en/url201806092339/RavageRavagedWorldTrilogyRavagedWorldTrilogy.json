There are a lot of them out there, and some very good ones. This makes it hard to avoid the cliches and stand out. Ravage, alas, does not stand out. The book starts well enough. Nick Adams heads off to work and encounters a strange, sick man. One things leads to another and the very next day he is running for his life as modern Britain crumbles beneath the weight of the infected, ravenous horde. By the end of the week, Nick and a small band of survivors end up holed up together in an old amusement park/petting zoo. It's about here that the story starts to sputter. Like most zombie stories, the real enemies are the survivors. The infected are a faceless, mindless menace lurking just over the horizon. A storm that needs to be prepared for and watched, but not necessarily a major factor (other than billions of dead and infected). The main villain is the ginger haired manager of the hotel who decides to seize the day and eliminate those who don't acknowledge his authority. He somehow forms an alliance with an ex-con and they start eliminating their enemies. It wasn't awful as a story line, it just wasn't that original. It's been done. Lots.If you are dealing with a traditional Zombie-apocalypse story-line, you need to have characters that stand out. Believable characters that you care about. I think that I honestly cared more for the Orangutan family at the zoo than I did for these characters. Nick basically kills his own (albeit infected) son, and fights off his (infected) wife, and somehow stoically soldiers on? WTF? There is no real gap for mourning. I'll be honest. If I was in his shoes, I would be a train-wreck and probably not resist when my wife took a bite out of my neck. All the characters seemed cardboard and formulaic. Two infected stars out of five. I was disappointed with the book. In the end I just wanted it over. Final analysis is that it was OK. Not great, but OK. Good for my creepy October reads, but I had really been hoping for something better. (On that note, a book that does stand-out by breaking the traditional zombie-apocalypse mold is The Girl With All the Gifts. Pick it up if you are in the mood for zombies.)"}, {"userName": "Emma Bannister", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10785595-emma-bannister", "userReview": "Only half way through and I really don't want to continue reading, which is a shame as I am a fan of IRW's other books. The writing and language is terrible. Everything is so correct 'do not, cannot, will not' that is seems so unrealistic as no body (apart from the queen of course) speaks like this. It's set out like a teenagers piece of coursework. For example the news broadcaster \"as I report these words to you, it may seem like some kind of sick joke\". Just seems to childish. It has the potential to be a good book and I'm probably being picky as to why I'm not finishing it, but this book really doesn't do it for me.

I went into it with high hopes. The author has quite a few books under his belt, and this title came with good reviews. I'm very fond of apocalyptic tales and I was looking forward to the read.What I liked about the book: Writing style is good. Very engaging. It could use another trip to an editor due to a few typos and grammar oddities, but nothing that can't be overlooked if one is enjoying the story.What I did not like about this book: There were too many things in the plot that did not make logical sense. I will try to explain this without wanton spoilers, but I will speak of some plot points, so stop reading if this concerns you.*********A few spoilers**************The plot is a basic zombie story without enough differences to make it stand out in a crowd. The plot itself is full of things that are nonsensical. For example, early on, the zombie of a small girl in pigtails manages somehow to attach herself to the windshield of a bus. It remains unclear in the narrative how she reached it or what she clung to. She also manages to completely block the drivers sight, despite being only one small girl. Then she beats at the window until cracks appear throughout the glass. Despite this damage to the windshield, rather than breaking, it pops out as a complete piece, manages to turn itself in mid air to avoid the driver, and lands harmlessly in the aisle. In the author's mind, perhaps this made sense, but he was not able to convey this with any believability. I almost put the book down at this point, but reviewers said that it picked up past the 1/3 mark, so I stuck with it.Another example of convenient but unbelievable plot device. The folks are holed up in a restaurant. There's lots of food in the freezer, but the power is already out, and the generator will only last two days. Weeks later, and they are still eating hamburger from the freezer. It's at least six weeks. There is talk amongst the characters of finding diesel fuel to put in the generator, but it isn't shown to happen. The characters are using candles and such and talking about the lack of power throughout the story. If the idea was that they refueled the generator only for the freezer, this is not made clear at all. It read as if they were eating rotten crap, and after weeks, it would be disgusting. But the characters don't describe it that way, only that they are tired of hamburger.Those are only two examples of many. Character decisions and the laws of probability and physics seemed to be for no better reason than to further the author's plot. This is a broken world, where tiny zombies can fly, unrefrigerated meat lasts for six weeks, Glass with a million cracks doesn't break, and men who fall hundreds of feet can survive to add conflict. What bothered me most was that the author could have justified all of these choices by taking the time to explain them, or by making more believable choices in the first place. If this author can get his plot to the level of his writing style, then I would enjoy his tales, instead of feeling cheated by them."}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16427962-patti", "userReview": "This was one damn fine book.Your basic zombies book, but with an actual REAL explanation to fast \"zombies.\" Starts out with a tragedy that no parent should ever go thru and ends with a slight chance at redemption.

From the first page the terror doesn\u2019t stop. And just like in the real world, it isn\u2019t just from the terror of being torn apart, but also by the people you meet along the way!I really enjoyed how Iain Rob Wright set this up. Three parts to the book. So in the first you meet Nick and read about his story, then Anna, and in the third all hell breaks loose! The plot was very well paced and terrifying. I can easily see this as a movie, especially since zombies pop out at you from no where. But I never felt like it was JUST for the scare factor. There was always a reason for something to pop out. And it was in times where I was getting tense but wasn\u2019t quite expecting it, brilliant!The characters were also very interesting. Although the only thing that threw me was how clueless Nick was. So, if you are a die hard zombie reading fan I would take this with a grain of salt. Sure the characters talk about scary movies and such, but never is it mentioned what to do in a zombie film. These people do not know what zombies are, and it\u2019s painfully obvious! I was yelling at multiple people when they were doing the stupidest things, but that is because I\u2019ve read and heard about zombies for years. These people have not. Paul nodded, rubbing at his hand and wincing. \u201cSounds good to me, governor. I\u2019m sure things will be better tomorrow.\u201d Nick huffed. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be any worse.\u201dEven with that though, the plot was fast paced, the characters were totally believable. There were parts that were heart wrenching and Iain does things that most horror authors seem afraid to do. He just dives right in and drags you along for the ride. And it\u2019s totally worth it.A little bit slow in the beginning, but again I think that is because I kept expecting Nick to know what was going on. Loved every word though. Very good read. Love this author. I am a new fan!!Some of my favorite quotes: Better to fake sanity than to accept insanity. Annaliese rubbed at her eyes and blinked. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve had three hours sleep in the last thirty-six hours and I\u2019m stuck in a low-budget horror movie, but I\u2019m ready.\u201d \u201cFine, let\u2019s just get moving, then. Quicker we find help, the quicker we can contact Kathryn\u2019s family and tell them you just tried to smash her brains in.\u201d \u201cIt was more like he was trying to bash them out to be honest,\u201d said Dash, giggling."}, {"userName": "Nev Murray", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21957544-nev-murray", "userReview": "This is Iain Rob Wright's first book in his series about a virus reeking havoc as it passes through the British population.I sort of ruined it for myself a bit by reading Savage first which I did as a beta read for Mr Wright so I knew some things that were obviously not going to happen to some people as they were in the later story. not telling who though so you won't know.The story starts in a mobile phone shop in a shopping center that is unusually quiet until a rather sick gentleman comes in. The manager Nick looks after him before closing up shop and going home to his wife and son. From here on in the virus spreads with a voracious speed. Within no time there are dead and undead everywhere. The rest of the story follows Nick as he meets up with others and they try to outwit the dead and struggle to survive.As normal with Iain Rob Wright he is a master at creating characters that you can believe in from the outset. Ravage does not disappoint with this either. Some of them you will love. Some of them you will hate. Some you just want to cuddle at times. Some you just want to poke in the eye with a big stick. Either way,they all come together beautifully to make this a very free flowing story that will have you gripped from page one. Read this and I guarantee you will want to read the rest in the series.No less than 5 stars again."}, {"userName": "Sharon Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17447035-sharon-kennedy", "userReview": "I found myself really enjoying this, and got irritated when I had to get off the bus!People are getting sick, then aggressive, then craving blood, and then attacking anyone they see. It's some kind of virus, and it's spreading fast.I really liked the pacing of this novel - the way it slowly built up, showing all the odd little incidents, until the story was racing along at breakneck speed. It demonstrated very clearly the way that society can either break down or pull together in the face of adversity - there was even a comment about the Lord of the Flies, and who was going to be Piggy - a reference which the younger members of the group didn't get. I also really liked the chapters at the end of the main story, which showed the progress of the virus, almost like a six degrees of separation for the zombie virus - how it had travelled from the Mediterranean, until it infected the family of Nick, the main character.Well written, well paced, and since it said To be continued, hopefully a sequel will not be far away."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17157847-andre", "userReview": "In a world where it seems that a new zombie novel staggers into existence on a daily bases it is hard to create something new and original. Iain Rob Wright is no stranger to horror cliches and actually seems to thrive on them rather than avoid them. A bad thing? No, it isn't.\u00a0 While he is not exactly creating something entirely new, he is very capable of creating something exciting and entertaining. 'Fear on every page' is his decree and fear on every page it is. No slow trains all stops here.

I knew the Author was working on it and was pleased as punch when he asked me to review it for him. Ravage starts out like most Zombie books. Characters living life, doing the daily grind. However, unlike normal days where the store is packed with people, business was slow, no it was quite literally dead. I really liked the build up to the story. In many ways it had a very Sean Of The Dead type feel to it. Yet, everything sort of just fell into place a bit to neatly. It does move the story along quickly but it would've been nice if Nick had seen more clues that things were souring before heading home. As with most Zombie books when the plague hits the survivors are standing around in disbelief. I can forgive this because it must be quite a shock. However, Nick's refusal to accept that people were indeed turning into Zombies made the character quite unlikable. My theory is if someone is trying to eat you whether it be family, friend, someone young or old, you do whatever it takes to survive. You don't sit around on your moral high horse demanding they be treated as equals. Nick's actions cause many deaths and it's quite frustrating to read about. Thankfully he does eventually accept reality. Too bad it comes a bit late to do any good. Midway through the books the story splits off and follows a second group of survivors. They do play a part in Nick's group being rescued so it wasn't all that surprising that the story caught you up on who they were. Personally, I found this second group to be much more interesting. Of course this could be because the lead female was so much more enjoyable then Nick. I'm also a sucker for animals in Zombie books and in this case we have a small zoo full of them. One of the saddest scenes in the entire book actually doesn't involve people at all but a family of Orangutans. I nearly cried at the end while Lily was wailing in grief. When the two groups converge power struggles ensue. By this point I could see the direction the book was heading and even which characters would be involved in upcoming conflict. I would've been OK with this had I enjoyed the last 2/3 of the story. Instead I was left feeling frustrated with the characters and lack of Zombie preparedness they had taken. Even when major characters died I simply didn't care. I felt they earned their deaths for being so gullible. Thankfully, by the end of the book the story did come back together. Nick might have been annoying but he did have some redemption in the end. Since the story is a cliffhanger of sorts I am assuming this isn't the last we've seen of the group. I'm definitely curious where the story is headed after everything that went down in the last few scenes. Plus I wouldn't mind seeing more from the world outside. It would be interesting to see if the majority of Zombies left in the wild were fresh or had they succumbed to death which turns them into the slow movie Romero kind.Overall, while Ravage did have its ups and downs I did still find the story mostly enjoyable. Would I recommend it? Yes, the story is written well and I read through it quite quickly despite its length. If you like plague type Zombie stories then I suggest picking up Ravage and giving it a go. That being said, I will be rating Ravage by Iain Rob Wright \u2605\u2605\u2605."}, {"userName": "J.C.

However, I thought I\u2019d take a chance and read this one\u2014just to see what I\u2019d get. I have to say I\u2019m so glad I took the time. Iain Rob Wright has taken the zombie apocalypse twisted it to create a suspenseful thrilling story and still gives the reader the blood and gore of the idea of zombies.

How did horror's Mr Wright go oh so wrong?!I should mention now that this was a free review copy so I don't know whether it's been updated since, however the copy I had was absolutely littered with typos. Not only is there misspelt words, but there are also words missing in places making it quite difficult to read. I have discussed this with someone who bought their copy from Amazon and apparently it does have the same issue.This is a real gripe I have with many Indie Authors, getting spellings right and making sure it makes sense is purely having pride in your work. If you expect someone to buy your work, for god's sake, at least run spell check!The story starts ok, but as you read on it seems to lapse into American. A couple of times I double checked that it was indeed set in England. Another gripe.. please, please, if you cannot write in accents..DON'T. The accents written in this book do not come across correctly. If you're going to try to write in an accent, sound it out first and then write it. The big problem is, if you get it wrong, you simply come across a bit racist. There are no particularly likeable characters in this book. I really wanted to like them, but they are all decidedly horrible people on at least one occasion throughout the story. I realise that a zombie apocalypse would probably cause all of us to turn on at least one friend or acquaintance, the pressure is on to survive, tempers flare, people try to become the leader of the pack, I get that. The only characters in this book who have unusual names are those with a shady past, I'm not sure if that was accidental or whether it was done on purpose. Even the other foreign people in this book have mainstream, English names. I do realise that every author likes a plot twist, but this is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen, the characters act like Bond villains and good god these people are hard to kill! In most zombie stories the people die very easily and the zombies take a bit of doing, but these characters just keep bouncing back!"}, {"userName": "TJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7394286-tj", "userReview": "This is my first venture into the world of Iain Rob Wright and, based on this read, probably won't be my last. \"Ravage\" is a solid, if not predictable, story about a zombie apocalypse threatening England. The book takes off quickly with little in the way of scene-setting (not necessarily a bad thing). Wright introduces the reader to a small band of survivors led by an unwilling hero named Nick who find themselves on the run from a country gone mad. As the band makes their way to what they believe will be sanctuary on a hilltop amusement park. Unfortunately, the book drags a little at this point and I found myself losing a little interest as it became nothing more than a \"Walking Dead-Light\" story. The book did pick up considerably when Wright introduces the reader to another band of survivors led by a strong character named Anna. Anna's group is actually at the amusement park and eventually helps Nick's band flee from a zombie hoard through the use of the park's cable car system.As the larger group of characters begin to interact with one another, the book becomes difficult to put down. From this point though, prevalent zombie themes become the focal points of the book. These include: \"We're running out of food\", \"Who's going to be the boss?\", and the ever-present, \"I think we have more to fear from the living than we do from the undead\".Replaying these stereotypical themes keep this book from being anything more than a 3 1/2 star read.

Most of them were just 'good people' while others were the bad ones a good story needs (besides the zombies). And this story had some good twists although in the second half I could sense were the plot would lead. The end was surprising nevertheless but I did not like it very much...Of course it's a zombie novel and therefore unrealistic on its own terms but some story elements seemed a little bit impossible, like streets full of accidents and a bus driving nevertheless. But I lived with it and just enjoyed the tension.

What an interesting take on the zombie genre. It's nice to actually have a working theory, for once, as to exactly what causes people to instantly come down with cannibalistic rage, and then to literally come back from the dead; as opposed to the usual campy attitude of \"we don't know what this is, or why, or how, or where, or when.\" (I mean, of course, the characters don't have a clue what's causing the melee, but we as the reader get a bit of backstory in the end, which is a nice change) I literally couldn't put this down until I was finished.

It had great story lines, and good character development. I liked that there was more story lines than just the zombie problem which made the book more interesting. Although the ending was sad, I really enjoyed it and thought it was a great way to end the book. I really enjoyed it, again if you like Zombie books - this is a great pick!"}, {"userName": "Ashley James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9142371-ashley-james", "userReview": "Best zombie book i have read couldnt put down a must read great characters great pacing pretty much perfect in every way i wouldnt change a thing well done Iain"}, {"userName": "William Taira", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29303500-william-taira", "userReview": "Entertaining and intelligently written story in the zombie apocalypse theme.Well-written, part of a larger series, but makes sure that the book can be enjoyed as a self-contained story. The characters were not all well developed (too many to devote that much time to expand upon), but the author also didn't use cliche stereotypes as a shortcut. Good for a quick apocalypse read, just wish it didn't have the inevitable long time before the main character realizes that yes, those are zombies."}, {"userName": "Derek Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30936167-derek-douglas", "userReview": "Pretty standard zombie-apocalypse stuff. It's essentially Walking Dead fan-fiction. Obvious plot, standard characters, and no background as to what caused the infection (which at this point with all the zombie material out there would actually be fresh and interesting.)The writing and pacing is fine. But the topic and story is just boring at this point. Why not less than three stars? I'm judging the novel in its context; if you want an unoriginal zombie story this is perfectly acceptable."}, {"userName": "Trina Talma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6183093-trina-talma", "userReview": "I could say a lot about why this book was so lousy, but I don't think it's worth my time.
