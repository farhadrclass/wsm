I'm awfully picky when it comes to gay literature. I think it's important that an LGBTQ themed-book be as honest and direct about the gay experience as it possibly can. This book mostly focuses on the progressiveness of the gay rights movement and the way our community eventually shaped itself. It's been a triumphant battle, I'm not going to deny that. The way we have liberated ourselves from all of society's derogatory glances should tell you just how strong a group of people we are. However, this book feels far too one-sided to me. For starters, it seems to mostly be focused on the \"gay white male\" experience and doesn't really try to reach out beyond that. To me, that's a shame. Many minority groups have had a hand in shaping gay culture and this book mostly glosses over them. Those of you who are interested in getting a better understanding of how lesbianism and feminism have affected one another will not get much out of this book. This book does not go into significant detail about a lot of the dark parts of the culture. We never read about the people who caused damage to the gay right's movement as often as we read about the people who helped push it. The AIDS crisis is not explored at any length. I don't know, to me this book felt as though it was written with an agenda in mind. Nothing wrong with that, but it needed to be more honest."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie", "userReview": "Kaiser has written a history of gay life in America from WW 2 to 1996 that is sure to grip the reader. Focusing on New York City, he moves through each decade with a combination of a dispassionate history of events and interviews with people who were actually there and lived through it. This technique humanizes the book, making it far more approachable than the average history book. And it\u2019s a very lively book, full of reminiscences, headlines, ground breaking events and gossip. Different eras emphasize different aspects of the gay experience: in WW 2 we have gays in battle (amazingly well tolerated for the time- so much for gays breaking down military cohesiveness); in different eras it\u2019s the literary set, the theater (the groundbreaking premier of \u2018The Boys in the Band\u2019, for instance), Stonewall, the bars and bathhouses, the beginning of the AIDS epidemic and the horrifying number of deaths that followed. I enjoyed this approach; it gives the reader a rounded view of gay history. My only complaint is that lesbians barely make an appearance in the book.Originally written in 1997, Kaiser wrote a new afterword in 2007 with a brief update. I found it fitting that I was reading that update while listening to the news about the NY vote on gay marriage."}, {"userName": "Elisa Rolle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156728-elisa-rolle", "userReview": "It\u2019s almost funny to read how Otis Bigelow (famous to be the most handsome man of the \u201940s in New York City, and coveted by millionaires and artists) reported as being gay \u201cwas an upscale thing to be\u201d, but at the same time the author reports as just \u201cacross town from Park Avenue swells who entertained him so lavishly in their duplex apartments, a completely different kind of gay life was thriving in Times Square\u201d. This was and is New York City, and as in the \u201940s, also now there is a melting pot of cultures, and each culture wants to reclaim their identity. Otis Bigelow was not wrong as they were not wrong the obvious fairies of Times Square, they were simply navigating in different circles.The \u201chidden in plain sight\u201d approach was apparently pretty common in the \u201940s, and so we learn from the memory of a fund boy from New England who wants to remain anonymous as he went to school with John Fitzgerald Kenney, and between the two, the outcast was Kennedy; but there is also the inside news of how JFK\u2019s roommate, Lemoyne Billings, was gay and how he remained family friend even after the president election.And from the words of many gay men who was there and lived that \u201940s atmosphere the general opinion is that, you could be gay since you simply didn\u2019t flaunt it. One of them cite a certain Mrs. Patrick Campbell who said \u201cMy dear, I don\u2019t care what people do as long as they don\u2019t do it in the street and frighten the horses\u201d. That is basically what Otis Bigelow and those other anonymous voices implied, you were free to be gay as far as you were gay inside \u201cprivate\u201d locations.And maybe that is the reason why, in a period when civil rights were starting to be a common agenda of many politicians, it was not the same when those rights regarded LGBT people. You were free inside your private home, btw if you were wealthy enough to have that safe home, but you were also captive of your own golden cage.There is a long session devoted to the gays in the military during the WWII. A nice introduction probably explains how the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was introduced, but mostly it\u2019s about those men who remained (or went back) into the closet, not for the fear of being discovered, but to avoid to be refused the chance to protect their country as soldiers.In the post-war stories, the one I liked the most is the friendship between Paul Cadmus and E.M. Forster, and how Cadmus was aware of Forster\u2019s novel Maurice, a novel the author refused to publish until after his death to not damage his policeman \u201cfriend\u201d (who was married).The \u201950s is a period of euphoria but apparently it also started the period when being gay was dangerous, and so it should be hidden; if in the \u201940 you could be gay inside private walls, in the \u201950s even that freedom was a danger, and the walls of a room became the more confined space of a closet. As for many others, gays became the target of a witch hunt. Maybe for this reason, late in the \u201950s the main tendency was to \u201cblend\u201d and you see gays people getting married, with or without the knowledge of the wife.The \u201960s see a surge of consciences, in all the level of society, and so also among gays and lesbians. New York saw not only the first religious congregation for gays, but also Columbia University became one of the first colleges to give formal recognition to a gay students organization. Homosexuality exited from the closet and arrived in television, with a ground-breaking documentary, The Homosexuals.The bridge between the \u201960 and the \u201970 is Stonewall, and so from that moment on there will be always a pre and post-Stonewall gay and lesbian movement and culture: \u201calthough millions would remain in the closet, within a year after Stonewall, thousands of men and women would find the courage to declare themselves for the first time\u201d. Not only, being gay, or at least bisexual, was almost \u201cfashionable\u201d, and in many media, television, cinema, publishing, the gay characters not only started to make their appearance, they were also, sometime, positively accepted by the mainstream public. And also Forster\u2019s Maurice came out of the closet. The \u201970 see the sexual revolution, a sexual revolution that happened also within the LGBT community.The \u201980 and the beginning of the \u201990 is the Dark Ages of the LGBT community, the AIDS plague killed so many, that almost completely deprived the world of an entire generation. There is visibly a jump, if you browse the net for notably LGBT characters, those born in the \u201950 and \u201960 are almost all among the victims. As reported \u201cNew York had far more AIDS cases than any other city in America\u201d. One man stated \u201cI know 450 people that died of AIDS that I can count. Thirty to 40 of my close friends that I had made from 1967 to today died from this disease\u201d. It\u2019s painful to read this part of the books, even more painful if you compare it to the energy that you had just felt in the stories of those men of the \u201950 and \u201960 and \u201970, men who were eager to claim their homosexuality.Maybe due to the imperative of being more mainstream to protect their rights among the massacre that was the AIDS catastrophe, the \u201990 see the LGBT community enters politics and starting to put their weight on who has to represent them.It was a long ride to arrive to the end of this book, but it was a very enlightening ride. Charles Kaiser managed to always bring alive the men he is talking about, with their dreams, fears, love and betrayals. It\u2019s a wonderful essay that you read like a novel, with the easiness of a collection of short stories, only that the characters in those short stories are real life men and women.http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802143172/?..."}, {"userName": "ProgressiveBookClub", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2220261-progressivebookclub", "userReview": "A New York Times Notable Book of the Year and winner of a Lambda Literary Award, The Gay Metropolis is a landmark saga of struggle and triumph that was instantly recognized as the most authoritative and substantial work of its kind.

The title is misleading -- this book is about much more than the Big Apple, although much of its anecodotal material comes from there. I especially liked the chapter on \"The Forties\" -- I hadn't realized how the mass mobilization of World War 2 brought together gay guys (and to some extent lesbians) and allowed them to form their own little sub-groups within their units. The detailed recounting of the Stonewall Riots also was interesting, and is especially relevant in 2009, the 40th anniveresary year. Some might find the book too gossipy, but I thought it was useful to find out how pioneers of the gay movement evolved as individuals over the decades."}, {"userName": "Brandon Leighton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5042294-brandon-leighton", "userReview": "This book offers a fascinating history of the gay \"experience\" from the 40s to the 90s.

I haven't spent enough time reading gay history as I should. Kaiser's depiction of the sexual \"revolution\" of the 1970's, followed by the decimation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's is especially poignant. He does an amazing job of devoting equal time to the \"big picture\" political stories, juxtaposed with the intimate stories of real people and real lives.

I read it out of order, but this did nothing to dim the sparkle and optimism of author Charles Kaiser's prose.As with all histories of this breadth, it's limited in its very nature. Only the broad strokes are covered. The AIDS epidemic, in particular, is brief, and queer people of color only make the occasional appearance. I took off a star for the appalling editing.

On the other hand, it could have been better focused and organized. A good deal of it was a sort of celebrity gossip, less judgmental than what you get in the media but just as trivial. For instance, I didn't think all the details of how West Side Story was created were relevant to learning what it was like to be an ordinary gay man in the US at that time and how it was changing. Also, the parts about lesbians were nowhere near enough to make the book a complete overview of the homosexual rights struggle, and yet didn't seem particularly relevant to gay men's history. The best parts were the excerpts from newspapers and documentaries, which seemed very good at showing what messages about gay people were coming through the media.

The story is about the fight for gay rights, from the very first sparks of it, and it also covers general changes in morals and attitudes pretty well. The book gave me a good idea of how gay people of US have acheived recognition, and finally have had their rights protected by law, and what's very interesting, how American society made that victory possible.The book seems a bit too much about the rich and powerful in some places, and it is quite New York-centric. It is really about significant people, with not much stories of lives of ordinary citizens. I liked that perspective though, as the book is concise and informative, and it puts the spotlight on all the most important actors. The spirit of each decade is conveyed pretty well, too.The book made me feel a little bitter, because of my realizing that for countries with no strong democratic tradition and freedom of speech \u2013 there is not much hope that the gay problem is going to be solved anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8357496-lisa", "userReview": "This was a fun but fact filled history of the LGBTQ Community especially in and around NY.

The writing felt really disjointed in some places for the same reason. That said, one thing that delighted me, reading this the summer that gay marriage was legalized: this was written in the 90s, and the author and his interview subjects were so convinced that gay people had Made It and were so optimism and proud.
