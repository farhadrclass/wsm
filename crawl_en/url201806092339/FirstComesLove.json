And I really didn't connect with Josie and Meredith. Josie and Meredith are sisters who are still coping with their brother's death, 15 years later. Now, some stories that I categorize as \"women's fiction\" that involve sisters feature a sort of love/hate relationship. This is more like a hate/hate relationship. Josie and Meredith fight constantly, and for extremely petty reasons. Honestly, I was sick of their back and forth right from the start, and their arguing lasts for the entire story. Meredith is particularly annoying. I really hated how she was the typical miserable shrew wife; denying sex, angry at everyone, comparing herself to other moms around her. I know women like that exist, but I just hate how mothers and wives are often depicted this way in these types of stories. Meredith takes offense at everything. Nothing is ever good enough for her. On top of that, she is very self-involved. You would think being in her head for part of the story would make me like her more, but I almost DNFed this story at 90% because I was so disgusted with Meredith. And the way that she treats Nolan, her husband, was practically unforgivable to me. She never really communicated with him about her wants, and I found her to be cold and unfeeling to the point of callousness. Josie was a little better, but she still was irritating. She was also self-centered, but at least she was more likable when the reader was inside her head. However, there were still problems with her parts of the story. I thought that her relationship with Gabe, her platonic best friend, was inconsistently depicted, and downright confusing at times. I also thought that her relationship with nice-guy Pete, who came across as desperate and waaaaay too agreeable, was odd, and not in a good way. What bothered me the most about this story was how the author would present a plot thread and then just sort of... drop it. For example, the story-line with Will, Josie's ex, was built-up and built-up... and then, nothing. Why introduce it and put time into it and then have it lead nowhere? It felt unresolved. Also, the plot element of Gabe's girlfriend was treated similarly. One moment she was a source of tension between Josie and Gabe, and then she just disappears into the background. Same with Josie and Meredith's father's drinking and girlfriend, and the persona of Daniel, the dead brother. So many elements of this story were underdeveloped. I think I was expecting more from Emily Giffin, who I remember fondly from my days of reading women's fiction. However, either my tastes have drastically changed or I just have no desire to read about miserable people making each other more miserable anymore. **Copy provided in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Celeste_pewter", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16386248-celeste-pewter", "userReview": "Short version: everyone in this book needs therapy. Long version: *Spoilers ahead. Because this book was so meh, I just don't care.* I'm not really sure when Emily Giffin's characters crossed the line from being complex and realistic to whiny and unlikable, but the latter is absolutely on full display in First Comes Love. \u200bGiffin introduces us to Meredith and Josie, two sisters who have let their entire lives be defined by the early, stereotypical prologue death of their older brother. Since that point in time, Meredith has gone on to marry her deceased brother's best friend (and question every minute of that marriage), while Josie is obnoxious, and eternally obsessed with relationships and babies. Guys, I'm going to be honest: it's been a few weeks since I've finished reading this book, and I still can't figure what the point of this book was supposed to be.Was it:* learning how to not make impulsive decisions after grief?* Learning not to be creepy and having a baby with your best friend, when you're flirting with another guy?* Or was it not being a complete brat to your sibling, especially when you are a grown-ass adult? Whatever the point of Giffin's book was supposed to be, it was lost on me in the pure drudgery of this story. Because Meredith and Josie are two deeply unlikable people, who are selfish, self-centered, and clear-cut examples of why it's healthy to get grief counseling after a traumatic event. Honestly, between the sisters bickering like absolute brats at every possible opportunity - including a SUPER awkward family dinner- their mom's obsession with remaining connected with her deceased son's one-time girlfriend who has clearly moved on, and Meredith and Jo generally refusing to take responsibility for their lives, I just can't recommend this book. (Meredith LITERALLY runs away from her family at one point, because she's just so stressed by her so-called difficult life.. Suck it up and put on your big girl pants, damn it.) Giffin's books have gotten ridiculous since The One & Only, and First Comes Love is increasingly making me think that the talent that shone in Something Borrowed and Something Blue was an aberration. Final verdict: Don't bother."}, {"userName": "Chelsea Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey", "userReview": "Many thanks to Netgalley for my copy in exchange for a fair and honest review.Yes, it may come as a shock but occasionally I DO take a break from my regular scheduled programming of blood, graphic violence, and disturbing content. Sometimes you just need to lighten the mood and feel girly for a hot minute, and this was the perfect read for that. I fell in love with Emily Giffin's strong characters (read stubborn and real), biting wit, and adult humor when I read Something Blue (even though I didn't realize I was supposed to read Something Borrowed first-oops) and I immediately went out and read the remainder of her books as fast as I could. My favorite Giffin book is Heart of the Matter; I was super disappointed with her last book, The One & Only. It wasn't a poorly written book, just completely different than EVERY OTHER BOOK SHE HAS WRITTEN and my poor heart thought I was done with her for good. This one, however, was right back on track with her previous work and I was able to breathe a sigh of relief. First Comes Love: A Novel introduces us to sisters Josie and Meredith Garland. These two could not be more different which seems to cause their loving but stormy relationship hang on by a thread. Something traumatic hits their family and causes the girls to go their separate ways. Fast forward 15 years and both women are pushing 40 in the different lives they have chosen. Josie is single and an elementary school teacher who seems to be more concerned with becoming a mother than finding Mr. Right; however, she feels society does not look favorably on that order of life. Meredith is your Type-A perfectionist with the \"perfect life\"; she has a successful job as a lawyer, a beautiful daughter and a fabulous husband, so why does Meredith secretly wonder if she made the right life for herself? I loved how the central theme of this novel was a combination of ownership of one's actions and forgiveness. Giffin's novels aren't just about romance; there is usually other forms of love explored in her books and I love all the dynamics that she can bring to the table without the story being confusing or off putting. I would go as far as to say she is the Harlan Coben of the women's fiction genre as she can take multiple storylines that seem unrelated and weave them together to bring forth a form of perfection that is hard to come by in fiction. A true gem of a read that would be as perfect for the beach as it is in your own home; either way you'll be transported into another story that will touch your heart."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "Family trauma / family drama, sibling conflicts, personality conflicts, who we love and how we love and why we love those we love, everything that goes into family dynamics.

Fool me twice, shame on me.\"That's how I feel after reading First Comes Love. After being a big Emily Giffin fan for her first six novels, I was so disappointed in The One and Only. I was still hopeful for FCL though and bought my copy the day it was released. For the second time in a row though, I find myself disappointed.Where to start? First off, Meredith is the least likeable character in a book I have read, ever. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but wow, what a negative, unpleasant person with no \"root for\" value. She was so mean and nasty I found myself hoping that she stays the same miserable person her entire life bc happiness shouldn't be wasted on someone like that.Josie was a bit more likeable but slightly annoying, especially in the beginning with her Will obsession. The relationship had been over for eight years, move on. I do feel like she showed some character growth by the end at least, and I liked her friendship with Gabe (and her potential with Pete).The big secret surrounding their brothers death elicited a big yawn from me. It didn't deserve the suspense that Giffin built throughout the story. I don't know what it is, but something changed with Giffin's writing in the last two books. Her stories are no longer even slightly relatable, and her characters are lame. If I decide to read her next book I'm getting it from the library and saving my hard earned cash."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14066678-christina", "userReview": "4 Stars!Grief is a mystery to be lived through, not a problem to be solved.This novel centers around two sisters, Meredith and Josie Garland. The prologue opens the story with a family tragedy, but you learn a fair bit about the family in it. Josie is impulsive, a bit of a party girl. Meredith is more reserved, an introvert. They don't have the best relationship. Then the tragedy strikes. Fast forward in time fifteen years later. Josie and Meredith are in their late thirties and their lives have gone very differently than how they thought they would. Josie is a first grade teacher, single and living with her best friend Gabe (more on him in a bit). She can feel her maternal clock ticking away and wants to be a mother very badly, whether she has found the right guy or not. That feeling is multiplied when she realizes that her most significant exes daughter is in her class.Meredith has a seemingly perfect life. She's a successful attorney, married to a great guy she's known all her life and they have a four year old daughter together. But Meredith feels dissatisfied, wondering whether she really made the right choices in her life. Pondering some \"what if's\".The anniversary of their family tragedy is looming and secrets from the past start to surface. This story is about how Josie and Meredith confront those issues and how they come to terms with their own decisions in life. It's a story about following your heart, no matter where it may lead you. One of the reasons I like Emily Giffin's books so much, is that the story is always original. Sure, there are some with plots that have been done before, but her characters and their actions and thoughts are so relatable. Then there are some of her novels, like this one, with a completely unique story that you haven't seen before. This book deals with a whole slew of things that I haven't seen together in a novel before, from divorce to death to artificial insemination, but Giffin really makes it work. One of my favorite things about this novel (which I haven't really seen before anywhere) was the fact that Gabe and Josie had the best friendship, a friendship that everyone should have...and the author made the friendship happen between a man and a woman, both straight. I loved the fact that not only did the author include an amazing friendship, but that it was between characters of the opposite sex. Nothing romantic ensues AT ALL between them, none of the whole \"secretly being in love with your best friend for years only to find out that the feeling is mutual\" scenerio (which I was totally anticipating) and I adored their friendhsip!This was a quick read, very enjoyable, despite the fact that it dealt with some tough issues. It definitely motivates you to always listen to your heart <3"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "[ Josie's storyline was just...argh!!!! I wanted to shake her. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to pursue motherhood via a sperm donor but she had an amazing candidate in front of her face the whole entire time and all the leading up to it felt like a waste of freakin' book space IMO. Meredith's storyline did resonate with me though. Women need a vacation away from their family sometimes - yes I said that - there's nothing wrong with needing a break from the multiple roles we fill. I think it's healthy. What if's certainly pop up now and again as well and you just have to focus on the here and now along with your goals for the future and more forward accordingly.

It was a fast read for me. Perfect for the summer months or for a plane ride. It is not too heavy but does deal with grief, relationships(husband/wife, sibling, friends, etc.).The book opens with a family tragedy 15 years in the past. The book then fast forwards (15 years) to the future as we see Josie and Meredith, two sisters who are polar opposites navigating their lives. Meredith is married to Nolan who was her older brother's best friend. She never realized her dream of being an actress and is instead an attorney with a perfect life on the outside. Josie, a school teacher, appears to have never gotten over a past love and lives in the moment, spontaneous and carefree.The sisters have a contentious relationship. They really seem to agree on anything. Josie is the older sister but reading the book, It felt like Meredith was older and Josie was the younger one. Both have issues they are facing in their lives and as the anniversary of their brother's death comes closer, past fears and secrets are ready to boil over. I found this book very easy to read. I enjoyed the characters and their story lines, even the sisters arguments felt real. The book really is about relationships, being yourself, being honest with yourself and others all while dealing with grief.

It\u2019s her knack for exploring the complicated relationship and her cast of relatable characters that have landed her on my list of favorite authors. After so long, this book was a reminder of just how much I enjoy her writing. There\u2019s a big part of me that wants to go back and reread some of her greats. Starting with Something Borrowed and Something Blue.This story is centered around two very different sisters - Josie and Meredith. Their relationship isn\u2019t easy by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, there isn\u2019t much they agree on. Except that life would be so much better if their brother hadn\u2019t been the victim of a horrible accident, fifteen years earlier. Some of the choices they made in the aftermath of his death have resulted in regrets and it\u2019s time to face some hard realities. Sit back and accept the way things are or make a drastic change?It\u2019s a real struggle for the sisters to find common ground. They don\u2019t get one another and they aren\u2019t exactly accepting. The alternating point of view really highlights just how differently they see the world. There are a ton of emotions packed in this one and at times I wasn't sure whose side I would take. I struggled with Meredith\u2019s character a little more than Josie\u2019s. It was hard to watch Meredith unravel her feelings for Nolan. He seemed so perfect! But I guess that was just my perception. I think she ultimately made the right decision in the end. Josie and Gabe's relationship took me by surprise. I envisioned a different ending, which yes, would have been a total clich\u00e9. I don't know if I would have made the same choice she did, but in the end it made for a different and unexpected ending, especially for a book in this genre. On another note, it was fun to look up some of the places the author mentioned along the way.

I am usually drawn to a good family drama, especially stories about siblings. So, the premise of this book was a huge selling point. Another reason that brought me to this novel was the author. I really enjoyed Emily Giffin\u2019s Something Borrowed and Something Blue, and I was already familiar with her style of writing. Indeed, I think Giffin really shines in family drama and the description of everyday life in a way that\u2019s interesting and smart.This book surrounds the story of this family, the Garlands, who after losing their oldest son in a car accident become extremely dysfunctional. There is something to be said about grief and tragedy. It either brings out the best out of people, or it brings the absolute worst out of them. In the case of the Garlands, it certainly brought out the worst.Although this story does not really have a plot, Giffin still manages to make the narrative engaging and the dialogues dynamic. The format of the novel is set up with alternating chapters between Josie\u2019s accounts and Meredith\u2019s accounts of their life. Josie is reaching her late 30s. She is an elementary school teacher, self-absorbed, and selfish. Meredith\u2019s not much better either. She is an OCD type lawyer who, although she doesn\u2019t see it, is also extremely selfish. Both sisters, together with the father and the mother have never truly processed the death of Daniel fifteen years earlier and somehow those scars have dictated their lives, their choices, and the relationship (or the lack of) they have with each other.I really tried to sympathize with these sisters, but I just couldn\u2019t. I believe Meredith\u2019s complete ungratefulness and inability to see anything beyond her belly button had me brace myself not to slap her in the face a couple of times. And that is one of the reasons this novel deserves 4-stars. Although parts of the story are predictable and even impossible, Giffin\u2019s character development was so good that I had a very clear idea of the voice and mannerisms of these characters by the time I was done with the book. This is an emotional and well-written novel with themes of grievance, forgiveness, friendship, and love."}, {"userName": "Laurence R.", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32492014-laurence-r", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Emily Giffin's ever since I read Something Borrowed - which I know is a controversial novel - so I was very excited to read her most recent novel, since I must say that I haven't read that many books from her. I might not be part of the targeted audience for this particular novel (and I wasn't either for Something Borrowed, especially since I read it when I was about 14), but it still interested me, so when I finally got my hands on it, I couldn't resist picking it up. I wasn't disappointed, even though it's much different from what I was expecting.I liked how the book starts with the tragedy that strikes the family, the older brother's death. Even though the rest of the story takes place fifteen years later, this particular event is truly what started this story, so I feel like it's important for the readers to know about it from the very beginning. Since I'm about the girls' age at the moment of the tragedy right now, I could imagine what it would be like to lose a sibling so suddenly and it made it easier for me to relate to them. I loved how different Josie and Meredith's reactions to grief are, because it reminds me a little bit of how different my sister and I are and that made the story even more realistic to me. Also, as someone who hasn't lost that many people yet (touch wood), it's always a bit difficult for me to imagine losing a close one, so even though it's a bit painful to read about, grief is something that has always interested me.The main characters are incredibly well developped and they keep becoming more and more interesting. I'm not sure which one of the sisters is my favourite, because I really like the both of them, even though they can be exasperating sometimes. Seeing their relationship evolve is really interesting because at first they keep arguing and it's kind of a love/hate relationship, but as the story progresses, it becomes more about love than anything else. It was really touching to see and it felt even better than a regular rom-com. As for the actual relationships, I think they're quite realistic, but since I have absolutely no experience in this field, I could be completely wrong. I liked seeing the start of a relationship as well as the struggles of another one, since the contrast between the both of them is impressive. Meredith's honesty and her desire to find what's best for her is inspiring, because most people don't have that much courage. Overall, I found this story to be a very pleasant read.

The one between Josie and her former flame, Will, was particularly unsatisfying as was the relationship between Josie and her best friend Gabe. The match.com/potential sperm donor, Pete, is plain creepy and if Josie had grown at all she would have recognized this. Her sister is equally whiny and one dimensional.

Talented Emily Giffin  returns following (2014) The One and Only with another gripping tale FIRST COMES LOVE  --the powerful bonds of family, and at the heart, being true to yourself. When you live for others, one day the bitterness will surface, and rear its ugly head. An avid fan of Giffin  (having read all her books, starting with her first to the latest), of sisters, marriage, motherhood, family, sibling struggles and challenges. From love, loss, forgiveness, and finding the courage to move on. People leave, disappoint, and die; however, love stands strong.The day after Daniel\u2019s  twenty-fifth birthday and three days before Christmas. He was halfway through his third year of medical school at Yale and had just returned home to Atlanta, for the holidays bringing with him his girlfriend, Sophie, a beautiful upper crust Brit whom Daniel once called the most charming woman he had ever met. The two had been dating for more than a year; however, this was her first visit to Atlanta, as well as meeting his parents and sisters.Daniel was the golden child.  The firstborn. The older brother. A perfectionist. Sensitive and sentimental, quirky and kind. A tragic accident. A sliding on a patch of ice at the intersection of Moores Mill and Northside Drive, (Atlanta) less than two miles from their home. A truck hit his car at the corner. Where was he going the night of the accident which took his life? Out for a burger, or more? Everyone has guilt. An accident which rocked their family, and indirectly caused their parents to divorce. The devastating aftermath. They discovered years later there was more to the story the night Daniel died. More than one memory from Five Paces Buckhead (been there many times).  That night changed all their lives in ways they had never imagined. Now fifteen years later  the guilt and regrets begin to surface for the entire family. The what ifs. Choices made, their pain never ceased. Still reeling, regretting, wondering, what if. A family torn apart. If Daniel had lived, he would have been saving lives, practicing medicine, happily married to Sophie, father of two or three children, turning forty. He understood nothing was as important as family. Love comes first. Everyone had pictured perfection in his future, now shattered. Elaine and Rob  (attorney) parents, residing in Atlanta. A broken marriage since the death of their son. A dad who started drinking. Two broken remaining sisters \u2013 total opposites. They never got along before their brother\u2019s death, and now it seems the tension is exacerbated. The mother is planning a 15 year anniversary in memory of Daniel. Something which occurred in the past. Good or bad, a date to remember. Tensions are high. Stirring up old emotions. Will they invite their father, who has a new girlfriend, Marcia. She wants to include Sophie. The woman they have not seen since Daniel\u2019s death. Closure.  What is her life now? Did she move on? Alternating voices,  readers hear from both sisters. They both despise one another. Keeping Secrets. Meredith, a lawyer, in Atlanta married to Daniel\u2019s childhood best friend, Nolan for almost seven years. Mother to daughter, Harper. She was hardworking and diligent, and more of a loner. She is very unhappy. An introvert. She loved arts. She wanted to stay in New York. She is judgmental and miserable. She thinks her Josie, sister is self-centered and a drama queen. She loves her daughter, Harper; however, she is really not all that maternal. Nolan is a constant source of both comfort and sadness to her dad. What really drew the couple together in the beginning? \u201cGrief is a mystery to be lived through, not a problem to be solved.\u201dMeredith feels she is the child who has not screwed up. The strong one. She is even unsure of her marriage and how they were thrown together due to the death of her brother. Nolan was her brother\u2019s best friend. A fixture in the family. Love? Now she is second guessing her entire life. What about her plays, Broadway, the theater? Lost dreams. She is bitter. She put her plans on hold. She kept thinking Will and Josie would get married and have the grandchildren. She could follow her heart. But it did not happen. She had married Nolan, the family business in Atlanta. Her future turned into what she had imaged for her sister. No New York. Was she really selfless and noble putting her parents first, or was she spineless? She had been determined to be their parent\u2019s stable- the successful child; the salve, on their still open wounds. She wanted their family to be normal again. Meredith views Josie as the extrovert, party gal, and in some ways she is jealous of her, down deep. She does what she wants. Meredith and Nolan bought the family house from her mother in Atlanta. Everything to make the family seem perfect. Is she the real coward?Classic Josie, calling shots, making demands, creating drama. Why couldn\u2019t she be happy for her sister wanting to have a baby, even though in an untraditional way?Josephine (Josie)  is a first grade teacher in Atlanta, and grad of University of Georgia--wants more than anything to be a mother. She is more free-spirited. At age 37 she has no prospects for marriage or even dating, so she is seriously thinking of going the donor route. She is now going through profiles to pick the perfect one. She also has a roommate hipster, Gabe (they are best friends) and a big support for her. They click. It is time for a new school year. New children. Excitement. Fourteen years of teaching, she loves it. She is fun, energetic, and creative. She thinks her sister is uptight and judgmental. To make matters more stressful,  her old boyfriend and the man she was to marry, Will\u2019s daughter is in her class at school. He is married to the perfect wife, the perfect daughter and younger son. Edie Carlisle, the firstborn of her most significant ex, Will Carlisle. They broke up eight years ago (long story behind this), and she is still not over him, completely. He shattered her world. He dumped her right before he married Andrea. The woman she has stalked. She hated herself for being mesmerized with her every move and shame at the same time. Now she has to see the perfect family and the daughter every day; as a reminder of what she could have had. However, she likes the little girl. Now, Mrs. Will Carlisle volunteers to be room mom. Why does she have to be so nice? From Match.com  to a physical therapist named Pete, sperm donor decisions, and a strong desire to be a mom, Josie carefully makes decisions. Shop. Look. Research.  Instead of her being the flighty one there is a role reversal, when Meredith starts second guessing herself, her life, marriage and career. A drunken night so long ago. Survivor\u2019s guilt. Everything had come back to Daniel. The fairy tale life. Especially in the South. People fake things so much. Put on a happy face and show off your perfect life. (so true).  Josie was definitely a better communicator than her sister Meredith. Giffin once again  gets to the heart of the matter. I love the way my top three chick lit authors, Emily Giffin, Sarah Pekkanen, and Jennifer Weiner  have taken readers from women in their 20s, 30s, and now 40s. From single, dating, to marriage, divorce, motherhood, siblings, and family. And best of all,  LOVE the Atlanta familiar settings! Where I spent my most memorable 30s, 40s, 50s\u2014(happily divorced) with most of my friends in late their twenties and early thirties. Having lived in Vinings, Buckhead and Midtown, over the years and working in the media business, I have been to every restaurant and bar, from Bistro Nikos to Five Paces, mentioned in the book. On a personal note: I have to say, Blue Ridge Grill is my favorite, (near my house) there have been many gals night out, dates, and good times on the sunporch (my favorite spot), solving all our problems over appetizers, cocktails, and great company. Plus plenty of late nights and wee hours of the morning having breakfast at OK Caf\u00e9,  across the street after a night out on the town. I also love Blackberry Farm (TN) where I have had the pleasure of many scrumptious weekends. If you have never been there, a rare treat! All these spots bring back my Atlanta memories. I was laughing so hard about Johnny\u2019s Hideaway.  None of us would be caught dead in the place, back in my Atlanta days---I had to pick up a friend there one night and could not wait to get out. Definitely a meat market for the \"over the hill\" gang\u2014Cheesy; and I do mean old with lots of spandex. Giffin described it perfectly. A great read,  mixed with wit and emotion! Gabe was my favorite character. Sometimes it takes, someone outside the family to see things clearly- the glue.  \"When you are being true to yourself, you are completely honest with what you feel, deeply value, and desire. It also means communicating your feelings wholeheartedly both with yourself and others, allowing your truth to flow through you and into the world.\"  A wise lesson for all!

It is about two sisters, Josie and Meredith Garland, who are trying to find happiness. About 15 years ago their brother Daniel died in a car accident and they are still trying to cope with his unexpected death. With the anniversary of their brothers death coming up, Josie and Meredith decides it's about to time to grow up and say goodbye to their brother. Not forever, but they need to start moving on from that terrible day sooner rather than later.I really enjoyed reading about Josie and Meredith throughout the book. Each chapter switched from their point of views and it was a little annoying at first but then I just ended up going with the overall flow. I honestly liked Josie's parts a lot better than Meredith. However, that doesn't mean that both characters didn't annoy me because they really did. Josie wanted to become a mother. Now I have nothing against this goal or how one becomes a parent (unless you are kidnapping kids) but she had the perfect sperm donor right in front of her and she just couldn't see it! It was driving me bonkers and I wanted to start pulling out my hair. Then there's Meredith and lord does she need a vacation. However, I don't know how I feel about her going on a vacation by herself and leaving her family behind. I have a feeling I've read a book before and it had a mom going on a vacation without her kids and I still don't know how I feel about that either.It's probably because I'm not a mom and have 0 kids. I'm sure my opinion and how I feel about that whole situation for Meredith would change once that happens. Someday.. maybe.. who knows?!Overall, it was a cute book. Enjoyable to read even though I wanted to pull my hair out a couple of times.

But it's hard to like a book where you despise both of the main characters. Let's start with what I did like: the setting of Atlanta. I grew up outside Atlanta so I just loved the references. My favorite was when they talked about Cracker Barrel and Meredith ordered the chicken dumplings. Yes, they are a bowl of starch as Meredith described but they are SO GOOD. Seriously, I started drooling just thinking about their chicken dumplings and butter biscuits. Amazing. I also loved that Josie decided to take charge of her own life and try to get a baby, even without a man. She was really independent and she went after exactly what she wanted. That was one character trait I loved about Josie. I also liked the portrayal of friendship between a straight girl and a straight guy (Gabe). They had a great friendship and it is so rare to see that kind of friendship in books, where the man and the woman genuinely feel no attraction towards each other. Meredith and Josie drove me completely batty. They fought about absolutely EVERYTHING. It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. And let me say that I do have a sister and we have a far more complicated relationship than Meredith and Josie. My sister is actually very selfish (unlike Jose, but we'll get to that in a second) and I disagree with so much of what she does on a daily basis. But here's the thing: since we are both in our 30's, we have learned to be civil to each other and sometimes we even have fun together. One thing we don't do is start a fight with EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION. God, these two women acted like children every time they were together. Even Josie saying something on the phone like, \"I guess I'll let you go.\" was enough to bring out a bitchy response from Meredith.And then there was Josie's decision to have a baby on her own. Meredith was so judgmental and said that Josie was selfish for making that decision. Another thing I really didn't understand was that Meredith said Josie's baby would eventually become HER burden and that Josie was not ready to be a mother because she wasn't responsible at all. I have no idea where that came from. Josie had her own job, she supported herself, she didn't appear to make any selfish decisions, so where was this idea that Josie was totally irresponsible coming from? Meredith's insane jealousy, that's where.Josie was not as irritating a character as Meredith, but she came close. I don't understand her very first date with Pete. She just decides before going in that it will be her last date ever because she wants a baby and she refuses to even give him a chance. Seriously? Okay, have a baby if you want but to totally dismiss Pete after one conversation was a bit much, especially since they had a lot of great banter going on. But of course, he ended up sticking around (kind of), so it was fine.The whole brother dying thing was just overdone and I felt no emotion from it. Their brother, Daniel, died fifteen years ago. I get that losing a brother would be hard, but it was FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. It seemed like Meredith and Josie used his death as an excuse for every bad decision they ever made and I didn't buy it. And they got pissed off that his girlfriend at the time didn't spend her entire life mourning him. There were also a couple of subplots that never really went anywhere. First, there was their dad's alcoholism. First, they said he started drinking a lot more after Daniel's death but then they said he was already an alcoholic before that. But they never really did anything with his alcoholism so I don't understand why it was mentioned. Then there was Josie acting like a brat about Gabe's girlfriend, Leslie. Leslie didn't even do anything and Josie was acting like a jealous girlfriend or something with all of her cattiness. But that jealousy disappeared as quickly as it came and no one ever did anything with that either. So what was the point? I wish I had liked this book more."}, {"userName": "Laura.125Pages", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35597285-laura-125pages", "userReview": "This review, and many more, was originally posted on 125pages.com\u00a0 I was super excited when I heard about First Comes Love\u00a0by Emily Giffin. I have all seven of her earlier books and could\u00a0not wait to read this one. Then I heard\u00a0she was going to be signing at BEA and I made it my mission to get a print copy to add to my bookshelf. She was gracious and kind and made a lovely comment about my candy colored hair. It is always nice to meet an author you have admired and they are more than you expected.\u00a0\n First Comes Love\u00a0by Emily Giffin is a deep look into the bonds that make a family. The good, the bad and the downright ugly. Josie and Meredith are part of a picture perfect family. Doting parents and the all-American older brother. When a car crash alters the dynamic of their family forever, each girl copes in their own way.I really enjoyed the plot of First Comes Love. A family slowly imploding and the various reactions to a terrible tragedy. Emily Giffin's writing was, as always, on point. She was able to infuse the story with emotion and depth. She can also make a character you don't like understandable. I did not care for Meredith at all, but I was able to understand where she was coming from and what made her tick. Josie was a solid character who I was able to\u00a0relate to and I\u00a0liked seeing her deal with her past. The pacing had a few weak spots, but\u00a0nothing that detracted from the story as a whole. The world built was solid and it was easy to envision the scenes.Now I will admit that First Comes Love\u00a0is not my favorite\u00a0Emily Giffin book. That\u00a0is Where We Belong, which was just so emotional in a fantastic way. However,\u00a0I have found that I do enjoy all of her books and this is no exception. Giffin is just as strong with book eight as she was with book one. Favorite lines - And it is in this despondent, desperate moment that I think of the one person in the world whom I love without condition. The one part of this tragic story that is beautiful and perfect and untouched by regret or what-ifs. Biggest clich\u00e9 - If you just did what I told you to, your life would be great.\u00a0Have you read First Comes Love, or added it to your TBR?\u00a0This book was most likely received free from the publisher/author in exchange for an honest review.
