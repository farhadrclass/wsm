A maid turned heiress? That's a new one, one that I could definitely go for. It doesn't mention it in the summary, but I feel like I should say that Margery learns about her inheritance pretty soon in. The book is less about Henry trying to tell Margery and more about Margery learning how to navigate her way through life as a Countess. And that brings us to that lovely character. I admired Margery. Her entire life was turned upside down, but she was strong and got through it, including all the nasty gossip. One thing I don't understand is why she was initially reluctant to leave her life as a maid. If I was in her place I would have jumped at the new life in a heartbeat. I can understand, to an extent. I know she would be leaving her entire life behind, but it struck me as kind of unrealistic that someone one balk at the opportunity to be the wealthiest heiress in all of England. My one other problem with her is her reaction to Henry when she finds out. Before she finds out, she is sweet and nice to him. But after, she suddenly finds every opportunity to hate him. It didn't make sense to me that the kind woman from the beginning turned into the resentful shrew later. I get that she would be a little angry, but I didn't understand why she flew into a massive temper and didn't let it go until very near the end. This is not to say I didn't like her character, despite what it sounds like. I liked her, but I had a few problems with her. And I wanted to shake some sense into her a few times.So, now about Henry. He's a complicated character. He was the heir to the earldom until Margery was found to be the rightful heiress. You'd think that would make him bitter towards her. Nope. He backed away with dignity. That was enough to make me like him immediately. He tries to always be cold and distant to avoid heartbreak, but that never made me dislike him. I mean, he had good reason to be cautious. His relationship with Margery was...explosive, to say the least. Every moment, whether their hopping on each other, talking, or arguing, is filled with tension and sparks. There was passion from the minute they met. I really have to applaud the author for doing such a good job in creating that feeling. Whenever those two were together, sparks were flying. It made things interesting :)The story is well done. It starts off immediately and takes off at a steady pace. There is one hell of a plot twist towards the end, one that I never saw coming. The plot as a whole was interesting throughout, no dull moments. Forbidden is a wonderful book. Passion, secrets, surprises. Fun, right?4/5Thanks to Netgalley for a copy!"}, {"userName": "Carol *Young at Heart Oldie*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3752204-carol-young-at-heart-oldie", "userReview": "I'm so, so disappointed that FORBIDDEN is the last book in the Scandalous Women of the Ton series. It's been an excellent series and I'll miss my regular dose of the scandalous goings on. This engaging rags-to-riches story is a winning blend of passion-filled romance and intriguing mystery and it\u2019s just the perfect ending to a great series.My Thoughts:I adore Margery! Who'd have thought there was such a headstrong, stubborn woman beneath that sweetness and innocence! She definitely proves a perfect foil for Henry. There's a great scene where, after discovering his deception, Margery unleashes all the anger she feels against him. She certainly doesn't pull any punches! It's easy to sympathise with her feelings of apprehension and bewilderment when she's thrust into a world that is totally alien to her. She suddenly feels lost and lonely - like a captive in a gilded cage - restricted by society's conventions. I love her little acts of rebellion, particularly when she slides down the bannister to find Henry standing at the bottom!Henry's just the sort of emotionally tormented hero that I love. Bitter memories of his wife's betrayal have left him a cold, cynical man who no longer believes in love. Honour and duty are the things that truly matter to him. It's these qualities that drive him to ensure Margery claims her true inheritance although it means sacrificing Templemore which he loves so much. Henry is totally captivated by Margery and I enjoyed watching his struggle to come to terms with these unwanted feelings and I loved him for wanting to defend Margery against the slights and snobbery of the ton and protect her from danger.These two have an amazing chemistry and even their sarcastic banter seems infused with a sexual undercurrent.Every scene just sizzles with sexual tension but my absolute favourite is the 'jewellery trying on\u2019 scene. PHEW! Talk about being sexually charged! Ms Cornick\u2019s love scenes are always passionate and sensual.There\u2019s an intriguing cast of secondary characters, including those \u2018Scandalous Women\u2019 and their husbands, who definitely add some interesting twists to the story. The mystery surrounding Margery\u2019s mother\u2019s murder and the attempts on Margery\u2019s own life really held my interest and there is a shocking denouement I never expected.With complex characters, witty dialogue, sexual tension, suspense, passion and romance, this book has everything for lovers of Historical Romance.RATING: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bdReview also posted on http://rakesandrascals.wordpress.com/"}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4364961-vivian", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 (2.5/5stars) ARC provided by NetGalley. Thank you! I'm going to bluntly say that this book was full of overused tropes and were just used horribly. Sometimes overused tropes can be twisted into a clever and delightful way but sadly, Cornick failed to do this.\u00a0 This was me the whole novel.1. The \"I can't marry to someone that I love.\" male protagonistPlease. I have seen this so many times in Regency books... but for a good reason, of course. It fits the setting and time. Love wasn't a thing back then. But it's always used in the same way that it gets so tiring to read about. Henry lost his love Isobel and she betrayed her. Makes sense. But it's boring.\u00a0\n2. The \"oh-so-dirty\" scandal that forces the male protagonist to marry the female protagonist out of \"duty\"\nNice move Cornick. How many times has Quinn done this as well? It's a common thing, but if you combine 1+2... you get a seriously typical Regency novel.Everything about the novel was not complex, but at least the sex was hot? Haha. But I'm not reading novels for the sex scenes. The female protagonist was the prototype of a typical Regency novel protagonist. Kind \n   Sweet \n   Innocent \n  I would like to say that Margery had more traits, but I'm sorry to say that those were the only ones she had. So overall, this book is good for a read when you're absolutely bored, but unfortunately the whole novel was filled with eyerolling and \"oh my god\" moments for me. \u00a0 It failed to deliver."}, {"userName": "Judith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214090-judith", "userReview": "Excellent sixth novel in the Scandalous Ladies of the Ton series and one that I continue to enjoy--even going back and re-reading some of the earlier books. Beautifully written by an author who seems to be able to keep the sense of the whole while brings several story strands together to form a lovely literary tapestry for the enjoyment of those who really like historical romance. And as has been the case throughout this series, this latest heroine is a woman least expected to become the richest heiress in England and who has worked for 12 years as a lady's maid to some of the heroines in earlier stories in this series. Now she is being courted for her money, but she still insists she will never marry except for love. Even the man she really loves gets turned down because she knows he really doesn't love her--desires her, yes, but love? That is the question. A really terrific read."}, {"userName": "Bree T", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3913428-bree-t", "userReview": "Margery has been a maid to some of the most scandalous ladies in the Ton. She likes to try and supplement her income by making and selling sweetmeat treats to ladies of the brothels so there\u2019s not a lot that can really shock her. She has no real desire to marry or even move up in service as they tell her she could be housekeeper one day. What she really wants is enough money to open her own shop and to bake the treats that make her so happy.Despite the company she sometimes keeps, Margery herself is chaste and hasn\u2019t had any romantic attachments. When a dark stranger names Mr Ward stumbles across her in a brothel, she is quick to assure him that no, she does not work there. She can\u2019t deny that she\u2019s attracted to him though and he makes her forget all the rules of propriety.Henry Wardeaux isn\u2019t exactly who Margery thinks he is. He\u2019s a Lord and until the discovery of Margery, living in London, he was the heir to the Earl of Templemore\u2019s vast fortune. But the Earl lost a granddaughter many years ago when the robbery of his daughter went wrong \u2013 his daughter was killed and his little 4yo granddaughter disappeared, not seen again. Now the men that the Earl has had working on the case for years think that they just might have found her \u2013 Margery. Henry has gone to London to see if he can get to know her and get the proof that the Earl needs once and for all on whether or not his granddaughter is still alive. The Templemore estate is one of the very few that can be inherited down the female line \u2013 if Margery is his granddaughter, then she is the rightful heiress, not Henry.Margery cannot believe it when she finds out that the dark and handsome Henry Ward is actually Lord Wardeaux and he\u2019s here to tell her that she\u2019s actually the granddaughter of an Earl and heiress to a fortune beyond all her imagining. Eventually she must accept the truth but she does not find her new life easy to adjust to. There are so many rules and regulations and people to frown at things she does and says. Even harder to negotiate are her feelings for Henry \u2013 as the former heir, she assumes that he might resent her for displacing him, but it seems he doesn\u2019t. He also makes his feelings quite clear that he will not marry her as he is no fortune hunter, to live on the income of his wife. Many others have no such qualms though and although the Ton are bemused by her new status, it doesn\u2019t stop the gentlemen calling, seeking to be united with her fortune.But Margery only has eyes for Henry\u2026.Forbidden is the 6th novel in the Scandalous Women of the Ton series by Nicola Cornick. It\u2019s the first in the series that I\u2019ve read, but each novel is about a different couple although there are characters that do recur, in lesser roles in books after their \u2018main\u2019 story. In this installment we focus on Margery, a young ladies maid who is adopted. She has three brothers, most of whom are engaged in activities that might delve into the dubious category but whom she loves anyway. She has been a maid for some ladies who have truly invoked some scandal amongst the Ton and that, combined with the fact that she regularly visits brothels to sell the women her baked treats means that nothing much shocks her. She\u2019s sensible, down to earth and honest, wishing to only have enough money one day in order to open her own bakery.I really liked Margery and I also liked that Cornick really kept her core character the same even after Margery discovered that she was really the heiress of Templemore. She didn\u2019t exactly embrace her newfound wealth, being horrified at the cost of gowns and the amount that it was deemed she needed and she often slipped up by doing things like trying to clear up plates and cups from taking tea. Even when corrected in her behaviour, she didn\u2019t really seem to care all that much, continuing on her way, her thinking almost like \u201cwell I\u2019m now rich enough to be the same person I\u2019ve always been and pass it off as being \u2018eccentric\u2019\u201d. I really found her believable in her slow adjustment to her new surroundings.I liked Henry although at times I questioned his motivation on certain decisions. It\u2019s very obvious from early on that he\u2019s utterly taken by Margery even though at first he states that he will not marry her at all, even though it would be very convenient for him in a lot of ways. He was the heir to the fortune before the discovery of Margery\u2019s true identity and he is very attracted to her. Henry was a soldier, very disciplined and he\u2019s still stinging at a betrayal by a woman in his past which really colours the way in which he attempts to have a relationship with Margery. He knows she wants to marry for love, but he refuses to ever do that so he thinks he can offer her something less. But Margery is strong willed (and now she\u2019s rich) so she has absolutely no need to settle. She wants it all and Henry better understand that!Forbidden is a deliciously fun historical romance populated with some seriously likable characters. I\u2019m determined to find the time to go back and read the earlier novels in the series now because I think, just from the snippets about the earlier pairings in this book, that there\u2019s some truly great stories to be had."}, {"userName": "Funmbi ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7276292-funmbi", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of historical romance, especially one's set in England's Regency Era. This book does not disappoint! There's so much intrigue, romance, mystery...I was hooked from the prologue! I started reading right around midnight last night and couldn't put it down...I ended up finishing Forbidden at 1pm today. This was a sensationally delicious read, which I gladly give 4.5 stars.We begin with Margery, a 24 year old lady's maid living in London. Her life is suddenly turned upside down when Lord Henry Wardeaux informs Margery that she is the long lost granddaughter of the Earl of Templemore. Having no recollection of being kidnapped as a 4 year old, Margery is the only witness to her mother's murder. She's now thrown into a new world, trying to adapt to high society, learn her new responsibilities and Heiress of Templemore, and handle the onslaught of suitors. As she's negotiating all these things, Henry is a constant at her side. Though their relationship is tumultuous, there is an undeniable attraction. Will they finally come together when it seems like, after all these years, Margery's life is still at risk?What I love most about Forbidden are the characters. Cornick gives us such characters with such vivid personalities, ultimately making the relationships between them quite passionate.Right away, I love Margery. I love that she's kind, straight forward, relatively modest, determined, and possesses lots of fortitude. Interestingly, I would describe Henry in a similar way. He's self-possessed, facing his responsibilities straight on. At first, I'm super suspicious of him: why would Henry want to find Margery, especially if he will lose his inheritance? But ultimately, it comes down to the his belief in being a gentleman and fulfilling his duties. But with that said, Henry isn't always a gentleman, ESPECIALLY when it comes to Margery! He pursues her pretty steadily and intensely. I love how explosive Margery and Henry are together. There are incredibly heated arguments with all this passion and sexual tension lacing the heat. With that said, Henry is so tender and protective. He's drawn to her: \"She was all sweetness and innocence and she washed the world clean of the violence and darkness he had seen in it.\" *SIGH-SWOON*Its like Henry is normally so composed, but can't help falling for Margery. Cornick's words describe it best: \"It was always like this between them, the current of desire laced with antagonism.\" EXACTLY! A few favorite moments: -The almost sexy times in the garden! OOLALA!-The big reveal, telling Margery she's really an heiress...Insane! Written so well. - I love Margery's friends, especially Lady Grant and Chessie.-\"You have no idea how much the idea of restraining you appeals to me.\" *faints*-The reunion between the Earl and Margery *CRIES*-\"Tell me, Lord Wardeaux, do you practice being so rude or is it a natural accomplishment.\" HAHAHAHA!-The mystery surrounding the death of Margery's mother and her kidnapping is interwoven so well in the plot, especially when different things happen to suggest that Margery is still in harm's way!-THE INCREDIBLE SEXY TIMES!!!!! For example: \"She was ravished, taken and achingly aware that she had pushed him to this extreme of possession.\" HAVE MERCY!ORM: \"I will not marry a man who does not love me.\" H: \"And I will not stop making love to you until you agree to marry me.\" *FAINTS*I'm very satisfied with the story's resolution, especially when we learn the truth of Margery's past. Several things occur which keep me on my toes, keep me guessing, and keep me reading! I loved every moment. In fact, I need to go ahead and read the first 5 books...I'm not ready to let go!Intriguing plot, charming characters, and gloriously sumptuous sexy times. This is an absolute MUSTREAD!Many thanks to the publisher and Netgaller for the opportunity to read this book!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879426-melanie", "userReview": "This is the last book of `Scandalous Women of the Ton Series' and I am so glad that Ms. Cornick has offered it to her fans in full, rather than a little novella. This heroine deserved her own adventure and happily-ever-after.Margery Mallon is a young woman who values her family even though all are earning their money by questionable means. Growing up a Mallon meant knowing how to squeeze that last penny out of every transaction made. But what she dreamed of was maybe, just maybe one day she might save enough money to open up her very own patisserie. She was in her element when baking and people around her loved to eat everything she baked.Henry Atticus, Lord Wardeaux has been brought up since an early age to be ready to one day take on the title and all the riches that go with being Lord Tempelmore. However, the current Lord Tempelmore and his Godfather, has never given up on looking for his long lost granddaughter Marguerite Catherine Rose Saint-Pierre who disappeared many years ago and was the witness to her mother's murder.This story of rags to riches is nothing like Cinderella! This is so much better!I enjoyed this story so much despite the predictability of it. Ms. Cornick is such a great story teller. She delves into so many facets of one's character, that I came to like even the villain. Go figure!The hero in this book is truly what one should be; a man who's principled, passionate and kind, honorable and too sexy for his own good. I mean, here's the man that stands to lose so much by this heiress, if she's found, and he's the one leading the search because he knows it's the right thing to do. Once he finds her, convinces her of her identity and gets to really know her, he has a very hard time not falling in love with her.The heroine must have been a hoot to wright. She is such a complex woman; innocent one moment and beguiling the next. For someone that has always been on the out looking in, she had a hard time believing the truth of who she really is. Watching her maneuvering and trying to reconcile a woman who is with the woman who now she should be, was as much fun as heartbreaking.Everything in this tale is perfectly well written and there's no way these two will not become one of your best hero and heroine. Ms. Cornick is great at plotting, pacing and giving us characters we'll love to talk about for years to come. This story definitely gets my Five Quills for its characterization, the sweet, tender and sensual romance and for bringing back all the scandalous ladies of the ton. That's what I call closing a series with a bang!

In forbidden a new hero and heroine are introduced though characters leading in prior books do make appearances. This is the third book in the series I have read and I\u2019m so glad I picked up Desired and Forbidden after not particularly enjoying the characters in Notorious. Margery Mallon is a sensible lady\u2019s maid who is relatively inexperienced with men, despite visiting the local brothel to deliver her token homemade sweets to the working gals. So when Henry Ward walks into her lascivious workplace and kisses her into oblivion she isn\u2019t the only one surprised by her sexual curiosity and lust. Several heated encounters later and Margery begins to really like and trust this mystery man. But when her handsome Henry Ward is re-introduced as Henry \u201cLord\u201d Wardeaux a nobleman who has come to deliver the news of her true identity- the deceit infuriates Margery. She discovers she was kidnapped as a child and is actually the long lost granddaughter of the proprietor of Templemore. In a moment she goes from a maid to the richest heiress in the county. She is to inherit the wealth and properties from her grandfather, a legacy that befell to Henry prior to Margery\u2019s discovery. Convinced that Henry tried to seduce her to defame her and steal her inheritance, Margery intends to never trust the conniving Henry ever again. However, she doesn\u2019t count on the strong sexual chemistry and her personal desires to get in the way of her plans. Despite herself, she finds herself falling in love with the man who gave up on love a long time ago. Of course, both are aware that they could solve both their problems by marrying- Margery could explore intimacy without impairing her reputation and Henry wouldn\u2019t have to leave Templemore. The problem is, Margery refuses to marry without love and Henry refuses to marry for love. Initially, I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was going to like Margery and Henry. I thought it was a bit out of character for Margery to have a fling with Henry, someone she hardly knew. It also seemed out of character for Henry who normally so controlled, could succumb to his lust for Margery when he was supposed to be confirming her identity. But as the character\u2019s personalities and fears began to emerge I really quite liked Henry and Margery. Their physical attraction made more sense as the characters evolved and I was quite happy with how the issues were resolved.I really love this series and I intend to seek out the earlier titles.

She has no idea she is the long-lost heiress to the Templemore title. She was kidnapped as a child on the night her mother was murdered and her grandfather has been looking for her ever since.If Mallory were never found, Henry would have inherited the estate. He is tasked to track her down and figure out if she truly is the missing Lady Marguerite. He ensconces himself into her life to better judge her character. Henry is taken with Mallory right away... and she can't believe this wealthy gentleman would want anything to do with her. A walk together, a dance, and a few feverish kisses later, she finds out the truth of who Henry is and why he is there. She feels angry and betrayed and vows never to be so foolish again.Of course, it's not so easy to get away from Henry. He is her grandfather's godson and he goes with her meet the old man and become part of the family. It's a difficult transition from maid to heiress, and although she has tender feelings for her grandfather, it's really Henry who makes her feel alive in her new surroundings. The anger she has for him makes their interactions even more incendiary. There is passion between them... flirtation and banter... and fear.Henry is determined never to fall in love again. A horrible first marriage cured him of any romantic illusions about matrimony. The thing is, Mallory refuses to marry without love. So as she begins to fall for him, he isn't able to give her what she really needs for a future.I liked Henry. He's almost too good to be true in that he is willing to give up the inheritance he would have gotten to do the right thing by Mallory. This, even before he knew her. He's got some emotional baggage, but it doesn't make him cruel, just... closed off at times. Mallory is sweet and genuine and--it turns out-- quite passionate. The sexual tension and the love scene between her and Henry were very, very good.I didn't love that they were pushed into a relationship decision by external circumstances late in the book. I also think I would have liked more loose ends tied up with Mallory's father. But overall, I enjoyed the story. There's a small mystery/danger side arc that managed to surprise me before all was said and done. And I liked the romance.This is book six in the Scandalous Women of the Ton series.

My childhood dream came to life in this book.What I loved about our heroine, Margery is that she simple didn't want the title, the money, she wanted things to stay status quot. She wanted to save her hard earned money and maybe open up her own confection business. But what she wanted and what was to be are two separate things.The hero, Henry, well I felt sorry for him at first, the man who was targeted to earn the title and the money. It was earmarked for him from the beginning, he loved the land, you can tell by how the author wrote about his dreams, his desires. But the best of both worlds happened in this story, both these unbelievably made for each other characters fell in love and things couldn't have worked out better for them.Not to give the plot away, our young heroine didn't recall much of her early years but there was one pivotal moment when her memory of her past came back, it was then that her life was in jeopardy. It was during this time that Henry finally accepted that he loved her and she was worth finding and fighting for.The author brought back all the \"scandalous\" ladies of the ton, united they are a force to be reckoned with.

The things that kept it a 4: I did not like some of Henry's actions, I really wanted him to be more sympathetic towards Margery (but, much of this was was because of his emotionally messed up past, and I do love angst and a tortured hero); although all the love scenes were clearly consensual (and HOT!), there were several points of saying no that were just railroaded over, which bothers me at times; and there were just a few things that threw me out of the story for a bit, kept me from being fully immersed. Margery was incredible, I adored her. She was so strong; I would have been curled in a ball in self pity and loneliness, but she carried on with little complaint and a lot of determination.

Margery aka Lady Marguerite Catherine Rose Saint Pierre is an impressive example of the female gender. Although she has lived amongst the most scandalous members of the ton she has remained virtuous and determined and keeps her head held high and has great entrepreneurial spirit even though the prospect of ever opening her own confectionary shop seems bleak she is still hopeful and is happy with who she is no matter the difficulties she has faced in life. Henry aka Lord Wardeaux is such a tortured soul and his inner turmoil is described with great detail. Initially when first introduced to Henry I didn\u2019t imagine him to be interesting or attractive but this was a good thing because as the story progressed I found him that much more alluring and complex. Their first encounter is precious and very Cinderella like and subsquentially their dinner together at the hoop and grapes was a very genuine moment between two people that are very into each other which makes the encounter immediately thereafter between Jem (Margery\u2019s older brother) and Henry such an abrupt change to the mood but the mood picks right back up and is immediately super charged with passion in a garden when one would have thought that the altercation would have dumped cold water so to speak on their growing interests in each other. Of course, as expected they must part when passions have gone out of control. From here the story unfolds and Margery learns of her relation to the Earl of Templemore and her new found inheritance and the immediate knowledge that she has been betrayed by Henry and that she is basically taking away his inheritance in which she wants no part of because she likes who she is (which up until this moment was Margery Mallon, Ladies maid and a confectioner) I couldn\u2019t find it in my heart to feel sorry for her though and the conclusions in which she jumps to about Henry. Of course, that being said Henry doesn\u2019t go out of his way to explain himself either. Now the newly found heir of Templemore - Lady Marguerite Catherine Rose Saint Pierre is whisked away to meet her grandfather and we learn that a man who is usually devoid of emotion is overcome by being reunited with his long lost granddaughter who was presumed dead for twenty years which only makes Henry hurt all the more because he is falling for Margery and has never seen the old Earl so happy. The emotion was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Around this time we are introduced to two more characters. Lady Wardeaux (Mother of Henry) and Lady Emily Templemore (Earl of Templemore\u2019s half sister). Lady Wardeaux is a cold woman who bound and determine that her son keep the fortune he is owed and Lady Emily is as very strange woman, she is into the occult and tarot cards and seems much younger than she is said to be but we learn why she is such a strange individual as the story goes on and it all comes together. All throughout the book there are deliciously scandalous moments. There is a point in the story when Margery tries on the Templemore jewels with Henry gazing upon her in the mirror and although they are in a large dining hall and barely obscured from the rest of the family it doesn\u2019t stop things from getting very hot!! I would say more but I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin this part for the reader. The book tears at your heart strings and the ending wasn\u2019t predictable like so many others I have read although I suspected one characters connection to her original disappearance as a young child the story came to a close with all of Margery\u2019s friends coming to her rescue and the ending was more unexpected and so perfect. I LOVED this book! I will have to go back and read the whole series."}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3226967-katrina", "userReview": "The Scandalous Woman of the Ton is a series I will never tire of. I find myself reading these books in almost one sitting , so engrossed in the world of the Ton and the Rakes, gentleman and ladies in this era, - It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking through a looking glass I can picture everything. The gowns, the men - the surroundings. If I could time travel and spend one day anywhere it would certainly be as A Scandalous Woman from the Ton ;) I must say finding out that maybe this is the last in the series is ** Scandalous ** but I know that Nicola will give us readers another Regency Romance to quench our needs. ** I do know that Nicola is pleased to announce her first Website = Exclusive Short story, Lady Emma's Disgrace , which takes place during the timeline of Forbidden. It is available at her website and is a wonderful short read.  Nicola Cornick does a wonderful job of taking the reader to another place whilst reading. Her descriptions and writing is just poetic. Smooth flowing, wonderfully written and I can\u2019t help but want more after each story has ended. In Forbidden we meet Margery - a lady's maid and Henry - Lord Wardeaux. Henry has sort Margery out as a dying last request and to his dismay finds that Margery not only intrigues him but his lust for her is overwhelming. Margery also discovers something she has never known before. Lust - need - and love. After a turn of events on Margery's life, Henry's realizes that Margery needs him in more ways than one. I won\u2019t go into the storyline much... But if you\u2019re after a wonderfully scribed Historical Romance, with a twist then this series is for you. The sex is tasteful and delicious not over the top but it certainly gives the story and the reader what every true romantic at heart wants. Love and undying passion. Well, I have to say that I enjoyed Henry and Margery\u2019s love story. The romance was sizzling, passionate and would certainly cause any ice peaks to melt from the sheer heat. I enjoyed the chemistry and the characters put forth. The romance was scandalous - but that\u2019s what makes it all the more exciting. Margery was a very head strong character which I really liked, she knew what she wanted, was willing to help out anyone in need, and blended in well with any walk of life amongst the ton. She didn\u2019t want what was bestowed upon her, she was happy to earn her money save and open her own shop. However her newly aquired status meant otherwise. Henry - sigh - He was certainly a dream boat - lol He had his dreams and loved the land he was brought up on; Nicola did a wonderful Job portraying exactly this. Both Henry and Margery were both stubborn, the swab bling between them at times was amusing, other moments - My reader was in frenzy... grins . Nicola Cornick puts a lot of intelligently written dialogue and witty banter between the two, increasing the sexual tension between them even more so. I think towards the end I was going to spontanusly combust ** blushes **All the secondary characters were all well placed, and all blended in well within the storyline. A twist or two was thrown in I certainly did not see this coming. I like unpredictable and this was certainly that !!Not only has Nicola Cornick\u2019s Scandalous Of the Tons series earned a coveted place on my crowded to be read again book shelf, I have now an affection for more historical Romances. If you love a well told , historical sexy romance with a brooding, sexy Lord and a caring adventurous heroine, this book is for you. Thank you to Harlequin for providing this book for me to review for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "May Mostly Romance", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL":

"userReview": "The Templemore Earldom is one of those rare titles that can, in the absence of male heirs, pass to the next female in line (of course she'd be a countess rather than an Earl). The current earl had a daughter who was killed some 20 years ago, and his little granddaughter vanished the same day. In the absence of the earl\u2019s granddaughter, Henry W is the next in line, and he has been raised since he was about 10 to take over the earldom. He loves Templemore, but he is an honorable man. So when it seems that the lost heiress may have been located, Henry sets about making sure she\u2019s what she seems.In her mid twenties, Margery is young to have been elevated to the status of lady\u2019s maid. When she isn\u2019t dressing her employer, Lady Grant, she is baking confections and bartering her goodies (the food kind) to prostitutes. It\u2019s in a brothel that she meets a gentleman who seems much too interested in her. He even knows her name, though she never introduced herself. The man continues to turn up wherever she goes, and it's creeping her out a little (he's a gentleman, after all, and she's just a servant\u2014any interest he has in her can't be wholesome). Even so, something about the guy makes her want to be stupid. So when he asks her to take a walk with him, she does (because gentlemen who want to \"walk out\" with lowly maids always have the best intentions). He asks her about her earliest memories, and she talks about a carriage, about a big room with black and white tiles, about a woman crying and blue silk. The next thing she knows they\u2019re making out. Then suddenly he backs away and coolly escorts her home.The next day, he shows up at her employer\u2019s residence with a lawyer, and announces that he is Lord W, and she is in fact the lost Templemore heiress. All their previous hook-ups, including the one that left her naked from the waist up with hickeys in places no decent woman should have them, were just his way of verifying who she was.Now she has to leave everything and everyone she knows and go to Templemore to become a countess-in-waiting. The thing is, her mama didn\u2019t quite die by accident, and pretty soon, as you might expect, stuff starts happening to Margery. If it sounds like you\u2019ve seen the \"lost heiress\" story before you probably have. It has been done. But honestly, I don't care if a general concept has been done before, as long as the book I'm reading does it well. This one does. So four stars. (I've been four-starring too much lately\u2014gotta stop taking my \"nice\" pills.)Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering about the title, the reason for it is that Henry keeps thinking that Margery is \u201cforbidden\u201d to him.

I particularly love stories about girls who are on the outside, who really do not belong, and Margery\u2019s story is one of those. In the beginning of the story, Margery\u2019s life is well-ordered and fulfilling, and then she is thrust into a role she would never have chosen for herself, and she must make the best of it. Margery is smart enough to know that she will never be accepted as she is and to know that there is no value in attempting to be anything else. Out of love for her newly-discovered grandfather, she makes an attempt to be socially acceptable, but she has no delusions about herself, and I enjoyed her frankness and down-to-earth intelligence. As far as female characters go, she\u2019s perfect \u2013 an odd, but enjoyable, blend of Anne Eliot and Catherine Moreland, to put her in Jane Austen parlance \u2013 and I was a little bit sad when the story was over because I didn\u2019t want to leave my new book friend.Henry is also an excellent character, which is really quite amazing considering he was saddled with the often-disastrous romance hero trope: he\u2019s been burned by love, and now he wants nothing to do with it. In the hands of Nicola Cornick, however, Henry is everything one would expect\u2013brooding, untrusting, and a bit cold\u2013but also so much more. In a way, Henry and Margery act as foils for each other. Where Margery has decided that she cannot be anything other than she is, Henry is constantly at war with himself, stifling his passions and emotions and pursuing the cold and lonely path of duty. Margery\u2019s character develops as she responds to the plot points in the book \u2013 she discovers she\u2019s a long-lost countess and heiress and deals with the ramifications of that discovery; she is thrown in with Henry and falls in love with him, and she deals with the emotional ramifications of that. By contrast, Henry\u2019s character develops in a well-crafted arc as he learns how to reconcile the past, how to forgive himself for his follies and heal, how to be himself after all these years; his is an internal journey, and it is fascinating to read. In Jane Austen terms, Henry is a blend of Henry Tilney, Edmund Bertram, and Frederick Wentworth.Bottom line: Forbidden is a wonderful and beautifully-written story with action, intrigue, unexpected villainy, richly developed characters, and interesting secondary characters (Henry\u2019s mother is delightfully awful\u2026 very Aunt Norris, I think). I had a difficult time putting the book down, and it left me wanting more when it was over.I received an advance, uncorrected proof, so I assume that some of the few funny little errors that I noticed will have been cleaned up in the published version."}, {"userName": "Anna Banana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5543697-anna-banana", "userReview": "Review: Haven't read Historical Romance like this is a while. I was pleasantly surprised by Forbidden and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.\"For a little while\" she said, \"when I first came to Templemore, I did not know who I was, who I had become.\"Margery is one stubborn lady. Despite being a servant, Margery has a lot of pride and I loved that she's such a strong, independent women. She really goes through a lot of obstacles and her life changes drastically throughout the book. One of the best things about Margery is that no matter what happens she still the same girl. She didn't let money or her new life change who she was. \"You're out of control\" Henry said. \"Wild\" Something fierce and hot burned in his eyes to rival the sun. His haze trapped hers and she felt her stomach drop. \"Don't pretend you don't like it\" she said. \"Oh I do,\" Henry said. His voice rough now. \" I like it far too much.\"Sexy, sensual Henry. From the moment Margery meets Henrey, he's seducing her without much thought to it. He's so hard to get a read on, and you never really know what he's thinking or feeling. Well until you read it from his POV and even then I'm still not sure what he's going to do. At times I wanted to strangle him because he wouldn't see what was so clear to everyone else. But then he says something flirty and sexy and I'm trapped all over again.\"She had thought her natural friendliness would carry her through all the ordeals that being heir to Templemore might throw at her. Now, she wasn't so sure.\"As Historical Romances go, this one was pretty good.

I actually found the Scandalous Women of the Ton series when the 5th book was released, and became a fan of Nicola Cornick with that book.Margery has been a secondary character in each of the other books in the series and I was glad to see we were getting her story. Margery is actually Marguerite Catherine Rose Saint-Pierre, who was has been missing since the age of 4 when her mother was murdered. Her grandfather sends Henry to bring her back to the family so she can take her rightful place in society. Henry and Margery have an instant attraction to one another. I really loved the attraction and connection between Henry and Margery. I could see both falling fast for the other, yet Henry had been burned in a past relationship, so he had no plans to ever love again. Margery knew she loved Henry, but because of his past never expected him to feel the same way. Even knowing Henry won\u2019t love her, Margery can\u2019t fight her attraction for him. The love scenes between them are sweet and hot at the same time. Henry is so loving to Margery, and you could feel how much he loved and cared for her by his actions.I really loved the characters Nicola Cornick writes. The secondary characters are just as important and fun as the main characters, yet I never really feel like they overshadow the main characters. I have to say the answer to the mystery of Margery\u2019s disappearance came as a bit of a shock to me. I really liked that I didn\u2019t figure out the mystery early, and especially loved that Henry was finally ready to admit his feelings for Margery at the first sign she was in danger.Forbidden is a fun, sweet and even sexy historical romance. The official release date is set for August 28, 2012, but I\u2019ve seen it available in paperback from Amazon already. The official release date for digital editions is September 1."}, {"userName": "Cerise", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20582920-cerise", "userReview": "Meh. I've read better romances and I've read worse. The relationship between Margery and Henry was well-done, although that sort of instant attraction tends to fizzle out when the author throws a bunch of contrivances to separate the two leads. This book is no different, and I found myself skimming through the middle to get to the (relatively silly) conclusion.My big issue when reading romances is that names or themes that feel wrong or overly contrived tend to leap off the page and it ruins the reading experience for me. The tarot theme really bothered me since it really lends nothing to the text aside from clunky foreshadowing. I'm not sure that occult tarot texts were available in England during the Regency; occultism in England didn't really gain traction until the middle to late 19th century, and the Rider-Waite tarot deck wasn't published until 1909. Probably not a big deal to someone who didn't have an extended goth period like yours truly, and the theme is certainly workable into a Regency romance (provided your character has access to French publications), but this really bothered me. Also, the Ward/Wardeaux deception made me roll my eyes pretty hard. It sounds like the author named her character Henry Ward (which seems a fine name for a Regency love interest) and wanted to give him a fancier name to show he was secretly an aristocrat. I found it unnecessary, since his appearance at Templemore would be a surprise regardless of his name. But I'm also really particular about names in historical romance, so take that with a grain of salt.Generally well-written, but falls into a lot of romance cliches: mistaken identity, life-changing secret that comes out of nowhere, basically every character save for the leads is more or less a hastily sketched stock character with one unique trait (if any). With a little more thought and planning, this could have been a much better book."}, {"userName": "Jo (My House of Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4297905-jo-my-house-of-books", "userReview": "I'm not certain of the actual likelihood of such a Cinderella-esque story, but it was very entertaining to see Margery Mallon accept her new life as Lady Marguerite. We've been introduced to Margery, though only in passing, in several of the previous Scandalous Ladies of the Ton books, so I was glad to learn more of her here in this unusual and probably far-fetched scenario.Several instances surprised me, but particularly Henry's instant attraction to Margery despite his insistence (to himself) that he does not want her. Margery's attraction to Henry is more believable.  All the emotion that had burned between them since he walked into her life blazed into vivid being. Margery could feel the elemental anger in him, all the more frightening because it was held under such absolute control. For one long, heart-stopping moment he looked down into her eyes. Then he started to lower his head.  \"Don't you dare--\" Margery began. Her heart was beating so violently against her bodice that she could feel the batter if it through her entire body. \"I do,\" Henry said. \"I do dare.\"I did wonder how Henry could so quickly give up the idea of inheriting Templemore once Margery had been found. Margery's grandfather had never given up hope his granddaughter would be found -- despite not speaking about her to Henry it would seem. Is Henry's acquiescence mentioned to show what a good man he is? He clearly loved the property and its tenants; why would he just roll over once Margery came back into the picture? Even his mother suggests they marry so Henry could retain the property (and wealth).And how could Margery instantly love her grandfather? She's terrified of all other aspects of becoming a lady -- losing her identify and sense of self -- yet she accepts him easily.Regardless of these quibbles, Forbidden was a great way to spend an afternoon and a great ending to the Scandalous Ladies of the Ton series."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2360766-elizabeth", "userReview": "In previous works by this author (which I now want to catch up on), Margery Mallon has served as lady\u2019s maid to several of the more notorious ladies of the ton. These days Margery is happily ensconced in a respectable home, with a friendly employer and the opportunity to borrow the kitchen to indulge her passion for baking.Of course, said respectable employer isn\u2019t really aware that her lady\u2019s maid is selling her sweets in the back rooms of whorehouses, but who doesn\u2019t have a secret or two? In this case, Margery isn\u2019t aware that her memory is hiding a rather large secret\u2014it seems she is the lost heir to the Templemore title and the fortune behind it.Enter Henry, the handsome fellow she first spots while selling her sweets\u2014and current heir to the Templemore title. Not the most forthcoming fellow in the world, Henry is also suffering from a serious case of emotional hide and seek. Can these two deal with the craziness around them? Should they bother? I am a fan of historicals, but I have reached a point where I can set them aside if I\u2019m not enjoying them. For example, I have an advance copy of another historical romance that I have picked up and put down at least 4 times since it arrived. That novel, which shall remain nameless, is going to my e-reader circular file at long last. That said, I am glad I gave Forbidden a chance. Margery, while clever and a bit spunky, didn\u2019t feel like so may others. There is something about her that felt a bit more mature, despite her requisite innocence. All in all, a nice chance to escape to the fantasyland* of historical England for a weekend. *I discovered ages ago that I prefer the fantasy version of history in my romance novels.

Nicola Cornick really has a great writing skill and I love reading every part of this book. This book, of course, has so many hot scenes, but besides that, it also has a big mystery to be solved. Who killed Margery's mom? Was that her dad? or any other person? And what was this person wants now after Margery came back? Is he/she trying to kill Margery or just threatening her? This is the question the readers will have during reading this book and only be answered on the last part of the book. I love reading historical romance books that really have more serious conflict rather than only questioning whether the hero loves the heroine or not.About the characters, I love both Margery and Henry. They are both very stubborn but also lovable. This book is full of their funny argumentations and fights. So entertaining. This book also has so many characters from the other previous books, and that actually makes me a little confused to understand their characteristics, but that doesn't reduce my enjoyment during reading this book.However, I find some love scenes were not appropriately placed. There were some scenes that I found impossible to make if you're in the real life and having such condition (not that I have tried any). I don't know how many love scenes the historical romance book must have but I think it's just too much in this book. But I do like the last love scene. That was very romantic.Overall, Forbidden is such a good book and I hope the whole series will be translated to Indonesian so that I can read all of them.

As maid to some of the most wanton ladies of the ton, Margery Mallon lives within the boundaries of any sensible servant. Entanglements with gentlemen are taboo. Wild adventures are for the Gothic novels she secretly reads. Then an intriguing stranger named Mr. Ward offers her a taste of passion, and suddenly the wicked possibilities are too tempting to resist....Henry Atticus Richard Ward is no ordinary gentleman. He's Lord Wardeaux and he is determined to unite Margery with her newfound inheritance by any means-including seduction and deception. But when the ton condemns the scandalous servant-turned-countess and an unknown danger prepares to strike, will Margery accept Henry's protection in exchange for her trust?REVIEW:Many thanks to Netgalley for this ARC and the chance to review.This was an intriguing read. I found that Henry was so irresistible. The character building was spot on for these two and the conflict reached until the very end. I liked how the story was plotted and paced out but only had a small problem with how things played out. It wasn\u2019t so much to do with the writing but I won\u2019t ruin the ending for anyone else and just let you get there yourself. You won\u2019t regret it.I found that I couldn\u2019t put the book down and when it was done, I sulked around the house until my husband told me to snap out of it.

I am not sure at what point that investment happened. The banter between the characters was fun from the get-go, their push/pull, up/down relationship believable.I did question Henry\u2019s easy acceptance of his fate and the gigantic shift that was going to take place in his life because Margery was located and restored as heir. His reluctance to even consider marrying her was never quite believable for me until it became about not marrying her since he did not think he could ever allow himself to love her (we all know how that is going to end). And he knew that Margery wanted to marry for love (and him not wanting to marry her because he didn\u2019t think he could ever love anyone again just showed how much he cared for her and loved her \u2013 see how that works?).I thought Cornick\u2019s portrayal of Margery was well done. She is a headstrong, stubborn woman who has worked her whole life and is suddenly thrown into a position of wealth and privilege. There were multiple times where I thought I knew how Margery was going to act based on what I would expect from other regency characters I\u2019ve read and yet Cornick never caved with Margery. Margery says the wrong thing and doesn\u2019t care, she stands up for herself and refuses to be played, she rescues herself when it comes time for rescuing.

It's light, nice, and HEA= everybody is happy.

From the plot to even the characters *sigh*.The author shouldn't fall to cliches traps of romance novels, if they have been fusion with more flavour, the book could be so much more awesome!my biggest pet peeve of books is that the author lack of research. Unless it's fantasy place or objects etc (i.e. Hogwarts) they should research the time setting of their story and social, politic, culture even lexis used in that time! (imagine a story of shakespeare using kindle.. er, not happening). Cornick slipped a few times with this, it stuck out like a sore thumb.Other than those, the prose was well written (syntax, grammar, spelling, etc).
