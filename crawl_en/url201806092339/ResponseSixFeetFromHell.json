Amazing story line w/from an EMT's POV. the lead character Joe has a very big responsibility on his shoulders tha t was thrown on him. there is loss & there is heartache but there is also humor & I love the mix! Great action & ways of taking down zeds! This book makes you think about what you would do if you were far away from your loved ones & how you would get to them!there are several losses I wish didn't have to happen but it's a ZomPoc book so of course there would be death! It is a must read & you will not be sorry! though there are some typos if you get passed them it is really good! Keep it up Joseph! I am looking forward to more!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Cleveland", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33359750-lisa-cleveland", "userReview": "This is one of the better zombie tales that I've read in a while. Good enough that I'm going to have to read the second book to see what happens. I think the characters are likeable and there may be 2 or 3 that I really like. So I'm sure a few.of them will die a long the way! Mostly I'll be happy to see them get out of that death trap trailer! Yep, I'd recommend this book and author."}, {"userName": "George III", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4855508-george-iii", "userReview": "I must commend the author, Joseph Coley on this series so far. All zombie stories have some of the same tropes but what sets them apart is the characters. If you care about the characters the situations become more real and terrifying. The author accomplishes that feat. I will be getting book 2."}, {"userName": "Joe Amber", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19739968-joe-amber", "userReview": "I simply loved this book. From the very unique release of the plague, all the way to the cliffhanger ending your hooked. Joseph Coley is a rising star. He gets everything about a zombie apocalypse. I could go on and on but id rather not give any spoilers away. Great book in a great series."}, {"userName": "Sara E Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26475426-sara-e-lawrence", "userReview": "Great story lineReally like the premise and the characters but the reading experience was diluted for me by the need to edit. There are enough grammatical errors that I found myself wondering if perhaps the author did it intentionally, as in a literary device. Upon further consideration, I think not.That said, the lack of editing does not deter me from reading the next in the series.."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9131136-theresa", "userReview": "Great book.

Getting by on the zombie craze"}], "description": "Six feet from hell is where it all started. A coal mine accident in the hills of Southwest Virginia has unleashed a deadly toxin that not only kills the living, it brings them back as ravenous zombies. Follow the men that try to escape the chaos in the first book of the Six Feet From Hell series.*AUTHOR'S NOTE - EDITED FROM ORIGINAL VERSION, GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX HAVE BEEN GREATLY IMPROVED, STORY HAS NOT CHANGEDThis is my take on the zombie apocalypse and what I would do. The characters in this book are all coworkers of mine that have inspired me to write what we might do in the situation presented. The locations are all real, the people are all real, the only thing fictional is the zombies....or are they?", "title": "Response\n      \n          (Six Feet From Hell #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16157434-response", "average": 3.58, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1370731762l/16157434.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6582815.Joseph_Coley", "name": "Joseph Coley"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16157434-response", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18892063-response", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18892055-crisis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17881144-salvation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18583755-six-feet-from-hell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18892073-escape", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18878013-r-i-p-van-winkle-part-i"]}
