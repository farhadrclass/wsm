While Fuller's mother reminisces about her Scottish ancestors, she herself is haunted by the Tasmanian natives forced into slavery on the family's ancient estate. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be to reconcile the fundamental need to see all people as equal with an entire family history predicated on the belief that they are not. Rhodesia's appalling history, that the lives of 250,000 white settlers should be so much more important than the 6,000,000 indigenous blacks who were there first, is tough to swallow. But that was their lives nevertheless. In the midst of the entitlement and privilege of white Europeans who found Africans to be, in the words of Rhodesia's prime minister, \"uncivilized savages,\" these people lived, tried to realize their dream of a farm, their children lived or died (mainly died, and although I knew of their deaths from Fuller's perspective from her first book, it was even more heart-rending to hear of them from her mother's). I hope that I can marvel at the specter of a hard-drinkin\u2019, man\u2019s-shirt wearin\u2019, dog pack trailin\u2019, bipolar Nicola Fuller, mourn her dead children and be amazed at the circumstances of her life even as she speaks of determination to be White and stay White in Rhodesia. I think I'm essentially trying to write a review that assuages my white guilt about loving this book. I am absolutely fascinated by Alexandra Fuller's family. Their pictures, their nicknames, their expressions, their drinking. I would love nothing more than to sit down & pore through every one of her photo albums. Their experiences are just so bizarre and heartbreaking. Does it make it better that the colonialism & racism both from this book and Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonightare slightly tempered here by her parent's experiences managing a black landowner's tobacco farm in Malawi after the war in Rhodesia? It is, in Nicola Fuller's words, \"A short, sharp education on how to live and behave in a black African country run by black Africans.\" Can you be fascinated by people and love reading about them while at the same time abhorring the dominant philosophy of their lives?"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4081664-jessica", "userReview": "Several years ago, I read Fuller's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, a memoir of her young life as a white girl in Southern (NOT South) Africa, and although I don't remember the specifics, I do remember that I closed the book with a sense of history and humor, so I was pleased to see that she'd published a new book. This one, Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, does not disappoint. This time around, the author sets her sights on the experiences of her parents, especially her mother, Nicola. The book starts out feeling somewhat glib and suspicious, but as Fuller settles into the narrative, the rich stories of her parents' lives unfold - her mother's childhood in colonial Kenya, her father's rootlessness, their falling in love and decision to stay in Africa, despite the wars for African independence that rolled across the continent in the sixties and seventies. As Fuller recounts the experiences of her family in Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, two feelings settled over me: this was really a love story (\"Tubs\" and Tim are obviously deeply in love, even after all these years - and the author deeply loves and admires her parents, no matter what), and that none of the family will ever really recover from her parents' decision to stay in Africa no matter what the consequences. Fuller creates an achingly beautiful and heartbreaking piece of work here, which manages to evoke the beauty and horror of the \"Dark Continent\" as well as the optimism and determination of her parents' personalities. She deftly weaves personal experience with the historical realities of Kenya, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and Zambia, which makes her effort especially remarkable. In the end, I closed the book feeling thankful, sad, and deeply in need of a cocktail. Cheers to Alexandra Fuller and her amazing love song to her family."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "This book is a memoir of all the good and bad and how to survive in the African wilderness. I find myself mesmerized, enchanted, sad, elated and pondering. Most of all, it was a great read. Sometimes I hollered with laughter.I love these quotes from the book:\"No one starts a war warning that those involved will lose their innocence - that children will definitely die and be forever lost as a result of the conflict; that the war will not end for generations and generations, even after cease-fire have been declared and peace of treaties have been signed.\"\"Whether out of desperation, ignorance or hostility, humans have an unerring capacity to ignore one another's sacred traditions and to defile one another's hallowed grounds. ... Surely until all of us own and honor one another's dead, until we have admitted to our murders and forgiven one another and ourselves for what we have done, there can be no truce, no dignity and no peace.\"\".... although my father is profoundly English, by the time I am old enough to know anything about him, he is already fighting in an African war and his Englishness has been subdued by more than a decade on this uncompromising continent. In this way, the English part of our identity registers as a void, something lacking that manifests in inherited, stereotypical characteristics: an allergy to sentimentality, a casual ease with profanity, a horror of bad manners, a deep mistrust of humorlessness. It is my need to add layers and context to the outline of this sketchy Englishness...\"Those wars are still raging.The most profound message I take from this book, apart from aspiring to be as resourceful and enduring as the author's mom, is this:\"But you can't have all this life on one end without a corresponding amount of decay on the other: in the morning my parent's maid, Hilda Tembo (Big H to the family), will sweep up half a bucket of insects carcasses and two gecko bodies from under the Tree of Forgetfulness. Months from now three of the Jack Russels will have been killed by a cobra in Dad's office, and one will have been eaten by a crocodile in Mum's fish ponds. And Dad will walk out of the bedroom one morning to see a python coiled in cartoonish perfection around Wallace (the late cat). \"You learn not to mourn every little thing out there,\" Mom says. She shakes her head. \"No, you can't, or you'd never, ever stop grieving. \" What my mother won't say - lost in all her talk of chemicals and pills - is that she knows not only the route grief takes through the blood but also the route it takes through the heart's cracks. What she won't tell me is that recovering from the madness of grief wasn't just a matter of prescriptions, but of willpower. \"I sometimes used to envy the people you see running up and down the Kafue Road in hessian sacks,\" she said once. And it is true that Mum seriously considered that level of deep, irretrievable insanity an option. But instead, she took a different route and regained herself and that had very little to do with forgiveness: she forgave the world and her mind returned. She gave herself amnesty and her soul had a home again. The forgiveness took years and it took this farm and it took the Tree of \tForgetfulness. It took all of that, but above all it took the one grief could never steal from my mother: her courage.\"If you have read African authors such as Kuki Gallmann, writing a detailed account of their life in Africa, you will enjoy Alexandra Fuller's books as well, but the latter has just added a lot of oomph and humor to the situations.

I loved it. I have been very foolish in not picking up this book sooner. You do not need to read both, but I would highly recommend it. This is \u201cawful book number two\u201d, as the author\u2019s Mom would call it. The two books are about the author\u2019s family, their time in \u201cCentral Africa\u201d, that is to say Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. The reason why I really love these books, and I love both of them, is that the writer talks about hardships you cannot imagine, and she does it with humor. In addition you learn about life in the African countries named. You learn through the experiences of this family. If you have read the first book, you simply must read this, the second \u201cawful book\u201d, because it clearly shows why the mother is who she is - in all the wonderful and hopeless and horrible details.  I listened to the audiobook. I want you to taste the humor and style of writing. Please go to the link here and click on the sample button below the audiobook at the Audible site: http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_3?...I want you to test and see if you enjoy her particular style. That is why I have included the link. So\u2026. I loved the author\u2019s writing style. I loved the humor. What else did I love? Why was it that I could not stop listening? Beside that I though the history of colonial overthrow was expertly woven into the story, and that isn\u2019t so strange since the family lived through these events, it was the understanding of who her mother was that I loved most. Maybe this sounds a little strange, but I like reading books to understand people. I like reading books to understand life, and life throws whoppers at all of us. Doesn\u2019t it? Life is throwing whoppers at this family from day one to the very, very end. And finally, I feel that the author has a wonderful way of relating to her annoying, ever so self-assured mother. I came to understand that mother and I came to admire the author\u2019s ability to accept her mother for who she is. You have to read the books, both books in fact, to understand. I not only learned historical facts, but I also learned on a personal level how one should/could relate to a strong, some times terribly annoying Mom. Here is a link to my review of the earlier book: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...ETA: I forgot to tell you: if you love animal stories, then this is another reason to read the book.

In Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, Fuller returns to that harshest of continents to chart her mother\u2019s life and memories as a one million percent Highland Scottish woman who grew up in the perfect equatorial light of colonial Kenya, who led a hardscrabble life in war-torn Rhodesia, who lost children, land, and sanity before courageously achieving an \u201cAfrican kind of peace\u201d on a farm in Zambia under her Tree of Forgetfulness.

Maybe I know Africa too well, but I felt an elitist tone to this one that I didn't pick up in her first book. The African Soldier one did leave me perplexed as to how someone could be privileged enough to just be able to hang around this guy for so long and what she was doing there making out with another guy with her husband and kids in Wyoming, but I got some history from the Rhodesian side, which is cool.

A horse vet named Charlie organized hunts bringing together large groups of colonials, which often ended in wife-swapping: \"About a thousand bad-tempered dogs were draped everywhere, glaring at you as you ate,\" Dad says. And there was a parrot. \"You would ask for the gravy and the parrot would shout, 'And you can fuck off too!'\" Dinner usually ended with port in front of the fire.

But the author rehashes many stories from her first book \"Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight,\" only this time from her parents' perspective and without the in-depth descriptions or emotions. The author seemed to want to tell her parents' story, but I found that I don't care about her parents' story. This is the part where I felt the author didn't care about my needs. She just wanted to write a book about her parents, and we the reader better like it. There were new stories, but they weren't all that interesting.

She is a memoirist who transports the reader to a time and place you could never otherwise know and experience it with compassion and good humor.Even her title invites the reader to the place in the African village where people meet, talk, discuss, negotiate, laugh, drink, sing, forgive and forget. One central tree where the shade provides a gathering place. The Tree of Forgetfulness is a symbolic spot where sitters anticipate the amnesia that lets them forget the past: slavery, war, violence. The central figure in this story, Nicola Fuller, is much like this tree herself. And she holds court there during the cocktail hour.If I told you this book was about a mother who lost two children, drove around with an Uzi across her lap with an infant and toddler strapped in, suffered from alcoholism and depression, and lived the life of a white Rhodesian, I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t really be interested. Not a character most of us are interested in getting to know better.But if you read Fuller\u2019s first memoir, Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood (2003 Random House Trade Paperbacks), then you already know the larger than life stories of Alexandra\u2019s mother, Nicola, and her father and itinerant farmer, Tim, Fuller are page turners. Alexandra Fuller returns to the subject of her childhood in Kenya and writes as the memoirist of parents who intend to spend their final days in the Zambezi Valley.Fuller recounts the African childhood of her mother, Nicola, and her father\u2019s British upbringing during the early part of the 20th century. The relations between whites and Africans, between rich and poor, majority and minority are shown, not told. Historical, cultural and political background information are woven into the story like a blind hem on a full skirt. Fuller is a gifted journalist and applies this skill by permitting her readers to make their own interpretations and draw their own conclusions.Capturing the voice and irrepressible spirit of Nicola Fuller, Alexandra reveals her mother\u2019s love of animals, especially horses, her grit in struggling to scrape out a living, her negotiations to make a place in the world, and her reckless sense of adventure. But also the suffering of a woman who lost a child to an illness that could not be treated in such a remote location. A woman whose daughter drowned when she left her at home. A woman whose husband would be gone four days at a time working farm land miles away. A woman who drank. A force to be reckoned with, and a lady.If you haven\u2019t read her first book, this one stands on its own. And you\u2019ll enjoy the first one, then, even more. You might be interested to know that Fuller\u2019s agent suggested she write another book about her mother and father. If you have read both, which do you think is better?Between the two books, Alexandra Fuller wrote The Legend of Colton Bryant (Penguin 2009). The true story of a boy in Wyoming who loves to ride mustangs and fancies the rodeo, returns home to take a job on an oil-rig and is killed on the job. Where the great high plains meet the Rocky Mountains, hydro-fracking changes the landscape and its people. Fuller lives in Wyoming and captures the characters and sense of place to draw a landscape portrait of contemporary life.Rare is the writer whose voice is so compelling that it doesn\u2019t matter what they write, you\u2019ll read it. For me, Alexandra Fuller is one of those rare writers."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward", "userReview": "What happened to all of those whites who once lived good lives in Rhodesia and east central Africa? That is, before the civil wars of the 60's and early 70's turned the countries over to native Africans. Many left, of course, but some remained, and Fuller's book is an tribute to her parents who stayed on. It's an followup to her earlier book, DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT about her childhood growing up in this volatile environment. She married and left Africa, and returns only to visit her aging parents. They were originally Scottish highlanders who settled in Africa and made it their home. As she writes, \"land is Mum's love affair and it is Dad's religion.\" They love the country, just as their ancestors loved the rugged west coast of Scotland, and both want to be buried in Africa.\" Her father fought in the African wars to retain British rights, but when those war were ultimately lost, he hung on, working as a manager on various farms. He says, \"You put your blood and sweat into a place and then . . . there's a coup, squatters show up, the wind changes direction, and suddenly it's all gone. No, there's no point, but you can still work in Africa without trying to own any of it.\" It was a tough life, Fuller's mother losing three of her five children, two to disease, one to a tragic accident, and most of all the youthful innocence she had when she first came to Africa. She suffered from serious bouts of depression and alcoholism.Fuller gets much of the fascinating story from her parents while they sit having cocktails under a tree actually called the \"tree of forgetfulness. A native explains that \"if there is a sickness or you are troubled by spirits, then you sit under the tree of forgetfulness and your ancestors will assist you. It is true, all of your troubles and arguments will be resolved.\" Whether they are or not is an open question, but Mum believes it \"two million percent\". To live in this part of Africa you have to have faith in a better future or else you'll succumb to despair. Africa is full of life and incredible beauty, but it's also full of decay and death, and Fuller captures both in this very interesting book."}, {"userName": "Deborah Gray", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856485-deborah-gray", "userReview": "I normally don't read other people's reviews before I do my own, because I don't want to be influenced.

Because I did love this book. Alexandra Fuller writes beautifully with such wit and clarity that I was captivated. I didn't care that some of these stories are small vignettes without tremendous consequences; together they made up the whole that is \"Nicola Fuller of Central Africa\" and I found it satisfying, enlightening and engaging. I learned far more about Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and the conflicts within Africa, from a very intimate viewpoint, than I ever knew before and that in itself was worth the price of admission. There is heartbreakingly personal tragedy in this book and triumph of an indominatable spirit, blended with such bipolar, haphazard child rearing that makes one wonder how the author ever made it to adulthood unscathed, or at all. In some ways, Nicola Fuller doesn't deserve to have a memoir written about her.

Nicola Fuller is a self-absorbed narcissist prone to the \"wobblies,\" periods of depression/manic behavior. She is also completely unapologetic about white rule in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), where much of this book is set. It's a testament to Fuller's skill as a writer that she's able to write about her mother with empathy and clarity, while at the same time making her flaws and weaknesses clear. Fuller is also very good with writing about the history of the region, the brutality of colonialism, and the war. She finds a good balance between her own point of view and allowing her subject, i.e. her mother, to speak for herself. And she's very good at creating suspense, especially if you haven't read the first book or you've forgotten it (btw, this means nothing about Fuller's writing--I forget everything I read, especially if I'm not teaching it).

What I so appreciated about Fuller's writing was her balance of affection for her parents and an awareness of the implications of their choices.\u00a0 She's no colonial apologist or 'when we' romanticizing the era of British control in Africa.\u00a0 She writes about the violence of late 20th-century Kenya and Zimbabwe succinctly and in a way that felt fair and accurate, that acknowledged the pain and losses on both sides of the conflicts.\u00a0 By the end of this book, I felt like I knew the Fullers a little.\u00a0 I liked them (even if I think Nicola Fuller is probably more fun to read about than live with) and I am wholly an Alexandra Fuller fangirl.\u00a0 This slender book packs a lot of punch and I can't recommend it enough.\u00a0 Even if the setting or era is alien to you, give it a try as Fuller's writing sucks you in and makes you care.

The book has since gone on to sell more than a half-million copies and to this day averages nearly 150 copies sold every week.Bo Fuller followed DOGS with two equally acclaimed narrative nonfictions--SCRIBBLING THE CAT and THE LEGEND OF COLSON H. BRYANT--but she never quite duplicated the success of her debut memoir. Readers wanted to know more about Fuller\u2019s eccentric family. Quite frankly, they were still interested more in where Bo had been than where she was going.COCKTAIL HOUR UNDER THE TREE OF FORGETFULNESS is the answer to those readers. Not so much a memoir of Bo's life, COCKTAIL HOUR is a biography of her mother, Nicola Fuller of Central Africa (as she calls herself). And whereas the narrative has that same strikingly unsentimental voice as DOGS, cloaking tragedy in humor and love in the stiff-upper-lip sensibility of British expats, there is something different going on with COCKTAIL HOUR. The book reads more as a love letter from Bo to her mother. Informed by several years' worth of post-DOGS interviews, I got the sense early on in reading COCKTAIL HOUR that Bo has always felt she owed her mother an apology for DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT, a book referred to by her mother only as the \"Awful Book.\" I think Bo does that and more, managing in her own inimitable way to convey sentiment without sap, love without lavishness.

That book was written from a child's perspective. This book is written from an adult's perspective. In both books, Fuller focuses primarily on her mother but in this is more biographical. She provides family background for her mother (and some for her father). Her parents are African whites. Her mother grew up in Kenya and met her father there - Nicola Huntingford and Tim Fuller married and but for 3 years of their marriage have lived in Southern (not South) Africa. They moved around quite a bit. War was all around them and Tim Fuller fought in the Rhodesian War, while his wife ran their farm. Nicola, while we are never told this, seems to be bipolar but even still she is incredibly courageous. This is a woman who lost 3 of her five children and yet chose to pull herself back up and get on with life. The author pulls no punches in her books. Her mother calls her first book - the \"Awful Book\" - but still tells her daughter the stories of her childhood and her marriage. Her parents were/are proud white Africans. They, unlike most white Africans, stayed as white Africans lost control Southern African governments. They live without fear amongst native Africans.This is the story of a heart drinking, truth telling, courageous family who lived a live that would have broken most families.

I suspect that the first book led to a rift between mother and daughter particularly as it unflinchingly reveals her excessive drinking and depressions and Nicola constantly refers to it as \" That Awful Book \" but this a more rounded portrait and a love letter to her parents and to Africa . Nicola Fuller is a no nonsense , jaunty out- doorsy type who adores animals , the warmth and freedom of Africa ,its colours and smells and probably in real life came over as great fun . At least some of the time she is but she also herself acknowledges her funny moods and mental wobbliness . It must be said that this is not a story of rich colonialists with partying , drugs , corridor creeping and general spoilt bad behaviour . Mr and Mrs Fuller are pretty poor although well bred and are wedded to the soil and to planting and reaping . They are khaki land rover types and English with their horror of sentimentality and bad manners, a casual ease with profanity and a deep mistrust of humourlessnes . They live through the mau mau uprising , the takeover of Rhodesia and the white farmers ,the declaration of Independence , the civil war , two childern dying in infancy , one child drowning , her several years of mental illness , until finally coming to rest in Zambia . Of course their views on white superiority are a totally non pc but they are not bad people they just have some firm views based on life and the end of an elephant charge .Mr Fuller is the strong silent type who has probably put up with a lot but the sight of the two of them glasees raised high on their verandha in the late evening tells of a hard unglamourous incident filled life survived with devil me care humour .The cover has a photo of Nicola Fuller as a child hand in hand with her best friend Stephen Foster , a chimpanzee . I found the title of the book a bit fluffy , the memoir most certainly not ."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867691-grace", "userReview": "This book, a prequel/sequel, continues, and in some ways completes, the first book, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight. I fully expect and hope we have another. This book is much more reflective and reveals the author's evolving and maturing understanding of her mother. The language is beautiful and evocative, rich in imagery. Several passages are worthy of quoting.\"Whether out of desperation, ignorance, or hostility, humans have an unerring capacity to ignore one another's sacred traditions and to defile one another's hallowed grounds... Surely until all of us own and honor one another's dead, until we have admitted to our murders and forgiven one another and ourselves for what we have done, there can be no truce, no dignity, and no peace.\" p 144\"No one starts a war warning that those involved will lose their innocence - that children will definitely die and be forever lost as a result of a conflict, that war will not end for generations and generations, even after cease-fires have been declared and peace treaties have been signed. No one starts a war that way, but they should. it would at least be fair warning. And an honest admission: even a good war - if there is such a thing - will kill anyone old enough to die.\" p 196\"What my mother won't say - lost in all her talk of chemicals and pills - is that she knows not only the route grief takes through the blood but also the route it takes through the heart's cracks. What she won't tell me is that recovering from the madness of grief wan't just a matter of prescriptions, but of willpower....she regained herself and that had very little to do with the very talented psychiatrist and everything to do with forgiveness; she forgave the world and her mind returned. She gave herself amnesty and her soul had a home again. The forgiveness took years and it took this farm and it took the Tree of Forgetfulness. It took all of that, but above all it took the one thing grief could never steal from my mother: her courage.\"p 203"}, {"userName": "Petrina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/677378-petrina", "userReview": "While this is a fascinating, even amusing portrait of a family lead by the author\u2019s eccentric mother Nicola, it left me wanting to know more about Rhodesia and Africa during the collapse of British colonial rule rather than more about the family. The book is a tribute to the strengths and limitations of Fuller\u2019s parents as they lived with the complexities of being white and often poor in Rhodesia during the 70's and 80's. In my initial search, I don't see many well-reviewed books on the subjects, so if you have one to recommend, let me know. The review I\u2019d like to write has already been written, so I\u2019ll just give you a quote and a link:. . . when her mother speaks of her long-lost childhood in Kenya \u2014 where she had tea parties with a neighbor\u2019s pet chimpanzee and entered show-jumping competitions with her favorite horse, Violet \u2014 it\u2019s as if she were \u201cspeaking of a make-believe place forever trapped in the celluloid of another time, as if she were a third-person participant in a movie starring herself, a perfect horse and flawless equatorial light.

No surprise, Ms. Fuller's mother was not entirely happy with the way she was portrayed in \"the awful [first] book.\" Who could blame her? It wasn't exactly a rousing endorsement of her mothering. She was often so wrapped up in her own mental illness that she had little left for her children. This follow up shows that both women, with time and space between, are able to forgive one another. Nicola Fuller had a difficult life but she's definitely a survivor. Under terrible pressures, she managed to overcome the obstacles of war, death, and loss of sanity, with humor and humility. Nicola and Alexandra have come to value one another and have a loving, respectful relationship. Maybe because so much has happened since the events of \"Don't Let's Go...,\" marriage and children of her own, Alexandra can now genuinely appreciate her mother. She certainly captures much more of her mother's sense of humor this time around. It's amazing, as we get older, how much smarter our parents seem to get."}, {"userName": "C.G.

The title and cover photo immediately hooked me. This memoir largely centers around the life of \"Nicola Fuller of Central Africa\", the eccentric mother of the author. For fifty years, we follow this pukka-pukka-sahib (most excellent mistress) and her family as political conditions and war force the Fullers from Kenya to Rhodesia to Malawi, and finally, Zambia where they run a banana and fish farm. Nicola is clearly a hypomanic whose world view and illusions of grandeur keep the reader engaged and giggling. Nicola blossoms from an enchanted land where a little girl can truly have a chimpanzee as a best friend (and that's just the start of the zaniness). But Africa has its dark sides: war, strife, disease, snakes, and loss. These forces take their toll on the family and Nicola's soul. Even so, her indomitable spirit gathers strength from the Tree of Forgetfulness, the heart of her current home in Zambia. I'd love to share a cocktail with this woman as she sits surrounded by her pack of dogs. She has seen and done so much."}, {"userName": "Sharon Huether", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3534528-sharon-huether", "userReview": "Cocktail Hour Under The Tree of Forgetfulness..

In Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, Alexandra Fuller braids a multilayered narrative around the perfectly lit, Happy Valley-era Africa of her mother's childhood; the boiled cabbage grimness of her father's English childhood; and the darker, civil war-torn Africa of her own childhood. At its heart, this is the story of Fuller's mother, Nicola. Born on the Scottish Isle of Skye and raised in Kenya, Nicola holds dear the kinds of values most likely to get you hurt or killed in Africa: loyalty to blood, passion for land, and a holy belief in the restorative power of all animals. Fuller interviewed her mother at length and has captured her inimitable voice with remarkable precision. Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness is as funny, terrifying, exotic, and unselfconscious as Nicola herself. We see Nicola and Tim Fuller in their lavender-colored honeymoon period, when East Africa lies before them with all the promise of its liquid equatorial light, even as the British Empire in which they both believe wanes. But in short order, an accumulation of mishaps and tragedies bump up against history until the couple finds themselves in a world they hardly recognize. We follow the Fullers as they hopscotch the continent, running from war and unspeakable heartbreak, from Kenya to Rhodesia to Zambia, even returning to England briefly. But just when it seems that Nicola has been broken entirely by Africa, it is the African earth itself that revives her. A story of survival and madness, love and war, loyalty and forgiveness, Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness is an intimate exploration of the author's family. In the end, we find Nicola and Tim at a coffee table under their Tree of Forgetfulness on the banana and fish farm where they plan to spend their final days. In local custom, the Tree of Forgetfulness is where villagers meet to resolve disputes and it is here that the Fullers at last find an African kind of peace. Following the ghosts and dreams of memory, Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness is Alexandra Fuller at her very best.", "title": "Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10338691-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347821647l/10338691.jpg", "reviews": 1328, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13900.Alexandra_Fuller", "name": "Alexandra Fuller"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10338691-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12986632-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13400384-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11435616-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16023857-onder-de-boom-van-vergetelheid", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11525635-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24687.Don_t_Let_s_Go_to_the_Dogs_Tonight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83477.Scribbling_the_Cat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22529144-leaving-before-the-rains-come", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2074104.The_Legend_of_Colton_H_Bryant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32571614-quiet-until-the-thaw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
