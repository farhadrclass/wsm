With Thunder Point nearing its end, I was so very excited to see that she\u2019s starting a new series, with yet another small town community at its center. It was clear from the start that Sullivan\u2019s Crossing has a whole lot of potential, with so many interesting characters already prepared to take the spotlight. What We Find, however, wasn\u2019t quite up to Robyn Carr\u2019s standards. Centered around Maggie and Cal, What We Find shows both of them during their most vulnerable time. They both have reasons to be a little bit lost and disillusioned. As a neurosurgeon, Maggie is being sued for malpractice, her practice is closed and her boyfriend of two years abandoned her after a miscarriage. She goes to regroup to the only place she feels completely safe \u2013 her father\u2019s camping ground and store at Sullivan\u2019s Crossing. There she meets Cal, a homeless hiker with secrets. She is distrustful at first even though Cal tries very hard to help her and her father. She is curious about his story and more than willing to pry, but Cal keeps his reasons for wandering very close to his chest. Although Carr\u2019s characters are very much alive, What We Find suffers from a serious lack of plot. Nothing actually happens in it. We follow these people as they slowly uncover each other\u2019s secrets and admit their feelings for each other. I usually prefer romances with very little tension and angst, but there has to be something to keep me engaged. Aside from the secondary characters like Maggie\u2019s father Sully or neighbor Tom, there was very little to keep me turning those pages.I think I was mostly bothered by the lack of chemistry between Maggie and Cal. It didn\u2019t seem like one of those romances that are meant to be, but rather a marriage of convenience for two wounded souls. Books with no tension and very little plot have to make up for it somehow, and a strong magnetic pull between characters is usually a way to do it. Unfortunately, What We Find was mostly unsuccessful in that, and almost every other department.The book was saved, as so many books are, by Therese Plummer\u2019s fantastic narration. Yes, she\u2019s one of those narrators who could read grocery lists and make them interesting. She brings characters to life and ads something uniquely hers to every story she reads. I will read the next book in this series because I trust Carr to make it a whole lot better than this unfortunate beginning, and as always, I\u2019ll choose Plummer to read it to me."}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "Originally posted on The Book NymphoMaggie Sullivan returns to her father's place at Sullivan's Crossing to recharge after an extremely stressful period. She's a neurosurgeon who's being sued, her practice is being dissolved and her boyfriend just walked away. What starts as a plan to spend a few days seeking respite turns into a much longer search for grounding and what's really important. I liked this story that seems to meander without purpose until it finds one. Maggie is an interesting character who, despite all her issues, never loses her footing. Cal Jones is a man of mystery who stays at the camp well beyond his planned few days and they seem to be on parallel paths in their separate journeys. I also liked this unique community and learned a lot about the lifestyle of a small Colorado mountain town. This was a strong start to a new series with a collection of characters I grew to like and appreciate. Maggie and Cal were beautifully crafted and I especially liked how their relationship developed. The story dragged at times as there was more a bit more telling than doing. However, the series shows promise as it has the signature sense of community typically found in a Carr story. 3.5 stars(I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review)"}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "There was no real angst or anything else really moving this story. It's about two pretty bland people finding each other, enjoying having sex with each other, and getting married. The end. Seriously.I loved Carr's Virgin River series, so I tend to pop up and read her standalones now and again hoping that I can capture some of the magic from that series in her other works. But this book was not that interesting. Maggie Sullivan is a neurosurgeon who suffers a breakdown after being dumped by her long term self involved boyfriend as well as dealing with the aftermath of a miscarriage. To top all of that all off, she's also being sued by the parents of a teenage boy she could not save. She decides to retreat to her father's store/camp grounds in Colorado (Sullivan's Crossing). Maggie gets there and ends up pretty much hiding from friends/family and herself while staying in Sullivan's Crossing.The book jumps back and forth between Maggie and her love interest named Cal Jones. A running (not funny theme) is Maggie trying to figure out what Cal stands for in the book, I have to say the reveal of his full name made me cringe in sympathy. We find out that Cal is also running from some things, but Carr tries to build it up into something big that may separate the two lovers from each other, but that does not happen. There are other characters in this book, but honestly I was more interested in Maggie's stepfather Walter. Maggie who is 37 by the way, pretty much rails at her father, mother, and anyone dumb enough to listen to her about how hard her life was and how angry she was that her mother divorced her father and rarely let her see him. But then you read she did get to see her dad for months at a time and honestly I started running out of sympathy for Maggie. Poor you, you had a well to do stepfather who honestly loved you and your mother and your mother wanted something more than just running a general store with her husband in the woods. At least Maggie's father finally had enough and told her about herself (the only part of the book I liked).There's also a random kidnapping plot point in this thing, as well as a woman who is being charged as an escort that totally made me wonder why in the world Carr included that in this book. Maybe even she realized that the two leads were boring. The writing and flow kind of chug along. I really wish I could say more than just I was bored. But honestly, I was just bored. The end eventually comes and I was relieved. I definitely will not be reading any more books in this series."}, {"userName": "Brandie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132341-brandie", "userReview": "A Robyn Carr book is like comfort food to me. She has the ability to sweep me away to a quaint town or country setting to get lost in the charming lives of it's residents. I first fell in love with Carr's writing when I read Virgin River, and wanted nothing more than to live in a place just like it. This book was just as lovely and adorable as I've come to expect from the author. I spent most of my time reading the book with a big smile on my face, even laughing out loud at some of the humorous moments. I loved the characters and the story and was completely charmed by the setting. My only complaint was that it became a little long winded and drawn out in the middle of the book, where it started losing steam, and I found myself starting to get a bit bored. But things happened to quickly pull me back into the story, and it won me over in the end.If you're looking for a romantic, witty, charming story- you'll find this book is the perfect getaway!ARC kindly provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jacob Proffitt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt", "userReview": "Man, I'm having a hard time starting this review. Some of that is past experience with Carr's other work. This story is much closer to a traditional romance than those others have been because there's a single central couple and we stay exclusively in the PoV of the main characters. So this was a much closer match to my reading preferences and much more firmly a romance story.Carr still feels uncomfortable with that focus, however, as a lot of community and extra drama bits are thrown in often enough that the romance still feels somehow secondary. Both main characters, for example, are in the midst of mid-life crises and ready to redefine who they are and what they want out of life. So despite tagging this as a Romance, it's an uncomfortable fit.I never did connect fully with either Cal or Maggie. Which is probably why some of the events felt manufactured or less serious than they would otherwise have warranted. It felt more like I was watching a TV show than reading a book, if that makes any sense. This was particularly noticeable when Cal reaches his catharsis moment and my only thought was \"oh good, now we can get back to him and Maggie.\"Most telling about my engagement to the story, though, is that I put the book down for days at a time and had to explicitly remind myself that I hadn't finished with it, yet. Not that I was reluctant to pick it up or anything. It wasn't like that. It's just that other normal, every-day events would happen and it'd take time for me to realize that I was in the middle of the story and hadn't reached the end, yet.So this was enjoyable enough, but not outstanding. A solid three stars.A note about Steamy: As with other Carr stories, the explicit scenes are over-the-top enough that I had a hard time taking them seriously. There are maybe three, but my long delays between reading and eye-roll tendency means I can't be certain about the number or length. Middle of my steam tolerance, at any rate."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "We begin the story in Denver where we meet Maggie Sullivan a thirty-seven year old neurosurgeon who has had a rough year. She is emotionally drained and financially strained. When her Doctor and co-worker tell her to take a leave, she packs up her bags and heads to her father\u2019s place in Sullivan\u2019s Crossing.Sullivan\u2019 Crossing hosts a general store and campground set along the Continental Divide trails in Colorado. It is owned by Maggie\u2019s father Sully. Right away, I loved the setting for What We Find. The campground sits on the edge of a lake and is surrounded by woods and trails. I love small-town settings and was drawn to the characters we meet, including Maggie\u2019s father, Sully.Maggie is suffering on so many fronts, and Carr takes great care in fleshing her out. Underneath the hurt is a compassionate, bright, witty character I came to respect. Cal Jones a camper soon befriends her after Sully has a heart attack. A short break turns into an extended leave as Maggie spends the summer helping her father and reevaluating her life. Carr brought the daily life of this small camp town to life making me long to pack my bags and touch nature.The friendship between Cal and Maggie slowly simmers into something more. The relationship began with snark and witty quips but evolved into something beautiful. Cal is a bit of a mystery and Maggie questions his aid. He refuses to say what Cal stands for, and of course, Maggie tries to find out by calling him Calvin, Clyde, Clinton and more it was hilarious. Their friendship soon turns to sweet kisses and I enjoyed watching it all unfold. Carr gives us Cal\u2019s story and it touched me. She writes genuine characters and allows the reader to connect giving the stories and townsfolk depth. The interaction between Maggie and Cal felt genuine and comfortable like a perfect summer night.Copy provided by publisher.

I thought maybe the author's style was just a bit too wordy, and that she skimped just a wee bit on the romance... but I was in dire need of a well written story that I could lose myself in, and this filled the bill. I loved neurosurgeon Maggie--a very strong/admirable character and loved the hero Cal, who had quite the backstory. I enjoyed all the supporting characters and plots, and I can see similarities between Sullivan's Crossing and Carr's previous two small town series.

Maggie is a neurosurgeon in a busy Denver hospital. She has a boyfriend who is just as busy as she is. When her co-workers in her practice are accused of fraud, then she is sued by the parents of a patient she lost, her stress goes through the roof. Add in an unexpected pregnancy that ends in a miscarriage, a boyfriend who is a total jerk about it, and her emotions are all over the place. She finally arrives at the point where she knows she has to get away, so that's what she does. She goes home to Sullivan's Crossing, where her father runs a campground and general store. An absence of judging and the opportunity to share in his simple life gives her the respite she needs. Then Sully is taken ill, and she has to step up and take care of him, plus the campground. She couldn't do it without the help of his friends, including Cal Jones, a mysterious camper who is eager to do whatever is needed.Cal is an attorney who was very successful. He had it all - great reputation, nice house, and the love of his beautiful wife. Then she came down with a devastating illness, and by the time it was all over his material possessions didn't hold the same meaning any longer. Feeling lost and lonely, he set out to hike some of the trails around the Continental Divide, which brought him to Sullivan's Crossing. While waiting for the trails to warm up, he finds comfort in the people around him.Maggie is suspicious of Cal at first. First, she thinks he's homeless, and that he certainly has no direction in his life. He seems content to just hang out, read his books, and chat with Sully. She can't deny that he's good looking, and that she feels a certain attraction to him. When he jumps in to help with the campground while Sully is recovering, she gets a chance to get to know him. What she finds is a charming, well-read man with a sense of humor and an amazing sense of calm around him. Their friendship starts with banter and teasing and an attraction that simmers just below the surface. As the weeks go on, that simmer grows stronger, and pretty soon the kisses lead to more.I loved seeing the relationship develop as each of them shares what has brought them to this point in their lives. Cal gives Maggie a quiet port where she can look at her life and the choices that are open to her. He doesn't push or direct or even suggest, he's just there when she wants to talk or just be together. Maggie gets Cal out of his funk and to start living again. Neither one pushes the other to give more than they are ready for, but instead provides the support needed to deal with their issues. I loved seeing them back each other up when complications would arise. I especially loved seeing Maggie dealing with Cal's parents in such a kind, yet matter-of-fact way. It was just what Cal needed to realize that, though his parents are part of him, they don't define him. I really enjoyed seeing that their relationship grew with mature discussions and understanding of what's important, without any major arguments or drama. The ending was sweet and romantic and just right for them.I loved the setting of Sullivan's Crossing. The people are fun, diverse and interesting. The stories of the various campers who came through the crossing were varied and fun. I loved Sully and his unquestioning love for Maggie. They had their issues at the beginning, but her extended time with him gave them a chance to resolve them. I enjoyed how everyone around him helped with his recovery. His friend Tom was great, as a single father of four and a busy life that wasn't too busy for his friends. His ex-wife's problems gave Cal a chance to dip his toes back into the world of lawyering. Tom's son also provided tension at the end with a search and rescue mission that had an unexpected twist for Maggie. I am looking forward to the next book and seeing what's in store for the people at Sullivan's Crossing."}, {"userName": "Bambi Unbridled", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3234139-bambi-unbridled", "userReview": "I have been experiencing burn out with contemporary romance this year. I think my biggest problem was the prevalence of new adult heroines... immature girls with lots of drama that made me feel old. So I thought I would try some new authors, those who write more mature female leads who are ensconced in their professional lives. I figured I would have more in common with these types of heroines.Unfortunately, this book didn't do it for me. It started out okay. Maggie is a successful neurosurgeon who has experienced a personal tragedy, and is being sued for malpractice. But as the story got going, I really felt like I was watching one of those movies that comes on the Lifetime Channel. (They really aren't my thing either.) Overall, I found Maggie to be boring and I lost my connection to her very quickly.I did like the hero, California Jones, lawyer and widower. The story about his wife was sad and moving, and he seemed like a genuinely good guy. I didn't find anything about him to be exciting though. Even the intimacy between the couple seemed more clinical than steamy or romantic. However, I totally lost respect for his character when he started talking about legal procedure because he was just flat out wrong. (Discussed below)The story meandered along at a snail's pace, except for a small blip of excitement around 35%. I wanted something to happen to spike my interest, but it didn't and I ended up losing interest all together. By 76%, I realized I was skimming pretty often and I decided to stop reading.I think the final nail in the coffin for me was the incorrect legal information that I kept coming across. For example, Cal is telling Maggie that she should not testify... but this is a civil trial, she does not have a choice. Either party in a civil case can be compelled to testify. Then a couple paragraphs later, Cal tells Maggie that if he were the plaintiff's attorney, he would use all her prior lawsuits against her. But a jury does not get to consider prior bad acts in a malpractice suit. There were a number of these mistakes, and they are the reason I usually stay away from books that cross my professional arena. I can't help picking apart glaring mistakes to legal practice and procedure... and its pretty clear that this book has criminal procedure confused with civil procedure. They are quite different.Otherwise, I am not giving up on this author. I have heard good things about her Virgin River series, so I think I will give it a shot and see if another story piques my interest.I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. 2 stars / 2 flames."}, {"userName": "Laura (Kyahgirl)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2906277-laura-kyahgirl", "userReview": "3/5; 3 stars; BI enjoy all the books I read by this author, some more than others.

Although, it was a bit slower paced the story and the characters held my attention and definitely have me wanting to read more about the highly entertaining and sometimes quirky inhabitants of this Colorado community. It held a simple and sweet appeal that was a nice distraction from the many drama-filled romances circulating these days. Maggie Sullivan was a character that I enjoyed a lot! As a surgeon that had tons of problems going on in her professional and personal life she escapes back to her own little piece of heaven, Sullivans' Crossing. Sullivan's Crossing holds her childhood memories, her father and the land that she loves. I loved how Maggie dealt with her taciturn father who wouldn't know how to coddle his daughter if he tried. Her personality fit in with these townspeople perfectly. Even when she met Cal and fell for him hard she was affectionate and open, but never mushy. I enjoyed Cal Jones immensely. The poor guy was trying to come to terms with a tragic past and a very unusual upbringing. He was just a great guy. Willing to pitch in and help without being asked he just did what needed to be done to help Sully (the owner and Maggie's dad) out when he suffered a heart attack. He expected nothing in return and even put up with some rude comments and observations with good humor. Cal was exactly what Maggie needed. His laid back approach to life and easy calm helped to balance Maggie. He brought out a playful side to her that we definitely didn't see in the beginning. I loved how he kept her guessing his full name throughout most of the book. I chuckled every time she spit out an even more outlandish suggestion than the one before. Their romance definitely wasn't a flash with sparks and sizzle. It was more of an easy, you've-always-been-the-one coupling. That's not to say it didn't come across as real because it did. It felt to me like they belonged together and there was no doubt it would be and it would always be them.

Robyn is my favorite author and I devour everything she writes. I've never read a Robyn Carr book I didn't love. WHAT WE FIND is an awesome start to what I'm sure will become a wonderful series.WHAT WE FIND takes place in Colorado and the way Robyn Carr describes the scenery had me feeling like I was sitting right there in the woods by the campground and enjoying a warm fire. I could almost taste the s'mores. The plot is multi layered and will have you not being able to put this wonderful story down until the very last page.Maggie Sullivan's life has gone to hell in a hand basket. She needs to get away. She is a neurosurgeon and her life has been non stop and hectic for years. She is being sued, her boyfriend has just dumped her, and two of her partners are under investigation. She decides to go and visit her dad, Sully at his campground. While she is there she meets Cal who is also taking a break from his life. They have many things in common but don't realize it at first. Maggie actually believes Cal is homeless but you know what they say about judging a book by its cover right?My heart was really breaking for Maggie and all she went through in WHAT WE FIND. The way Robyn Carr writes, it was as if I had known Maggie for years and I found myself wishing and hoping she wouldn't get hurt anymore. Her ex Andrew was a total jerk towards her and I just wanted to reach in the pages and slap him silly. I truly got lost while reading this beautiful story and found myself in Colorado with Cal and Maggie and all the wonderful secondary characters who I know are going to become my friends as the series continues.

It was an easy, pleasant, low-key read that is fairly typical of Ms. Carr\u2019s writing style, but I think I really expected more from her debut hardcover release and the inaugural book of a brand new series. It was nice, but neither the characters nor the plot really sparked off the pages for me. Reading it wasn\u2019t a chore, but neither was I stoked to get back to it each time I had to put it down. After reading the author\u2019s books for as long as I have, it just didn\u2019t offer anything new, unique, or exciting, not only in comparison to her other titles but also in general. I did like the atmosphere of Sullivan\u2019s Crossing, but it didn\u2019t really live up to Virgin River for me or maybe even Thunder Point. What We Find is the first of Ms. Carr\u2019s books I\u2019ve read (beginning with Virgin River) in which the hero\u2019s and heroine\u2019s are the only POVs presented. On the one hand, it\u2019s nice to have the focus more fully on the main couple rather than secondary characters, but at the same time, it sometimes felt like the author didn\u2019t know what to do with them. To me, their story felt very ordinary and pedestrian. I like to read romance (or any book for that matter) for the escapism factor, and this one just didn\u2019t give me that. Our hero\u2019s and heroine\u2019s lives felt a little too much like real life to me to be entirely appealing. They\u2019re both doing some soul-searching, which along with their decision-making, takes place at a snail\u2019s pace. It\u2019s realistic, but not very compelling reading, IMHO. There just wasn\u2019t enough drama or conflict to keep me riveted to the pages and really excited about the book or this new series.Maggie is a talented neurosurgeon who has just experienced several stressful situations one right after the other. Her practice disbanded after her partners were accused of fraud and malpractice. While she knew nothing of what they did, it still reflected somewhat badly on her. Then she was sued by the family of a teenager who died while under her care. Add in an unexpected pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage and a boyfriend who was less than sympathetic about any of these things, and Maggie was more than ready for a break from her hectic life. She went back to her childhood home of Sullivan\u2019s Crossing, a little campsite and general store run by her father in the rural Colorado mountains. Even though her mother hated it there, the Crossing has always been a source of solace to Maggie. She only intended to stay for a couple of weeks, but she no sooner arrived than her father had a heart attack. This leads her to stay a lot longer than planned not only to look after her father and help him run things while he\u2019s recovering, but also to figure out what to do with the rest of her life. She enjoys the slow, relaxed pace of life at the Crossing and thinks she would like to stay there long-term, but at the same time, she misses being in the operating room. I\u2019d like to say that there\u2019s more to Maggie, but if there was it eluded me. She\u2019s basically just a doctor who\u2019s gotten burned out by both her professional and personal trials and needs a break. She also needs time to think and decide what she wants out of life, and she spends basically the entire book figuring that out with a couple of mildly dramatic moments to punctuate her soul-searching, but they\u2019re few and far between.Cal is pretty much doing the same thing. He lost his wife two years earlier and much like Maggie he\u2019s left behind a lucrative profession while trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life and to once and for all say goodbye to his first love so he can move on. We don\u2019t really start learning these things about Cal until probably about a quarter of the way into the book. Until then, he\u2019s just some oddball vagabond who\u2019s camping at the Crossing long-term and planning a long hike when the spring thaw comes. He\u2019s a real sweetheart and a stand-up guy who helps out for free while Maggie\u2019s dad is recovering from his heart attack. I really sympathized with Cal in what he went through losing his wife. I could also relate to his love for books and his idolizing of Atticus Finch. He has a rather colorful backstory too, with a wacky, dysfunctional family life growing up. Even now, he\u2019s still dealing with that to some extent. It\u2019s a wonder he\u2019s as normal as he is, considering how he was raised and who his parents were. I suppose that\u2019s a testament to Cal having his head on straight and learning where to draw healthy boundaries in his relationships as an adult. I liked Cal and felt like he had a slight bit more depth to his character than Maggie, but ultimately he wasn\u2019t really a stand-out character for me either. He takes equally as much time to figure things out as Maggie does, which was a little frustrating, but I did enjoy his sweet, charming, easy-going personality.Maggie\u2019s and Cal\u2019s relationship was pretty much as simple and ordinary as their individual life challenges. I really would have liked to see more buildup in their romance. Cal and Maggie seem like they're nothing more than friends, hanging out in the evenings around a campfire or on the front porch of the store. Then next thing you know, they're suddenly thinking about kissing each other. Supposedly they've been attracted to one other from their first meeting, but nothing of that nature comes out in their introspections until that very moment. Then mere hours later, they have their first love scene. It all felt like it came from out of nowhere. Until Cal goes on his hike to say goodbye to his wife, it's a no-strings, no-commitments, easy-going, sex-only relationship. I could understand that he wasn\u2019t ready to get more involved until he found closure, but this just isn\u2019t a very romantic way to start a relationship IMHO. I would rather have seen him perhaps fighting his attraction to Maggie, maybe feeling a little conflicted about it or even like he was betraying his first love or something, then coming to terms with it after his hike. Even once he returns and makes it clear that he\u2019s interested in Maggie as more than just a fling, they still make no promises or commitments to one another, and much like their individual journeys, it takes the entire book for them to get to the point of saying the three little words that are integral to any romance and to realize they want something more permanent. During this time, they don\u2019t really experience any relationship conflict. It\u2019s merely a matter of will they or won\u2019t they get to that point of a stronger commitment. It just doesn't work well for me when there's not something greater at stake in the relationship. It was nice and of course, there\u2019s the requisite happy ending, but there were few of what I would call truly romantic moments between Maggie and Cal. I do enjoy Robyn Carr\u2019s books for their feel-good quality and their small-town atmospheres, but there are certain quirks to her writing style that really tend to bug me. Sometimes I can overlook them when the story is really strong, but other times, like with this book, they tend to stand out a little more. I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that I sometimes wish she would dig a little deeper with her characters and plots. Oftentimes, it feels like she\u2019s just skimming the surface, almost telling things from an omniscient narrator perspective rather than delving into the really deep POV that I prefer. She also has a tendency to tell her stories more in dialogue rather than introspection, which can make the conversations a little long-winded at times. That much dialogue wouldn\u2019t be so bad if she were more attentive to blocking, but more often than not, she goes on for paragraphs or even pages with nothing more than the verbal back and forth going on and little action taking place in between. There are many times when I can see places where a little touch or a facial expression would really go a long way toward creating a stronger connection with the reader (or at least with this reader, anyway :-)). Also her penchant for list-making, long lists of items or actions, can become a bit tedious.I know that I\u2019ve expressed a fair bit of criticism of this book, and IMHO, it does have its weaknesses. However, I did mostly enjoy it for what it was. Since my husband is from Colorado, I have a soft spot for the state, and although Sullivan\u2019s Crossing doesn\u2019t yet exhibit all the charm and life of Virgin River or Thunder Point, I could see it eventually growing on me. Although I\u2019ve become a pretty big fan of her Virgin River books in particular, I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like Ms. Carr hit the first one of that series out of the ballpark either. It took a couple of books for me to warm up to her characters and her writing style, so maybe it will be the same with this new series. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend shelling out the dough for the hardcover on this one unless you\u2019re a hard-core fan of Ms. Carr\u2019s, but those who are will probably enjoy it. Most of the time, a new book series will leave me with an impression as to who one or more of the future heroes and/or heroines will be, but I\u2019m hard-pressed to name anyone right now who might be. Whoever it is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll give it a try. I just hope that the author ups the stakes in the relationship department with the next couple of the series.Note: I received a copy of this book from the author's publicist via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/627337-tina", "userReview": "I started listening to this because every time I picked up a romance novel to read, it seemed to star these super angsty 20-somethings with impossible horrible tragic back life stories, hence I decided to make a foray into women's fict. I needed to read something with older people with some drama but without all the sturm und drang that 20-somethings in romance novels seem to face these days.This book fit the bill, but it was also rather unfocused in a way that while it was pleasant to listen to, it didn't really come together and click completely.It starts off well with Maggie, a neurosurgeon being hit on all sides: her practice is closing down because her partners are being investigated for fraud, she herself is being sued for wrongful death, she's just suffered a miscarriage and her long time boyfriend dumps her because she is too \"depressing\". So she decides to head back to her favorite place, the smallish town pretty much run by her father, Sully, where he acts as the postmaster, general store owner and all around caretaker. It is also a campground where hikers and campers come from all over to use as a base. She's always loved it there and descends on her father to lick her wounds, unwind, help out with the day to day stuff and figure out what she wants to do next.Also at the campground, staying for awhile is Cal Jones. He is a mysterious figure who helps out and is well liked. At first Maggie views him with suspicion, but soon they form a great friendship and then romance.There is no plot, really. Just a collection of things that happen while Maggie & Cal are helping out and trying to figure out their live. There are a lot of colorful supporting characters and walk on characters who help the story along. There are small incidents -- an escaped bull terrorizes the camp, a missing person with dementia wanders in -- and large emergencies -- a heart attack, a fall down a mountain, a girl is abducted -- all of them are told in a slice of life manner of \"I wonder what will happen today.\" In the meantime Maggie has to deal with her trial, her expertise as a doctor is called upon more than once and Cal's past is revealed in bits and pieces.Even though I didn't love it and the plot felt a little ephmeral, I still liked the low key nature of the narrative, it was nice hanging out with these people as they faced each day. Even if it is women's fict, it slides a little closer to the romance scale as Maggie and Cal grow closer, make peace with their past and figure out their future. Therese Plummer, the narrator, does a great job with the performance."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "4.5 StarsMaggie Sullivan is a successful and driven neurosurgeon, but several crises have come down on her all at once. A fraud scandal in her practice, a wrongful death suit, but the miscarriage of a baby she desperately wanted sends her reeling into grief. Worse is the fact that instead of offering support and understanding, Maggie\u2019s longtime boyfriend is relieved over the miscarriage and feels she should snap out of her depression (jerk!). Realizing that her life isn\u2019t what she wanted sends Maggie running for the safety of her father in Sullivan\u2019s Crossing. Sully, Maggie\u2019s father, is cantankerous and bristly, but Maggie loves him. Before Maggie\u2019s on the road to peace, though, Sully suffers a heart attack and Maggie\u2019s occupied with helping her father recuperate. No easy task with the stubborn man! Fortunately, friends and neighbors pitch in to help. Cal Jones, the good looking and mysterious camper staying at Sullivan\u2019s Crossing, steps up and helps their family with the store. He\u2019s enticing and confusing, and Maggie is completely drawn to him.Sullivan\u2019s Crossing is a campground, general store, and post office out where the Continental Divide Trail and the Colorado Trail intersect making it a perfect stop point to refuel for \u201cthru hikers\u201d tackling one of the long hikes, or perfect for campers wanting to escape for shorter trips. There\u2019s always people staying or hiking through, and the locals who work or frequent the place make for an interesting mix of people Carr had to write about. There was always something exciting going on from a rebellious bull stopping through to a naked hiker there were some fun times! There was also a bit of danger!Robyn Carr brings so many of her characters to life that I loved them and hated a few! Andrew, Maggie\u2019s ex-boyfriend was a self-centered prick! Maggie\u2019s mother was another self-centered person. I have very little respect for a parent who puts their own happiness before their child\u2019s and this is exactly what Phoebe did, and continued to do. Tom\u2019s ex-wife, Becky was another piece of work! Leaving your husband and four children (the youngest being four years old!!) because of malcontent, and then going back when it pleases you to visit and string your kids and ex along? That\u2019s seriously crappy, IMO. Unfortunately, Tom is very soft-hearted towards her. What\u2019s revealed about Becky and the way she handled herself with Cal ticked me off! I wish Cal would\u2019ve given her more of a set down. I\u2019m hoping Tom gets his own romance and book in the future. I couldn\u2019t help but adore this man! Tom lived and worked for his children, minding his busy schedule so he was there for them every day, whether with homework or busing them around to their various commitments. The attraction between Cal and Maggie was immediate, but their romance was a gradual process where they fell a little harder with every passing day. They revealed and shared their past wounds slowly, the reasons each were taking down time at Sullivan\u2019s Crossing, but taking comfort from each other along the way. Maggie had to sort through some issues with all of her parents, Sully, Phoebe, and Walter, her patient and loving stepfather. She also needed to find out exactly what she wanted from life and decide whether she could stay in neurosurgery, as the recent events burned her out. I was riveted by all the stories contained in What We Find. Robyn Carr has a way of making small town life so appealing with a wonderful mix of kind, loving, but quirky characters. Sullivan\u2019s Crossing felt like an actual place with Ms. Carr\u2019s vivid and beautiful descriptions of the scenery and life pulsing through there. I\u2019m a backpacker and sometimes camper, so Sullivan\u2019s Crossing is exactly the kind of place I\u2019d love to visit! I met Ms. Carr at the 2014 ALA and at that time I hadn\u2019t read any of her books. I wished I knew her awesomeness back then so I could\u2019ve appropriately fangirled at the time! Lol! I\u2019m anxious to find out the release date and focus of the second book in this new series! Until then I\u2019ll keep on going with Ms. Carr\u2019s Virgin River series.

I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. This is the first book in the Sullivan\u2019s Crossing series by the amazing Robyn Carr. I have been very curious about this new series and I eagerly dived into it. Maggie is dangerously close to meltdown territory after a series of huge professional dilemmas takes place, and her personal life implodes, as well. Heeding the advice of friends, Maggie decides to take a leave of absence and visit her father, Sully, who lives in the small community of Sullivan\u2019s Crossing in the Colorado mountains. But, her plan to escape from life\u2019s pressures are quickly dashed when Sully has a heart attack, and Maggie must tend to him, which means sticking around much longer than she had anticipated. Cal is in Sullivan\u2019s Crossing with a top secret mission of his own. He hangs round the general store helping with chores while Sully regains his strength, which gives him time to get to know Maggie. Initially, Maggie is wary of Cal, who seems like a man without direction, or goals, and no apparent need to work a real job. But, there is no denying an underlying attraction to him, and it could be that Cal is just the soothing balm Maggie needs right now. But, once the summer is over, will Cal move on? First of all, the setting for this book is perfect. While I consider myself more of a beach person, this book had me pining for the Colorado mountains. The slower pace of life is evident and I could feel the stress Maggie was under slowly begin to ease, the more times she spends here. This setback in her life also offers her the opportunities to address old resentments, which helps her strengthen her relationship with Sully, and realize the sacrifices he made for her. However, there were a few issues with this series debut, one of which, for me personally, was Cal\u2019s understated personality. He was too cool for school sometimes, personifying his parent\u2019s hippie background with a kind of laid back response to almost anything, which is charming at first, and his playful teasing draws Maggie out of her depression. But, he remains too calm even in life\u2019s most poignant moments, or in situations that are extremely heavy, dire, or dangerous, or just plain stressful or emotional. I wanted him to show some kind of righteous indignation on Maggie\u2019s behalf, to wipe away a few understandable tears, or feel his heart beat out of his chest during harrowing moments, but I never picked up that vibe from him, and it\u2019s a little odd for a person not to respond to those situations with more gusto. In real life, I think someone like Cal would drive me nuts. But, he is super sweet, too, and really comes through for some folks in a big way, and I knew he had a big, generous heart, which eventually won me over. I also appreciated that his character was a little offbeat, his unusual background, and his approach to Maggie and the building of their relationship. The other issue with the story was the pacing, which unfortunately is almost a death knell for this book, because of its sluggishness. I had a very hard time staying focused and fought hard not to skim over some areas. However, Maggie more than makes up for any of Cal\u2019s blandness, and single handedly saves the story with her exploits, which come out of nowhere sometimes, and are often hilarious or exhilarating, giving the story a strong shot in the arm at just the right moment. Maggie is the heart and soul of this story, and her journey to Sullivan's crossing, and all the trials she faced, will open her eyes to all there is to be thankful for, will teach her some very important life lessons, and open doors for her that are far more appealing than the life she was living in Denver. I also enjoyed the quotes that started off each chapter, and loved seeing two people with huge, life altering issues to face down, helping each other move upward and onward to bigger and better things, learning what is most important in life, accepting that fate has plans for them, they didn\u2019t expect, and finding the courage to embark on a new path, working things out as they go, and are rewarded with peace, contentment and true love. Although, the road was a bit rocky, overall, this is a solid begging for this new series. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Ravaged by work situations, not of her own making, Maggie Sullivan retreats to the one place she knows is safe\u2026her father\u2019s camp ground, Sullivan\u2019s Crossing, a base camp for the trails to and from the Continental Divide.Maggie shows up unannounced but is welcomed with open arms only to have her father quickly suffer a heart ache putting her in charge of getting the camp ready for the hiking season.

This book seemed to have a quietness about it, one where things built slowly where all of a sudden you couldn't turn the page fast enough. At the start it seemed like Maggie's life was starting to get out of control, she was at the perfect storm where so many things were going wrong in her life and she needed a life line, one she found when she went home to her father and the magical campground of her childhood.I wasn't too sure about this Maggie, she didn't seem comfortable back home even if it was the place she choose. It didn't help that soon after she got there her father needed her special skills. Sully was a very bad patient and it was fun to see him verbally spar with Maggie.Cal was another one that I wasn't too sure of at first. With his comments I wondered if Maggie wasn't on to something with her thoughts. It was only as we learned nuggets of Cal's past that I could start to laugh at what Maggie assumed. Cal was hiding so much and his life in flux as much as Maggie's.Cal and Maggie's courtship was very unorthodox, sitting on the porch of the campground chatting every night, a break while Cal dealt with some of his issues, Sully butting in giving advice to both of them and finally Cal and Maggie figuring out what they wanted by dipping their toes back into their professions and how that could work with a relationship.
