On her latest assignment she steals a relic from an ex-serial killer vampire and ends his life. Except this time she has a close call as the vampire's client slides out of the elevator while Cassandra is making her exit. While entering the elevator Cassandra bumps into the alluring Aimee, and the two feel an unmistakable spark between them. Cursing herself Cassandra heads quickly out of town.Aimee is a full-blooded white witch and a rarity in the supernatural world. She is blood-bonded against her will to the vampire Frank who is a supernatural trafficker. When Cassandra is the next asset in Frank's cross hairs Aimee decides its time for her escape. Entering a powerful game of cat and mouse Cassandra is ready to rescue the damsel in distress but there are more than one betrayals and plots in the making. This was my first read by the author and WOW this was definitely a page-turner and action-packed with descriptive scenes. The reader travels with the characters to the glittering and bustling Las Vegas casinos all the way to the countryside in west Texas. There were also an array of supernatural beings which made the novel very interesting- not just vampires. We encounter a dhamphir, witch, Anubis, vampires, and enhanced humans. I loved the characters and their story was incredibly sweet and powerful. Cassandra is such a kick-ass heroine who uses her stilettos as weapons, fights evil, and manages a normal life with her mother and a part-time job as a waitress. Aimee is a delicate but indomitable force and the reader gets to experience her full ascent to power and her release from bondage. The chemistry between the two is what really tips this novel off the scale. Cass and Aimee have such an untainted and passionate connection that I was definitely swooning! I plan to continue with this series and hopefully read more of Cass and Aimee along the way! I definitely recommend this to readers of well-written paranormal romance with two women who will warm your heart."}, {"userName": "Smash", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1271418-smash", "userReview": "I was excited when Rhiannon released this short story in the Pretty When She... universe. Aimee and Cass are introduced near the end of the second book, but they made a serious impact. I immediately felt their connection and dedication to one another. I'm so happy that Rhiannon decided to write the story of how these two characters met. It was action-packed, heart-warming and cray-zay! We meet some serious villainous bastards, as is always the case in Rhiannon's books. I was sickened by these horrible creatures and their warped ideas of fun and pleasure. We get glimpses of the unique aspects of Aimee and Cass, the things they are capable of, the hardships they have endured, and their fragile yet strong personas. Their hearts collide and while they don't understand the connection, at first, they use that bond to save each other, in very different yet similar ways. They are a duo that packs a supernatural punch! And I adore the love and passion for their mate that seeps from their pores!Favorite Quote\"Be careful, Cassandra. Be very, very careful. Sometimes, the knight in shinning armor gets eaten by the dragon.\"\"Oh, I'm not a knight in shinning armor,\" Cassandra corrected him. \"I'm the ninja sneaking up the back stairs.\""}, {"userName": "Mihir", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229652-mihir", "userReview": "I decided to read this novella before jumping into the series because I have never read the author's work before. With this being a prequel and the length made it easy in my current scenario. The story features Cassandra who is a Dhamphir and works as a procurer of special items. Aimee is a witch who is beholden to a person who doesn't have her best interests at heart. This novella deals with how these ladies come together to find solace and strength in each other whilst also learning more about who their friends or foes are. A dark, action-packed story which ensconces a love story that is apparent from the beginning but doesn't overwhelm the main storyline. I'll be reading the main trilogy of which the first 2 books are out and feature a different protagonist."}, {"userName": "Anna  (Bananas!)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas", "userReview": "I'm wondering if I would've enjoyed this more if I knew the series. Or maybe I'm just a romance junkie and this didn't have enough lovin' for me. As a one-off read this was decent. The characters of Aimee and Cassandra, a witch and a dhamphir, were interesting and the action in the latter part of the story was done well. Overall though I didn't connect with this world.Oh!

I've never read this author but thought the synopsis sounded interesting... Boy was I pleasantly surprised with how wonderful the book turned out to be! Cassandra is a dhamphir (vampire/mortal offspring). On the side from her normal job of being a waitress (I believe.. this was brushed over and not a big part of the story), she is a thief of relics for a price. Aimee is an extremely rare full-blooded witch... too bad she is tied to a vampire that treats her just like another one of his belongings. Things change for both women when they just happen to bump into each other, starting a long entangled web of events (sort of). I don't want to giveaway any of the story, which is hard to do since its so captivating and every page is important and makes you want to flip to the next one just to see what is going to happen and how things are going to end up. Such a great novella!!!While it is a 'romance' per se, there wasn't a whole lot of romance in it besides the development of the characters relationship, which was more emotional than anything. Still it grabbed me and made me want to keep reading to find out what happens to each character and their relationship.**ARC given for HONEST Review for Rainbow Gold Reviews - http://www.rainbowgoldreviews.wordpre...**"}, {"userName": "Lorre", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6349980-lorre", "userReview": "This prequel is an amazing start to the Pretty When She Dies series!The story is about how Cass and Aimee met and fell in love.From what I read on the author's site this couple will appear more in the trilogy.

Killing vampires on the go, is just another advantage of her work. During one such jobs, she comes in contact (accidental bump) with a very rare full-blooded witch and immediately magic flows between the two, along with the desire. Cass doesn't know that that her current job - the relic that she stole belongs to this witch's vampire master, Frank.Aimee is a full-blooded witch, who is enslaved by the blood bond of a vampire, Frank. Aimee can't work against Frank because of their bond, even though she is much more powerful than him. When she accidentally collides with a beautiful woman, she knows that she is a dhamphir. And her blood can break the bond between Frank and her. But that is not the only reason Aimee wants to see that woman again. She felt some hot desire that she never felt before when she touched her. So, when Frank plans to capture Cassandra, Aimee contacts her in dream and asks her to come, explaining the situation.Is Aimee's request enough for Cass to risk her own life? Even if Cass helps by going into a trap knowingly, will Aimee get rid of her vampire 'monster' master, who is also planning to collect Cass to add to his possessions?As I said before, this is my first Rhiannon's novel, although I was trying to read her books like months ago. I have even bought her books and kept. But, as always my life has been very busy lately and now, I found my reading time somehow.The two main characters, Cass and Aimee, will entrance the readers to never stop reading. Their attitude and powers made me want to learn more about them. I think I have to start reading other books soon. Frank is just pure evil. I just hate that guy for the way he behaved towards Aimee. Rhiannon has created the villain more horrible that we would want to hurt him ourselves. That's a real success to a character.About the writing, the flow is smooth, the pace is fast and the narration is awesome! One would be happy for Aimee, enjoy the toughness in Cassandra and feel the need to kick Frank. The action scenes were brought out so well, that I was clutching my Kindle so hard and reading with my face so near to the Kindle, as if I am going to miss something if I keep my Kindle in some distance from my eyes.Favorite character: Cass' mother. With her forgetfulness and love towards Cass, she made me feel the love that she felt in me too. Such characters are very hard NOT to love.Favorite scene: The action scene in the climax scene. Excellent narration!This book is an action-filled short novella from \"Pretty when she Dies\" series, but it can be read as a standalone.Recommended for fans of fantasy and paranormal romance readers!--More reviews can be found at Books Are Magic."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "I\u2019m such a fan of the Pretty When She Dies series by the super talented Rhiannon Frater, so hell yeah I was excited to read this novella about Cass and Aimee. Pretty When They Collide is technically a prequel, because the events take place prior to the first book. However, the characters do not appear until the second book, Pretty When She Kills. Personally, I liked reading the first two books before this one, just because I was already familiar other characters mentioned in it. You can read it at anytime, though, and it won\u2019t ruin anything.Cassandra is a dhamphir (half vampire, half human). Thanks to her good genes, she used to model in Paris. But now, she\u2019s in the business of stealing rare artifacts, and being a dhamphir makes her damn good at it. I love Cass. She\u2019s a badass, leather wearing chick; but she\u2019s also loyal and compassionate. She\u2019s so good to her mother, whose mind has become fragile due to living with vampires for so many years. I can\u2019t help but want to hug both of them at times.Amiee isn\u2019t just a witch, she\u2019s a very rare and powerful full-blooded witch. Unfortunately she\u2019s bound to Frank, a cruel, narcissistic vampire who is a dealer of monsters (e.g. werewolves, dhamphirs\u2026). Frank keeps Aimee on a short leash, and Aimee would love nothing more than to be free of him. I love Aimee, too. She\u2019s been under Frank\u2019s nasty thumb for so many years, but she still has that fire that keeps her from seeming weak. She\u2019s not only strong magically, but mentally as well. Even if she may not completely feel it at times. She has hope, though, after a chance encounter with Cass.As much as I love the relationship between Cass and Aimee, one of my favorite things about Pretty When They Collide, is getting to see the relationships between Cass and some of the characters from the other books. I enjoyed getting the background and connections of Cass, Jeff, and the other members of The Assembly. As lame as it sounds, it made me a little giddy. Especially knowing how things turn out for them down the road.It was great how the events that led up to Cass and Aimee\u2019s first encounter played out. In fact, Rhiannon did a fantastic job with the entire story. Everything fits together perfectly. And even though this is a novella, it feels like a wonderful full-length novel in a tight little package. Honestly, it\u2019s one of the very few novellas I truly enjoyed. It\u2019s action packed, smart, and sweet. What\u2019s not to love? I hope Rhiannon writes more stories that focus on Cass and Aimee!Pretty When They Collide is a must read if you\u2019re a fan of this series. If you haven\u2019t started this series yet, get on it!"}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5089871-pam", "userReview": "Aimee is a full blooded witch who is blood bonded to Frank a horrible vampire that deals in slavery of supernatural people. He also loves to collect relics. Aimee has to create spells to protect Frank and do what ever he says. She really just wants to be free. Cassandra is a dhamphir which is a rare supernatural. Her does odd jobs stealing relics and other things people ask her to get. When she steals a relic that was supposed to go to Frank he finds out what she is and wants her for his collection of supernaturals. Cassandra is drawn to Aimee and when they touch she feels a spark. She finds herself drawn to Aimee and will do whatever it takes to get her free. Aimee knows Cassandra is the one who can free her from Frank and she also realizes she is drawn to Cassandra for different reasons. Will these two manage to be free to explore what seems to be a growing spark between them or will Frank capture and control them both.Never think Aimee is weak. She really grows stronger the more you read this and you really get to see her grow and become stronger. She is treated horribly by Frank sometimes on the verge of dying. She doesn't give up and keeps trying to break free. I love how she reacts when she meets Cassandra. You can see she is confused by her feelings for another woman. Cass is simply fantastic. From taking care of her mom, getting over an ex, to doing her job she is amazing all the way around. She is willing to fight for someone she has only bumped into because she feels something stronger. This kinda shows you how she will protect those she cares about. Her mom while she has problems is great. She loves Cass so much and it is nice to see the sweet side of Cass's life. Frank is a horrible monster that I kept hoping would die. He is truly evil. If you have read this series you get to see some more familiar faces in this book. I am a huge fan of this author and always enjoy reading her work. This book has plenty of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat and shows you just how tough these two girls can be. It had a few twist in it I didn't see coming and I couldn't tell at times whose side one character was on. This book has plenty of paranormal creatures in it that fans will love. It is nice to see the sparks between Cass and Aimee grow as the book moves along. Having read the Pretty When She Dies series I was wanted the background on these two and the author did a fantastic job on it. I want to see more from these two and eagerly look forward to reading more. Pretty please write more about these two. If you haven't read this series yet you should it is awesome."}, {"userName": "Amy Fournier", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5943163-amy-fournier", "userReview": "I have read the first two books in the Pretty When She Dies series, so when I saw this novella I knew I wanted to read it. I love the world and I will take more where I can get it until the next installment of the series is out. This read so much like a full length novel and I really enjoyed that about it. It was short enough that it was a quick easy read, but long enough that I was able to really get into the story. It had a lot of great action to it, and the brutal vampire violence that I love!!!Cassandra is a really great character. I loved getting to know her better. She is half vampire and all badass!! She has got some massive skills when it comes to retrieving items, and killing off the enemy. She's smart, sassy, and knows how to get things done. She's been through a lot, but she doesn't let that make her weak. She's not a pushover. She is just herself and I really enjoyed that.Aimee is a witch, and I really liked her. She is powerful, but has been enslaved to a horrible power hungry vampire. He tires to control her, but she is able to fight it to a point. When she meets Cassandra she knows that she is her chance to get away from him. She will do whatever she has to to break the bond. She knows that he only wants her for power, and she isn't happy. At one time she was fond of him, but that is long past. When she meets Cassandra, she is drawn to her. They have an undeniable chemistry right off. I liked that Aimee wasn't afraid to go for what she wanted either.This was so awesome. It starts off with a bang and continues all the way through. I was instantly drawn in and connected with the characters, and I loved that characters I already knew from the other books were part of this. It all ties together so well and I think that this really adds to the series. It's not just a filler novella like some tend to be. This was a story in itself, but flows with the bigger story also. It was suspenseful and had my heart pumping. I enjoyed every page of it and it has me really needing more of this series!!"}, {"userName": "Francis Franklin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12507868-francis-franklin", "userReview": "This was picked for me to read as part of a goodreads challenge. I enjoyed Pretty When She Dies but had been avoiding this prequel. For one thing, Aimee and Cass are introduced in a later book so it's really a prequel to a story I haven't actually read. Prequels are odd things. When exactly should they be read? Before? After? Never? Still, a challenge is a challenge - and witches, vampires and lesbian make for an attractive mixture. Besides, it got a five-star review over at Lipstick Lesbian Reviews.It didn't grab me - at least, not until about halfway through. It's an interesting setup, more urban fantasy than vampire story, with witches, a dhamphir, vampires and other. Lots of special abilities and amazing powers. Pretty When She Dies, on the other hand, was very much a vampire story, focussing on Amaliya's transformation and her slow discovery of what it is to be a vampire. Pretty When They Collide has the vampires as bad guys, pure and simple.But with so many characters with different powers it starts getting confusing. What could look pretty cool on the big screen doesn't (for me) translate to an interesting story. (The X-Men always suffers from this, I feel. There's never a clear sense to the reader of what the different characters are truly capable of.) The other problem with focussing so much on special powers and abilities is that it's harder to connect on a human level between reader and character.I don't know. I think this novella suffers because it is a prequel. Rhiannon Frater writes well and her characterisation is good, and I can overlook the distraction of pop-culture references, but the story underlying the novella isn't really satisfying and the end of the novella descends unnecessarily into soap opera."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460100-lori", "userReview": "In Pretty When They Collide we get to see how Aimee, the full blooded witch and Cass, Cian's dhamphir daughter meet.Their introduction to each other is less than idea to say the least. We were introduced to these two briefly in Pretty When She Kills. However, I think if you haven't read either one of those books you should still be able to follow along in this novella fairly easily. This novella is by far my favorite from author Rhiannon Frater's PWSD's world. I love Cass. As in she is my book girlfriend love her. She is everything I want in a book heroine. She's tough, smart, and has a soft side that she doesn't show often. Aimee is amazing as well. She is tied to a douchebag vampire named Frank. Yup he goes by the name Frank. The scenes between Aimee and Frank are spine chilling. They are so dark. I was literally shaking and my fingers where freezing they were that intense. Rhiannon really writes great horror. If I don't feel like I am going to be sick to my stomach because gore, or human actions then it's just not good horror to me. This book has a bit of both. The action is heart stopping. It's intense. At some points I felt like I was watching a spy movie from the way Cass was able to move around and manipulate fights. She's just great. Aimee and Cass have instant chemistry, but not in the insta-love way. They just sort of click, but it's not some silly predestined thing. Overall another awesome work from Rhiannon. I really hope that she can write more about these two again.

Pretty When They Collide is my first F/F book. This was exceptionally written and engaging. In this book you meet Cassie and Aimee. Cassie is a antique acquirer that\u2019s also a half-vampire half-human. Aimee is a rare full blooded witch trying to escape her vampire master. For this book to be a novella it had everything that one of Ms. Frater\u2019s novels would have possessed. From the beginning it is packed with action and it makes you want to continue to turn every page until you reach the end. The love story between the two characters was well written and it didn\u2019t turn me off or make me uncomfortable with sex scenes, that a lot of books seem to put in just to call it erotica, but if you ask Ms. Frater she doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy writing sex scenes anyway because she writes horror. I have read about dhampirs before and never did I read about a dhampir that possess the powers that Cassie did in this book.If you want to read a F/F book and don\u2019t have a place to start I recommend this one and remember these aren\u2019t your sparkly vampires or your good witches."}, {"userName": "Nicole Hadaway", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2799492-nicole-hadaway", "userReview": "I was very lucky enough to be a test reader for the draft of this novella. Having read Pretty When She Dies and Pretty When She Kills, I was anxious to see the origins of a very dynamic couple from the Pretty When universe. What can I say -- they are my favorite couple!! Frater has a gift for showing characters, for letting you get to know them, in just a few short paragraphs. Cass and Aimee have distinct personalities, and while I was reading the novella, I wasn't always sure the characters stayed true to themselves, until -- BLAM!! They meet. The novel is appropriately named, because it is one hell of a collision! The chemistry between the two is electric. They are very likable and believable, neither is over-thet-op, each possesses strengths and weaknesses that fit together quite nicely. Yin and Yang.Sorry -- I get so wrapped up in Cass and Aimee. As wonderful as they are, the villains are hideous, and Frater doesn't spare us the horrors that can be real life.
