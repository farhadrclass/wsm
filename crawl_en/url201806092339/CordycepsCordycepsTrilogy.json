I kept picturing zombies coughing and spewing yellow spores! This book reached out and grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go until I finished it. Very thrilling, fast-paced story. I found myself rooting for the main character, Cole, as he made his way through fungus-infested southern Florida. The tension between the government's desire to quarantine the affected area vs. the scientist's wish to study and combat the disease felt realistic. I also thought the author's use of different kind of zombies made the story particularly creepy.This is an outstanding work! I don't think I will ever relax again when I hear someone coughing nearby!"}, {"userName": "Ann Marie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11371257-ann-marie", "userReview": "Not your typical brain eating zombie...Yay! Something NEW!I must give a disclaimer here, I am not a fan of zombie books. They all seem very formulaic and predictable. Every once in a while though, I like to go beyond my genre to mix things up. I read one the authors blog posts, and decided I really liked his writing style; so I thought, what the heck. I'll give it a try.Ian Duncan smacked me down in Southern Florida and really made me feel like I was there trying to evacuate. The seriousness of their dire situation gradually unfolded. You obviously know it is going to get bad, but Ian walks you through it... ramping up the tension a little at a time. About three quarters of the way through I was staring in disbelief at the kindle screen. No. Freakin'. Way. Obviously I can't get into plot without giving too much away. These are absolutely not your typical zombies, but more like a humans infected with a sentient fungus.I loved the dialogue in the book, especially the banter between Nizzam and Cole. I knew from the second Cole made eyes at Shelley what would happen to Niz! Cole and Shelley's relationship made me smile. In the midst of terror and tragedy, love starts to blossom. The narration with three POV's was really good as well, and pretty seamless.My only criticism (and it's not one that would keep me from reading or recommending to others) is the ending left me wanting more. I want more of an explanation about the Cords and I also want to know more about Shelley and Cole. Maybe this is going to be a trilogy? It just doesn't seem like the end of all this."}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7535598-garrett", "userReview": "If you've read books, comics, watched movies, or even played games about zombies, you get a different take most every time. You may jump in your seat, actually be scared, roll your eyes, or laugh at moments; sometimes in the same movie. Most leave you with much to be desired (at least for me), no matter how fun they were to experience. However, one thing remains a constant: they aren't believable. This is the first take on zombies that is convincing AND actually has real-life precedence.I Youtubed \"Cordyceps\" as a result of the author's claim that \"CORDYCEPS IS REAL.\" Wow. Now that is scary. It is present in insects already! Perhaps it is possible that Cordyceps could evolve to become a threat to humans. Not only is that a bit frightening but it's also exciting (in a scary kind of way)/nerve-wracking. If this book doesn't make you want to go out and buy quarantine-ready survival equipment, I'm not sure what will. Confession: I bought a Casio G-Shock that would last through zombie infested times (hopefully) as a result of reading this very fun and very scary book; beginning preparations for what may come I suppose! Read this book in total silence. I read this on a porch out in the middle of nowhere with just the light from my iPhone. Every noise or shuffle in the woods put me at full alert with my heart racing. You will be on edge. Also, be worried if you start to find yourself seeking out ways to climb higher."}, {"userName": "Brenda Fryland", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4907098-brenda-fryland", "userReview": "Ooh, now this book is quite a nice surprise! Not only on a topic that I find fascinating, but IT IS WELL WRITTEN!! Beautiful descriptive passages, characters that feel pretty real, exciting storyline, and not a single grammatical or spelling error noticed so far. Of course, I am not reading it as an editor and the story is quite compelling which pushes me forward quickly, but I generally notice such things.I hope the last third of the book lives up to the first two -- I'll keep you posted ;)It does! Exciting read, had to bump my next scheduled book and move right into the sequel.Basic idea in the story -- the fungus that causes \"zombie ants\" jumps species to humans. Just like with the ants, it controls the host to do what the fungus needs and quickly adapts to the higher order creature. Characters you want to survive are in the \"zone\", not so nice but necessary characters outside of the zone. Doesn't end the way I expected, but hey - there is a sequel so don't get too comfortable with it!"}, {"userName": "Jeff Waters", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37747775-jeff-waters", "userReview": "This was a solid, well-written Post-Apocalyptic book with some unique elements. Yes, there are \"zombies\" -- but, they aren't dead and don't eat the living humans. They are simply humans who have been infected by a fungal/viral combination that makes them spread the fungas/virus. This actually happens in nature with some lesser animals... so, pretty neat to explore it happening in humans.I love PA books... but often can't make it through the 1st chapter due to poor dialogue and writing. This one kept me engaged throughout. I get the impression Ian Duncan has made it past the hacky early days of becoming a writer.The overall story arc isn't quite as deep as something like The Passage... but still a good, enjoyable, fast read."}, {"userName": "Julissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9566451-julissa", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It had a great twist on the whole zombie thing. These zombies are not flesh eaters but intelligent hosts to a fungus. This is a fungus that demands to be spread in its search for new hosts (an organic pesticide gone awry.) The story takes place in Florida and the residents of the quarantined area need to get to the border and be cleared. You can imagine the chaos that ensues (looting, horrific traffic jams, lack of food and water, violence.) I really wanted to like the characters but their flaws (which do make them human) make them unlikeable. No loyalty or honor here. The whole idea of airborne spores is completely frightening to me. So, despite the characters, the story is definitely worth reading."}, {"userName": "Allison Ward", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17651640-allison-ward", "userReview": "Cordyceps is an incredible book which took me completely by surprise. The eerie sense of how close the possibility of this happening is makes it such a perfect combination of truth and sci-fi thrill. I was so torn while reading this book: wanting to read it all the time but fearful that it would fill my dreams with zombies. This to me is what makes up a perfect book - unashamed obsession which transforms your way of thinking just a little more every time you sit down to read it. Cordyceps does this is such a way that I have not experienced in a thriller book before now. It is absolutely a must-read!"}, {"userName": "Lynne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4370922-lynne", "userReview": "Good storyline. Main characters do have extremely good luck in some instances and I don't see how they avoided infection with such massive exposure but if you can just accept it, the rest of the story is fun. Trubilinski is my favorite character. Shelley is annoying. I hope we see her and Cord in the next installment but I get the feeling we won't. I'm not sure why Trubilinski would say something along the lines of \"officially we don't support the CDC doc going into the Zone but unofficially get him everything he needs\" and then Dr. Sean goes in woefully unprepared and not understanding the plan of action. That's just silly."}, {"userName": "Amber A.

I quickly found it impossible to put down. The author's descriptions are both chilling and able to transport you to the apocalyptic scenery in the book. Cordyceps is very well written and a must read. I will definitely continue reading the next installments in the trilogy, as well as other books by this author."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3658857-jessica", "userReview": "This book was an action packed thrill ride! The idea is based on a real fungus that modifies the behavior of insects when infected. The writing was spot on, the characters were interesting, and I am glad I took the time to read this one! Well worth the price! And it's lendable which I always appreciate, because if I love a book I want to share it with someone else who will love it too. Next book please! I am glad this is listed as the first in a trilogy."}, {"userName": "Rolando Gill", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5004167-rolando-gill", "userReview": "I thought Cordyceps was a fun read and the Cord zombie was a great twist on the genre. I read it in one day and I am glad I bought it. What made the book much scarier for me is that I came back to Amazon to write my review and I typed Cordyceps into the Amazon search bar and people are buying and selling the Cordyceps fungus!
