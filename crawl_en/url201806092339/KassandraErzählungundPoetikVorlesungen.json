I saw her at once. She, the captive, took me captive; herself made an object by others, she took possession of me.\u201d- Christa Wolf, CassandraThis wasn\u2019t the easiest of books to get through due to its relatively dense prose but it was well worth the effort. In a way it made me realize that I don\u2019t know enough Greek mythology, as well as how pervasive the knowledge of ancient Greek culture is in our modern society. However, not knowing too many particulars of the Trojan War, which is the backdrop of this book, didn\u2019t dampen my experience whatsoever.I\u2019d never even heard of Cassandra before, the Trojan princess who the gods had given the gift of prophecy. Most of what I\u2019ve heard of the Trojan war has been about Helen of Troy so it was a nice experience to witness the story from another woman\u2019s perspective. Although the gods give Cassandra the gift of prophecy, they make it so that nobody believes her prophecies. She foresees the fall of Troy and her own death.What I realized while reading this famous story from a woman\u2019s point of view is the importance of the feminist perspective when it comes to talking about just about anything, but history is what came to mind more strongly here. This perspective often recounts a more painful history, one where the pain isn\u2019t kept at a distance or hidden away. In this case, this is a story recounted by a woman who was in the midst of the action. It was more painful shown this way and it clearly highlighted all that women had to deal with, matters of the heart, feelings of helplessness and so on. I found so much that would probably have been ignored or glossed over had it been written from a male perspective. However, in this case the rapes weren\u2019t omitted, neither was the violence against women. The entire women\u2019s experience was highlighted and that\u2019s probably the reason why I read this as slowly as I did, it was slightly overwhelming to tell the truth.This book was definitely feminist in its approach. It also showed the patriarchal nature of war. Cassandra could easily stand as a symbol of all women, especially those who are oppressed and don\u2019t have a voice. Cassandra is intelligent, observant, and well-learned, yet still finds it impossible to convince people of her views, all because she\u2019s a woman. It didn\u2019t matter that Cassandra was a princess, she still didn\u2019t have much say, led a claustrophobic life and was a pawn.The book ended with four literary essays written by Wolf. I\u2019m interested in inspiration and how people get their ideas, especially their writing ideas. The essays were a great way of learning how Wolf was inspired to write about Cassandra while reading Aeschylus\u2019s Oresteia while in Greece: \u201cWhat does it matter if you do not believe me? The future will surely come. Just a little while And you will see for yourself.\u201d-Cassandra, in Aeschylus, OresteiaThis book reminded me of Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Penelopiad. Great story, one that I\u2019d read again."}, {"userName": "Neal Adolph", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5459072-neal-adolph", "userReview": "Several months ago I finished reading the novella in this collection and I wrote a review. It is below, under the line break. In the time since I have read the essays, though that has taken a good deal of time. I moved to Colombia and left the book in Canada, which delayed reading the last essay by several months, and I celebrated Black History Month, which meant that I set aside all literature by anybody who wasn't black, even if only for a month. There have been delays.But the essays are fantastic, and I am a little sad to have taken so much time in reading them. Oftentimes they are unorthodox in their structure, and require re-reading of passages to understand just how they are moving forward, why they are moving in that direction, who the speaker is, what they are speaking about. Wolf didn't write for a simplistic understanding of her literature and how it developed - the story of how it developed was complex, and so was the telling of that story. It comes with a great wide knowledge, a great wide research into the experience of women in history, and, as a result, is powered by a deep, seething, historical anger. How powerful is her frustration! It makes you stronger as you read it.Essays are illuminating when they are well-written, when they play with the form, when they add to our appreciation of something that we love. While I would find it hard to argue that they are as stellar as the novella that they are attached to (Cassandra is a 5-star read), they are still very good, and perhaps an essential collection for anybody who wants to write one day. In fact, if I worked for a creative writing program, I would make this book - all of it - essential reading.------------------------------------------------------I never expected to become a big fan of the great classics, though I suppose in retrospect my high school admiration for the art of Oedipus Rex was a good indication that I could love the epic poetry of ancient Greece. And somehow it turned out that, with a nudge from a good friend, I did. I loved The Odyssey, and The Iliad is perhaps the best work to give to somebody who wishes to become a pacifist. And then I read a book about the Iliad by Simone Weil and Rachel Besparloff - a small collection of essays that only managed to enhance my appreciation for these great epics.And now I have read Cassandra by Christa Wolf. To say that Cassandra is a wonderful piece of writing I think fails to acknowledge the many remarkable things that Wolf has accomplished in having written it. Here she has taken the works of three incredible ancients - Homer, Virgil, Aeschylus - and discovered a character, Cassandra, hidden away in the margins, and then placed her in the centre of the fall of Troy. She, burdened by the powers of a seer, is witness to the destruction of her city, the murder of her people, the mastication of her body, many years before it is destroyed. She is the prophet compelled to speak out against the war mongering brought to the council by some unknown but trusted young man. She is the woman who is recognized as a traitor, removed from her seat of power in the council and prevented from influencing her father, King Priam, and then thrown in a cellar. She is violently disregarded, ignored, silenced. To the detriment of the whole city.Christa Wolf has written, by taking on the great story of Troy\u2019s collapse, the narrative of women in the western world - that is, to be valuable, intelligent, essential parts of our communities who, for no reason other than patriarchy, have been disregarded, ignored, and silenced to the detriment of our whole selves. She has tied this to the beginning myths of our world - the origins of so much of our defining literature, the beach and walls from which Odysseus set off to return home and, lost for twenty years, recorded one of the great stories of the Western World - a story which has often been called Everyman\u2019s Journey. She is wise in telling us about Cassandra from the perspective of Cassandra. Patriarchy is in everyman\u2019s journey - either as victim or as perpetrator and sometimes as both.I keep on reading novellas which tell so much in such a short space and continue to be astonished by them. After reading something like Cassandra, which is dense and powerful, intense, and sometimes a struggle, one wonders at why some even bother trying to write books that are more than 150 pages long. How lazy some novelists are, taking so long to tell so little, one thinks. Of course, this isn\u2019t possibly entirely true - some novelists need the novel. But books like Cassandra illumine the power of brevity, or declarations, of compelling characters created in very few words. This work is nothing short of a classic. The discovery of Christa Wolf will, like my discovery of Gabriel Garcia Marquez only a few weeks ago, surely go down as a landmark in my literary life."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859690-jeremy", "userReview": "Forced to read this book due to a third year literature course, and being a lover of great literature as well as 'fireside' reads, I got some chuckles from the 'elitist' ramblings of other reviewers regarding the complexity and importance of this book. I agree that anyone who doesn't 'get it' when it comes to this book - particularly after reading all the exegetical text that goes with the story - must be a little simple; Wolf's narrative touch is as subtle as a poorly wielded jaw-bone. This is such horrid revisionism and politically-motivated story-telling as to make a thinking reader retch. Wolf dips her toes into Aeschylus' ocean of ideas, shrinks back from the cold and retreats to the comfort of the sand. If the writings of the Ancient Greeks are considered misogynist (which I don't believe), then this text, judged by those standards, is misandrist to the point of mania; I mean, the archetype for the modern misandrist novel is to make the central male figure incompetent, sexually dysfunctional, emotionally dysfunctional, ugly/sleazy, hate-filled, bitter and compulsively obsessed. This is almost a how-to book; 'An Idiot's Guide to Writing A Misandrist Novel'. Having said all that, Wolf is certainly not a poor writer; her craftsmanship is excellent. The characters she chooses to portray more than one dimensionally are vividly drawn. If the type of book described above is up your literary alley - and there is a market for this type of book, unfortunately - then you'll really enjoy it. Addendum: No, this book is not a difficult read: the story itself is actually quite fluid. The style does not even particularly reflect that strange misnomer: 'stream of consciousness'. Thematically it is simple in the extreme, and could easily be an almost silver-clear reflection of a high school level western sociology textbook. I would call it 'Literature Lite' if I didn't object to the oxymoron. Please, read Aeschylus, if not Homer just to get some stylistic perspective. Or, read Manfredi's The Talisman of Troy if you want to see how this kind of thing can be genuinely handled."}, {"userName": "Lyn Elliott", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott", "userReview": "So good I\u2019ve been re-reading, taking copious notes, and will eventually review."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "While the narrative style of the novel is not my favorite style, the story does eventually become engrossing.

In Aeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon, Cassandra says that she agreed to have sex with the God Apollo in exchange for the gift of prophecy, but when she went back on her promise and refused the Sun God\u2019s advances, Apollo made sure that her prophecies would never be believed. When she predicts the future her friends and family treat her as nothing more than a babbling and a raving mad woman. I have a distinct memory of first translating the Agamemnon and how difficult Aeschylus\u2019s Greek is to unpack. But the parts in the narrative in which Cassandra is speaking were a nice break because oftentimes she just rants and raves; the various \u201coi\u201d and \u201coimoi\u201d noises she makes are a welcome respite from the complex grammatical structures of Aeschylus\u2019s sentences.Christa Wolf\u2019s Cassandra is an ambitious novel in that it tries to cover the entire scope of the Trojan epic cycle by telling it through the eyes of this doomed and unlucky Trojan princess. Priam, Hecuba, Helenus, Achilles, Aeneas, Troilus, Briseis, Calchas, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Polyxena and Paris, are just a few of the characters that make an appearance or are mentioned in Wolf\u2019s narrative. Cassandra, the narrator of this story, is the daughter of Priam, King of Troy, and his first and most favored wife, Hecuba. From a very young age Cassandra wants nothing more than to become a priestess of the God Apollo and possess the gift of prophecy. But once she is given this gift she is subjected to a plethora of other misfortunes which lead to her tragic death. Wolf\u2019s narrative is so wide-ranging and covers so many characters and actions from the Trojan saga that it is impossible to mention everything she touches on in one review. So I am going to write about the aspects of Wolf\u2019s story that were the most striking and memorable for me.In the original myths and stories involving the origin of the Trojan War, Paris, the prince of Troy, visits King Menelaus of Sparta and with the help of the Goddess Aphrodite, absconds with his wife Helen. In order to get his wife back, Menelaus asks his warmongering brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae, to help him get an army together, sack Troy, and find his wife. Wolf makes her story less a matter of love, pride and recapturing a straying wife and instead makes the inception of the war more of a political issue. Priam\u2019s sister has been taken by the Greeks and there are three separate, and unsuccessful expeditions to bring her back; on the third and final ship, Paris sets sail with the other men and when he cannot get his aunt back he takes Menelaus\u2019s wife instead. Paris is portrayed as an arrogant and brash young man who uses the pretext of the expedition to take for himself a woman who is said to be the most beautiful in the world. Christa\u2019s Paris is much more bold than Homer\u2019s Paris, but in both tales Paris has no forethought or concern for anyone other than himself.When the Greeks attack Troy, Cassandra has already seen this event coming and predicted that it will destroy her home and her family. She has a dream when she is a child that Apollo spits in her mouth and this is the sign that she can foretell the future but no one will believe her. When she has one of her prophetic visions she foams at the mouth, has fits that mimic the symptoms of a seizure and drives everyone away from her because they think she is a babbling lunatic. Cassandra\u2019s narrative about her childhood, how she acquired her gift of prophesy, the destruction of Troy and its aftermath are all told in a stream-of-conscious narrative. Wolf\u2019s Cassandra constantly moves around between different time periods and this cleverly reflects the anxious ramblings of her tormented mind. She oftentimes dwells on her earlier years when she was first given the ability to prophesy and became a priestess of the God Apollo. She is King Priam\u2019s favorite daughter and her position as favorite as well as her ability to predict the future cause her to have complicated relationships with her siblings, her mother, and other men in her life.When Troy is sacked, all of the Trojan women who survive are divided up among the Greek Kings and taken back to Greece to become their household and sexual slaves. Cassandra is taken back to Mycenae by King Agamemnon and her interactions with this narcissistic man cause her to reflect on the other complicated relationships she has had with men throughout her life. Wolf portrays Cassandra as having a great desire to be a priestess of Apollo and remain a virgin, but even her desire to remain untouched is conflicted. There is a strange scene that Wolf includes in which all of the young women in Troy are placed within the sanctuary of a temple and one by one they are chosen by Trojan youth for a ritual deflowering. It is oftentimes the tendency for non-Greek, Eastern cultures to be portrayed as being more sexually open and even promiscuous. In the Ancient Greek myths Priam is basically described as possessing a harem with multiple wives and fifty children. Even though this is not necessarily emphasized in Homer, Wolf seems to pick up on the sexual differences between the Greeks and the Trojans. When Cassandra does finally become a priestess, she puts up with the head priest visiting her nightly for sexual trysts and she endures it because she pretends she is sleeping with Aeneas whom she loves very much.Cassandra views Agamemnon as a self-centered, rash and dangerous man who is also sexually impotent. In Cassandra\u2019s eyes Achilles is not any better a man than Agamemnon and she describes Achilles as a murderous, selfish brute who takes what he wants, including Cassandra\u2019s sister Polyxena. The only male in the story that Cassandra has any positive thoughts for is Aeneas, a Trojan youth who is the only hero to escape from Troy when it is burning. In the ancient Greek myths Aeneas and Cassandra are cousins but they don\u2019t have any real connections other than Cassandra\u2019s prediction that Aeneas will escape Troy. I am curious as to why Wolf chose Aeneas at the only male in the Trojan saga with any redeemable characteristics. The depressed, hopeless, confused, Cassandra in Wolf\u2019s narrative becomes a completely different person when Aeneas is around. The only time when Cassandra has positive, loving thoughts are when she is around Aeneas:At the new moon Aeneas came\u2026I saw his face for only a moment as he blew out the light that swam in a pool of oil beside the door. Our recognition sign was and remained his hand on my cheek, my cheek in his hand. We said little more to each other than our names; I had never heard a more beautiful love poem. Aeneas Cassandra. Cassandra Aeneas. When my chastity encountered his shyness, our bodies went wild. I could not have dreamed what my limbs replied to the questions of his lips, or what unknown inclinations his scent would confer on me. And what a voice my throat had at its command.One final male in the story that is not portrayed in a positive light is Hector, the prince of Troy and first son and heir of King Priam. In the Iliad he is, I would argue, the most heroic of the men on either side because he has a sense of honor and courage that no other warrior possesses. So I was disappointed that Wolf refers to him as \u201cDim-Cloud\u201d and Cassandra remarks, \u201cA number of my brothers were better suited than he to lead the battle.\u201d To have veered so far off the mark from the Hector of the Iliad was disappointing to me.When I teach about the God Apollo and Cassandra and her doomed gift of prophecy, my students always have a hard time with the fact that time and again Cassandra prophesies the truth but not a single person ever believes her. My interpretation of Cassandra has always been that she represents that person who tells us the very thing we don\u2019t want to hear about ourselves or our actions that we continue to ignore. Cassandra is the classic case of being mad at and ignoring the person who tells us the truth and is honest but who we will cast aside anyway because the truth is too hard to bear. Wolf writes a spectacular rendition of Cassandra and brings to the forefront this allegory of ignoring our better judgement and the better judgement of others and suffering the negative consequences for it."}, {"userName": "Sarah Magdalene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3100991-sarah-magdalene", "userReview": "This dark race is beyond helpfor the most part you had to remainsilent so as not to be consideredmad like Cassandra, when you prophesiedwhat already lies outside the gate.Goethe, 1794Spent all afternoon immersed in this great book. So inspiring to read such a sentient passionate author describing so timelessly the horror and madness of war. Impossible not to identify with Cassandra, wailing hopelessly at the insanely deluded and doomed Trojans as they demolished their own fortifications to tow inside the Wooden Horse. Their stupidity has become legendary but her wisdom has been largely forgotten. Those who can see clearly are still being denounced as mad by a world bent on destruction.I've always loved the story of the Trojan War, ever since I was a child. It seemed to me the ultimate tale, containing everything there was to be known about human nature. And I loved the way Christa Wolf interprets it. She is so scathingly cynical about all the so called Heros. Brutish Achilles who kills for the sake of killing is more like a rabid beast than a man, and Agamemnon is so weak and morally feeble he could almost be a contemporary politician.The Trojans aren't much better, the venal and pathetic Paris and the big dumb simple Hector ...I actually prefer her version of events to Homers'. It strikes me as much more realistic and for that reason much more poignant. There are a few very positive male characters but for the most part it concentrates on the lives of the women, how they are affected and how their secret strengths and beliefs live on in spite of everything.

La autora escribe a modo de ensayo, de corrido, de continuo, d\u00e1ndole un formato de borbotones de pensamientos inconexos y desordenados que son la mente de la sufriente Casandra. Si un ser humano se ve enfrentado a la muerte de forma inminente, desde luego que sus pensamientos deben ser as\u00ed.

De lo contrario, es muy probable que no reconozcas personajes ni sucesos y la lectura de los pensamientos atormentados de Casandra se conviertan en un tormento para el lector tambi\u00e9n. Pero si ya los conoc\u00edas de antemano, este libro es un regalo.Cuando uno ve y lee sobre estos personajes m\u00edticos (Pr\u00edamo, H\u00e9cuba, Paris, Helena, Pentesilea, Aquiles, Ulises, Pol\u00edxena, Casandra, Helena, Anquises, Eneas...) los siente como algo irreal, lejano. M\u00edtico, c\u00f3mo no. Inmortalizados por Homero en la Il\u00edada y por los artistas a trav\u00e9s de tantas pinturas y esculturas. Christa Wolf te los devuelve, los convierte en humanos. Con sus virtudes y sus defectos; de un modo distinto al de Homero, incomparable. Si una autora del siglo XX ha sido capaz de hablar de una \u00e9poca m\u00edtica de la que bien poco se sabe hablando de sus protagonistas como si los hubiese conocido en primera persona, \u00e9sa es Christa Wolf. A un nivel que ninguna novela hist\u00f3rica ha conseguido. A otro nivel, no apto para todos los lectores; y menos para los que buscan simplemente entretenimiento.Casandra, la princesa troyana, la profetisa maldita por Apolo, presencia la destrucci\u00f3n de su mundo, la masacre de sus seres queridos, el hundimiento de su civilizaci\u00f3n, y nos lo relata instantes antes de su propio final. As\u00ed, la bella figura que decora muros y vasijas se convierte en una mujer real, cuya historia es tan cre\u00edble como la de esas mil personas que vemos, indiferentes, en las pantallas de nuestros televisores, como cualquier otra v\u00edctima de guerra m\u00e1s, tan inteligente, tan humana, tan valiosa como la que m\u00e1s; pero cuyo tiempo se ha acabado.Sin duda, un libro no recomendable para todos, pero un libro de cinco estrellas.

Such is the inevitable conclusion wherever a self-described autonomous being uses \"insanity\" as their characterization of the utmost abject, a fount of lazy thinking Wolf falls into a handful of times during the course of both the narrative and the last couple of essays. However, since she doesn't formulate her clear crux in a way that depends wholly on that separation of her from the \"delusional\" other, I can pick and choose what I want of the insights she makes about toxic masculinity, war mongering, the military industrial complex as bears down on science, literature, the propaganda of the translation of ancient literature and evocation and historization of the select group of ancients chosen to prove to that 'white' people didn't merely crawl out of caves once upon a time and, by a combination of luck and sadism, conquer the world. Wolf may commit many of the dehumanizing mistakes she seeks to critique in others, but she has more self-reflexivity than the average white woman, enough to make what truths she sees about this hellscape of a globalized terror complex worth picking over.\n[T]he various generations of translators have translated these differently, depending on their own moral views and interpretations; that is, depending on whether, unconsciously or not, they have sided with the man or the woman.Do people suspect, do we suspect, how difficult and in fact dangerous it can be when life is restored to an \"object\"? When the idol begins to feel again? When \"it\" finds speech again?The most important thing about your dream, Cassandra, was that faced with a completely perverted question, you nevertheless tried to find an answer. You should remember that when the time comes.\nI never would've read this work if all I expected was some historical fanfic of the more ancient than average sort. Part of my problem with Medea was this its lack of context, as while the mainstream likes swallowing down its entertainment with as minimal indigestion as possible, I prefer that the author prove to me that they made the effort to know what they're talking about. A lot of reviewers got stuck on the gender issue, but my concern is how a bunch of white men keep driving civilization into the ground again, and again, and again, with more and more complexly rendered excuses and false choices and scientific/humanistic/socioeconomic jargon each and every time. I don't think white women would do significantly better, leastwise not while they're stuck in the white supremacist and cisnormative ideologies that compose the two part identity, but they'd at least be more sick of the bullshit and less likely to put up with it as a result. In 2013, I dropped out of college because my engineering career pointed the way towards making things that helped people murder other people for a living. And yet, I'm also insane (major depressive disorder to be exact), so shouldn't I be gleefully driving the world towards a penultimate end of rape and genocide and nuclear winter, laughing all the way? Life and death is what's the matter here, and if people mewl and puke because they won't see past their their dicks to the bigger picture of those on top putting those on bottom out to the radiation poisoning slaughter for the sake of a few books, they're prophesying more about their future than Cassandra ever could. The history and theorizing and mixed messages from the realm of ancient myth is all incidental. Society tells itself the stories necessary for the sake of its continued function. not moralistic functioning, or sustainable functioning, or emancipating functioning. Functioning. If our models are murderers, why so surprised that so are we?\nTo prevent wars, people must criticize, in their own country, the abuses that occur in their own country. The role taboos play in the preparation for war. The number of shameless secrets keeps growing incessantly, boundlessly.So there was a time when the dead were sacred, at least to us; and I knew that time.\nI could write a ten page paper about this, easy. However, as professorship is officially a dead path, I won't be doing anything more than the sort of amateur work I've been doing the last eight years. I may not be completely happy with this particular work of Wolf's, but it's certainly interesting in meaningful in the ways I hoped for when I began my rereading, and more importantly, I can use her ideas to develop my own and carry them forward into the future. Nearly four decades have passed since these recorded scares of the cold War, and it is Wolf's writing that broke through the crust of my having tutored in AP World History for the past few month sand brought home just how little has changed in the prose and the events from Minoan to Troyian to Grecian to German to now, and how there will be no future left if the white patriarchy continues its practice of human sacrifice on the scale of millions for the sake of capitalism and realpolitik. Mewlers and pukers saying that it's no the white boys' fault, ask yourself who is everywhere in the seat of power. It's them you should be moaning to, not me.\nWhat meaning does this observation have for a literature which no longer wants to create large-scale, vital, ideal figures; no longer wants to tell coherent stories held together by war and murder and homicide and the heroic deeds which accrue to them? What kind of memory does the prose of Virginia Woolf require and endorse? Why should the brain be able to \"retain\" a linear narrative better than a narrative network, given that the brain itself is often compared with a network? What other way is there for an author to tackle the custom (which no longer meets the needs of our time) of remembering history as the story of heroes? The heroes are exchangeable, the model remains.

Wolf rewrites the story of the Trojan war from Cassandra's perspective, all the while combining elements from Athenian playwrights and other writers through the ages, and writes the Trojan war as a realistic event in history. In the second half of this book, she writes about how these characters took hold in her mind and the questions they posed as she travelled through Greece to do research.While I would recommend a certain familiarity with Homer and the Athenian tragedians' materials, I thought this book was fantastic."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3663222-emma", "userReview": "I will come out and confess that my interest in Greek Mythology only began after I became obsessed with the 2004 movie Troy. That was six/seven years ago and I'm not trying to read as much literature based on the subject as possi thible.I am mainly interested in the story of Briseis and Achillies and this book offered me an insight into their connection at a different angle than that of the movie. I think that Christa Wolf's portrayel of Briseis as the forced slave of the Greeks is much more realistic than the romantic love story of the film. However, the book had no order to it, it was just a series of random sentences which had me skipping pages until I found a name that I recognised. It felt like I'd been made to read it by school and I needed an english teacher there to explain it to me! I think that she should have focused on fewer characters but for those who are very interested in Greek mythology and who have related knowldege already then this will be a very entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Julia Buckley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2710358-julia-buckley", "userReview": "Christa Wolf's stream-of-consciousness account of the mythological Cassandra, imprisoned and waiting to be executed by the vengeful Clytemnestra, is a fascinating study of an ancient world, of patriarchy, and of a universal humanity. The novel is not broken into chapters, but that is an appropriate way to chronicle the relentless thoughts that torment Cassandra in her prison. Ultimately, despite the necessarily grim tone surrounding details of the Trojan War, there is something victorious in Cassandra's narration, and in her refusal to give up her authentic self.

Ma Cassandra \u00e8 anche la protagonista di un romanzo che si chiama proprio come lei, scritto da Christa Wolf, scrittrice tedesca che visse durante il periodo della Guerra Fredda e che fu particolarmente attiva nella politica, iscrivendosi al Partito di Unit\u00e0 Socialistica di Germania. La Wolf visse con molta ansia la situazione di tensione causata dalla separazione tra la Germania dell\u2019Est e quella dell\u2019Ovest, ed \u00e8 proprio su questo scenario che si basa il suo romanzo pi\u00f9 famoso: \u201dIl cielo diviso.\u201d Eppure, l\u2019autrice ha pubblicato una vasta quantit\u00e0 di libri e racconti, ed uno tra questi \u00e8 proprio Cassandra.L\u2019incipit del romanzo \u00e8 spettacolare. La figlia del Re Priamo, Cassandra, si reca a Micene, diventata ormai una schiava al servizio di Agamennone. Eppure, Cassandra va in contro alla morte, poich\u00e9 la moglie di Agamennone, Clitemnestra, ha teso al marito un\u2019imboscata. Cassandra va incontro alla morte. E lo sa. Mentre la visione della sua fine si fanno sempre pi\u00f9 vicina, ripercorriamo la sua vita. La sua infanzia tra le mura del palazzo, la scelta di diventare sacerdotessa, il dono di poter vedere il futuro, l\u2019amore platonico e bruciante per Enea, l\u2019inizio della guerra, la morte di Achille, e tutti gli eventi principali dell\u2019Iliade narrati attraverso gli occhi di una donna che gi\u00e0 li ha vissuti, che gi\u00e0 sa cosa accadr\u00e0.La Wolf utilizza il flusso di coscienza, ed i pensieri della protagonista sembrano quasi immediati. Lo stile della Wolf \u00e8 caratterizzato da una scelta delle parole e dei vocaboli, e anche della punteggiatura, quasi maniacale, ma il tutto porta ad un risultato perfetto, poich\u00e9 si ha l\u2019impressione di non leggere pi\u00f9 un libro, bens\u00ec di ascoltare Cassandra raccontare la sua storia, come se la stesse mettendo in scena su un palco. Numerosi sono i riferimenti ai miti, non solo a quelli narrati nel poema omerico. La voce di Cassandra \u00e8 forte, potente, si alza sopra tutto e tutti eppure, da un lato, \u00e8 come se rimanesse soffocata, come se si mescolasse a quelle di tutti gli altri. Fatto che, come narra la vicenda, accadde. Questa protagonista \u00e8 una donna estremamente forte, ostacolata per\u00f2 da tutte le regole imposte dal patriarcato. Cassandra potrebbe governare: in pi\u00f9 punti si interessa alla politica, e questo motivo in un primo momento la rende la prediletta di suo padre, ma successivamente la allontana da lui per lo stesso motivo.Cassandra \u00e8 la figura principale del romanzo, ma appaiono anche altri personaggi: Marpessa, amica di Cassandra, Pentesilea, donna ammazzone e guerriera, Priamo, che in guerra perde la ragione, Ecuba, la madre forte e severa, Polissena, sorella bellissima e maledetta, Agamennone, che rappresenta la quintessenza del maschio virile e sicuro di s\u00e9, Enea, amore di Cassandra che gi\u00e0 ha predetto un futuro per lui. La Wolf analizza in modo diverso anche la figura di Clitemnestra, non \u00e8 una vendicativa, bens\u00ec \u00e8 stata costretta anche lei a sottostare ad una legge, quella del marito, che l\u2019ha privata di sua figlia. Nel momento del loro incontro, vittima e carnefice si dissolvono. Sono entrambe due vittime di una societ\u00e0 che non riconosce il loro potere. Nella presentazione dei personaggi secondari, l\u2019autrice dimostra una tecnica incredibile: sono personaggi forti, profondi, intensi, eppure tutti restano quasi sullo sfondo rispetto a Cassandra, come se fossero lontanissimi ma allo stesso tempo parte integrante di lei.Cassandra pensa. Si interroga. Domanda. Vede oltre la faccia degli uomini. Vede il loro futuro, riuscendo a capire il loro presente. Un personaggio creato tanti secoli fa, emerge come una ragazza moderna e attuale, che finalmente fa sentire la sua \u201cvoce.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Christina Sallis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16136808-christina-sallis", "userReview": "Wolf's *feminist* interpretation of the fall of Troy, reminded me of Ellul's characterization of western imperialism as \"the proverbial collision between the earthenware pot and the iron pot. what happens, happens, despite the best possible intentions of the iron pot.\" Wolf traces the technical and ideological origins of Western imperialism to the fall of Troy and the ascension and glorification of Achaean values of domination by brute force by all means at any cost. Cassandra reaches this same conclusion when she watches Achilles 1) brutally murder her brother Troilus in the temple of Apollo 'Troilus stood his ground, faced his opponent, fought. He fought by the rules, as he had been taught was the way to fight between high-born men. But Achilles. Achilles the brute did not respond to the boy's offer. Perhaps he did not understand it. Achilles raised his sword above his head, gripping it with both hands, and let it whistle down on my brother.  All rules fell into the dust forever.  So that's how it's done. Those who could see saw it the first day: We would lose this war.\" 2) drag the corpse of her brother Hector behind horses around the city walls and afterwards offer the remains of his body in exchange for all the gold Troy has (he delights in the double humiliation, that Troy barely has enough gold to even the scale of Hector's remains)'Below were the scales. On one side of the scales was a mass of war meat that had once been our brother Hector; and on the other was all the gold we had, for Hector's murderer. This was the low point or the high point of the war. The coldness inside me. Andromache lying inanimate on the ground. And Polyxena's face, which suited this occasion, the voluptuousness of self-destruction. The contemptuous way she threw her bracelets and chains onto the mountain of gold, which still fell a little short of the weight of Hector's corpse.  We were learning new things at a dazzling rate.'  3) posthumously rape the corpse of Amazon warrior Penthesilea The essays are dark. Wolf is mostly wracked by dread and anxiety like any truly feeling person in contemporary society.  The whites are coming. The whites are landing. And if they are repulsed again, they will return again once more. No revolution and no resolution and no foreign currency statue will help; they will come in spirit if they can no longer come in any other way. And they will be resurrected in a brown and a black brain; it will always be the whites, even then.

This is not to disparage either myth or Homer's work, but it is refreshing to be dealing with a human being who is yet a person of her historic era.The four essays are Wolf's own examinations of how she went about this work to literarily realize Cassandra once the seeress had stepped into her creative mind. Wolf was granted a guest lecturer status at the University of Frankfurt in 1980 and this whole series of her work is what she presented to them. Historically, she understood the passions that disrupted the Aegean area and she incorporates that history into the story to give the machismo heft. Why were the Achaeans really attacking Troy? She delves into the various legends of Helen and creates interesting possibilities that color the story in other ways.She spends a good bit of time researching the status of women in this story and she investigates the delusions that set historical peoples upon one another. It's an eye-opening piece of work -- and by a woman yet, an East German woman who was struggling with her own post-war difficulties and who chose to investigate socialism in her own life. Born in Poland in 1929, her family was forced to move and where they ended up happened to evolve into the Russian sector. Her young life was besieged by one of the worst wars in history. Her mind, which was brilliant, questioned everything and she was a writer of immense talent and ability. Her writing is beautiful, sensitive,and based on good research but primed by a mind that considers everything with a constant energy. I enjoyed this work.

It is the story of Cassandra the woman facing the demons of her past, the mythical aspects of her character: that she is a seer, a priestess and a king's daughter have not been denied but have been muted down to not be all that she is. (As Christa Wolf writes in one of the essays, her desire was to free Cassandra from the strings that made her an object). In consequence it is a Cassandra who feels, who thinks, who sometimes makes mistakes but who above all raises questions, who wonders, who asks. It is therefore also a novel which keeps the well-known events of the fall of Troy in the background; her rape by Ajax the Lesser, the stealing of Helen, the death of Hector... all these things feature in the novel but instead of being the focus of the story they serve as the background, as anchoring points in the narrative from which Cassandra can investigate, explore and analyse themes, issues, her own experience and feelings.This is the defining factor of both novel and essays because there are so many things to unpack in both that I'd imagine this book will only get more interesting with every read -or the longer one allows oneself to muddle over the issues they raise."}, {"userName": "Faedyl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12058946-faedyl", "userReview": "Entrada en el diario 3 de Faedyl desde City Bell, Buenos Aires Province Argentina en mi\u00e9rcoles, 09 de septiembre de 200910 de 10Casandra! excelente libro.Mediante un relato que revive hechos del pasado y los entremezcla con lo que esta aconteciendo y lo que va a suceder, esta casandra cuyo anhelo de videncia es su misma perdici\u00f3n, se enfrenta con una serie de reflexiones que son universales y que, dejando de lado ese acontecer del mito se convierten en intensas meditaciones de cualquier mujer en cualquier \u00e9poca.La vida y la muerte, la familia, los lazos, nuestras relaciones, todo esto pasa por el ojo escrutador de Casandra, con la impotencia que nos da saber que algo suceder\u00e1 y no podemos torcer el destino.Un libro del cual no puedo extraer p\u00e1rrafos porque son tantos los que me han impactado! tengo ganas de releerlo, de comprarlo y tenerlo porque es de esos que siempre te dar\u00e1n una mirada distinta.

Some specific sentences stood out, true, but that's not really it; it just seems to run so well as whole, and reading it is a pretty special experience. It works just as well as the multiple voices in Medea, and I'm not quite sure which one I like better. And of course, The Iliad (...800+ pages of fighting men with occasional interruptions from Athena and Hera) being my point of comparison in terms of narrating the Trojan War, the novel becomes all the more satisfying. Unlike other feminist retellings of classical myths, like LeGuin's Lavinia or Atwood's The Penelopiad, Wolf does more than shifting the narrative to a female and relying on that in itself to give the book value. Cassandra talks, but you don't listen to her only because Wolf is telling you that there's more to her story. You listen because Cassandra subverts the way you've learned to accept the story of the war and makes you wonder why you never found some parts questionable, because she's an actually interesting character with interesting things to say, because things aren't black and white but are always more comlex. You listen because the way she tells her story makes you feel like you should be listening.

Of the well-known women in the Iliad, some wonder why Christa Wolf chose Cassandra\u2019s perspective in attesting the heroisms of the Trojan War. In the first place, why a woman? Why Cassandra? Biasness aside, I think it was appropriate for an author to value a woman\u2019s judgment regarding the war. Cassandra was righteous \u2013 she did not let Apollo control her. She is an intelligent and honest woman. She was fit for the role. Honestly, Christa Wolf did an excellent translation. Moreover, a good thing that came out of it is Wolf let the readers get a glimpse of a mindset of a woman in the midst of her struggles in a society dominated by males. But, because of Wolf\u2019s persistence to present a woman as all-knowing and the idea that if only men would believe women all the time, all would be well, my fondness for the book lessened. I am not prejudiced against women but I think it is essential to get the other characters \u2013 both men and women \u2013 in the Iliad become more involved as well. Cassandra is a translation, after all. Aside from Cassandra, I felt the rest of the characters were underdeveloped. Wolf only wrote what Cassandra thinks, what Cassandra feels, what Cassandra hears.
