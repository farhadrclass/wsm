People do it all the time. Getting your prediction right is a bit harder, but honestly, does anyone really care? (c)Q:There was a study in 2011 called \u201cAre Talking Heads Blowing Hot Air,\u201d* in which the predictive abilities of twenty-six pundits were assessed. Predictive powers ranged from mostly right to usually wrong.*For most people, the pleasure of reading this study was the discovery that certain individuals were not just intolerable morons, but statistically intolerable morons. From our perspective as pop science writers, there was an even more exciting result: Regardless of their predictive prowess, all these people still have jobs. In fact, a lot of the worst predictors were the most prominent public figures. (c)Q:The big discontinuous leaps, like the laser and the computer, often depend on unrelated developments in different fields. (c)Q:Consider this: If someone came to you two hundred years ago and asked how we might build a device to scan people\u2019s brain patterns, would your immediate response be, \u201cWell, first we need to trap some gas in a glass tube\u201d? (c)Q:The same difficulty holds for all the technologies in this book: Whether we can build an elevator to space may depend on how good chemists get at arranging carbon atoms into little straws. Whether we can make matter that assumes any shape we tell it to may depend on how well we understand termite behavior. Whether we can build medical nanobots may depend on how well we understand origami. Or maybe none of that stuff will end up mattering in the end. There is nothing about history that necessarily had to be as it was. (c)Q:We now know that the ancient Greeks could create complex gear systems, but never constructed an advanced clock. The ancient Alexandrians had a rudimentary steam engine but never designed a train. The ancient Egyptians invented the folding stool four thousand years ago, but never built an IKEA. (c)Q:There are also people who become cynical because they thought we\u2019d have fusion power or weekend trips to Venus by now. (c)Q:For all these chapters, we had to read a lot of technical books and papers and we had to talk to a lot of mildly crazy people. Some were crazier than others, and generally they were our favorites. (c)Q:The road to Mars may be paved with small discounts.

Cheap Access to Space, 2. Asteroid Mining, 3. Fusion Power, 4. Programmable Matter, 5. Robotic Construction, 6. Augmented Reality, 7. Synthetic Biology, 8. Precision Medicine, 9. Bioprinting and 10.

The Weinersmiths combine fact and humor to create a book that's so informative and silly you'll want to read it again and again. Zach Weinersmith is the creator of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, a popular geek webcomic great for fans of XKCD. His wife, Dr. Kelly Weinersmith, is an accomplished scientist whose work has been featured through many popular science venues. They worked together to explain complicated technology and science in such a way that those who last took a science class in high school can understand what they're talking about. Their combined wit and self-deprecating humor make the writing exciting while Zach's cartoons help break up all the heavy concepts with a good laugh. Personally, I find that if I'm laughing while learning, the concepts stick with me better.

I'm reading an advanced copy so I didn't get to see the color cartoons which are throughout the book as well.The best thing about the book is the examination of where we are and why things are slowly progressing... that analysis of what it takes to make something happen... the shining idea and the crash of reality.

Sadly, the answer for many of the fields that the authors address is that the technology is still so primitive that it is not feasible in the near future and may not be feasible for even many decades hence or even ever, and even for the technology that is feasible, the costs are often so outrageous that, barring major changes to national and international economies, it is unlikely that the technologies will ever be fully developed because the cost is so prohibitive.The book is very grounded in reality, and so the general tone about the development of the future technologies examined is on the pessimistic side, but the book is still very informative and is seasoned with just the right amount of humor and a conversational tone to keep it from being overly technical.

The one minor error that I noticed was in the fusion section. I happen to work in magnetically confined fusion. They said that to heat plasmas \"They electrocute it, microwave it, and fire a beam of neutrons at it\". We most assuredly do not fire a beam of neutrons at it, but we fire a beam of neutrals (that is a particle with no net charge, or non-plasma). This technology is quite interesting on its own (look up netural beam injection on wikipedia).

The illustrations aren't so sensitive that they make sense one or two paragraphs out of context."}, {"userName": "Darnell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell", "userReview": "Good pop science book. Even as someone who reads a fair amount of this subject, I found some new subjects to enjoy, and I appreciated the authors giving a fair amount of space to technical limitations and concerns. Having said that, your enjoyment would probably be related to how much you follow new tech developments. Someone who follows more than I do might not won't find much new, while someone who doesn't touch pop science might find this a fantastic introduction."}, {"userName": "Deb Diner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42873487-deb-diner", "userReview": "I don't read as much nonfiction as I should, but I'm very glad I got this as a Chanukah gift; it's an engaging, humorous, well-researched look at where the world may be heading in the next few decades (or not). Reading it also introduced me to the \"Science... sort of\" podcast, which is informative and delightful. Highly recommend them both!"}, {"userName": "Laci", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4138951-laci", "userReview": "Really good. The authors provide an overview of state of the art in every field, outline some difficulties that will need to be overcome, and make some potential prognoses. It seems to be pretty down-to-Earth, no sci-fi fantasies or such. And it really is written in a way that ensures no scientific background is necessary."}, {"userName": "Peter Tillman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman", "userReview": "I didn't like the smartass writing style, the humor left me cold, I didn't much like the cartoons, and I wasn't learning anything. 1.5 stars, rounded up.Note that this is a minority opinion, and I'm unusually grumpy around the holidays.

This is not an easy combination to find."}], "description": "What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why do we not have a lunar colony already? What is the hold-up?In this smart and funny book, celebrated cartoonist Zach Weinersmith and noted researcher Dr. Kelly Weinersmith give us a snapshot of what's coming next -- from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters. By weaving their own research, interviews with the scientists who are making these advances happen, and Zach's trademark comics, the Weinersmiths investigate why these technologies are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way.New technologies are almost never the work of isolated geniuses with a neat idea. A given future technology may need any number of intermediate technologies to develop first, and many of these critical advances may appear to be irrelevant when they are first discovered. The journey to progress is full of strange detours and blind alleys that tell us so much about the human mind and the march of civilization. To this end, SOONISH investigates ten different emerging fields, from programmable matter to augmented reality, from space elevators to robotic construction, to show us the amazing world we will have, you know, soonish.", "title": "Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34490192-soonish?from_choice=true", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1488834408l/34490192.jpg", "reviews": 300, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16534466.Kelly_Weinersmith", "name": "Kelly Weinersmith"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4094380.Zach_Weinersmith", "name": "Zach Weinersmith"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Science", "Humor", "Sequential Art"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34490192-soonish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37675290-soonish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34510910-soonish"]}
