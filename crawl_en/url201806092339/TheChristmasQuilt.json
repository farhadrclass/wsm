But one day Granny gets a letter with (another) promise from Joe, that he will be home for Christmas.\u201cThe Christmas Quilt\u201d is not as much a story about a quilt as it is about growing up in Smoky Hollow. Granny, the mainstay of the family, is ill. After she receives her latest letter with Joe\u2019s promise, she decides to start a quilt for him.I really enjoyed this quietly told, warm Christmas story. Told from the perspective of the main character, a 12 year old boy growing up in the Smoky Mts, each chapter reminisces a down-home mountain memory. There is a variety of both small and large events in a country boy's life; both good and bad. There are stories of summer-time, of hard work and hard play. There are stories about baptisms in the creek, and church suppers, picking blackberries and harvesting the apples. And there is good old-fashioned American \u2018make-do with what you got\u2019. After all, who ever invented tree stands? who needs a tree stand when you have the outdoors and a barn?\u201cDaddy told Mildred to go and fetch some water from out back, and while she did that Daddy placed the bucket in front of the window, and the two of us placed the tree in the bucket. Daddy had cut it just right \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be any need to cut any of the lower branches to make it fit in. Mildred came back with the water, and Daddy poured it in. Then Daddy said, \u201cYou two go and fetch some rocks now, and I\u2019ll make shore the tree don\u2019t git up and walk away.\u201d So we did that, too, same as every Christmas I could remember since I stood big enough to gather up rocks and bring them in. Mildred and I went back to the barn, got another bucket, and went to pick some of the good-sized rocks up in our road and up near the main road, filling the bucket almost full \u2013 it didn\u2019t need to be all the way full, because the tree trunk would take up some room.Doing something for Christmas like we were doing made the work seem more like fun. We practically ran back to the house with our rocks, feeling all good about them like it was something special to be able to pick up rocks off the road.\u201dThere are days spent in the one-room schoolhouse, and caring for loved ones' resting places on Decoration day. There are long, hot summer revival-time nights and Sundays listening to the tough, hard-nosed Preacher and quiet, star-filled nights coon hunting with childhood friends like Bobby. And interspersed with these, there are more sobering vignettes about wartime. Bobby\u2019s brother is home with a bad leg and shell shock. And the draft system has begun:\u201cWell looky here,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cThey finally stopped volunteer enlistment. Says here the president has tolt folks that the Selective Service System has to be used to fetch recruits.\u201d\u201cReckon folks\u2019ll fight as don\u2019t want to ?\u201d Aunt Lois asked Daddy.\u201cPut \u2018em in a place where they\u2019s people shooting at \u2018em, and don\u2019t matter much whether they want to or not. They will.\u201dA book not only about a twelve-year old boy (turning thirteen) with a busy childhood, it is also a book about a time in America\u2019s past that is forever gone:\u201cTurned out the Gilmer County sheriff had resigned to go fight. Course, he could, him being awful young to begin with. Ed Rackley\u2019s daddy had been sheriff, and when he suddenly died everybody reckoned he had trained Ed good enough to be sheriff, though Ed had barely reached eighteen.\u201d Most of all, \"The Christmas Quilt\" is a story about Granny who never gives up looking for her son to come home. Her unflagging perseverance and spirit shine through this novel, teaching a young boy that what has to be done can be done.A poignant, touching story that reminds us all of what we most look for no matter where we are; a place to come home to."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1315216-jennifer", "userReview": "it is written like country mountain people talk and it drove me crazy, so I quit"}, {"userName": "Janell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1635254-janell", "userReview": "A mildly touching coming-of-age story.

This literally has the word in the title, but it didn't really center around it whatsoever. It really didn't even mention it until the end of the story. I wasn't expecting a terrific book. I just wanted a decent and quick read. This was neither of those because it was boring and I had to DRAG myself through the end. I wanted something that was just a good ol' country story that maybe dealt with quilting at Christmas back in the day. But what I got was just the daily happenings (which in the country in the 1940's wasn't much of nothin' ya hear) and several trips to the church. I didn't connect with any of the characters. And the story was stagnant from the get-go. If you like books that don't really go anywhere - this is for you. I'll give it the extra half-star because I did enjoy some of the author's writing style. I've seen country done better, but there were a few spots in the book where he captured things a bit more uniquely than others. Though it's not enough to earn your attention to read this al the way through. Trust me."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56902751-meghan", "userReview": "Book club, book 15, Nov. 2007, I did not read this yet, but I think mom has the book."}, {"userName": "Shelly Hammond", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18711623-shelly-hammond", "userReview": "This is a sad, happy, inspiring story revolving around a close knit family living in a very different time than we are now and the events that lead up to the Christmas of 1942. You find out extremely early on what makes this particular Christmas so important and then the story proceeds to show you what transpires in the months before.The author tells the story from the main focal point of a 12, going on 13, year old boy. Times were so much different back then it was entertaining to try to picture the events as they were happening. There were quite a few sermons and things of that nature (not relating to Christmas) that I suppose I wasn't necessarily expecting as they took up a good bit of story time but they were good. The book was one that was predictable in the sense that it told you what would happen at the end, so it was supposed to be and that really built up a bit of the emotional turmoil you, the reader, held on to, as you read. It was also very unpredictable at many different places so it had a terrific balance. This is one that tugs on the heartstrings a lot and may just remind some of their own youth or others of the stories they may have heard from their own older relatives while growing up. It's definitely worth reading and don't let the name get you, it doesn't have to be read at Christmas. It can be read and enjoyed any time of year!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10468325-emily", "userReview": "A simple, southern tale of a boy coming of age in rural Georgia.This story had so many parallels to Cold Sassy Tree that I couldn't help but think of the work by Olive Ann Burns as I read this one: the setting of historical Georgia; the unkind-but-acclimatable slang and twang of the region and its people; the overbearing aunt always picking on the adolescent boy; the focus on a grandparent and that relation's private life; a water-downed version of the gospel intermingled into the plot. When the boy nearly got hit by a train, it was a little uncanny.However, this story had a different slant and slightly different feel - and plenty of sadness, what with two world wars and polio outbreaks and veterans returning home not the same men who'd left. The focus on a prodigal son's return also made for a different kind of story.I enjoyed the writing, and Granny's gentle wisdom, and the red clay of Georgia that seemed like a character unto itself. All in all, a good, even-paced read - very enjoyable, and I look forward to checking out the author's other work."}, {"userName": "Allison Fetch", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14227409-allison-fetch", "userReview": "This was a very sweet coming of age story. A young boy, a member of a poor farming community, spends his twelfth year doing chores, getting his first crush, having his best friend contract polio, watching his grandmother slowly wither due to heart disease, and waiting for his uncle to come home from an idyllic life in Detroit. The author manages to put magic and appreciation into the smallest of activities, making the entire book a study in valuing the little things in life. I actually quite enjoyed the dialogue being in the dialect of the northern Georgia rural areas, though I know that some would find it annoying and difficult to read. I felt that the language really transported me into the story the descriptions were vivid and the characters enchanting."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/276570-natalie", "userReview": "[close] I really enjoyed reading this story about a family in the northern mountains of Georgia in 1942, told from the point of view of a 13 year old boy living with his dad and Granny. I think what I enjoyed the most was the look at life back then and there -- a much simpler life in many ways, more difficult in other ways. I loved all of the Southern dialect and the portrayal of Southern life in the 1940s.

It's a fictional memoir of a young boy growing up in Georgia, therefore written heavily in Southern dialect.

It would have been interesting for that reason alone.
