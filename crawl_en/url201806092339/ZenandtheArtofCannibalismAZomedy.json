But when a giant evil talking dog shows up and starts raising the dead, things get a little more complicated. As the end grows nigh, it's up to Wiz and his ragtag cohorts (along with a binge-drinking voodoo god) to fend off the hungry horde. Will they make it? Or will everything go up in smoke? A hilarious, gut-busting, skull-crunching homage to B-movies everywhere. Funnier than The Illyad... Scarier than Brokeback Mountain... Dumber than Breakfast of Champions... Significantly shorter than Dune... It's Zen and the Art of Cannibalism.", "title": "Zen and the Art of Cannibalism: A Zomedy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25463506-zen-and-the-art-of-cannibalism", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430501013l/25463506.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8191090.Daniel_Younger", "name": "Daniel Younger"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25463506-zen-and-the-art-of-cannibalism", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31571200-the-wrath-of-con", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23616406-delirious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29983043-the-wrong-girl"]}
