They are a mess but they are the kind of mess that every family can relate to. They are real; they make mistakes but they are connected as family. This story has a lot of elements in it: many family members, all with their own \"issues\"; the ecosystem, marine life, living abroad, health and courage. Mix it together and there's a lot going on. For me, some of these elements were weak and the story may have been stronger without them. The author, at times, jumps in the storylines without detail. No big jumps, no loss of continuity....just small jarring moves that makes the reading sometimes jumpy. But throughout it all, the author never loses sight of warm and heart.All in all, I enjoyed this book. It's warm, tender, humorous, sensitive and is a satisfying read. The ending was truly a warming touch, with the author showing what she terms \"the magic heart of the dragon\"."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Blair", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553494-jennifer-blair", "userReview": "I received this book through a Goodreads giveaway, and I'm so glad it has a permanent place in my collection. We're All In This Together is the type of book you can read at different times in your life and get something totally different from it each time. I've been the callow teenager and the lost housewife and the woman afraid to live--all characters that Jones portrays with brutal honesty, humor, and love. This family is all families--perfectly imperfect, messy, and hard to like. But there are such shining moments of humanity in this book that I turned the final page feeling that we all have, to quote Jones, the magic heart of a dragon.

In the end, every family is fucked up, right? That's the overriding theme of this novel set in Thunder Bay, Ontario. I've never been to Thunder Bay, but to me it sounds a lot like a bigger version of Ladner - always overshdowed by Toronto, people either desperate to get out or happy to stay. And in the middle is the Parker family. Estranged family member Finn comes back to deal with the aftermath over her mother going over Niagra Falls in a barrel, becoming an overnight YouTube sensation.

Definitely great to relive some Thunder Bay memories."}, {"userName": "Ryley (Ryley Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30704624-ryley-ryley-reads", "userReview": "Thanks so much to Penguin Random House for sending me a copy of this book in exchange of an honest review. As always, all opinions are my own.Going into this book, I had no really idea what to expect. I knew it was about a family of which the matriarch, mother, wife, etc. goes over a waterfall in a barrel. That and the author is Canadian and the book was set in Canada. At it's bare bones, I suppose that is what this book is about, but their is also so much more to the story.There are quite a few perspectives that we get, although the first, and main one is of one of the twin daughters, Serafina, or Finn. Finn is the one who 'got out,' leaving behind her family for the big city. After Finn hears that her mom, Kate, was in an accident, she begrudgingly goes home for a few days. Finn was an interesting character, she is pretty much at the point in her life where nothing makes her happy anymore, not her family and not her life away. She does grow quite a bit thoughout the novel, and sees that life in the Parker house is never 'normal.'We also get to know Finn's twin sister, Nicki, who is pretty much her polar opposite. After becoming a teen mom, Nicki stayed up north with her parents, eventually having a set of twin girls herself, and a little boy, all with different fathers. Although Nicki was portrayed as your typical \"white-trash,\" she was also a little bit endearing and she actually ends up being a better sister than Finn originally thought. There's a lot of anger in Nicki, but I think there's a lot of emotion in general in her character, everything she does, it is with all she has.Another one of the 'children' is Shawn. Technically, he is just a boy Kate took in when he was a teenager, riding the rails, getting into trouble, but he is practically a Parker. Out of all the characters in the book, I think he was my least favourite. He is married and has two boys, but seems to care more about the Parkers, than his own family.We also get quite a bit of the story told in the perspective of Shawn's wife, Katriina, who I think was my favourite character. In an attempt to save their marriage from the dullness, they decide to have another baby. Unfortunately, Katriina ends up having three miscarriages, the last of which occurs on the day Kate goes over the falls. Katriina has a hard time being the steady constant that Shawn needs, and ends up driving herself to the brink trying to be perfect. At one point, she takes a box cutter to her calves because she can't deal with it anymore. I loved how raw and real Katriina's chapters felt, and part of me almost wishes that this book was more about her and Shawn's life, with Kate's accident more of a side story. This little family fascinated me, and I was always excited to read Katriina's chapters and get back to the 'good' part.There are also a couple other POV's, Kate herself, Walter, Kate's husband, and London, Kate's granddaughter and Nicki's daughter. Walter's chapters were interesting enough, but I didn't feel they added much. London's side story was a little bit, I think, unnecessary, but I suppose it did have some point in the end.Storywise, I enjoyed this book. I think I would have preferred if there was one main storyline, I guess it was supposed to be the waterfall incident, but I just felt, because Kate was in a coma and not really mentally stable, we didn't really get a lot of details on the event. I think if one of the other stories was a main one, like Katriina and Shawn, and Kate's was more secondary, that would have been better. Although I do get that the author was trying to show that yes, this crazy thing happened, but there's also crazy 'normal' issues going on as well, i.e. marital issues, meeting strange men online, cheating boyfriends, having to choose between work and family, all things people can relate to, because most can't relate to going over a waterfall in a barrel.I think this book was very well written. It is told over the course of four days, and the writing style really made it enjoyable. You really felt like you were in the character's heads.Overall, I think this is a great summer read, perfect for the beach, that deals with family issues that are easily relatable."}, {"userName": "Penny McGill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7033258-penny-mcgill", "userReview": "I can't remember why I found this one - some list somewhere? - but when it arrived on the holds shelf I felt like I was extra lucky because just look at that shark! He is tossing a barrel on his sharky snout. Terrifying. There is an underlying feeling of unease in the reading of this book because it is about family and no family life is perfect. There are sharks everywhere. Amy Jones has written something beautiful here and I've shelved it in my 'book club favourites' shelf because I think it would be a rip roaring success for any group. There is no way a group could read this and not dredge up their own family stories, their own youthful indiscretions, stories about their mother. It's just filled with gorgeous moments and, as I was reading it I thought about so many other books that I have read which resonated for me. Moments that have stayed with me. Snapshots that come back as I'm listening to the radio and a little tidbit of a novel will pop back into my head. Amy Jones is that kind of writer - her paragraphs linger in there forever.It takes place in Thunder Bay which is a delight and it's filled with people who are punching and kicking (sometimes actually so) their way through a life that is messy and real. I can't say enough about this novel. It's five stars plus. There is a reason there is a shark on the cover which wasn't apparent to me at first but once I got to that realization it was like.. ah. So clever, this Amy Jones. We are all in this together. It's a wonderful read. You should read it and you should give it to customers to read. A lively story that will keep them engaged from beginning to end and they will surely see something of themselves in it."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2593004-danielle", "userReview": "I read this as a monthly reading with my book club. It was my selection, actually, and to be honest, I enjoyed it! However small this complaint may be, the hazard symbols corresponding with the characters should not have been placed at the end of the book. I didn't come to notice it until over half-way through. Prior to that, I often had to flip back to remind myself who was speaking. Once I realized the symbols had a purpose though, it was great!Now, onto the story. It was funny, a little far-fetched, but definitely funny. I understand why the novel started the way that it did, but in all honesty, I found Finn's portions of the book to be the least eventful. Every time I turned the page to see it was Finn's chapter, I found myself skimming in order to get to Katriina's or Kate's segments. If I were to pick a favourite aspect of the novel, it would surely be Kate's flashbacks to her time in Europe. We're introduced to a completely different side of Kate, a fun, exuberant, and adventurous side. What's even nicer, in my opinion, is the fact that her granddaughter, London, is the only person with whom she has shared this this portion of her past. While it may not have been exactly what I was hoping for, it is definitely worth placing on your \"To Read\" shelf. People of all ages could read this novel and get something different from it at each stage of their lives. Although my rating reflects 3 stars, I would give it a solid 3.5 if that were an option, so I'm going to leave it at a 3."}, {"userName": "Ashley Corbett", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43857479-ashley-corbett", "userReview": "I picked this up on a whim and because I liked the cover but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Finn is called back to a complicated family situation she fled years earlier in Thunder Bay when her mother, Kate, goes over goes over Kakabeka Falls \u2014 \"the Niagara of the North\" \u2014 in a barrel, barely surviving and becoming a viral video sensation.Once Finn returns to Thunder Bay, the book\u2019s narration is shared among Finn and her father, her twin sister, her niece, her adopted brother, his wife, and others: in total 10 separate narrators, each with their own clear voice. The family members\u2019 accounts layer, cross and converge, each person seeing the weekend\u2019s events through the lens of their memories of past events.We\u2019re All in This Together brings Thunder Bay to life so faithfully the reader could follow the characters\u2019 steps on a map. Jones, a native of Halifax and only recently of Thunder Bay, does a beautiful job of bringing small-city living to life: \"She is all about the downtown north core, that two-block radius of stores and restaurants that can make you feel like you\u2019re in a real city until you realize you have walked the entire length of the neighbourhood in less than a minute,\" she writes of one character\u2019s commitment to condo living. \"Still, if you never left that two-block radius, if you lived and worked and partied there, you might be able to forget where you are.\"Jones draws her characters in bold strokes: all are three-dimensional individuals who sometimes try to do their best, but whose actions are also often motivated by rage or loss, jealousy or fear.Beyond Kate and Finn, fully half of the book\u2019s narrators are modern female protagonists in the Gone Girl/ Girl on the Train vein: conflicted, sometimes foul-mouthed women who work to balance what society expects of them with that they want for themselves.Indeed, the strength of the women characters shines a light on perhaps the only quibble with the complex narrative structure: the lack of explanation of what a couple of key male characters are thinking. Among the detailed accounting of the memories and thought processes of so many people, Finn\u2019s ex-boyfriend and brother-in-law appear in silhouette, the reader left to guess at their motivations.While dealing with the acute problem of Kate\u2019s trip over the waterfall, the Parker family is struggling to come to terms with her worsening dementia. Kate herself strives to hide her condition from her family, while her husband and children deal with the spectre of the decline of the family matriarch while doing their best to pretend it\u2019s not happening.Kate\u2019s particular illness \u2014 semantic dementia, which causes sufferers to lose language skills \u2014 is shared by Jones\u2019 mother in real life, and some of the the book\u2019s most resonant writing is in Kate\u2019s voice as she navigates her new mental landscape: \"Kate begins to remember little snippets from the previous day... There was a drive, the girl, something about a sandwich. A deer. The girl is searching for someone. The girl is her granddaughter. Her name is on the tip of Kate\u2019s tongue.\" The view from inside Kate\u2019s head is bewildering; the reader roots for her.Jones takes a messy knot of a family and carefully draws out each strand, examining the way it connects with the others. The result is a nuanced examination of the ties that bind a family together.Review reprinted from the Winnipeg Free Press: http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts..."}, {"userName": "Michelle (FabBookReviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5752615-michelle-fabbookreviews", "userReview": "Thank you Penguin Canada and First Reads! 4.5 stars We're All in This Together is one of those reads that (excuse the shark nod), you will delight in sinking your teeth into. Award-winning Canadian writer Amy Jones has crafted, rather masterfully, an all-at-once funny, heartbreaking, and wonderfully plotted novel about a family you will not soon forget.The novel begins with an introduction to Finn Parker, who is forced back to her hometown of Thunder Bay, Ontario, upon hearing that her mother is in a coma. Finn's mother, Katherine, has become a bizarre media sensation due to a video of her launching over a waterfall going viral. Finn, already struggling with memories of the last time she saw her family- which involved an awful blow-up with her abrasive sister-now has to return home as the daughter of new North American viral sensation: The Conqueror of Kakabeka Falls.We're All in This Together weaves together a complex and potent story about an almost-deteriorating family. While it seems, initially, as though the story is going to focus mainly upon Finn, Jones takes the readers in unexpected directions with different members of the Parker family. The author pulls pieces of the Parker family apart to examine multiple family members, telling their intersecting stories and their most intimate, unforgivable, and searing moments. Jones thoroughly explores the different veins of the the family: everything from Katherine's complicated history of love to her current state of mental health; Finn and her sister's extremely volatile and aching sibling history; Finn's teenage niece's call to action on ecological and environmental concerns; to that of adopted brother Shawn's place as a 'Parker', to his current relationship with wife Katriina. There is, quite simply, a lot to unravel and appreciate in this story. While potentially daunting (and potentially swamped) with an alternating roster of character storylines and past-and-present timelines operating, Jones smoothly maintains the various story angles and reveals.Overall, We're All In This Together is just a terrific and out-of-the-ordinary novel. An accomplished read, Jones' novel is very sharp, very funny, with some major heartrending moments. Any readers who enjoy their Canadian lit, family-centred tragicomedies, or enjoy the work of authors such as Maria Semple, Jonathan Tropper, Miriam Toews, or Elinor Lipman, might especially savour this read.I received a copy of this title courtesy of Penguin Canada via First Reads in exchange for an honest review.

It takes all the pieces of the family jigsaw puzzle tosses them all over and you need to find a way to bring it all back together again into the new reality. The Parkers are a family that doesn't lack for drama but does lack in the ability to face it all head on.The decision of Kate, the matriarch of the family to take a trip over Kakabeka Falls in a barrel is the catalyst that forces them to confront their issues and each other to fall back together or apart for good.I could relate to many of the personalities in this book.

But when matriarch Kate Parker miraculously survives plummeting over a waterfall in a barrel -- a feat captured on a video that goes viral -- it's Kate's family who tumbles into chaos under the spotlight. Her prodigal daughter returns to town. Her 16-year-old granddaughter gets caught up in an online relationship with a man she has never met. Her husband sifts through their marriage to search for what sent his wife over the falls. Her adopted son fears losing the only family he's ever known. Then there is Kate, who once made a life-changing choice and now fears her advancing dementia will rob her of memories from when she was most herself. Set over the course of four calamitous days, Amy Jones's big-hearted first novel follows the Parkers' misadventures as catastrophe forces them to do something they never thought possible -- act like a family.", "title": "We're All in This Together", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893652-we-re-all-in-this-together", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1461532066l/25893652.jpg", "reviews": 138, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1556469.Amy_Jones", "name": "Amy Jones"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893652-we-re-all-in-this-together", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6662072-what-boys-like", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39906756-tiny-house-living", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36100861-time-to-play", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32756985-adventures-in-mixed-media-art", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2792207-the-drabble-project"]}
