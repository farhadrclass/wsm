Which means everything should be taken with a grain of salt. However, Harlequin Teen was kind enough to provide this ARC to me and I felt I should at least take the time to explain why I couldn't make it all the way through.It had something to do with this:The writing made me go:The Characters were like:And I had to stop before I was driven to:Maybe I should have kept up with it, because most people seem to really enjoy this book. But I found the writing extremely telling. The main character, Samantha tells us a lot about herself in a very awkward manner rather than showing us who she is. Thus I had very little invested in either her or Bishop. Since I didn't connect to her, I found it hard to connect to the world and to, in turn, stay interested in the novel.It was like one of those avalanches started by a single stone. I don't want to hear that you were acting out because of your parent's divorce so you tried shoplifting and, since that didn't work, making out with your crush was another option. It was very disingenuous to me as a character voice and I couldn't relate to how she expressed herself. Sure, the back story is there but the emotion is not. The frustration, the sense of helplessness and impotence, the uncontrollable urge to lash out - all of this was missing and replaced with a fairly lucid, detached personality reflecting on her state of being with all the emotional investment that I usually give to my breakfast cereal.I would suggest this book for fans of City of Bones or Twilight - but I would also suggest reading the first chapter and half and deciding whether you bond with the protagonist and the writing style before purchasing."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Armentrout", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4533977-jennifer-armentrout", "userReview": "That is one hot angel/demon/dude/whatever he is"}, {"userName": "Anzu The Great Destroyer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2278800-anzu-the-great-destroyer", "userReview": "I'm not planning on reading this book.

I\u2019m also getting really, really sick of special people. Why is it that the main characters of pretty much all Paranormal YA books have to be so flipping beautiful and special? Are we really so shallow that authors think if their characters are ugly, they won\u2019t get any readers? Because that is not true. Take the Downside Ghost series; the hero is a ugly thug, whilst the heroine is a messed up drug addict, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that those books are pretty damn popular. So how about we take the beautiful and the special down a notch, so that the heroine doesn\u2019t spend half the book visually molesting the guy, and the hero doesn\u2019t get off on telling the girl how bloody special she is?Dark Kiss is no different from about a hundred other books in the same genre, which means that the characters were so forgettable that I don\u2019t even remember their names. In fact, they were such a bore to read that I went and did the laundry instead. It\u2019s a good thing my mother doesn\u2019t know about this book or she may bring it out every time I refuse to do my chores - she\u2019ll have me on my knees scrubbing the floorboards like Cinder-freaking-rella. Needless to say, I couldn\u2019t finish this book. I could feel my soul crying out in pain, so much so that I wished the serial-kissing-soul-stealer could leap out from the pages and lay a big fat one on me. I\u2019d be so grateful I\u2019d snog him to within an inch of his life."}, {"userName": "Mimi Valentine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6110599-mimi-valentine", "userReview": "**Interview on my blog with Bishop and Kraven today + two giveaways! Trust me when I say you don't want to miss it! :') Enter HERE! You have to admit it: This gorgeously dark cover is probably the first thing that piqued your interest. But even though I've been burned by stunning covers before, I'm happy to report that Dark Kiss isn't a deceiving one! :) In Dark Kiss, two angels and two demons are sent down to Earth to work together on a mission to get rid of the grays (soulless beings who can drain the souls out of others through kisses). This is one of those books that blurs the line between good and bad. Whether you go to heaven or hell is really like a lottery with 50/50 odds \u2014 and that makes it so much harder to know who to trust and who to push under the bus!Sam may seem like your regular girl on the surface but she has a heart of gold underneath. Even though she's far from perfect, she's also incredibly determined, loyal, and admirably brave with the way she deals with the meddling angel/demon team. I only wish we'd gotten to know the characters more \u2014 not just Sam, but the angels, demons, and her best friend Carly as well. Bishop isn't your average angel! Dark and brooding, he harbors a mysterious past that only makes him even more alluring. And even though there's no love triangle in this book, trust me when I say that this is one where you actually want one! \u2665 Kraven, one of the demons on the four-man team, is the snarky, rude, and totally inappropriate character that adds hilarious commentary at the perfect times. I alternated between the urge to smack him and kiss him.With Michelle's fantastic writing style, a sweet romance, and the original and intriguing angel/demon lore, Dark Kiss is the first book I've ever read by Michelle Rowan but it definitely won't be the last! She's a one-sit kind of author, that's for sure! :)BUY or BORROW?: I'm probably biased since I'm buying a copy just to have this gorgeous cover on my shelf, but I think that this book is well worth the read and buy! ;) (Original review at Mimi Valentine's YA Review Blog)"}, {"userName": "Lynsey   (A Bookish Life)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5112089-lynsey-a-bookish-life", "userReview": "First of all, I cry foul!

It's all, like, normal and stuff. B. O. R. I. N. G.As for the contents inside the book? Eh. It was okay. It was a decent enough story, but it had a lot of cliches, incredibly 2D cardboard cut-out characters, and a rather unlikable protagonist.The worst part for me was the characterisation of the main character, Samantha, which consisted of TELLING me (as opposed to showing me), that she was a bookish, nerdy type that incongruously, for reasons unknown to the world at large, kept banging on about how she'd once shoplifted and ran away from home and spent three nights sleeping rough on the streets. #troubled #introvertedShe was also quite bitchy and snarky, which was another thing she kept TELLING us about; that she had this incredible wit and had learned to fight people with her sharp tongue. Not once did I find any of her comebacks funny or cool in any way, but whatevs. #ohsnap #noyoudi'n'tShe was also a bit TSTL. Like, \"Hee, hee! Let's follow the weird, clearly mental, homeless dude into a dark alley.

One really sweet, the token friend. One bad as bad can be...I'm pretty sure the YAers will lap it all up, but I've read far too many books, including recently two brilliant YA books (Wilde's Fire by Krystal Wade and Immortal Rules by Julie Kagawa), to accept this mediocre writing. It's all been done before so much better.Having said all that, I did read it all the way through and in pretty short order. Like I said, the story itself was not too terrible and could have been so much better if it had some decent characters to carry it. But alas, it did not.To sum up, it entertained me for a few hours, but I didn't like the characters enough to want more.

While I was hoping for a little more, this was a quick, easy and fairly enjoyable story to read. As the story opens up we are introduced to Sam and her best friend Carly as they are going to the town's popular teenage club. Right away Sam's long-time crush, Stephen, singles Sam out and kisses her. This kiss is different than any she's experienced, drastically changing her and opening up a new world and new powers. This change comes with a huge drawback, a hunger that can't be satisfied with food. Soon she learns that she is part of a bigger world, one of angels, demons and others and now she's on their radar. She finds out there are angels and demons working together to stem the tide of \"grays,\" growing in number fast. Grays pose a threat to humans because they can suck the souls out of them. Bishop is an angel in charge of this mission but ever since he's been back on earth he has had trouble finding and gathering his team and focusing at all. His mental status is hovering around crazy. Sam, seeing Bishop and mistaking him for a homeless, vulnerable teen in need of help, stops to assist him and touches him, clearing his mental fog. Not only is she able to do that, but she is also able to see where the other team members are and leads Bishop to them. No one knows why she's able to do this but she has just become an unwelcome member to this team. Most of the members are not too pleased.  I enjoyed the author's original take on the whole angel and demon lore and her vivid descriptions and imagery made the scenes come alive. Unfortunately, for me the story felt a little lacking in depth. Bishop was a main character yet I didn't feel we got much on his back story to help us understand his motivations. I admired Sam's loyalty to her best friend and her desire to help ones in need however, her actions and reasoning had me shaking my head in disbelief. Her na\u00efve trusting of other characters, even with little information or answers, made want to pull my hair out. Her ping-pong feelings towards Bishop were also an irritation for me. The romance felt a bit forced and while it wasn't technically an insta-love, it certainly had some of the identifying marks of one. This story took a positive turn for me though, in the last twenty-five percent. Sam seemed to smarten up and finally got her feelings sorted out and the story pace picked up considerably. Another plus for me was the fact that this didn't leave off on a cliffhanger. The story wraps up nicely while leaving you wanting more. I will be picking up the sequel to find out what happens next.

But unfortunately Dark Kiss fell a long way short from my expectations.Out one night in the up and coming club Crave with her best friend Carly, Sam\u2019s unexpectedly approached by Stephen, she\u2019s had crush on him for as long as she can remember, she always knew she never had a chance with him, he was hot and hung round with the popular crowd, so it comes as a bit of a surprise when she spots him in the club when he should be away in college and he insists on talking to her in private. However what was meant to be a chat turns out into a full blown make out session. And then to top it off he just leaves her there referring her to as a kid and with no explanation what so ever.The next few days get weirder by the minute; Sam finds guys are paying attention to her more than usual, even her best friend\u2019s ex-boyfriend! She also finds that she\u2019s constantly hungry all the time and nothing can quench her appetite. Then she bumps into Bishop, a guy so confused he has no idea what\u2019s going on, just that he has to complete some sort of mission. Also when Sam touches him there\u2019s this sort of spark between them. Sam can also see these \u201cbright lights\u201d that Bishop was meant to see. So they decide to help each other out, Sam will lead Bishop to each \u201cbright light\u201d she comes across and he will help her get down to the bottom of her problem.What I enjoyed about Dark Kiss.Kraven (Bishop\u2019s brother) a demon badass and probably the funniest character in the entire book. He was a proper wind-up merchant, always had a witty, snarky come back, and knew how to get under your skin. Even though Kraven was meant to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d as he was a demon we didn\u2019t get to see much of that side. I think I would have liked to see more of a darker side to him.Bishop; he was so adorable, he fell down to earth all confused with no idea how to complete his mission. He was always dedicated even though he was completely weak most of the time. I also loved the banter between him and Kraven.What I didn\u2019t enjoy; The forbidden relationship between Bishop and Sam felt like insta-love. As soon as Sam saw him she just knew he was the one. I understand that she couldn\u2019t be apart from him as her touch helped Bishop clear his thoughts, but the constant brooding about him really began to irritate me.The meant to be surprises didn\u2019t feel like surprises at all, I was able to guess what was going to happen before it actually did and so Dark Kiss wasn\u2019t really an enthralling read as I\u2019d hoped it would be. By the second half of this book, I felt I was just reading for the sake of reading, the initial enjoyment I had started off with had quickly disappeared and it soon became a draining read.The amount of times someone referred to Sam as \u201cspecial\u201d without any elaboration as to why she was special made me want to thump someone.By the end of the book Kraven and Bishop hugely reminded me of Stefan and Damon from the Vampire Diaries.So overall Dark Kiss was not my cup of tea, however I think I may be in the minority as most people I know thoroughly enjoyed this book. So don\u2019t let my review put you off from reading it. I know dedicated fans of paranormal romance would love this.Thank you NetGalley and Harlequin for the opportunity to read this book.This review and more can also be found on: The Readers Den"}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68305370-kayla", "userReview": "I really loved this book!

The kiss stole Samantha's soul and makes her hungry all the time - not for food though but for kisses. After meeting the mysterious Bishop, Samantha finds out that she's now a Gray and that her kiss can devour souls.-The plot was ok but certain aspects were just dragged out too long like finding Bishop's team. The characters bar a few were all flat and unoriginal. The romance was like every other romance in YA.-Sam was the typical YA heroine she was unpopular, flat chested, had absent parents and no-one understood her. Naturally, it didn't take long for someone to describe her as special \u2014 even though she wasn't. What really annoyed me was how much Sam stuttered when she was shocked or scared or turned on \u2014 it made her seem idiotic. I was baffled when Sam claimed she was witty and was good at one liners. Her so called snarky sense of humour wasn't clever it was rubbish.-Sam lost her soul but apart from feeling cold and wanting to kiss everyone she was no different from before. She still had normal feelings, thoughts and morals. Why was her soul so important when it didn't do anything??-Sam was so dumb and selfish, it was her fault that Carly was turned into a Gray - instead of making sure Carly got home ok she left her in a club knowing that they were other Grays there that could easily turn her. I hated that Sam left her friend somewhere dangerous all so she could go off with a guy she'd only just met. -The romance was predictable and cheesy. In less than a week Sam fell for Bishop. The insta-love was 'explained' by the usual inexplicable connection and attraction that heroines in YA/PNR/UF seem to get struck with so often \u2014 it was unconvincing and was a lazy way to avoid characters getting to know each other in an organic way. Unsurprisingly, Sam's whole life started to revolve around Bishop over a course of a few days \u2014 she thought about him all the time, she couldn't concentrate on anything else and nothing else was important. Bishop was no better than Sam. -The relationship Bishop had with Kraven was far more interesting than the one he had with Sam. Kraven was by far the best character, he was actually quite funny and I could understand why he had such a chip on his shoulder in regard to Bishop.-There were of course the stereotypical mean girls that hated the heroine for no good reason. It's become quite clear that in YA land most girls don't care about anything but boys and bullying girls.-Yet again the virgin heroine was called a slut by the resident mean girl just because more than one guy was interested in her. I don't know why most girls that aren't the heroine get portrayed in a negative way when in reality most girls aren't like that.Overall a bit of disappointing read, it's not a completely horrible book but I couldn't get into it because it was so similar to other YA books. I think new readers or readers that enjoy the same type of formula found in paranormal YA will probably enjoy this."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581159-jennifer", "userReview": "Samantha runs into her crush Stephen while out a night club.

So does the cover, and when I started reading I knew I was right about the title implying this was going to be a deliciously wicked novel. Awesome storyline, awesome characters. Michelle Rowen is an awesome author, and she has written one awesome novel. Okay, with all that awesomeness out of my system, I can now tell you just how much I love Dark Kiss. Let me start with the characters. Samantha (Sam), Bishop, Kraven, Roth, Zach, Connor, and Carly and so many more, but these are the ones I fell in love with the most. Sam is the kinda shy, loner girl who really is tough. Bishop is the head angel who's in charge of this heavenly mission with two more angels: Zach, who a healer and Connor, the smart ass. Then there're the demons, Kraven, who is the good/bad boy and Roth, who is just a mean jerk, and they all are working together. Carly is Sam's cool best friend. Thank you Michelle Rowen for this incredible novel.Sam is seventeen, and she never thought a kiss from the guy she\u2019s been crushing would change her life forever. And she sure didn't think that kiss would become the reason why she\u2019d be the only one that could save Bishop and his heavenly mission. This kiss is Sam's own something wicked, and it came straight for her. Sam and Bishop have a connection to each other, and it's not just for the mission, it's also one with their hearts. For Sam, this romance might be more dangerous than the dark kiss. Bishop has secrets about his past, the angel she\u2019s falling in love with\u2014the angel that is more dangerous than a demon.Kraven is one of the demons sent on this mission to help Bishop. Kraven and Bishop have a secret, too. Rowen gives just enough about the secrets these two share to make me beg for the next book. Kraven\u2014I couldn't get enough of this cocky bad boy. He is just slick, and when he says \"sweetness\", his nick name for Sam, it sends chills up my spine. Oh yes, I love Kraven, and Bishop is also a hottie. Both these bad boys make my heart race a little faster.Dark Kiss is Heaven and Hell coming together to create the nightwatchers, who protect and whose mission is to save Trinity, New York from the evil in the darkness. And it all starts with a dangerous, delicious dark kiss.

So... Let's start with easy part. I love this cover - it's probably one of the prettiest covers this year. Too bad that what was betwen the covers wasn't so good. Maybe the problem is in me because I've read few good reviews about Dark Kiss and I wanted for a while now to read a really good book involving angels. (If you, guys, have any suggestions, I'd appreciate it.) My biggest problem with Michelle Rowen's novel was that it didn't feel believable. I know what you are going to say - it is fantasy, it's not realistic - but, in my opinion, for fantasy novels it's even a bigger deal that while you are reading it, you have a feeling that it truly could happen the way author described it. That's why it's important to make sure that plot doesn't have loose ends or that what motivates characters is set out really clearly. Problem with Dark Kiss was plot - it sounds great and interesting, but there is too much repetition and you get lost in Samantha's thinking and going over and over the same stuff. You don't have write again what happened on the next ten pages - we read it, we know. No matter all the things I found lacking, I still enjoyed in this book - well, I did read it in one day. I like that it has dark atmosphere and that nothing isn't the way it seems.

I mean who doesn't like angels and demons trying to say the world? The cover was also really cool which I'm kind of sad to say kind of influenced me reading it. I wasn't sure how good the romance between Samantha and Bishop was going to be since it seemed like it would take up more plot than it should. Before reading it, I had seen many people who liked it but there was one review that I saw showing that Samantha was a whiny and \"weak\" character. I think that this could have been better if it wasn't first person from her point of view. This is true in about 70% of the book. Samantha doesn't really handle her problems and she complains or makes irrational decisions thinking she knows what she's doing. She cries (a lot!) too many times to count and for no reason. It was also annoying how many times she got called \"special\". She does have some cool powers but there has to be another way to describe it then \"special\". I did get a little excited seeing that there might be a love triangle going on but that might be in the second book. There was some action in the ending of the book but it was kind of predictable with what was going to happen. I did like the minor characters in the book (yes, even Roth) and I hope to learn more about them in the second book.I think that I will read the second book because there is a hint of an even larger evil and who knows, Samantha might get a little stronger."}, {"userName": "Mitch", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170554-mitch", "userReview": "Michelle Rowen's writing really saves this one. The characters are pretty much tried and true tropes; at this point I've seen too many of these triangles where the nice and slightly bookish girl has to choose between the serious hero and the sarcastic antihero I just really don't care anymore - not that I really cared before. But the plot wasn't bad at all and Rowen does dark urban fantasy pretty well - actually, considering how generic the characters were, the book kind of surprised me, I wasn't nearly as bored as I thought I'd be and might even look forward to the sequel.But the characters really are generic, by the books, uninspired, unoriginal. Kraven, the sarcastic antihero, is definitely the worst of the bunch - no, calling Sam by a pet nickname and dropping hints that you may be somewhat dangerous and have a hidden agenda does not make you interesting or unique. Nor does being a demon who may or may not be totally evil. Need more character development than that. Bishop, the serious hero, wasn't that much better. At least it's implied that he has some sort of tragic past, and over the course of the book he did surprise me with how he deals with the burdens of his mission and makes a few interesting choices. But he was still really boring. Now that I think about it, I really wish Rowen switched these two characters. Why not have a sarcastic hero and a serious antihero? At least that would be something different ... because right now sidekicks Roth and Zach are more interesting than those two.Sam as the sassy heroine wasn't that great either. I get that she's toned down to fit with the darker mood of this book, so not as sassy, but there are a couple of places I thought she could've been a little snarkier, worked on her dark humor. And I thought her justifications for helping her evil aunt Natalie were a little weak, didn't like her going back and forth for so long deciding that. But a couple of things surprised me, her friendship with Carly, which I thought like everything else was rather generic, really got interesting in the end, likewise her relationship with her mother. It's too bad so much felt crammed into the final quarter of this book, book's definitely not slow, but maybe could've been a little better paced.What I did like, though, was the tone and mood. For some weird reason I have a headache from reading this, but, wow, Rowen had some really dark and ominous stuff in here. Sam's vision of the entire city melting into a pool of shadow, a supernatural void that sucks in anything around it, a ritual involving stabbing people in the chest. I get why Sam freaks out from seeing that - several times, but those are the kind of details that I really thought makes this book stand out beyond the typical angel book. Together with the muted feel, awesome. Perfectly matches the dark cover design at least.So yeah, liked the book, really liked the plot and writing, but the characters didn't really work for me. Seen them before. Something to work on for the sequel at least ..."}, {"userName": "Soumi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6833452-soumi", "userReview": "Dark and haunting tale of love, Dark Kiss is one of my most favorite paranormal romances of 2012. I must say Michelle Rowen has nailed it. \u201cA sob caught in my chest. I didn't even know what a gray was, other than a drab color. All I knew was that I was hungry all the time. And I knew, deep down, that it wasn't just for food.\u201dIn Dark Kiss heaven and hell comes together to build an army of angel and demons know as Nightwatchers to protect the humanity from the evils, known as Greys. The book starts with delicious kiss in a nightclub that change Samantha\u2019s life. She become the center of attraction of every boy in her school, also a different kind of hunger is killing her inside. The she met Bishop, an alluring boy who doesn\u2019t seem to recall much, later he is revealed to be a warrior of heaven. Then they joined forces with other angels and demons to track and hunt down the evil Greys.I liked the character building, each and every one. There are many things I liked about the protagonist Samantha, and her character growth from a simple girl to rocking one. The night she has been kissed by her long time crush, her entire world changes around her, and a different kind of craving and hunger developed inside her. A power of feeding on human souls could have doomed her, but she never let go of the humanity. And there Bishop, a lost angel and completely swoon worthy. He was determine to protect Sam, and I was spellbound the immediate attraction between them. The romance was hot and intense, kind of love which made the readers crave for more.Kraven was my favorite among all of them. All bad boy and sarcastic attitude, he was pain in ass and I love such kind of pain. He is just that dead sexy demon, who can\u2019t be described in words. Mhan! I love him.When the book started the team were just tracking the Greys, soon it\u2019s revealed that there is a queen, the \u201cSource\u201d who has a past connected with Sam. I was biting my lips every moment the book took a turn, so unpredictable. There was so much emotions and pain, I felt them flowing through my veins. Every action was well planned, and I loved them.

This has been such a great year for YA fantasy romance stories, I'm so excited that I get to read these in the beginning of the series. Dark Kiss is another story that took the angel concept and twisted it to be something new and original, and I really enjoyed it. I loved Samantha as the heroine; when we first meet her, she's just a plane Jane. Really good student, with a single mom and nothing much going on in her life to speak of. But when the hot guy she's crushed on for years kisses her at the club one night, it rocks her world in a way she never expected. She feels cold and hungry, but nothing seems to satisfy either of these feelings. She's not sure what Stephen did to her, but she knows there's something wrong. When she stumbles across a devastatingly handsome, confused boy named Bishop on the street, there's just something about him that draws her in. When he touches her hand, a shock goes through both of them and suddenly the pieces start coming together for both Bishop and Sam. Her touch gives him clarity, his touch gives her the warmth she craved. When the newly clear-headed Bishop asks Sam for her help on his mission, she agrees without knowing what she's getting herself into. Turns out Bishop is an angel sent to earth to lead his team against the grays...the soul-snatching creatures that Sam herself has been unwillingly turned into. Sam can fight the urge to steal souls and has powers that even she doesn't fully understand, but she still doesn't know if she can trust Bishop and his allies. Even though her heart has already made up it's mind.Bishop and his team seemed all set to face off against the grays, but when they were searching for \"the Source\", the woman who was behind the grays being turned, I was very anxious for Sam. She played a huge part in them discovering more about the Source, but with her lack of complete trust in either side she was very conflicted. I was so scared she'd turn to the dark side and lose Bishop, especially when the truth behind Natalie was revealed. Sam is just beginning to grasp her true potential; I was so fascinated as her abilities came to light, I truly can't wait to see what she's capable of throughout this series!! The plot for Dark Kiss was great, but the characters are what really resonated with me. The team of angels and demons that Bishop is gathering together to fight the soul-suckers was awesome; Kraven with his crass sarcasm, Zach with his sweet and truly angelic ways, Roth who was just plain scary, and Connor who seemed to be the enlightened one of the group. Each of them added something truly exciting and interesting to the story, a piece to the puzzle that their mission was. Kraven and Sam were like oil and water, but their interactions were a hoot. It was really an interesting twist with the balance between demons and angels in this story, and it made their mission a real trial for all of them. I really liked that the romance and attraction factor was ever-present for most of this story. Sam and Bishop have an immediate attraction, in part due to the affect their touch has on each other, and it made for great steamy tension throughout the story. They had great chemistry, and Bishop cared for Sam pretty much from the moment they meet. They needed her help to get their team together, but it was clear they both were happy to have more time together. It was just so sweet how Bishop was so protective of her, he's just soooooo dreamy!! *sigh* It broke my heart what he has to go through in this story, between his confusion thanks to being thrown from Heaven for the mission, unshielded like the others. He's so frustrated with his situation, and I just loved that Sam was the one person who could help him!! Talk about sparks!! And when Sam and Bishop give in to their attraction for a moment and a painful discovery is made about Bishop, I was screaming \"noooooo!!!!\" Ugh, when will this guy catch a break??!! I very much look forward to getting my hands on the next book in this series, the ending leaves you desperately wanting more!! Thankfully it's not some gut-wrenching cliffhanger, but I need more of Bishop and Sam for sure! Great story, highly recommend to YA fantasy fans!!"}, {"userName": "Whitney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3827678-whitney", "userReview": "This is my first ebook received from NetGalley.com. So, it hasn't come out yet; it does on March 22nd. c: (I'll try not to include too many spoilers.)To start off with, this is about angels/demons. And considering, I've read a pretty good amount of angelic and demonic books, I still liked this. Sure, it's still got all the basic angel/demon stuff, and yada yada. At least, I think it does. Can't really go much more further with this type of stuff. >-< But there are some minor twists and turns in there, making it a bit different. It was definitely good and definitely thought out. There were a couple surprises, but none too holy-shit-I-think-I-just-pissed-my-pants-on-that-one like. ;3The plot was pretty cool. Like I said above, it had to have been at least a little thought out from the beginning. I enjoy books with twists and turns that make you have whip-lash turning the pages back and forth and rereading, or those moments where you're like, \"I can't believe that just happened,\" or \"I can't believe he/she let him/her do that.\" And that's almost happened with this one. I got so frustrated in a few parts, though. But it wasn't because the books was bad, it was from the characters.Speaking of the characters, just about every one of them was more than frustrating. I like there were only two or three that I know of. And that was Bishop, Zach, and Connor. I reeeeeeally didn't like Sam. I don't know if it's just because she was just having trouble accepting that there are angels and demons, when there's crystal clear proof. Or if it's just because her bitch-of-a attitude got on my nerves. (Which it did anyway.) She has to be one of the top twenty or thirty weakest heroines out there. I'm sure anybody that reads my reviews knows that I do. not. like. weak females. Though, I can see a bit of a transformation throughout the book with Sam. NOT MUCH. Next is Kraven. I like him, then I didn't like him. :/ His mood swing almost make him out to be like he's bipolar. And and bipolar demon is frustrating. I loved his sarcasm, but I'm like Sam, I can't figure him out for shit. And it's beyond infuriating. I can't tell if he likes Sam or not. asdfghjkl; I loved Bishop and Zach. They were both so sweet. c: Bishop especially. I loved his protectiveness of Sam. Which she doesn't deserve. Roth is a bastard. Enough said. I didn't like Natalie. At all. From the beginning. The conniving bitch. I didn't really like Carly in the beginning, because she seemed too... uppity? Then on up in there my distaste for her only grew, but then I felt sorry for her in the end. :/Can I just say that I seriously love this cover? Not just from the hottness..... But that's the majority of it. >_> I mean, what hormone-raging teenage girl wouldn't like it? But I like how the wings are and the scenery in the background. Not to mention blue's my favorite color. \nOh my God, I'm so lame for that.\nI've read just one book from Michelle Rowen--which was The Demon In Me. And I'm glad I got into her books.

One that I found intriguing, and new, but the fact that the female lead was an annoying installment caused a serious drift in my interest for the book. I really disliked Samantha. I felt she was too annoying, and childish at times, she just didn't seem to know how to make up her damn mind. Which bugged me to say the least. And that we got the story from her pov really killed me. I couldn't take it. Bishop wasn't such a remarkable character for me. He seemed so dull and most of the time, he just seemed to be there as opposed to making his presence known. He sort of lingered through the book, losing his mind, and annoying me by saying Samantha was \"special\" at every turn -.- Why is she special, hmm? I found nothing interesting about her. Kraven however, is a different story. I really loved his character, and I wish there would have been more on him. Seeing the story from his point of view would have been way better. His sarcastic humor made me LOL literally, and that he's a demon is definitely a plus ;) I would have liked to have seen more action. The pace was rather slow, but the overall writing was great. Will I continue the series, however? If I have to sit through another entire book with Samantha's point of view, then sadly, no. Not even to learn more on Kraven would I continue. Add in some shifting POV's, and/or exclude Sam from it, and I'll gladly read it! :D Lol The story is a good one, and it's interesting, it's just that I didn't like her at all.

(Maybe I am paranoid, but it is something I wouldn't do.)2)Approaching some dude sitting on a curb by myself.

He is a leader. Really?(laughs).He is the type of leader that once he turn his back on you, you throw spitballs at him. Bishop is always whining about how he can't do things: he can't lead,he can't see the lights, he can't use a pencil sharper. Whine, whine, does something stupid. I like Kraven better.

That's what happens to Samantha. One minute she's a normal teenager, the next she's thrown into a world of supernatural chaos. I'd spend more time summarizing, but the most important thing about this book was that I just didn't care about the plot. I love Michelle Rowen. Even though she may not be the greatest author out there, her books have always had great humor and/or characters that I really enjoy reading about. Prior to this book, I've been behind her 100%. I wish I could say the same here. While Dark Kiss was fraught with danger at times, I didn't feel any of the suspense. Sadly, I just didn't connect with the work and felt like the plot was mediocre at best.That all being said, I think that younger YA readers could really buy into this story. Middle school students and younger high school kids would probably enjoy the plot. I don't foresee them having the same problems that I did. They'll notice the lack of tension that just grabs you doesn't let go, but I think that overall they'll have fun with it and give this series a shot."}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "I like this book!!the writting and the plot are good!I think that things can only get more intense in the second book!!!

It is another night at her favorite club, Crave. Then Samantha sees Stephen, her sexy, older, next door neighborhood, whom she has been crushing on for years. Stephen is supposed to be away at college, what is he doing here? Her heart catches in her throat, he is beckoning her over. Stephen wants to kiss her. Is she dreaming? He does warn her that she must want this kiss he because it will change her......of course she wants him to kiss her! She has only been dreaming about this moment forever! Stephen kisses her, and the kiss is dark and delicious, but strange. Samantha soon learns that the kiss changed her in ways she couldn't even fathom, and it isn't all good. The next day, Samantha accidentally bumps into what appears to be a homeless boy on the street, but once she touches him his mind clears. His name is Bishop and he isn't exactly human. Samantha finds herself drawn into a dark and dangerous paranormal world where angels and demons are vying for control. Can she figure out whom to trust and save her soul?What I Liked:*Dark Kiss brings some stunning and interesting new ideas to the table with its complex ideas of souls, demons, angels and the balance between Heaven and Hell. I was very much impressed by the originality and the complexity of the ideas that Ms. Rowan presents in this book. Her idea of souls is especially interesting. If you like reads that are intriguing and complicated try this one.*I am not always a fan of angels and demons, but I liked Ms. Rowan's take on angels and demons in this book. The angels, especially Bishop, come across as a bit flawed and not overly perfect and righteous. They have human characteristics and they aren't uptight and perfect or snobby. The demons on the flip side are not completely depraved and evil, either. They have some good qualities. While I did like the tortured Bishop, his demon counterpart, Kraven, certainly stole the show. Kraven is the bad boy and he is snarky! He totally livens up the book. I wanted more Kraven!*The world building in this one is good. There is plenty of detail and I enjoyed seeing how everything fit together. There were some surprises and twists that I didn't see coming, for instance the relationship between Kraven and Bishop. The world building wasn't perfect, but it was enough to keep me satisfied.*I liked that the romance was subtle and was not the main focus. It is mostly an attraction, but it is a bit hesitant and shaky, and it hasn't fully blossomed by the end of the book. I am excited to see how it will progress in the sequel.And The Not So Much:*Samantha, the protagonist, is not an easy character to like. I enjoyed her wit and her determination, but I got irritated with her indecisiveness and her inability to see who was really manipulating her. Especially when it comes to The Source. I couldn't believe that she would even think of trusting this person for one second, after what she did to Samantha. I wanted a bit more fight and fire with Samantha. I am hopeful that she will grow and mature and become a heroine that I can really enjoy.*The lack of parental guidance was irritating. At the beginning of the book, Samantha has gone through some difficulties in her home life, which cause her to be rebellious. The detail on her parents and her home life is scant. Samantha is allowed to pretty much do whatever she wants. There is this big reveal regarding her mother that almost feels like it comes out of nowhere. I didn't like the way this whole situation was handled when it comes to Samantha's mom's secret. This book would definitely have benefitted with a bit more development on this angle.*I liked the world building for the most part, but it felt like Ms. Rowan was just getting started. There are so many intriguing story lines presented in this one, and most of them are not fully developed. I was left at the end with so many questions, such as who was the mysterious homeless guy? How did Bishop and Kraven change into an angel and demon? What really happens to souls? How did Natalie get out of The Hollow? What happened to Samantha's dad?*The ending, while not exactly a cliffhanger, felt like a big to be continued. There is little resolution with any of the story lines and the reader is left with more questions at the end than answers! Dark Kiss provides a new and fascinating take on angels, demons, souls and the balance of Heaven and Hell. I enjoyed the complexity of this novel and appreciated the detail. I was a bit perplexed that there were many unanswered questions left hanging, so I will certainly be picking up the second book. If you like intelligent books with fresh ideas give this one a chance!Favorite Quotations:\"He might be the boy next door, but to me he was also wicked. And dangerous.\"\"I should warn you, it's a very dangerous kiss. It'll change your life forever, so you have to want it.\"\"I thought only demons and care salesman made deals. Not angels.\"\"Heartless bastard. I glared at him as I touched my throat.

Ich musste es lesen, die Idee klang neu und unverbraucht und machte mich neugierig.Ich h\u00e4tte aber nicht damit gerechnet, dass mir \u201eDark Kiss\u201c SO gefallen k\u00f6nnte.Ohne lange Einf\u00fchrung, nach nur einer kurzen Vorstellung der Protagonistin Sam und ihrer besten Freundin Carly, kommt es zu diesem einen, \u201elebensver\u00e4ndernden\u201c Kuss. So fr\u00fch hatte ich damit gar nicht gerechnet, schlie\u00dflich gibt der Klappentext nicht sehr viel mehr her\u2026 Mitzuerleben, was danach noch in Sams Leben tritt, welche \u00dcberraschungen und Erkenntnisse auf sie warteten, bedeutete Lesespa\u00df pur.Die Protagonistin Sam erz\u00e4hlt in Ich-Perspektive Vergangenheit. Ihre sarkastische Art ist nur ein Punkt, warum man sie lieben muss. Sie ist direkt, realistisch, sieht die ganzen Klischees ihres Lebens, kann sich aber dennoch nicht dagegen wehren. Sam ist etwas Besonderes. Dies wird ihr kurz vor DIESEM EINEN Kuss bereits gesagt, die Bezeichnung h\u00e4uft sich aber von Seite zu Seite. Was sie so besonders macht? Abgesehen davon, dass ein Kuss von ihr die Seele des Gek\u00fcssten rauben w\u00fcrde? Tja, das verrate ich nicht.Frau Rowen hat mit den \u201eGray\u201c eine neue Rasse Fantasy-Wesen erschaffen, die sich in die Urban-Fantasy-Welt einf\u00fcgt, als w\u00e4re sie schon immer da gewesen. Ihre Grundidee hat sie mit viel Liebe zum Detail, mit Hintergr\u00fcnden, Antagonisten usw. vervollst\u00e4ndigt, dass eine rundum gelungene, mitrei\u00dfende Geschichte herauskam.Auch die Charaktere waren um einiges tiefgr\u00fcndiger, als es die sarkastische und schlagfertige Oberfl\u00e4che im ersten Moment vermuten lie\u00df und bis kurz vor Schluss hatte ich Probleme, \u201eGut\u201c von \u201eB\u00f6se\u201c zu unterscheiden\u2026 Zu viele M\u00f6glichkeiten und zu viele Grauschattierungen behinderten meine Sympathiebewertung.Neben Sam geh\u00f6rt wohl der \u201eJunge mit den kobaltblauen\u201c Augen zu den wichtigsten Charakteren: Bishop, der Engel mit einer Mission. Doch nicht nur der Prolog l\u00e4sst vermuten, dass etwas schief gelaufen ist, als er entsandt wurde. Mit dem Grund konnte mich die Autorin \u00fcberraschen, ebenso mit der ein oder anderen Erkenntnis.Auch sein h\u00f6llisches Gegenst\u00fcck und weiteres \u201eTeam-Mitglied\u201c Kraven war f\u00fcr die Geschichte unverzichtbar. Er ist mir durch seine vor Sarkasmus triefende Art sofort ans Herz gewachsen, die Dialoge zwischen D\u00e4mon und Engel waren einfach g\u00f6ttlich und spendeten \u201eDark Kiss\u201c die gewisse W\u00fcrze. Erw\u00e4hnenswert ist auf jeden Fall auch noch Sams beste Freundin Carly, die sich im Verlauf der Story ziemlich ver\u00e4ndert und doch den Titel \u201ebeste Freundin f\u00fcr immer\u201c verdient.\u201eDark Kiss\u201c ist nicht von nervenaufreibender Spannung gepr\u00e4gt, war dennoch mitrei\u00dfend und absolut fesselnd. Ich klebte an den Seiten, mein Sympathiekompass mal in die eine, mal in die andere Richtung ausgestreckt, bis ich mir ein endg\u00fcltiges Urteil bilden konnte. Sofort trug mich dann der Showdown \u00fcber die letzten Seiten, ehe \u201eDark Kiss\u201c viel zu fr\u00fch, jedoch ohne richtig fiesen Cliffhanger, endete. Urteil:Mit \u201eDark Kiss\u201c hat Michelle Rowen dem Fantasy-Genre eine neue Art hinzugef\u00fcgt, die sich herrlich \u201egewohnt\u201c und doch \u201efantastisch neu\u201c anf\u00fchlt. Der sarkastische Humor und die geniale Schlagfertigkeit der Charaktere haben mich mehr als einmal grinsen lassen, von dem dringenden Bed\u00fcrfnis nach K\u00fcssen, das die Protagonistin entwickelt, ganz zu schweigen. Trotz dieser Lobeshymnen konnte mich \u201eDark Kiss\u201c nicht vollends in den Bann ziehen, das gewisse Etwas, der ber\u00fchmte Funke, konnte mich nicht erreichen. Den absoluten humorvollen Lesespa\u00df, den mir der \u201elebensver\u00e4ndernde Kuss\u201c schenkte, belohne ich daher mit sehr sehr seeeehr guten 4 B\u00fcchern und ich bin gespannt, ob die Autorin mit der Fortsetzung das volle Potential der Idee aussch\u00f6pft.Ein Muss f\u00fcr alle Fantasy-Fans, die ihre Geschichte gerne mit einer Prise Humor genie\u00dfen, Sarkasmus nicht abgeneigt sind und eeeeendlich mal wieder einer neuen Art begegnen wollen.

Jedenfalls passt Dark Kiss perfekt als Titel!MeinungDie Meinungen zu Dark Kiss waren sehr durchwachsen, aber besonders die Rezension von Blogger-Kollegin Stefanie von His&Her Books hat mich unheimlich neugierig auf das Buch gemacht. Eine d\u00fcstere Romanze mit einer noch nicht da gewesen Idee wird versprochen und genau das bekommt man auch!Das Samantha etwas ganz Besonderes ist, bekommt der Leser schnell raus, da es wirklich sehr oft erw\u00e4hnt wird und zugegeben etwas auf die Nerven geht. Hier wird nie ein anderes Wort wie z.B einzigartig oder anders verwendet \u2013 nein, immer nur besonders. Im Prinzip war das aber auch das Einzige, was mich \u00fcberhaupt beim Lesen gest\u00f6rt hat, denn der Roman hat viele St\u00e4rken und konnte mich bestens unterhalten. Da f\u00e4llt auch die Wortwiederholung nicht allzu sehr ins Gewicht.Womit ich ehrlich gesagt gar nicht gerechnet hatte war, das mir Protagonistin Sam einfach so mega sympathisch wird \u2013 und das ziemlich schnell. Sie ist ein ganz normales M\u00e4dchen, das durch einen ungl\u00fccklichen Vorfall (und auch ein bisschen das Schicksal) in die Sache mit den Engeln verwickelt wird. In Dark Kiss gibt es n\u00e4mlich drei verschiedene Fraktionen, die eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Da gibt es zum einen die D\u00e4monen, zum anderen die Engel und die sogenannten Grays. Das sind Menschen, denen die Seele gestohlen wurde und die dadurch Hunger leiden. Sie versp\u00fcren das Bed\u00fcrfnis anderen ebenfalls einen Teil oder gleich die ganze Seele zu stehlen, um sich daran zu n\u00e4hren. Sam wird in eine Gray verwandelt und schon steckt sie mitten im Schlamassel. Ziemlich rasch begegnet sie Bishop, der mit einer Mission zur Erde geschickt wurde, aber an Erinnerungsl\u00fccken leidet. Ich war sehr \u00fcberrascht wie witzig hier an die ganzen Klischee heran gegangen wurde. Bishop ist n\u00e4mlich der typische gutaussehende, dunkle Kerl, aber durch den Verlust seiner Erinnerungen legt er keinen sonderlich tollen ersten Eindruck hin, der nat\u00fcrlich bei Sam h\u00e4ngen bleibt. Es war einfach zum schie\u00dfen komisch, wie sie ihn immer wieder hat abblitzen lassen und erst gar nichts mit ihm zu tun haben wollte. Dabei gefiel mir besonders gut, dass Samantha immer alle Dinge aus eigenen Willen tut und sich kaum von ihren Gef\u00fchlen zu Bishop beeinflussen l\u00e4sst. Sie ist ein ziemlich starker Charakter gewesen, der bei jedem Konflikt versucht hat sich treu zu bleiben. Dabei ging sie mit der ganzen Situation sehr gut um, auch, wenn das nicht immer leicht war. Sam hatte deutlich mit ihren neuen Lebensumst\u00e4nden zu k\u00e4mpfen und bis zum Ende des Buches macht sie eine tolle Entwicklung durch!Die Handlung des Roman war sehr abwechslungsreich gestaltet. Rasch wird man in die Geschichte hinein geworfen und Spannung l\u00e4sst nicht lange auf sich warten. Innerhalb weniger Kapitel befindet sich Sam zusammen mit Bishop und einen weiteren Charakter auf der Suche nach gefallenen Engeln. Im Gegenzug f\u00fcr ihre Hilfe, wird ihr versprochen, das man sich um sie als Gray k\u00fcmmert, aber nichts ist, wie es scheint. Jede Figur verfolgt ein anderes Motiv, das immer deutlicher wird, je mehr sich die Ereignisse zuspitzen. Dabei gab es zu den wichtigen Charakteren auch immer kleine St\u00fccke derer Vergangenheit, welche in den Plot mit einflossen. Mir hat unheimlich gut gefallen, wie viel M\u00fche die Autorin sich gemacht hat, die Beziehungen der drein untereinander zu beschreiben. Das hat die Charaktere greifbarer gemacht. In Sam konnte ich mich sowieso sehr gut hineinversetzten, weil sie ein sehr entschlossener und kluger Mensch ist. Was die Liebesgeschichte betrifft, fand ich es super, das sie eher nebens\u00e4chlich ist. Zwischen Sam und Bishop geht es an einigen Stellen ganz schon hei\u00df her, aber hier gibt es keine Instant-Liebe oder gar d\u00e4mliche Bekundungen oder Schw\u00fcre. Die beiden fangen langsam an, sich zu m\u00f6gen. Zwischen ihnen stehen dann noch all die vielen Probleme (auf die ich wegen Spoilern nicht genau eingehen kann) und das sorgt schon f\u00fcr einiges an Drama, aber im guten Sinne. Es gibt eben einige Konflikte, die f\u00fcr beide gef\u00e4hrlich sind, wie die Tatsache, das ein Kuss von Sam selbst Bishop schaden k\u00f6nnte, weil ihre F\u00e4higkeiten eben \u00fcber die normaler Grays hinausgehen.Auch die Idee hinter dem Konzept von Dark Kiss, konnte mich \u00fcberzeugen. Die Mischung aus d\u00fcsteren K\u00e4mpfen, der Feindschaft zwischen Engeln und D\u00e4monen und die Erkl\u00e4rungen zu den untergeordneten Arten, fand ich sehr fesselnd! Sogar viele der Wenden zum Ende hin, habe ich so nicht kommen sehen. Daher wurde trotz des fehlenden H\u00f6hepunktes zum Schluss der Roman nie langweilig.Durch den fl\u00fcssigen und am\u00fcsanten Schreibstil, der besonders Dialoge nur so dahin fliegen l\u00e4sst, liest man die Geschichte so schnell aus, das die etwas gro\u00df formatierten Seiten, einem gar nicht so viel vorkommen. Ein weiter Riesenpluspunkt war auch einfach die Atmosph\u00e4re: mal gruselig, zum zerrei\u00dfen gespannt oder locker-leicht-lustig \u2013 die Mischung machts und hier hat das super funktioniert. FazitEin empfehlenswerter Dark Romance Roman, der mit einer d\u00fcsteren Idee \u00fcberzeugt, durch die Charaktere begeistert und durch die Spannung mitrei\u00dft. Einzige Schw\u00e4che: Wortwiederholungen, die auf den Wecker gehen k\u00f6nnen und ein Ende, das im Vergleich zum Rest des Buches etwas absackt und weniger fesselt."}], "description": "I don't do dangerous. \u00a0Smart, \u00fcber-careful, ordinary Samantha-that's me.
