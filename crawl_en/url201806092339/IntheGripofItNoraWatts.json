Cheyenne has taken her son, Trevor from Vancouver to the island\u2019s Spring Love yoga retreat but her ex-husband, Ken is convinced there are more sinister activities taking place in the commune.Nora joins Spring Love run by Vikram and Wanda, to investigate what is happening on the inside. The islands typical welcoming community does not extend to the commune and Vikram and Wanda are suspicious of Nora from the get-go and the intensity builds as they take measures to oust her once and for all. But Nora\u2019s connection to Trevor reminds her of the daughter she never got to know and she vows to get him back home safely with his father.This story lacks the same intensity Kamal delivered in her suspenseful debut, The Lost Ones, and I\u2019m not entirely sure how this novella fits into the series, but I\u2019m committed to it and will read It All Falls Down, which releases this summer."}], "description": "On a surveillance assignment for a child custody case, PI-in-training Nora Watts finds herself ensconced in a small farming community on a beautiful hippie island in the Pacific Northwest, a place with a reputation for being welcoming to outsiders. But when she arrives there, she discovers her welcome quickly wears thin. Perhaps too quickly. Salt Spring Island, with a history as a refuge for African Americans fleeing the bonds of slavery, is not a place of refuge for her\u2014and, she suspects, may not be for the people who live there, either. As she investigates, nothing about this remote community seems to add up. It gets personal as Nora confronts her own complicated feelings toward her estranged daughter and becomes increasingly concerned about the child she\u2019s been tasked to surveil. She discovers that small, idyllic communities can hide very big secrets. Included with this short story is a sneak peek at the next Nora Watts novel from Sheena Kamal, It All Falls Down.", "title": "In the Grip of It\n      \n          (Nora Watts #1.5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39320181-in-the-grip-of-it", "average": 3.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524444971l/39320181.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15967760.Sheena_Kamal", "name": "Sheena Kamal"}], "type": ["Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39320181-in-the-grip-of-it", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30531875-the-lost-ones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341212-it-all-falls-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40122429-los-perdidos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39837876-vancouver-noir"]}
