He was actually reading it. A book with all words and no pictures.This was that book. He'd read it with his mom a over a month's worth of bedtimes. Then, of his own volition while walking through the hallway, he'd pulled it off the shelf, sat down, and started to read it again.That's a recommendation beyond anything I can give it. * * *About a week ago, I went on a car trip with Oot, and we listened to this book together. I see why he liked it. It's very tightly written. Good setting. Good mystery. Two POV characters, one boy and one girl. They each have their own plots, and their own character arcs. Their own problems they struggle to resolve. The boy gets angry sometimes, and his father talks to him about it, and the boy tries throughout the book to get a grip on his anger with varying success. What's more, they both make mistakes. And they're *obviously* mistakes. If only the boy would have told his father about X, things would have gone better. It's kinda the opposite of Harry Potter. It's nice to have that in a kid's book.Anyway. Yeah. Good book. Good Audio. Two thumbs up. One from me, and one from Oot."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697371-eric", "userReview": "The City of Ember is a young adult novel that is a fantastic allegory for spiritual awakening, though I have no idea if it was intended as such. The story is of a girl who lives in an underground and completely self-contained city created by the \u201cBuilders.\u201d The population of the city knows of nothing outside the city, in fact, though they speak English many of the words in it like \u201csky\u201d are not understood in any terms but metaphorically. The problem is that the city is falling apart, the lights are going out, the vast stores of supplies of light bulbs, canned food, and vitamins are running out. The reader is in on a worse calamity, namely, that a secret message in a timed lock box that was left by the Builders, which was meant to be handed down from mayor to mayor and that would open just in time to explain to the city dwellers how to get out of the city, was lost many generations back. Well, being a young adult novel it\u2019s pretty predictable in that the box is in our hero\u2019s closet, but a nice turn of events it is found by our hero\u2019s baby sister who chews on it for a while before our hero gets her hands on it leaving the message is only partially legible. So the bulk of the story is the deciphering of the message, followed by the experience of trying to communicate its contents to the adults, who of course don\u2019t accept the message (where else is there but here?) which is the equivalent of all prophets experiences of rejection by the status-quo. And finally, there is the adventure of eventual escape.This book reworks the universal theme of Plato\u2019s cave, and of all mysticism. What we think of as the whole universe is but shadow, and further, that to enter that \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d you must be like a child. The insight that this version of that universal story led me to is part of the answer to why childishness is a necessary component of the transformation. Children haven\u2019t yet become someone. Which means who they are is not yet at stake. For some reason our culture has this question \u201cwhat are you going to be when you grow up?\u201d Think about the hidden structures and assumptions in that question. Who are you? Have you figured it out yet? Is what you do, who you are? Is what you believe who you are? Is who you associate with who you are? I write these questions myself in shadow not in the condition of childishness, and with all of this, as Quaker\u2019s say, \u201ca notion,\u201d i.e. not something that I have experienced, but rather something I think. But this thing that is mostly a notion for me, that the distinction between notional and experiential living is key to awakening, I am begining in small ways to actually experience."}, {"userName":

In other words, she often over-explains, following up dialogue and action sequences with redundant descriptions of a character\u2019s take on what just happened. Another disappointment is that the mystery of Ember unfolds in an entirely predictable manner. There are no great surprises. DuPrau's characterization of Doon is one dimensional. His spurts of rage create the only complexity in an otherwise flat character. Lina, on the other hand, rings true as a 12-year old throughout the book, with one exception: when her grandmother dies, Lina\u2019s grieving process is so brief it feels like the author has ignored something very important. The book\u2019s strongest element was the setting, Ember. Throughout reading the book, I could see the dark, amber lights and the anxious people throughout the city.

I have so many questions!! I need book 2 asap!! I really liked this story, I did, but I didn't love it. I had a lot of quibbles? Because I'm a quibbler, okay? And that stops me from bumping it up to a higher rating but I still rather loved it. I also adore the movie and have a sever crush on Lina's shirt. YES. I do. No shame. I love her shirt.THIS SHIRT. GIVE IT TO ME, SOMEONE. Ahem. SO I adore that movie and my adoration leaks into my love and enjoyment of this story.It's written really simply...and is very firmly middle-grade. It reminded me a lot of The Giver's style. Except that this was more wordy. The Giver was all for succulently crisp language, but I felt City of Ember dragged a bit? Like long paragraphs and not so much dialogue. Meh. I found myself skimming at times and had to settle down and read properly. A Brief List of Things I'm Not Fond Of:\u2022 The ending...I like a good cliffhanger. I DO. But it honestly felt like it ended mid-thought.\u2022 I really wish there'd been more between Lina and Doon. I'm not talking romance, HECK NO. I'm talking about more intensity and sparks for their friendship. They honestly felt like \"Eh, we could be friends\" and \"Eh, but maybe we won't be tomorrow...it doesn't even matter to us.\" AND THAT SADDENS ME. I really like strong friendships!\u2022 Poppy....hmm. I think it said she was 2? But she acts WAY younger than that. Her age just wasn't consistent. She was talking okay and then suddenly she could only \"toddle\"?? Then she was dribbling soup like she couldn't chew (??) but then she was scribbling confidently with a pencil, which a small baby wouldn't do. They'd just chew the pencil. SO I DON'T KNOW. I have many baby relatives, but who knows? Everyone is different. \u2022 I did get rather bored a lot. There really isn't a lot of adversary or action. But despite ALL THAT, pfft, whatever. I STILL LIKED IT. Because, for starters, the idea is epic. A dystopian where people are underground and they're relying on stockpiles of tinned food?!? IT IS SOOOO COOOOL. It's like an entire town of Hobbits! (Ahem.) And I love the whole old feel. The book really felt old. With the flickering lightbulbs and the second-hand-everything and the messes. I was just really in the book. And then I loved how Lina was SUCH a good big sister to Poppy. N'awww. Be still my beating heart. It's definitely more Lina's story than Darrow's. Although they do share the narration. I love the names and the jobs and GAH. Just the world is A+A little more action would've been nice....something to break up the long paragraphs of just description and narration of what they were doing. It needed a bit of a BANG, maybe??Either way: ME LIKEE DYSTOPIANS AND TINNED FOOD. There is pineapple in this book, of which I highly approve.

The story is told in third person, limited in two different perspectives. Lina Mayfleet, twelve years old, sat \"winding a strand of her long, dark hair around her finger, winding and unwinding it again and again.\" Doon Harrow, also twelve, \"sat with his shoulder's hunched, his eyes aqueezed shut in concentration, and his hands clasped tightly together.\"So I'm busy marking up my paperback copy for examples to share with my own students when it becomes more than a coincidence - that I'm noticing the similarities between Ember, the city, and the Community in Lois Lowry's The Giver. But then... there is just more and more and more. I especially loved the questioning, like Lina's friend Clary's \"Where does life come from? What is life?\" and Doon's father's words of wisdom that sound strangely familiar: \"What you get is what you get.

Luckily, Lina just so happened to be a super fast runner and that's why she thought messenger would be a perfect job for her. Doon wasn't the kind of boy who loved sports and computer games, he would rather be a quiet gentleman who paid attention to his bug collection all day long, spending more time at the library than on the couch, so it wasn't normal for Doon to scream to others,\"The city of Ember is not prospering,in fact everything is getting worse and worse by the minute!

Which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is totally fine; inspiration comes in every shape and form, and if a great book/movie inspired HG author Suzanne Collins to write a great series, then more power to her and more fun to us readers. So all is good;-)Back to CE, the reason why I compare it to HG is because when it came out it was to my knowledge the first post-apocalyptic YA to ever hit the market. In that, DuPrau can only be praised for her originality and avant-gardism. But there the comparison ends. Because if you\u2019re looking for poor kids fighting for survival in a beat-up world, look somewhere else. CE is not about that. At all. Rather, it is more about discovery (both self- and world-), about not taking the truth that\u2019s given to us unquestioningly and instead go and look for another one despite all the obstacles along the way. So again, if you're looking for point-blank survival, full-frontal fights and gruesome deaths, you're not going to get it in this book. In this sense it is a very clean and very-young-reader oriented story, which, however, doesn\u2019t fail to catch the fancy of older readers as well, and thus transcends all age groups. The two main characters, Lina and Doon, are very real, very relatable and very likable; the story is very satisfactory, if somewhat a little slow-paced at times; the writing is very easy-reading and will never make you scratch your head in confusion; finally, the ending is great and will make you want to pick up book 2 right away.Long story short, it\u2019s a winner to me!OLIVIER DELAYEAuthor of the SEBASTEN OF ATLANTIS series"}, {"userName": "JonathanT", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59170961-jonathant", "userReview": "HEY LOOK WHO FINALLY READ THIS. xD Confession: I actually saw the movie first.

This was really fun and bouncy and intriguing and I LOVED the storyline. Although it maybe felt just a little creepy for an MG book? Maybe that's just me though. It was an easy read, and fairly fast-paced. The plot was really simplistic and kinda predictable (to be fair, this could just be because I've seen the movie)... but somehow it still worked. The characters were.. ok? They felt really shallow, but this is MG after all. I wasn't expecting super complex characters. But I would have like for Lina and Doon to have changed over the course of the story. *nods* Also, this was COMPLETELY CLEAN WOOT. Nothing content-wise that would make me feel uncomfortable giving this to anyone 10+. However, that being said, this had decidedly humanistic undertones. I think the author overdid it a little... she pretty much just layered her worldview on over the story. Which isn't necessarily bad, but when your worldview is humanism, then I don't agree with you. xP So I'm thinking this would be better for teens who are more discerning.

The biggest problem is that the entire city, society, economy, and all, feels like it was only created to give the main characters something to do with their time.It seems impossible to me that a city could exist for 200+ years with no innovations, no improvements, no advancements, nothing. They're all dependent on a dwindling stock of canned goods and panicking about the periodic short-term blackouts (the longest mentioned in the book is 7 minutes) even though the blackouts have been part of life for everyone there as long as they can remember. Even beyond that, it explicitly states that no one in that 200+ years has managed to create *any kind* of portable light.Think about that. Not only are there no flashlights, there are no lanterns. There are no candles. There are no oil lamps. A couple of people manage to catch a stick on fire and wander into the darkness outside the city with it, only to go mad when the stick inevitably burns out - and NO ONE tries any experiments with any other type of flammable substance to see which might last longer, how it might be fueled, or even think about carrying, what, maybe a back-up stick?The thing about humans is that they're always trying to find out \"what happens IF.\" What happens if I combine vinegar and baking soda. What happens if I set my deodorant on fire (don't laugh; my brother actually did this). What happens if I push this big red button. Without any hint that the people of Ember were being controlled by radio waves, or drugs in their food, or hypno-dream-therapy, I find it completely unbelievable that every single one of them would have such a complete lack of curiosity or even just desperation at their existing circumstances that they don't even attempt to see, maybe, what kinds of fungus are edible, or experiment with any of the electrics while they were still in full supply to find out how they really worked.And that brings us to our heroes: the only two people in the history of Ember who seem to have both an understanding of the deterioration of their society AND the impetus to do something about it (besides marching ineffectually with placards in front of the mayor's house - another sign that the general population of Ember is pretty much standing around begging for someone else to save them). This is why I say that the city is basically a straw-man argument - the only reason for it existing the way it does, for the people acting the way they do, is if you have pre-determined that you want to have a couple of twelve-year-old heroes who are the only ones clever enough, brave enough, and determined enough to accomplish anything at all. The rest of the population is just a monotone backdrop to let the two of them stand out even further."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "I am sort of a late-comer with Young Adult novels. I blame it on my age. When I was a teenager in the 60s there was no real level between children and adult literature. Teen literature was a bit of a no man's land. I didn't realize there might actually be real literature in YA until I read the Harry Potter series. Since then, I've dabble a bit with the genre and discovered some gems: The Hunger Games series, Gaiman's The Graveyard Book, and Dan Wells' John Wayne Cleaver series. Of course there are plenty of duds too (Hello, Twilight!). Yet I am more willing to explore in this field than I was before. The City of Ember was our book club pick precisely because some members wanted to add a YA read to our repertoire. I was looking forward to it due to the great press it has receive. If I read this in my teens I would have been Ga-Ga Ape Shit over this book and possibly the entire series. Jeanne DuPrau is a very good writer and does a beautiful job in bringing this fantasy city to life. Yet, as an adult and reviewer, I need to relate this to other books in the same genre. While DuPrau kept my attention, the resolution of this story became fairly obvious and, frankly, a little lame if you are familiar with other sci-fi tales. I don't want to give it away but I expected more. I also had some serious logic problems on why the obviously intelligent Builders would devise such a flawed method for delivering a two hundred year old message. Or how the inhabitants of the city never received or never devised portable lights. Fortunately the characters of Lina and Doon were enough to keep me interested and this is where the story gets its success; from the realness and energy of these two adolescents. Nonetheless, compared to books of similar YA genres like The Hunger Games, this novel comes out a little tame. Still, it is a good story and I would have no problems recommending it to a young teen audience."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "I asked my best friend what kinds of books his children were reading (I'm always looking for books for my niece) and he said his oldest son had read and enjoyed the City of Ember series. So much so that he'd passed them along to his parents, who had read them and found them interesting as well. Add to it a movie coming out and I decided I would give the series a try.The City of Ember exists inside the darkness, where it's always night. Darkness is held at bay twelve hours a day by artifical light, though the electricity is becoming sporadic and the city is running out of replacement bulbs. Founded many years before, there was some instructions on how to leave the darkness left behind but lost by one of the city's mayors. The city is facing shortages of supplies and the residents live in a sense of paranoia that the lights will go out forver, plunging them into enternal darkness.It's a fascinating premise for a novel and one that begs a lot of questions, especially when you find certain things about Ember in the novel's final pages. The story follows two children, Doon and Lina, who have completed their schooling and have been given new jobs. Doon wants to fix the city and trades to have a job in the underside of the city, hoping to explore the mystery of Ember. Lina gets a job as a messenger and is able to run across the city, taking messages back and forth and discovering the full extend of the shortags to come. The two eventually begin to share their knowledge and piece together just what's going on in Ember. They also find a bit of the original instructions and try to fanthom what they mean (Lina's younger sibling eats part of them). Lina and Doon discover there's more going on that meets the eye. The Mayor is a corrupt individual, hoarding resources for himself and seeking to discredit or lock up anyone who discovers otherwise. Lina and Doon are soon on a path to being rebels and forced to flee into the darkness surrounding the City.A fascinating, compelling story that left me with a lot of questions and some good answers.

It is easy to make application to various groups in our own society. Lina and Doon are among the few who actively search for a positive solution.

I like the idea of this society making up their own myths about 'the dark' and having new origin stories and singing songs amid candles lit against the ever-present night. However, all those enchanting pieces of The City of Ember are just tiny footnote details in what's really a fairly decent adventure story. The setting of an underground sort of steampunk like society surviving post-collapse without any connections to their past is merely the place where this book begins. I really enjoyed this story, and am excited to read more in the series, but I wish this book had been about twice as long and had about three times the depth. I really feel like the author here was on the verge of creating a whole new world, maybe not with the intricacy and pull of the Harry Potter universe, but something heading in that direction.

Anyway, as soon as I started reading it I couldn't stop. It's one of those books that you cant put down. Infact I have been late for school a few days because I stay up so late reading it.It's not a very large book. But the story is incredible!From what i've read so far it is about a girl who lives in a strange city called Ember, where there is no such thing as the sun. The whole city is lit by lights. Because 300 years ago, people called the builders decided to create the place. Ember is now in danger of dying away, because all the supplies are running out (the builders built giant storage places and filled them with supplies) And nobody knows how to make anything themselves. Another problem is the generator, recently their have been frequent power failures that last only minutes, but without the power their is no way to see, or do anything. Then one day the main girl finds a strange letter that seems to have been written by the builders. I wont say anymore, as to not spoil it."}, {"userName": "Mrs. Riding", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1002924-mrs-riding", "userReview": "This was my first book to read on the Kindle. This futuristic story about twelve year olds Doon and Lina was wonderful. I felt just like the guy from Amazon hoped that I would while reading on the Kindle, that I would forget the medium and enjoy the story. Twelve year olds have such a simple world, even when confronted with big issues. When I told my own children how much I enjoyed the story I heard, \"Oh, yeah. That's a good book. I read it last year.\" I wonder why I didn't pick it up then? I've heard that book two is even better, so I'm looking forward to reading it soon, too."}, {"userName": "Aisyah  (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u1d55 \u2022\uff61`) \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13615508-aisyah", "userReview": "My first dystopian novel. It has great character-building, interesting story, and also the concept of Ember itself is intriguing.

Lina and Doon are curious protagonists that fight against all odds to find a solution for the problems of their city.

The action is slightly lukewarm; in fact, nothing much happens for ages. The characters are nothing special. Lila and Doon are both flat as can be. In general, the book is just fairly meh. That being said, there's something fairly entertaining about this book. It's got that sweet emotional realness of so many middle grade books. I wouldn't read this as an adult, but for middle grade readers, this is definitely a solid read."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581159-jennifer", "userReview": "Been wanting to read this for a long time.

It was very predictable, but that didn\u2019t really take away from the enjoyment of the story (except when I got annoyed with the characters for being about 5 steps behind me, but then I\u2019m not the target audience). We are expected to accept some things without questioning, and certain events that should be dealt with on a deeper level are just brushed over. For instance, Lina\u2019s grandmother dies, and she hardly seems to notice. Some things about the writing annoyed me, but I cannot recall the specifics now.Otherwise, I enjoyed the story. It flowed well. It\u2019s an interesting concept. It\u2019s disconcerting reading about a civilization that expects the world to be pitch black. I was a bit nervous for them the whole time, as I am not really a fan of the dark, and I can imagine the fear and chaos bubbling under the surface when your whole existence is about to be snuffed out once the electricity and supplies run out.I really like that it encourages curiosity and praises stepping outside your comfort zone. I\u2019m also glad the author shows how difficult this can be and how much faith it can take to go into the unknown. It also comes with the customary Great Life Lessons for Young Readers, such as boo for anger, greed and unhealthy ambition. Worthy lessons all, and not too heavy handed I didn\u2019t think."}], "description": "Many hundreds of years ago, the city of Ember was created by the Builders to contain everything needed for human survival.
