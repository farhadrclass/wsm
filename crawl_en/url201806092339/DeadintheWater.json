Passangers aboard the freighter Morris believe they are headed toward Hawaii for vacation. Will they ever get there? No. The Morris goes under and the shipwrecked passengers are rescued by the Pandora. Are the passengers saved? No. The Pandora is a ghost ship and the passengers - the young and wealthy married couple, Phil and Elise Van Buren; John Fielder and his cancer-stricken son Matt; Donna, a cop haunted by memories of a boy who drowned; and Ruth, an old lady who dreams of her dead husband - will drown one-by-one haunted by their fears, desires, and many others who have drowned before them in the fog. This book was excellent, gripping, original, deserving of the Bram Stoker Award! I highly recommend it, but beware of the message in the bottle."}, {"userName": "Jeannie Sloan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134638-jeannie-sloan", "userReview": "Good god!!!What a scary book.The first part had me on the edge of my seat chewing on my nails!I can see why it won the Bram Stoker for 1994.It starts out chilling in telling you how you are going to drown and doesn't let up from there.This is a story about a bunch of people who are in a ship wreck and what happens to them once they are rescued from the sea.There are a lot of twists and turns so that the story keeps you off balance but you know something terrifying is just around the corner.And boy is is scary.You have to read this book to get the full flavor of terror.I was not particulrly scared of water before I read this book.Now I am not so sure that I want to play in the waves anymore on shore."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1000163-laura", "userReview": "This is not a good book, but it was kind of fun to read for the super corny dialogue and a few well-written horror scenes. Overall, though, the plot was unnecessarily convoluted, and the way Holder wrote her main character seemed to be more influenced by hundreds of years of bad male writers writing women than anything she knew about women to be actually true.

The first chapter was brilliant, captivating, and utterly scary. It made me feel as though I'd picked well. (Spoiler alert - I hadn't.)  Unfortunately, as others noted, the story devolved quickly. The premise was good but, halfway though, I found myself wishing I was nearer the last page. I'll be honest, I skimmed some of the passages in which the level of detail was both confusing and painful. When I reached the end, I realized that I didn't really care about any characters or their fates so the inevitable twist we weren't supposed to see coming didn't really seem so much a twist as a last, dying gasp at relevance.With a good editor, half the length and a little more cohesion, this could have been good."}, {"userName": "Taylor Preston", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7788333-taylor-preston", "userReview": "From the first sentence to the last, this story baits, hooks, and reels you in, taking you on a journey of physical, emotional, and psychological horror. With a cast of rich, well developed characters, which include a tough-as-nails female cop, a doctor and his cancer-stricken nine-year-old boy, an elderly woman in search of her husband, and a young couple trapped in a failing marriage, Holder makes you invest in the lives of these people right from the start. You care what happens to them and that's what makes this novel so terrifying. Interweaving references to poetry such as Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Sandburg's Fog, as well as pop culture like John Carpenter's The Fog, Dead in the Water is the perfect marriage of literary and popular fiction. At its core it is a character oriented novel, with every plot twist, every horrific image, every incident reinforcing the character's fears and emotional trauma. Holder doesn't pull her punches. When bad stuff happens, it really happens. The writing here is top-notch and Holder seamlessly floats between characters, shifting her voice to suit that of each individual while simultaneously maintaining a narrative flow that drags you through the book like a fishing line. Despite being third person, she manages to get so close to these characters it feels, at times, as if it is in first person. If you like creepy, atmospheric horror and great characters, do yourself a favor and check out Dead in the Water. You may lose a few nights' sleep, either from sheer engagement with the story or fear of what might be lurking in the shadows, but trust me, you won't regret it!"}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/521920-robert", "userReview": "This 1994 Bram Stoker Award winner for Best Novel has a killer opening line: \u201cThis is how it will be when you drown.\u201d It then proceeds to tell you, in frighteningly tactile, insinuating detail, just exactly what that might feel like. For me, the rest of the novel didn\u2019t live up to the opening (it tends to meander midway), but it felt satisfyingly all of a piece by the end. Holder is one of those horror writers who does not dick around, mercilessly depicting scenes of truly ghastly goings on; however, she always retains a psychological bent, grounding her characters in reality despite the unreality they find themselves trapped in. This is definitely worth a read for sophisticated horror fans; I give it 3 \u00bd out of 5."}, {"userName": "Jenna B.", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9693491-jenna-b", "userReview": "Never has a more promising open chapter led to such a disappointing shipwreck (haha) of a novel. It begins with a harrowing description of drowning, and sets up the premise: a group of people taking a cruise on a decrepit freighter and then some bad, bad stuff happens. It's a variation on my favorite theme of \"idiots lost in the woods\": Idiots lost at sea.

I was so excited to read the rest, but unfortunately it's a hot mess: repetitive, full of offensive stereotypes and murky in narrative. The book is so overstuffed with stream-of-consciousness narration and baroque tableaus that at several points of the book I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be going on. That a female author would conjure female characters as shallow as Donna Almond and Elise Van Buren-Hadley is truly disappointing.

The prose style makes it difficult to visualize what's going on, and the characters never quite made it for me - Donna was the closest. Also there are some minor sloppy details - for example a Swedish character who inexplicably communicates in perfect English even though it is highly implausible he'd do so, and no, lampshading doesn't help - that made it difficult to suspend my disbelief. 3 stars and I don't think I'll reread."}, {"userName": "Oscar Espinosa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15357531-oscar-espinosa", "userReview": "La almalgama de referentes cl\u00e1sicos es como el barco de la novela: se soporta gracias a \u00ednfimas costuras que lo mantienen unido a duras penas.
