But it's been years since I picked them up, and it's the first time I'm reading them with my son. And both of those things make a huge difference to my experience.First, and perhaps most importantly, my little boy likes them. He's about five an a half, which is younger than the target age for these books, but he's into them. (In the interest of full disclosure, Oot isn't the most critical of readers at this point in his life. He pretty much likes all books.)I like the books too. I think they do a great job of blending traditional folklore and the modern world. What's more, they borrow from the traditional lore, and expand on it in interesting ways.What's more I *really* like the illustrations. I'd forgotten the books were illustrated, and that really makes it nicer when reading them to my boy. It adds a lot to the experience. I wish I had thought to look through these books for some pointers before I did Slow Regard of Silent things with Nate Taylor. All that said, I have some quibbles with these books as a parent. Things that never occurred to me the first time I was reading them. I'll save those comments for the reviews I'll write of the later books in the series, as the issues I'm going to be talking about are more prevalent there..."}, {"userName": "Bangadybangz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39123161-bangadybangz", "userReview": "This was such a fun little book!

It features three children and their now-single mom, as they move to a dilapidated house owned by an elderly relative. Mallory is the eldest and likes fencing. Simon is one of the twin boys and loves animals and science. Jared is the other twin and appears to the trouble-maker of the bunch. They discover they may not be the only inhabitants after stumbling upon a hidden attic with a field guide full of details about fairies. Crazy things start happening to the kids, much to the bewilderment - and frustration - of their mother, and the kids must figure out what (or who) is behind the mischief.So I asked my daughter how many stars she would give it if 5 was \"one of my favorite books\" and 1 was \"I hated it.\" She said 4. I think I would agree. This is a very short introduction to the world and premise and I am sure the later books will get into more adventure.Apparently, the father divorced the mother and abandoned the kids? I wasn't quite clear on that, but it mentions \"dad leaving\" many times. Kind of a serious topic, but it doesn't give any details."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/989452-rachel", "userReview": "Everything about the packaging and promotion of this book is delightful...the title, the mysterious notes obscuring the back cover synopses, the inclusion of a letter from the three children protagonists to the author. All of that is very nice, but after reading the first installment, I can't help but feel a little robbed. First of all, and forgive me for this, I can't help comparing the books to a more cleverly written and altogether smarter series, Lemony Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" Aesthetic similarites aside (and there are many), both series center around the somewhat fantastical adventures of three children, and, more importantly, both series emphasize the importance of children solving their own problems. I'm all for that.What irks me about the Chronicles is the authors' lack of subtlety and creativity; take this passage, for instance: \"Jared watched him go and wondered what he could do. Could he really solve anything by himself?\" Ironically, the authors seem to underestimate the problem-solving abilities of the kids that are reading these books. Not to mention the first book ends with hardly an introduction; breaking the series into a five-book set feels like a cheap trick to make a profit, and I think the overall flow of the story suffers because of it.The Chronicles are not without merit; there is some enjoyable dialogue and the illustrations are terrific. I think the series could be truly engaging if the authors focused more on the story, rather than on spelling out the moral behind it."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "Just your typical 'move into an old creepy house, weird stuff starts happening, one of the kids gets blamed, and then they find a book that explains the existence of fairies/faeries/fey which solves their problems... while at the same time causing many more problems'. Happens every day. Also, I'm no expert in the sport of fencing, but I'm pretty sure that they don't call the weapon a sword, and someone who is serious about fencing, as Mallory apparently is, would know that. I think that this book reads a little young, also. Not just for the length, which is REALLY short, but also in the style and feel of the writing. The characters are 9 year old twins and a 13 year old older sister, but if I had to peg an age range for the target audience, I'd go with 6 or 7 year olds. Still, this is probably a fun and cute story for kids. I'm just less than impressed by it, considering that I'm a crotchety 30-something cat lady."}, {"userName": "Taylor Knight", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12627819-taylor-knight", "userReview": "I read the Spiderwick Chronicles back when I was quite young, maybe eight or nine. My sister and I read the crap out these books (we must have read them 15 times, no joke) and I've been wanting to revist this series and the wonderful fantasy world that Holly and Tony created for awhile now but I've finally gotten around to it.The writing partnership of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi is remarkable and this series is by far some of the most well written literature that I've ever read.The three main characters, Jared, Simon, and Mallory, are so relatable and realistic. I can relate to each of them in a different way and I think most readers will feel the same.Overall, I highly recommend this series to everyone of any age. The Field Guide is such an outstanding start to a series and I can see myself rereading this book a hundred times and still enjoy it just as much as the first time."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9176531-kristina", "userReview": "I remember reading and loving this book when I was 10 or 11years old. So when I saw it in one of my local charity shops I immediately bought it. I definitely don't regret it. I think I loved it just as much as my child self. Maybe because I am such a huge fan of all things paranormal. I like that there are drawings throughout the book which are absolutely gorgeous by the way. :) It follows the adventure of two brothers and a sister into the magical world right beside the house they live in. There are descriptions of many magical creatures - like their appearance, habits, etc. I find this simply amazing!"}, {"userName": "Reem Alkhalaf", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44142877-reem-alkhalaf", "userReview": "\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u062d\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627"}, {"userName": "Alexis Ayala", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22000082-alexis-ayala", "userReview": "Las cr\u00f3nicas de Spiderwik nos cuenta la historia de Sim\u00f3n, Jared y Mallory, tres hermanos que se mudan con su madre a una casa de la \u00e9poca victoriana en medio de un lugar aparato de la ciudad.

I didn't know much about the series, other than that there was a movie made, but for five bucks I decided to take a chance. And now, over a year later, I have finally started reading them. And I'm really glad I have. This first book is about the Grace children: Mallory, Jared, and Simon. Their lives have changed quite drastically in a short amount of time and they find themselves in a new home. Things get interesting when they hear things in the walls and Jared discovers a field guide to faeries. The plot is simple because this is focused toward children, but well detailed and clever. The writing is also really excellent and engaging. Although targeted at a younger audience, this can easily be enjoyed by adults. My sister and I read this first book together and plan to continue reading the series in the coming days/weeks. I hope that the remainder of the series holds the same charm as this first installment. We're excited to share these books with our six and seven year old niece and nephew, who we think will really enjoy the story and humor. The illustrations are also really great and should work well when trying to engage younger children in the story. I highly recommend this first book."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "I might be out of the target age range for this series just a wee bit buuuuut better late than never."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Very cute!

I'm pretty sure a boggart is stealing my left socks. OKAY, NO. That's not why I'm researching it! I want to write children's books, and mine turn out too weird, so I thought I'd read more children's books and get a hang of the voice and style. This was an epic example. (It can't be more then 10K, right?) I really enjoyed it. I've watched the movie, and the first book is...what? The first 20 minutes of the movie?! It's such an adorably cute book! But now I'm impressed at how close the movie was following the book. Good stuff. I like the quirkiness of the fencing. Adoring the illustrations. And the poems!My only complaint is the mother. She's a bit weird. I mean, she was out  shopping for groceries  and got mad at them for being out of bed at night and in the kitchen. MAD. Angry? Why!

That may sound an odd comment, but I am a book lover of the real deal books, not electronic ones. I love books you can hold in your hands, feel and smell the paper, books you can caress. It's just such a lovely size; I could hold it in one hand whilst I read. Even the fonts captured me. This is the sort of book that I would have cherished as a young girl, collecting all of the series and placing them in a special spot on my bookshelf. I found this copy, in near perfect condition, at a thrift store for 50 cents. Initially I picked it up thinking it would be a good base for an altered book but it's a keeper. It is going on one of my (grownup) bookshelves. The story would also have captivated me as a young girl: three children and their newly-divorced mom move, out of necessity, into an older relative's practically abandoned Victorian home, where weird things happen and a mystery unfolds. I realized reading it as an adult that there is powerful marketing going on here; The Field Guide is just a tasty morsel to whet young readers' appetites so they'll want to buy the next in the series. That's cool. I once owned over 60 hardback Nancy Drews and loved every one of them. (I can't believe my mom let me sell them to a used bookstore when I was 14 and thought I had outgrown them. I weep still.) Lovely illustrations, fun mysterious story, beautiful presentation. I read it in an hour or two and enjoyed it very much.
