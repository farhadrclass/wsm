I think this is the book that recommended I measure the volume of my bread pan to know what size loaf I can make. Kudos for that alone! Also, found a Black Forest Bread in here. Hello! Chocolate and cherries, what could be better?!I wouldn't own this, but I would certainly borrow it from the library again."}, {"userName": "Kathie H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267531-kathie-h", "userReview": "Huge array of bread machine recipes along with extras like soups, stews & spreads. I've tried quite of few of these & have had great results every time. I date the recipes when I make them & add comments (\"More cinnamon next time\" or \"used Brand X flour\" or \"YUM!\"). I'd like a more in-depth index (with cross-references like \"Southwestern recipes,\" \"sweetened condensed milk,\" etc.)."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124058-sandy", "userReview": "This is a great book with LOTS of ideas for bread machine recipes. It includes recipes for 1 1/2 and 2 pound loaves so that you can use it with whatever size bread machine you have. It would be nice to have a copy. I found it in the Girdwood Public Library while Bart and I were down there in March. It inspired Bart to come up with his own bread recipe--which was a variation of one in the book."}, {"userName": "Dioscita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/742082-dioscita", "userReview": "We have a weird version of this book and have a love-hate thing going with the recipes (some we love, some we don't).
