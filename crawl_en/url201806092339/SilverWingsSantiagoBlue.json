(I already know the details of Camp David, the planes they flew, their training..) I love them. This one upon reaching the 100 page mark, however, began to irritate me and I bailed at 200.Why: When the Houston class joins the Sweetwater class, you got a bunch of GROWN women acting like bratty high school girls.. \"This is OUR table.\" OMG. Grow up. This whole bit of drama was stupid. The second thing that caused me to no longer take this book seriously is when Eden takes off her blouse and sunbathes while flying. Um, duh. The women are always wearing their ugly flight, \"zoot\" suits and she would NOT be flying in just a blouse and bra. No way, no how. So even if she did zip down her flight suit and take her blouse off, she would have had immediate covering at her disposal. Ridiculous. At that point, I no longer cared for the characters either. I liked Eden though she is spoiled and rich, but Rachel? Perhaps she entered the story too late. I didn't feel anything there and Mary Lyn is supposed to be a main player but there is very little about her."}, {"userName": "Glenn Call", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15944573-glenn-call", "userReview": "The many wonderful reviews here reflect the story-telling power this book has.The only thing I can add is a little background regarding the dedication \"To Harriet \"Tuffy\" Call ...\" etc.:When she set out to write the book, Janet Dailey paid an extended visit to my mother former WASP Hariett \"Tuffy\" Call. It was late in my mother's colorful life when the book came out and from time to time, I'd ask her which of the characters was actually based on her memoirs.My mother would smile a wistful smile and gently change the conversation.When my mother passed at age 73, I asked that question of my sister. She was very close to my mother and I was certain that she would have the answer.My sister was surprised that I didn't know. \"Why, all of the characters were taken from mama's memoirs - except the one who died.\"I re-read the book and realized that each of the characters - with the one exception - portrayed a very real facet of our mother's spectacular personality. For Janet Dailey to have given any one character all of our mother's traits would have made the book completely unbelievable!As it stands, though, it's something very special to be able to look into the past of a very real, complex and exciting person as our mother was!"}, {"userName": "Jan Mcleod", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8616349-jan-mcleod", "userReview": "This epic is a wonderful piece of historical fiction about the WASPs--Women's Army Service Pilots--who ferried planes for the Army, as well as other missons, even ones that other male pilots refused to fly. These women were volunteers but were given officer's status and privileges. Even so, they were not officially Army and were denied the benefits they deserved until 1977--years after they were disbanded due to prejudice (and jealousy).The story centers around four main women, though there were numerous others. It tells about their struggles, triumphs, loves, heartaches, and battles against male prejudice. Most men, and even the women's families, did not want women flying because they reasoned women were not capable. However, these ladies had a passion for flying, and flying they did and served their country with honor!!!!"}, {"userName": "Linda Katzman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/622824-linda-katzman", "userReview": "Did you ever dream of flying?

It was, as I remembered, a nonfiction account of the WASPs, the Women Army Service Pilots, and I have wanted to reread it since I returned it to the library and have tried to find it. When I found this book, I thought it must be the book--although it is clearly fiction by a well-known romance novelist--but if it is, it doesn't live up to my memory. The historical parts are fascinating and could have stood on their own, perhaps in the setting of individual stories, without the promiscuity, adultery, and even an abortion for convenience, as well as the steamy sex scenes, in this book. I doubt that these women, who give in to their worst impulses despite being self-disciplined enough to become highly skilled pilots, really represent the women who courageously and effectively served as WASPs in World War II. I'm sorry this isn't the book I remember."}, {"userName": "Adriana Foga\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18040134-adriana-foga-a", "userReview": "As Mo\u00e7as de Azul.Janet Dailey.1987Este romance com certeza \u00e9 um dos mais realistas que Janet escreveu.

This historical fiction describes the brief, yet immensely important role of young civilian women pilots trained and placed in service between 1942 and 1944 to relieve their male counterparts for combat duty during WWII. The historical aspects were well researched and presented in a compelling novel centering around four out of the one thousand WASPS who assisted in the war effort. Though subjected to blatant discrimination and harassment and placed in dangerous and deadly flying situations, these courageous, ambitious, capable women bonded by their love of flying and loyalty to country proudly served. They have my respect and admiration.

Dailey's indepth look into the lives of American women serving as military pilots during WWII remains high on my list of historical fiction. SW, SB tells a great story about some the unsung heroes of the war, and details the hostility, danger, and challenges they faced along the way. Almost 20 years after reading, I can still remember devouring this novel and loving the women, many of whom were presented as brave and complex people complete with flaws and weaknesses. Highly recommend for folks who like historical fiction, women-centered stories, and/or pioneers who broke barriers."}, {"userName": "Elena Dru\u021b\u0103", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18419820-elena-dru", "userReview": "O poveste despre cum femeile din SUA au devenit pilo\u021bi \u00een anii 40 ai secolului trecut, c\u00e2t de greu le-a fost \u0219i impactul acestora \u00een cel de Al Doilea R\u0103zboi Mondial.

None of them went overseas to fly in the war effort. Yet there were those female pilots who wanted to join the service and fly for their country. These women had a rough time getting themselves taken seriously. The military didn't support them, but they persevered.This novel takes the true events and fictionalizes them. Four very different women come together for training in Texas determined to prove themselves and fly for their country. Perhaps not all of them came with altruistic intentions, yet the drive is there for each one.Cappy, the military brat, is not sure she wants the restrictions of military life again. She knows how it affected her home life. Marty came from Detroit, determined to break out of her mold. And she wants to prove she is as special as her brother. Eden's rich background affects how she approaches the other women. Mary Lynn is the soft lady who everybody likes.Another \"behind the scenes\" World War II story is told well here. These are real women with depth and problems. It is a romance, yet it much more the story of the drive that anyone can have when faced with a special love. These women are going to fly. And they are going to fly the planes that men do.
