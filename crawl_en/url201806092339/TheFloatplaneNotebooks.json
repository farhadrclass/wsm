I've enjoyed Clyde Edgerton's books over the year. Walking Across Egypt is a fun read. Floatplane Notebooks takes you inside a North Carolina family with their quirks and interests. It starts in the 50s and moves into the turbulent 60s. Vietnam looms and the story takes a turn there.Clyde Edgerton writes literature-- in that he writes about ordinary people and their lives. To do this successfully you have to be a very good writer. And he is. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Roxy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18417210-roxy", "userReview": "By turns humorous and tragic, a solid read by an entertaining author. Warning: lots of racial epithets and animal deaths, but remember to take that in context. My favorite chapter was when the two boys went frog-gigging, as I have a fond memory of doing that with my youngest aunt when I was about the age of these characters."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355494-jean", "userReview": "Come on, Clyde Edgerton is great. He writes funny, tender stories and has made writing little old ladies an art form. He's easy on the eyes and has a bluegrass band, for pete's sake. This book breaks rules about how many points of views are okay in writing, and I love that. Even a wisteria vine has a point of view. This book made its stage debut with the Charlotte Repertory Theatre, and Clyde had a reception before the opening. He played the banjo and talked to us like we were sitting in his living room."}, {"userName": "Ana Menendez-tuckman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15900509-ana-menendez-tuckman", "userReview": "I read this for a Book Club and really, there is not much I enjoyed about it except that I was able to skim while not losing track of the story. I especially hated the drowning kittens, skinning of birds and the technical details of the floatplane. Some of the characters, like Bliss and Mark, were interesting but I just don't get the country humor."}, {"userName": "Nann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17409191-nann", "userReview": "A poignant tale.

These stories were told to me as a child verbatim by my grandmother late at night during her sickness after a diabetic shock. She passed in 1972/ I was age 18. We visited the gravesite for the yearly cleaning. The stories about Aunt Sarah and 'Puss' had me rolling. My grandmother could roll her names off her tongue so easily as if in a song... I would laugh so hard when she said at the end: 'they called her Puss' . When I found out about this book... it brought back all the memories of the truth she was telling about her neighbors and relatives in the NC area this book was based upon. The first wisteria was planted in her back yard and took over the entire area over time. The chimney from her childhood home was there for years until it completely fell into the earth and buried by leaves and trees. There is a billboard on the property showing the home with my grandmother standing in front. Elaborated over the years, but very similar to the stories I heard as a child. I enjoyed the memories and the details that I had forgotten. Thank you Clyde Edgerton for bringing my grandmothers voice back to life."}, {"userName": "Gina Rheault", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582556-gina-rheault", "userReview": "Story of a big, affectionate, slightly loony and hyperactive family in North Carolina and Florida. Easy read, with individual chapters in voices of the various family members, including the wisteria vine. At the end you feel as if you've watched a nice North Carolina country tv show. I am often curious about the thinking and feelings underneath, but sometimes families don't talk so much as they act out their lives. But this book was meant to be a light-hearted witness of a family, Garrison Keillor style, and that's fine. Seemed a little too cute at times, and the better parts were toward the end when tough times really hit. Descriptions of the contraption-creating were a riot. Nice book if you need a nice break that will make you smile."}, {"userName": "Brennan LeQuire", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63519680-brennan-lequire", "userReview": "The parts of this book that I liked were delightful.

It has ROFL parts and some of the most sad, moving parts I've ever read. this isn't really a spoiler for the best ROFL part: Watch out/listen out for Papa saying: \"Thantion it, damn it, thantion it!\" In this book, characters interior monologues, their thoughts, are given as speech. These interior monologues also are from \"the wisteria vine\" at the graveyard and the folks buried in the graveyard, including an old man, babies, and the leg of a man who lost it and his family buried it in the old graveyard.The monologues of the oldest daughter are sweet and heartbreaking, especially in her love for her husband and also for his clever playful younger brother. The most heartbreaking interior monologue I have ever read is by that brother after he has gone to war and returned totally paralyzed. I have wondered a number of time about how much a person who is paralyzed understands of what we say to them--or, in this case, how they understand our body language and actions or lack of actions. There is a \"pity fuck\" or a \"mercy fuck\" in this book but it is one of the most caring and delicately described events I have ever read.The Floatplane Notebooks refer to the floatplane that the father/papa is building after he throws the directions away. This plane is described as a folly, a failure, a thing to be ridiculed--but at the end of the story it figures in the conclusion and denouement in a most spending and touching way.In my mind, this book is Clyde Edgerton's masterpiece. I have read it many times and listened to the audio CD's a number of times as well. I mentioned in the beginning the phrase, \"Thansion it.\" The event that this phrase goes with, when the scallawag younger brother keeps trying out a weak board in the center of the kitchen caused me to almost drive off the road in laughter so hard that I was crying. I have watched two other people listen to this part of the CD's and they dissolved in touching laughter, too.I just picked January 1, 2014, as my date of finishing this book because I have read it/listened to it so many times over years, starting well before 2001, that giving a date is silly. But I did re-listen to the CD's sometime last year. I have them stored in my \"Keep forever\" collection."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1221368-melissa", "userReview": "As a collection of individual stories and personal recollections, it was interesting, but there was no real story - nothing apart from the characters' relationships with each other to bind them all together. Mr. Edgerton does a great job juggling several different first-person points of view. Each character has their own distinct voice, even the wisteria vine. I think I would have enjoyed it more if there had been more reports of what the vine \"overheard.\" I was also surprised that the floatplane itself didn't have more of a character in this book. For being the driving force of the \"plot\" I would have expected to hear a bit more about it."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13938384-kathy", "userReview": "This is a book that I thot was really kinda just ok but I read it when I was pregnant the first time and I was lying on the couch and there's a passage in the book that was so funny to me, when I read it out loud to my husband, I fell off the couch! So how could I NOT give it \"an amazing\" review? I read it again a few years later and the the same passage cracked me up again, altho I was not unmoored balance wise and did not fall off anything that time. Whew.

They're unique and live lives worthy of dissection and discussion. Every family (hopefully) has at least one storyteller who chronicles those who came before and puts the pieces of the family puzzle together and creates a sense of completeness. Family sagas help us understand ourselves a little bit better and brings long gone progenitors again to life.

I thought it did a good job of capturing Eastern North Carolina dialogue patterns; I also thought it managed to span various time periods well and still be believable.

Like an intricate quilt composed of squares from different quilters, the story is gradually pieced together by the voices of vivid, deeply-human characters.
