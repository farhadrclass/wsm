It's also super depressing. Basically, everything in our modern environment, from our food, to our water, to the air we breathe, to the clothing on our backs, to the cleansers (both personal and for inanimate objects), EVERYthing is trying to kill us. And since it's all been created or tampered with by other humans, basically humanity is trying to kill itself, slowly and one person at a time. BUT there IS hope. We can't become hermits and hope to avoid toxins, that's not possible with our Global Village, unfortunately, BUT we CAN mitigate the damage by being well educated and doing the best we can to affect our own personal environment. We can decide what we put in, on and around our bodies. This book is to help those specifically with cancer, but also those who want to prevent cancer, to do just that. They are VERY careful to state that many of these steps shouldn't be done without a professional health care provider and LOTS of blood work. Since we are all genetically different, with different mutations on different genes, how we react to certain de-toxification actions will differ. Some won't work, some will do more harm, some will work miracles. But you need to know how you will react before doing any of them. Knowledge is power and key in keeping one's self healthy and able to fight off cancer and the daily toxins we encounter. They DO have a couple of suggestions that I am not sure about, such as drinking in ounces half of one's total body weight in water. Example, 120 pound female, 60 ounces of water DAILY. You can over-do water. So I'm not sure about that. They also VERY briefly mention marijuana, but state that the part that isn't the high inducer, so not the THC, is that part that is beneficial for certain people. Again, I'm not sure about that, but it is only briefly mentioned and isn't a pro-MJ screed, so it doesn't make this book drop any stars.This book is repetitious, but that seems to be because it isn't necessarily designed to be read straight through. In the beginning of the book, there are ten different sets of questions to focus on which of the ten terrains you should be focusing on cleaning up first. There is a chapter that focuses on each of the ten terrains. You can skip ahead to the chapter that will best help you, or you can read front to back. Since each chapter can be read on it's own, there is by necessity, some repetition in the intro to each chapter. I found it somewhat lengthy and to the point of boring, but I read straight through. Not a huge negative, as I understand the why of it, but it did make the book seem MUCH longer than it was.I also loved the bibliography. Seriously, this book added like 10 more books to my TBR and some of them I already HAD on my TBR, which made me feel super smart! Yay ego-boost! LOTS of notes and other sources, which I really appreciated. If you are coming across as an authority on something, I want to see other already established authorities and studies backing you up. They bring it in spades.So, long story short, EVERYone needs to read this book, not just those with cancer. Understanding your body and how the environment it is in affects it is key to health. It makes sense, you put sugar in a gas tank on a car, it is NOT going to do well. Same with our body. With all of the crap we put ourselves and bodies through, is it any wonder that diseases, including cancer, is taking hold? This book is NOT preaching that chemo and other modern ways of treating cancer is bad and wrong, but discussing how to bolster the body's ability to help with fighting the cancer and to be stronger so the healthy parts don't get sick from the chemo, which is also a carcinogen. It's maybe not the best way, but it can be augmented by the foods we eat, the toxin-free environment we create for ourselves and by paying attention to our bodies on a genetic level. The authors aren't fond of the modern Western way because it ignores the more intuitive Eastern way that is understood to not be the only way. An integrated approach is probably the best way to attack any health problem.Again, this should be necessary reading for ALL, especially the law makers and lobbyists. They should at least understand that the laws they pass and the \"food\" they are working to make super cheap is killing everyone. They won't stop, money is more important than the people they are helping to slowly kill, but it might make them a little more aware of what they are doing, if only for a little while.Anywho, five huge, you need to read this right now, stars.My thanks to NetGalley and Chelsea Green Publishing for an eARC copy of this book to read and review."}, {"userName": "Jess Macallan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5575217-jess-macallan", "userReview": "I received and e-copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This book is fantastic and I urge anyone interested in nutrition to read it, but especially anyone looking for nutritional support for healing during cancer treatment. It's well-researched, smartly presented, and FULL of brilliant nuggets of nutrition wisdom. Even skeptics should be happy with the wealth of studies used to support the authors' assertions. The science presented can get heavy at times for the average reader, but this book is worth taking the time to read and reread. It's one I'll reference and recommend frequently in my nutrition practice.The authors offer a comprehensive look at each of the 10 terrains they believe need to be addressed for cancer patients, and what readers can do. The quizzes at the beginning of the book will give readers an idea of what areas they should focus on first. This book is a great resource to go over with your doctor or nutritionist because a ketogenic diet is one you want to approach thoughtfully and with expert support. Even if you're not interested in the ketogenic approach, there are plenty of ideas and suggestions anyone can implement and benefit from.This book should be required reading in nutrition programs, and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Andreas", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1118763-andreas", "userReview": "If you are like me and think that cancer is purely a genetic defect then this book is for you. It looks deeper at what causes cancer and comes up with a new explanation, the \"metabolic approach\". I cannot claim that I have understood everything and the book can be overwhelming but it's absolutely worth it to invest the time and effort. Nasha Winters has created a list called the Terrain Ten. These are ten \"...physiological and emotional human elements that require balance and optimization in order to halt and prevent the cancer process\". According to her, it's necessary to treat the terrain, not the tumor. If the body is strong enough then it can withstand cancer and the medicine is intriguingly simple: food. The right one, of course. Unfortunately nutrition has turned into a pretty complex topic these days. Organic is a must but not the end of the story. Cows should be grass fed, chicken not fed with soy, grain should be avoided and so on. There is also the nice simple rule to avoid food that has more than 5 ingredients. You won't believe how restrictive this actually is. Last time I wanted to buy some coconut milk and only the organic brand contained just coconut and water, the other brands had many more ingredients.There is a huge amount of information to be digested and the best practical advise was given at the end of the book: take one step after the other and observe your body. Everybody is different and what works for one person might have no impact on the other. Experiment and find what works for you.Highly, highly recommended! And never give up."}, {"userName": "Sherin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43617996-sherin", "userReview": "Written by Dr. Nasha Winters and Jess Higgins Kelley, The Metabolic Approach to Cancer: Integrating Deep Nutrition, the Ketogenic Diet, and Nontoxic Bio-Individualized Therapies is a great book. When I saw this book on Net Galley, I wanted to read it because it would help me with my course, and cancer being one of the top battles we fight in the modern era, I was keen to know how to equip ourselves to prevent it. It is a sad world where everything is corrupt, toxic and a lot of things are scary. Everything from the food we eat, the things we buy, everything is laden with toxins. But that's the world we live in and it is survival for the fittest. In this book, Dr. Nasha tells us how to profile ourselves, risk factors and every other information we will ever need. It is not just a book for those dealing with cancer, or have a loved one dealing with it, it one everyone should read to prevent, deal and help ourselves and the ones we care about, the right way. **I was offered a copy by Chelsea Green Publishing through Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mwalkes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2230313-mwalkes", "userReview": "I attended her lecture a little out of duty - to friends who are dealing with cancer and others, including myself, who may be in the future. I left that lecture relieved that this is a practitioner I feel comfortable directing people to. This upbeat book from a 26 year cancer survivor provides some security in that you do NOT have to do something immediately when getting the diagnosis. Then it is extremely empowering. The opposite of everything else done to people diagnosed with cancer.Is it even possible to follow her recommendations? Only you can decide. But following them sounds like a blissful walk through a forest compared to the alternatives. Can following the information in this book help prevent cancer? I truly believe so. Some people think that preventing cancer is impossible. If you are one of those people, possibly this book could change your mind."}, {"userName": "Rachel Russ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52796701-rachel-russ", "userReview": "A fantastic approach to healing cancer that is NO nonsense and you don\u2019t have to be a medical doctor to understand the science behind it.

Change your terrains"}], "description": "The Optimal Terrain Ten Protocol to Reboot Cellular HealthSince the beginning of the twentieth century, cancer rates have increased exponentially--now affecting almost 50 percent of the American population. Conventional treatment continues to rely on chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation to attack cancer cells. Yet research has repeatedly shown that 95 percent of cancer cases are directly linked to diet and lifestyle. The Metabolic Approach to Cancer is the book we have been waiting for--it offers an innovative, metabolic-focused nutrition protocol that actually works. Naturopathic, integrative oncologist and cancer survivor Dr. Nasha Winters and nutrition therapist Jess Higgins Kelley have identified the ten key elements of a person's -terrain- (think of it as a topographical map of our body) that are crucial to preventing and managing cancer. Each of the terrain ten elements--including epigenetics, the microbiome, the immune system, toxin exposures, and blood sugar balance--is illuminated as it relates to the cancer process, then given a heavily researched and tested, non-toxic and metabolic, focused nutrition prescription.The metabolic theory of cancer--that cancer is fueled by high carbohydrate diets, not -bad- genetics--was introduced by Nobel Prize-laureate and scientist Otto Warburg in 1931. It has been largely disregarded by conventional oncology ever since. But this theory is resurging as a result of research showing incredible clinical outcomes when cancer cells are deprived of their primary fuel source (glucose). The ketogenic diet--which relies on the body's production of ketones as fuel--is the centerpiece of The Metabolic Approach to Cancer. Further, Winters and Kelley explain how to harness the anticancer potential of phytonutrients abundant in low-glycemic plant and animal foods to address the 10 hallmarks of cancer--an approach Western medicine does with drug based therapies.Their optimized, genetically-tuned diet shuns grains, legumes, sugar, genetically modified foods, pesticides, and synthetic ingredients while emphasizing whole, wild, local, organic, fermented, heirloom, and low-glycemic foods and herbs. Other components of their approach include harm-reductive herbal therapies like mistletoe (considered the original immunotherapy and common in European cancer care centers) and cannabinoids (which shrink tumors and increase quality of life, yet are illegal in more than half of the United States). Through addressing the ten root causes of cancer and approaching the disease from a nutrition-focused standpoint, we can slow cancer's endemic spread and live optimized lives.", "title": "The Metabolic Approach to Cancer: Integrating Deep Nutrition, the Ketogenic Diet, and Nontoxic Bio-Individualized Therapies", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32761097-the-metabolic-approach-to-cancer", "average": 4.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490830501l/32761097.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16013562.Nasha_Winters", "name": "Nasha Winters"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16013563.Jess_Higgins_Kelley", "name": "Jess Higgins Kelley"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7127288.Kelly_A_Turner", "name": "Kelly A.
