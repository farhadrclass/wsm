While the Chinese are satisfied, for now, with the latest border arrangements, a new plot is brewing inside the already weakened U.S., one that could cripple the vulnerable nation and bring the country to the brink of a second civil war.Keene and his team are once again set against the clock, as they race to discover who and what his new threat is.And on the eve of America\u2019s most pivotal moment, the entire world watches as an epic showdown of Biblical proportions on the floor of the House of Representatives will once and for all decide the fate of The 13.\u201cThe 13: Stand\u201d is a thriller make no mistake about it. Not only are the main characters lives at risk but the whole country is in great danger as well. On top of that The 13 face elimination. The authors have given us an even more exciting story than the previous one and that is really going some as \u201dThe 13: Fall\u201d was really exciting. Don\u2019t start this book late at night because you will want to finish it before you go to sleep and you won\u2019t get any rest until you flip that last page. I enjoyed this book and would really like to see another in this series. I would like to know what will happen between Jon and Megan. All in all \u201cThe 13: Stand\u201d is a winner that I think you will really enjoy.You can find \u201cThe 13: Stand\u201d at a discount at http://www.deepershopping.com/item/ch...If you would like to listen to interviews with other authors and professionals please go to www.kingdomhighlights.org where they are available On Demand.To listen to 24 hours non-stop, commercial free Christian music please visit our internet radio station www.kingdomairwaves.orgDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Barbour Publishing.

At the end of book one, Agent Jon Keene has been captured by the Chinese, the Chinese have taken over the western half of the United States, the President of the United States has been shot and is in a coma, and the Prophet is proclaiming God\u2019s judgment on the USA. What more could go wrong? Well\u2026you\u2019ll just have to pick up this second book to tune it to the action that follows all the prior happenings I mentioned above in the first book with even more occurring now.CIA Agent Megan Taylor has realized her growing feelings for Jon, but she has no idea if he is even alive. She prays for him every day while she continues to try to find out his fate. Boz Hamilton receives a call from the Prophet regarding Jon and the head of the CIA sends Boz to investigate. The Prophet also tells the director of the CIA that he has more to worry about than the Chinese and what they are going to do. Something even closer to home is brewing that will spell disaster for what remains of the USA if it isn\u2019t stopped. With the help of an operative from Great Britain, Megan leaves for North Carolina where a faint rumor has popped up about a plot against the current government. Oh, and did I mention there is the best assassin in the world has been spotted? Can the USA ever recover from the fall it has taken?With action, suspense, tension and grit, this story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I was turning the pages so quickly, I lost count of the time and everything else! I just had to see how this story ended. The characters were likable and believable. I got involved in the story and the events that happened. There is even a romance in the story! Readers should read book one first and get set for both books to give hours of enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "A thriller should be thrilling. It should keep me turning pages like there\u2019s no tomorrow. It should keep me awake at night, wondering what\u2019s going to happen to the characters (or it should keep me up at night to finish it so I can rest).A thriller should get my heart rate up.This didn\u2019t. I read the first 40%, got bored, so went and read something else (seriously. I\u2019m bored reading a thriller. Doesn\u2019t that tell you something?). By the time I got back to it (two weeks later), I\u2019d forgotten most of what had happened in the first portion but quickly picked it up again. The problem was I still wasn\u2019t engaged with any of the characters. I gave up not long after the halfway point, where two main characters had a gunfight and I realised I just didn\u2019t care who won and who died.In fairness, 13: Stand is the second book in a series, and I often find the middle book in a trilogy to be slow, so maybe it\u2019s that. Or maybe there are too many characters (I had trouble keeping the characters, locations and politics straight).Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that even though I have read the first book in the series (13: Fall), it was a year ago and I have forgotten most of the details. 13: Stand moved straight into the plot, with no recap of what happened in 13: Fall, and that felt as though I\u2019d been dumped in the middle of the story. I suspect 13:Stand is written for people who only read a handful of books each year, so have no trouble remembering the plot and characters from a book they read a year ago (several other reviewers have only reviewed this one book. I suspect that\u2019s the camp they fall in to). Unfortunately, that\u2019s not me.Thanks to Barbour Books and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review."}, {"userName": "My Book Addiction and More MBA", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7909095-my-book-addiction-and-more-mba", "userReview": "It\u2019s been a week since I finished this book, and I\u2019m still speechless. That has only happened one other time due to an authors\u2019 shock and awe tactics (cue Red Wedding in GoT). These books are incredible. I have read a few of the J. Bourne books, and one J. Reacher novel, and these are definitely on par with the spy thriller objectives that connect them. One of my favorite movies is Red Dawn, and this played right along with the idea that the US is overconfident, and could easily be placed in the situations detailed in this series.The authors\u2019 attention to detail in how America has fallen was impressive. I\u2019m sure someone active in the military or politics could find a discrepancy or two, but to the average reader the plot is entirely believable and seemingly inevitable. I love the fact that it is biblically centered, and that the authors used biblical instances of God\u2019s wrath to preface what He is allowing to happen to America. The depth of the characters was notable, and their individual evolutions from the first book to the second book will connect every reader to at least one of them. There are very, very few books I consider giving a 5, and these two, in their entireties, are beyond-a-doubt worthy. Trying to contemplate the imagination of whoever wrote the ending of this particular book is mind-boggling. That ending alone would have earned it. And it\u2019s not over! I will be waiting on pins and needles for the next installment.Rating: 5HEAT Rating: NoneReviewed By: Daysie W.Review Courtesy of: My Book Addictions and More"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8388716-melissa", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book.
