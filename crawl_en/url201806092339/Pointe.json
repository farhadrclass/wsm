For one, it ended up being an incredibly heartbreaking, tragic, and important story. For another, it's well written with a compelling narrator who's a realistic portrayal of a teenager with a shattered self-esteem. And all of it is very very gritty. But, before you realize what it all has to do with the heart of the story, the book feels like it's dodging the real issue at hand with the introduction of tons of others. It kept circling around the actual kidnapping for so long - which was what attracted me to this book in the first place - that I started to feel let down at about the half way mark. It makes us wait until the end for it to finally become the focus. While I can't say I was ever bored exactly, I was starting to feel as if the book was trying too hard, which had me doubting how well rounded it was going to end up. You know that feeling when you're convinced the book will end up disappointing you and you lose enthusiasm for it? Fortunately, my worries went unwarranted as I ended up highly satisfied - even impressed - at the end, but I can't say I loved it the whole way through. I think part of it is the angle it took to tell the story was not what I expected, but this ended up being a good thing. Am I making sense? >.< Like I said - mixed feelings!We have everything from eating disorders, to dance, rape, love, cheating, manipulation, kidnapping, friendship, drugs, sex, altogether with a disturbing underlying story\u2026 Now do you understand why I was wary of this all holding together? Nevertheless, even through my wariness, I found the narrator so real, so raw and obviously broken, that I found myself greedily devouring it all. She's not the kind of character you will like, but the kind you will feel sympathy for. The choices she makes, the illusions she makes herself believe, all stem from something very dark deep inside of her. So while her decisions are not ones you will approve of, while the romance she craves is not one you will root for, we come to understand that this personality of hers is the product of a tragic past - even if she doesn't realize it. Aside from the main character, I found memorable personalities inside her group of friends, and the others who come and go were given equal importance in the story. In the end, this is less about the kidnapping itself, but rather a story about giving your fears a voice. About learning to love yourself! Let me rate it like this: -Once I turned the last page: definite 4 stars-While I was reading up until the last 40 pages: 3-3.5 starsSo there you go! Worth the read? Definitely! Just give it some time to come full circle.--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Meli", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5087694-meli", "userReview": "TRE-MEN-DOEn todos los sentidos.

This is not one of them. This book is brutal, and emotional, and yet so fucking real. Pointe is a book about ballet and sexual abuse, but in some ways, it's really a book about finding yourself, no matter what you've been through. \u2654 Theo is one of the most believable YA heroines I have ever read about. She's passionate and desperate to succeed. Shes insecure, but not in the \u201cI'm beautiful and don't know it\u201d way; her insecurities feel real, and would be relatable to any teen. She's not lying about her past\u2013 she is completely convinced that she was mature for her age and nothing bad happened between her and her boyfriend. She's a flawed yet likable character. \u2654 Also, a brief shoutout for diversity: the aspect of Theo and Donovan's race is integrated into this novel perfectly. It's not the focus of the story, but it's definitely not ignored either. \u2654 Colbert paces the plot and reveals perfectly. The story unfolds slowly, with flashbacks scattered throughout the book. Every reveal feels natural within the story, with no twists feeling abrupt or out of place. It's not a book about plot twists, but man, are the reveals powerful. \u2654 Pointe also manages to neatly avoid common tropes. In any other book, Ruthie would be a rival and stereotyped as a bitch because she's competitive. But in this book, she's Theo's friend and supports her when she talks about her rape. I loved the attitude towards ballet and dance, it managed to avoid the usual \"they all hate each other and the teacher is crazy\" trope. \u2654 I don't know how exactly to explain what made this story tick for me, but it's undoubtedly a character-driven and intriguing story. I can't recommend it enough. VERDICT: This book is polarizing, according to the reviews, but I think there is a huge chance this could be a new favorite for you. It is a character-driven masterpiece and I can't recommend it enough."}, {"userName": "Dahlia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4688700-dahlia", "userReview": "Oh my good lord, this was so freaking good. It's such an unconscious subversion of pretty much every single trope and stereotype I've become exhausted of seeing in YA lately. It's neither a celebration of flaws nor a celebration of perfection, but rather successfully gets the point across that flaws do not eternally damn a person or his/her character, and perfection has its price and its cracks too. The characters within are just so believable, and real, and I love how morally gray it is in so many different ways that feel so true to life without ever being moralizing. In truth, Colbert could've just had me with the fact that these kids smoke weed and it's not some cautionary tale. Because in high school, that was pretty much allll my friends. It happens, and yet, in YA, it's one of those things we pretend doesn't. But there was so much in this story that I felt like were genuine depictions of everylife, even though the premise suggests really unique characters in a very specialized scenario. But really, it's a bunch of kids who make some bad decisions and some good decisions, have some talents and some downfalls, and have feelings and experiences they struggle to understand. And it's nice to see a main character who screws up time and again but ultimately comes to her own rescue, though not without support.Theo's not perfect, but she's not a character who hates her parents, or other girls just for being girls, or her competition just for being her competition. She is a fully fleshed, fully realized person, and one of my favorite main characters in a long while. That it's nice to finally read contemporary YA with a black main character is just the icing on the cake. Theo's a girl worth spending time with, and now that I'm done with the book, I'm admittedly a little sad to be finished with her. It's rare that I actually care where and how a main character ends up, but with her, I really do."}, {"userName": "Kate Quinn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913455-kate-quinn", "userReview": "There is A LOT going on in this book: ballet, eating disorders, an abducted friend, and a potential love interest, but WOW every bit of it comes together and creates a complete portrait of what feels like a girl so very real that your heart can't help but ache for her.

She claimed to love ballet, and wanted to dance professionally, but then at the same time she was smoking \u2013 both marijuana and cigarettes, and drinking alcohol! Surely if she was that focused on ballet she wouldn\u2019t be ruining her lungs smoking!The storyline in this just didn\u2019t sit right. Right at the beginning we found out that Donovan was alive, but then didn\u2019t actually meet him until the 90% mark, and even then it was a very brief cameo. I mean really? I thought that was the main point of the story, and in the movie this would be a non-speaking role! Then we found out a little bit about Theo\u2019s eating disorder, but it was more a past-tense sort of thing. We were told that she had had an eating disorder, and her not eating properly still was alluded to, but not enough time was spent on this to make it feel like an important part of the story, it was more like a side story. Then we had the mystery over what had happened to Donovan, which again wasn\u2019t explored until the very end of the book, which was again disappointing. I expected much more about Donovan than was actually in here.There was some romance, but I wasn\u2019t impressed really. Theo picked the wrong person, the wrong time, and the wrong situation, and basically set herself up to be hurt. It was a disaster of a romance really.I also don\u2019t really know why this book was called \u2018Pointe\u2019, because there wasn\u2019t much about the ballet in it, and Theo didn\u2019t even really act like a ballerina! Another disappointment.The ending was also less than special. We did eventually find out what happened, but not totally, and even when we did find out I was bored.I have to say that I was disappointed with this book overall. The eating disorder wasn\u2019t given enough air-time, the mystery was dragged out for too long, we didn\u2019t even get to meet Donovan properly, the romance was a disaster, and there wasn\u2019t really much about ballet at all.

Yes, I'm black. No, I'm not selling you some ridiculous, slow-strokey, writer click-bait. Yes, at the time, I meant it.The article is, in my opinion, articulate. It's got some valid points, talks about obligation to culture and the responsibility of the task and also gets a little handsy with Baldwin and his personal aims as one of the most brilliant writers to grace the earth.I'm writing this entry now to say, I think I may have been wrong? Or, more likely, I was right in my use of the word \"probably\" in the title.The post got a lot of action. More than Tiger Woods in 2009. To date, it's one of the most popular posts on my blog and it's still getting a lot of responses, lotta traction. More--I'm still getting a lot of anon hate for it. Which, tbh, is totally fucking hilarious to me. I'm a nobody. I wrote a personal post on my personal blog about my personal opinions on a thing that affects literally, only, personally, me.Somehow, people in the writing community felt the need to seek me out via my blog, via my email, and most popularly, through my Twitter. They thought it would be really fucking fun apparently, to just let me know why I'm a disgrace to the black community. Why my parents should be let down by my morals--or the lack there of. Why I had an obligation, as a POC writer, to educate people about black lives and black culture--the shit you won't find on BET.\"Lucky\" for me, this was before all the #blackout #blacklivesmatter #Ferguson hashtaging--which I have most certainly been a part of. When you grow up black in LA, you better believe you develop opinions on shit like police brutality.The point here is that I think I may have been wrong about my initial post, but not for the reasons so many people might think. When I said this book was a game changer in my earlier update, I meant it. It's a story about a young black ballerina, ergo, right up my alley.This is the book that makes me realize why I should be writing black girls. Because--and I mean this in the nicest, least offensive way--nobody can do it like we can. We, quite obviously, are the authority on the subject, are we not? Also, because black girls are just fucking beautiful. And we're strong as fuck. We've got struggle like nobody else does.I'm not saying I'm one hundred percent down to be the next Toni Morrison or to wax poetic about the things that she does, but I'm open to carrying some of the load.Pretty much I was right to include the word \"probably\" in that blog's title because POINTE and Brandy Colbert just altered a lot of my life and my outlook. I'm not making any promises, and I'm not discounting my earlier opinions, but this book seriously shifted my shit WAY off center and I have literally not been so moved by anything having to do with me in so long. I know this was a lot of words just now, but none of them are the right ones to communicate how I feel about this book.If you haven't read this book and you're reading my review: Pick this book up.

This is not a book where a boy saves a girl. It is NOT a book where the romantic interest is any good nor does he even KNOW what's going on. When it's exposed what a jerk he is, Theo realizes the only person who can save her -- and by extension her best friend -- is herself. The only person in this story who gets to know the truth of things is one of her girlfriends. Something that happens so, so rarely in YA that it is worth addressing. But that friend doesn't push her. In fact, no one in this story pushes Theo towards her final decisions -- those which would help her best friend and the one which ultimately help her personally -- it's Theo who has to own her decisions and her life's course for herself. And at the end, NOTHING IS PERFECT. There are still miles and miles of recovery to be had and it's clear Theo may still make dumb decisions.

Well, I definitely underestimated the author and the overall story. This book is poignant, straight-forward, unpredictable and raw. I was so in love with the protagonist and her struggles and I wanted to protect her from the world. She represents such an authentic teenage girl that I felt for her even when i was completely outraged by her actions.Theo\u2019s best friend Donovan disappeared four years ago, when they were both 13. Since then, her dedication to ballet has kept her focused, so she wouldn\u2019t think about what really has happened to him. But then Donovan returns home and everything that she tried to forget resurfaces. He won\u2019t see or talk to anyone, no matter how many times Theo tries calling. On top of that, Theo has a secret that is connected to what happened to Donovan.The whole time, I waited for the moment when Theo will finally see Donovan but most of the time, I was reading about Theo with guys who clumsily try to flirt with her. I really like Theo's voice, but if the purpose of the book is her friendship with Donovan, I wanted to actually see it, not only read about it through her memories. Still, I really enjoyed the book and it definitely has a unique point of view on teenage life and all difficulties that come with it, alongside dealing with topics such as anorexia, abduction and pedophilia, but there are SO MANY QUESTIONS AND NO ANSWERS. Theo is such a strong protagonist, that I almost forgot that I never found out the purpose of the book. This book turned out to be the opposite of what I expected, since it kept on dodging the real issue with the introduction of tons of others. It kept circling around the actual kidnapping for so long and reunion between two best friends, but by the end, a part of me felt let down. The book is written to the flow of Theo's thoughts with descriptions of casual drug use among adolescents being treated nonchalantly, which actually felt refreshing, because it\u2019s realistic. Theo developed wonderfully throughout the book. She represents a realistic portrayal of a teenager with a wounded self-esteem. It's refreshing to see a main character who screws up and deals with real-world problems. Theo\u2019s insecure, doesn't believe she's good enough and it\u2019s painful to see her like that, because she truly deserves better. As a confused child who has been manipulated, she\u2019s been through a lot of traumatic situations and she\u2019s been through all of that without anyone knowing her pain. Everyone was pulling away from me\u2014but nobody was telling me what I\u2019d done wrong. She has so much love to give, but she always gives to the wrong people.\u201cI cross my legs and lean forward with my elbows on my thighs, catch a quick glance in the mirror to evaluate how much of me has changed and how much has stayed the same. I can't see a big difference and I wonder if I've changed more on the inside or the outside over the years.\u201dIt\u2019s unbelievable how someone so self-conscious can lack self awareness in such intensity. Theo develops an unexpected attraction to the school drug dealer, who also has a girlfriend. Their chemistry was natural and I cheered for them for the biggest part of the book, until I realized that their relationship is similar to hers and Chris', except that Hosea treated her better. Still, they had some truly touching moments. \u201cShe knows about the music stuff, but she doesn't care. That's why I didn't tell her about my job at the studio. She doesn't want make me want to be better, like you do. She doesn't get that it's scary... to want something so much and not be sure if you're good enough.\u201dGah, they had so much potential."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "3.5 starsTheo used to have an eating disorder. When she learned about her best friend's abduction, she used what she ate - and what she did not eat - to get past the pain. A few years later, Theo has set herself on the right path: she has good grades, spends hours practicing to get into an elite ballet academy, and begins a relationship with a mysterious and attractive guy. But when Donovan, Theo's best friend, comes back home after years of being kidnapped, Theo must face the harsh realities she has hid herself from all along.I appreciated the honesty and diversity in this book. Theo is a black ballerina who has casual sex and does not feel ashamed. Brandy Colbert did a nice job cultivating Theo's voice; it felt real without coming across as too callous or vulnerable. Despite some of the issues I had with this book, I round my rating up to 4 stars because of Theo's development as a character - my favorite part of this book occurs within the last few pages, in which Colbert indicates Theo's independence and strength in a way that finishes the novel on a high point.However, Colbert took on too much at times in Pointe. Theo's restricted eating, her relationship with Donovan, her desire to become a ballerina, and a couple of other conflicts all came into play but never merged well enough to flesh out Theo's character. It almost felt like Colbert threw in issues to move the plot forward instead of incorporating dilemmas that would maximize the natural progression of the book. Theo's relationship with Hosea read as the weakest link in the story; Colbert left it at a solid place, but Hosea's part in the story felt superfluous at times.Overall, recommended to those who have an interest in a YA realistic novel that deals with a character who has an eating disorder or who must face a friend's abduction and return. Not the best book I've read about those topics - perhaps try Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson or Stolen by Lucy Christopher - but a solid effort that reads well."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1635120-rachel", "userReview": "Oooooo I liked this one.

No es el elemento principal como intenta demostrar la portada. Pero sin duda lo que m\u00e1s me molest\u00f3 fue la sexualizaci\u00f3n extrema de la imagen de una ni\u00f1a de 13 a\u00f1os. Al leer que la protagonista en ese entonces \"nunca quiso complacer tanto a un hombre\" sinceramente, se me revolvi\u00f3 el est\u00f3mago. Tambi\u00e9n lo de \"ya estaba por entrar en secundaria y convertirme en mujer\" (o algo as\u00ed) me pareci\u00f3 excesivo.

It is necessary, it is needed & these stories matter. POINTE focuses on Theo- a ballerina who has her world turned upside down after her best friend, Donavan, comes back after he was abducted 4 years ago. Theo discovers the man who abducted him- & she's got a connection to him as well. One that is sure to unravel & forces her to speak up.Since this book discusses mature themes, I do feel a warning doesn't hurt. Themes present here include: eating disorders (anorexia), pedophilia, selective mutism/PTSD, sexual abuse, etc. All so very important & Colbert pens a compelling tale that makes you desperate to know Theo's outcome.I did have mixed feelings about this though. For so many topics, I feel like maybe it was too many to incorporate in a single book. Some issues are briefly mentioned & are never really developed. I would have liked to see certain elements more in-depth, but there's only so much you can include in several hundred pages. This is classified as a \"ballet\" book- except for a few descriptions of Theo in class, eager to further her career down the road, there is not much here. It is mostly about Donavon's reappearance & how Theo deals with that.I also feel like the pacing was inconsistent; there were a couple times I had to reread sentences as the timeframe would change abruptly. But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was Donavan didn't play a larger role here- he stays home until the trial. I get that, I do, but I just would have liked to have more scenes with him. I feel that this was mostly about Theo & believe the themes would have hit home harder if Donavan had a more crucial part. The ending felt satisfactory to the circumstance & I am happy to see Theo accept the help she needs."}, {"userName": "Eilonwy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17237503-eilonwy", "userReview": "3-1/2 stars, rounded upTheo\u2019s best friend and next door neighbor, Donovan, disappeared four years ago, when they were both 13. Since then, her dedication to ballet has kept her focused. But then Donovan is found and returned home. He won\u2019t see or talk to anyone, no matter how many times Theo tries calling. Theo\u2019s carefully balanced world is thrown completely askew. To complicate things even more, Theo has a secret, something she hasn\u2019t been able to talk about, either. And it seems to be connected to what happened to Donovan. But she can\u2019t talk unless he does.This book was a harrowing read, as dark and gloomy as the Chicago winter it\u2019s set in. It features kidnapping, pedophilia, anorexia, and a lot of smoking, drinking, and drug use. It was very good, very tense and suspenseful. But wow, it was tough for me to get through. I\u2019m not sure how to review this, because of the suspense factor. There\u2019s a lot that Theo doesn\u2019t want other people to know. And a lot that she hasn\u2019t figured out for herself. (More than once I wanted to jump in the book and yell at her, \u201cHow dense can you be?\u201d But at the same time, the combination of her naivete and her determination to stick to her 13-year-old self\u2019s emotional narrative was convincing.) I loved her character arc over the course of the story, as she has to make a difficult effort to rewrite her own history -- and then accept how that revised past might affect her future, all while she tries to navigate a tricky present. It\u2019s risky, terrifying, and never sugar-coated. I really appreciated that Theo and Donovan are both black, and it\u2019s addressed, but it\u2019s not what this book is about. Theo gets a story that\u2019s about her as a person, period. They live in a well-to-do mostly white Chicago suburb, with solid, loving parents. What happens to each of them doesn\u2019t happen \u201cbecause\u201d they\u2019re black. It could happen to anybody. And weird as this may sound, I admired that Theo isn\u2019t always an entirely sympathetic character. She makes plenty of bad choices. But she owns them, and learns from them. She\u2019s as tough and strong as the toes she dances en pointe on. But she\u2019s also tender and damaged. This was a well-written, well-paced contemporary YA novel. But be warned that wow, it\u2019s kind of bleak. It\u2019s not what people think of as a \u201cbeach read,\u201d but that might be the best place to read it, so the sunshine breaks up the darkness."}, {"userName": "Izzy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31211197-izzy", "userReview": "People fawn over the beauty of dance. The long legs and elegant shoes and expertly twisted buns. And it's not that they're wrong. Those are all part of the reason I was drawn to ballet at the age of three. But I'd be willing to bet those same people have never set foot in the dressing room of a dance studio. Because you can't quite look at it the same once you've been to the other side.\nActual rating: 4.5 starsFun fact/personal story time: I was a ballet dancer for eight years. My mom is a ballet teacher, has been for over thirty years, and ballet has always been a part of my life, even though I haven't danced in years. So I'm always interested in reading fiction that involves a part of that world, because there's a lot to explore within it \u2014 the pressure the dancers have to endure, the psychological damage, the dynamics between the girls... It was what drew me to this book, but this is not really a book about ballet. It's still amazing, though. Pointe is about Theo, a 17 years old dancer. She does a good job of juggling being a junior in high school with the intense dance schedule she maintains, in hopes of becoming a professional soon. Everything is pretty uneventful in her life, until one Thursday when her best friend who has been missing for four years is found.The book sets out to tackle a lot of issues that are difficult to deal with: eating disorders, a kidnapping, pedophilia, rape. It sounds like too much \u2014 it could have easily become too much, in the hands of an author who'd include those things strictly for their shock factor and not known how to handle them \u2014 but we don't see that happening here. It takes some dark turn you wouldn't expect at first, and it all contributes to Theo's growth and to the conclusion of the story.\nThirteen. I learned how to put a condom on a guy when I was that age. Not every time. Only when Chris felt like it. Which wasn't often.\nThe book is written to the flow of Theo's thoughts and internal ramblings, and that might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's the only way we can truly see how the confusion and the fear works inside a victim's mind; from an outside perspective, some of the choices Theo made wouldn't have made sense if we didn't know what a true mess she was inside.Theo is insecure; she doesn't believe she's a good enough dancer, that she's pretty, that she's worth of a guy who won't have to hide the fact that he's with her. And that's what made me love her so much \u2014 I can relate to that feeling of not being good enough, of not understanding why people think you're special. She's not a special snowflake kind of girl; she's just a teenage girl who's been through a lot, and who doesn't know that yes, she deserves better. And at first I kind of wanted to shake her for settling for less than what she deserved, but what was great was to see how much she grew throughout the book, and how she ended up dealing with things.Another amazing thing was how the author subtly included the subject of race. Both Theo and Donovan are black, in a mostly white suburban town just outside of Chicago. Their struggles aren't limited to the fact that they're black, but it's discussed, because of the impact it has in their lives. The thing about it, though, is that often a character that's black, or gay, or fat, or whatever escapes the norm\u2014authors let that become their defining trait, never developing them past a stereotype or past the struggles they have to face, and this definitely doesn't happen here. It was honestly refreshing to see how real these characters felt, from Theo and Donovan to the side characters.Overall, I really enjoyed this, and it's definitely a read more people should be considering."}, {"userName": "Ardo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9874363-ardo", "userReview": "The last time I cried while reading a book was during The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini for my Grade 11 English class. Sobbed is a more accurate term since there\u2019s only been two books in my lifetime that really got me going. The second was Pointe by Brandy Colbert.I don\u2019t often have the pleasure of reading a Young Adult book that has a lead black character who\u2019s identity as a black individual is woven seamlessly into the story. The subtly taken to remind readers of her race with a comment here about the lack of black ballerina\u2019s in the ballet world or a comment there about being the spokesperson for the entire black experience during the civil war unit at a predominately white school. I say remind because, despite being told that the character occupies darker skin, we\u2019re just reading a story about one girl and her experience.Theo is probably one of the bravest characters I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading. She wants things. More specifically, she wants to be a professional ballerina which is a difficult thing to do if you\u2019re not dedicated,hard working,fearless,disciplined,talented,and passionate.These are the qualities I attribute to Theo but I\u2019d also add broken. The broken skin on her toes when she works hard. Her broken self image leading to a broken relationship with food. A young broken heart that shouldn\u2019t have been broken so it leaves emotional scar tissue that reverberates throughout her life. It even reverberates into the lives of the people she cares about leading to the physical and emotional break of her childhood best friend, Donovan, who copes through the breakdown of communication: he becomes mute.Some might call Theo unlikable due to her \u201cbad\u201d decisions but those who do should take a good long look at themselves. Likability is a non-factor in fiction. People are the basis of great fiction and Colbert has written phenomenal fiction that will hook and live within you weeks later. Ballet not only offered Theo the much needed stability and structure to her life but it did the same for the reader. It was the only sure thing throughout and it was described so eloquently that those who don\u2019t have knowledge on the craft will feel like they do once they\u2019re done.Colbert has debuted a gem that I think everyone should read both adults and teens alike. It\u2019s a story about trauma and survival but also about hope and the proverbial light at the end of a tunnel. I hope to wrap Theo and Donovan in my arms and protect them the way they deserve to be protected. I also hope that readers wrap this book in their arms when it comes out this April because it\u2019s definitely a life changer.http://aaomer.wordpress.com/2014/02/0..."}, {"userName": "julieta  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22438184-julieta", "userReview": "[It took her til the end of the book to deal with that.

The blurb is rubbish, but even to say why is to spoil things that shouldn't be spoiled. This is emphatically not because the author is trying to be super-clever and outsmart the reader for a Big Twist reveal. Rather it's because the reader is brought along with Theo as she slowly and painfully comes to understand what she's experienced. Trigger warnings galore are both needed and impossible. It's especially wrenching if you're a parent who has had a child in trouble and you know they're in trouble and can't get at the trouble to help. But even without the \"child in trouble\" part, it's devastating because Theo's parents are wonderful and caring, and have no way of knowing what's happened to Theo. Theo's strength is both admirable and credible, and it was perfect that she couldn't quite find it for herself, but eventually could for her friend.Possibly the thing I love most about this book is the fact that Theo's being black is only a very minor part of the issues. On the other hand, that the line very early on about an important character's being one of Theo's friends' dealer is not any kind of an issue was disturbing in another way entirely.If you've finished reading this and need cheering-up, but the kind of cheering that doesn't diminish the power of the book, I suggest watching the documentary First Position. Michaela's story and character were the kind that make you feel better about the world, just knowing people like that exist.

This is mainly because it tackles hard-hitting topics; I wish this book came along with trigger warning. Pointe explores body image, but mainly pedophilia and the abuse and power imbalance that is attached to it. I wasn\u2019t aware this story is going to be about that which cause me a major setback. I\u2019m anticipating a mystery thriller that isn\u2019t as depth and jarring. I wish the publisher had been affront about that part, particularly to avoid any readers who might get triggered. It is genuinely difficult to read.I like Theo and her arc. She\u2019s a confused child who has been manipulated. She\u2019s been through a lot of traumatic situations. She\u2019s a teenager, she\u2019s not meant to be perfect, she\u2019s going to make a lot of mistakes. I like how the author crafted that without romanticizing what she\u2019s been through.

I LOVED this. My little sister has been dancing since she was about three years old and I've been fascinated by ballet since then. It's always been an intellectual fascination for me--I was into writing and acting and singing, not dancing--but you definitely don't have to be a ballet fan to enjoy this novel. It's not really about ballet. Theo being a black ballerina among a sea of white girls is what drew me in, not what made me stay. This is a gorgeous and deeply resonant story--it's simultaneously a bildungsroman, trauma tale, crime novel, friendship ballad, and a rumination on sex and romance. Also I appreciate the casual drug use among adolescents being treated nonchalantly because it's realistic and I wish more writers with adolescent characters realized that.
