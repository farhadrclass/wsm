A phone! They have a phone! Yes obviously I am a bit shocked. I never expected to see (or read) something about a phone, sports car, golf, limousine etc. Well one thing\u2019s for sure, they may be prince and princess but this book is surely not regency. I was expecting regency you know. I got deluded. This is more like Princess Diaries, except that it\u2019s more religious. I have so many issues with this book. Well for one the conversations are not engaging. The storyline is predictable. The writing is plain and simple. The characters are annoyingly faultless/prefect. I feel like I\u2019m reading from a Bible story. And the attempts at intimacy are awful. The humor is barely laughable. I don\u2019t get the sudden mood changes. No preamble, no nothing. GET OVER YOUR DEAD WIFE! Nickolai is annoying.The sweet gestures which were supposed to make me a giggling mess have no effect whatsoever. Shelby blushes at ridiculous things! Spare me. What is so embarrassing about getting a burger? She\u2019s angry at Nickolai, sometimes scared but I don\u2019t get why! This is so dumb. Worrying is a sin. A sin. Okay. Flirtations. Are you trying to be funny? Cause I\u2019m not laughing.\u201cThank you\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me\u201d OH MY GOD STOP IT. IT\u2019S GRATING ON MY NERVES. And who says \u201cI think I\u2019ll lie down\u201d when hit with a ball? Ridiculous. HE GOT HIT BY A BALL. You don\u2019t need to panic. HE GOT HIT BY A BALL. IN THE HEAD. WHO CARES? HE\u2019S NOT GONNA DIE. What in the name of fuck was that about? So weird. Also did I mention that the \u2018intimacies\u2019 didn\u2019t make me want to curl my toes? Quite the contrary. It\u2019s giving me goosebumps. And not in a good way either. And they\u2019re all crybabies! Oh and another thing, do you really have to get your husband\u2019s permission for everything? Or say \u201cthank you\u201d EVERY FREAKING SECOND?!\u201cMay I hold you?\u201d \u201cIf I can hold you back\u201d OH MY GOD ARE YOU FOR REAL WHAT THE HELL IS THIS OH MY GOD ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!I have never rolled my eyes so much while reading.

I cannot resist a fiction novel when temptation persists. Lori Wick has this knack for writing love stories that make me wonder what world she's living on, cuz it isn't planet earth. Now on the bright side her stories are always clean, and the characters have great value systems and what have you, but I have read much better from her than this. It's not so much that the story was bad per se, just that it was so gosh darn 'mushy'. Sickly sweet. (too much, take it back!)I love great literature, and if that's what you're in search of with a hankering for romance, then I suggest Jane Austin. Lori Wick writes 'brain candy' it takes no effort to read it and I'm sure she pumps out the stories quickly, I kind of wish she'd take more time. I find the conversation stilted and characters sadly predictable. However I still read the whole thing, so that either tells you that there is something there after all, or that part of me is girly enough to devour a love story. (I shame myself. And to think I could have used that time to do homework!)"}, {"userName": "Nola Redd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015045-nola-redd", "userReview": "In most fairy tales, when the Princess and Prince get married, the story ends \u201chappily ever after\u201d. In Lori Wick\u2019s \u201cThe Princess,\u201d however, the vows are only the beginning. Although this is the story of an arranged marriage, I found its underlying message quite relevant to most people today, and I think it may especially help those who are struggling or considering divorce.\tPrince Nikolai of Pendaran lost his wife before the novel begins, but she is quite present, especially in the early pages. As custom rules that the crown prince must be married by the age of 26, and that fateful birthday draws nearer, Nikolai knows that he cannot in good conscience choose his own wife. Instead, he asks his parents to make the choice for him.\tThey select for his bride the lovely Shelby Parker, a sweet, goodhearted woman who shares the same Christian values as they royal family. Although startled by the decision, Shelby accepts the proposal, and the two find themselves married without even meeting. Perhaps the best sign of the distance between them when the Prince, thinking her the new help, introduces himself \u2013 after the wedding.\tAs Nikolai struggles with grief and Shelby struggles to connect to her distant husband, both learn that love does not come automatically with marriage. Indeed, we can make the choice to love our spouse \u2013 or to not love them. Nikolai especially struggles to draw closer to his wife, but after he has rebuffed her, Shelby also finds herself ambivalent and seeks to overcome the pain her husband unwittingly causes her.\tChoice, then, is the message I pulled out of this novel. Marriage isn\u2019t easy for anyone, royal or average. We disagree (fight, argue, whatever) with our spouses, we see them at their worst as well as their best, and the romance that begins even the best of marriages can easily fade away. But, like Nikolai and Shelby, we each must make the choice to love our spouse on a daily basis, and must seek ways to cultivate and grow that love. \tI really enjoyed this novel. It felt a bit heavy-handed on the Christianity, occasionally preachy, but overall it was an enjoyable story. The characters struggled with realistic relationship problems, and, despite their royal origins, were easy to relate to. About the biggest problem I had came from the royal family itself \u2013 counting Shelby and Nikolai, there were (I think) four sets of royal couples, and this got a bit confusing. Still, overall, a great read!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3457287-heather", "userReview": "I had a lot of problems with this book so I'll just go with the highlights. The book was poorly written. There, I've said it. I only finished it because it fulfilled a reading challenge requirement and it was painful for the last two hundred pages. There was far too much telling of events and not enough showing. What we do see usually hurts the characters. We see them being good Christians but we almost never see their thoughts, making their actions feel disingenuous. I didn't hate the heroine, but that's only because there wasn't enough character there to hate. Her life is unreal, even before becoming royalty. The only friends of hers that we really see are the elderly women suffering from cancer who she attends Bible study with. If she's so wonderful and likable shouldn't she have friends her own age? Her only real flaw seems to be that she cares too much. Her mistakes stem from a need to help people that ranges from simple generosity to actually endangering her life and health. Unfortunately, this issue is never discussed. She is praised constantly for this selflessness when what she really needs is to be told that she's allowed to care about herself. I was also very disappointed in the lack of royal issues. After the discussion of \"the tradition\" (requiring the prince to marry by age 26) the book might as well be about normal, everyday people -- it might have been better that way. The royal family is seen moving about as easily as normal people do, as if there would be no issue when the heir to the kingdom suddenly stops by a small family restaurant. Even the tradition falls by the wayside, no one seeming to care that its purpose probably had something to do with producing an heir."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1833494-sarah", "userReview": "This is absolutely my most favorite book by Lori Wick!"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51422-nikki", "userReview": "I find myself re-reading the book a lot.

The plot was of course predictable but that doesn't really bother me in a romance novel. The premise itself was okay -- a marriage of convenience becomes a true romance, that part is a classic device that, while hackneyed, is also good fun. The problems with the book were as follows1) It was incredibly boring. The plot did not move forward in a way that was particularly interesting. In fact, I skipped whole chunks of it, skimming to get back to the point. The characters were wooden and two-dimensional, and the secondary characters were also poorly fleshed out. I honestly could not figure out the Prince's family tree, in part because I didn't care to try, but it seemed like several generations were wandering around the palace? His parents were not king and queen, but his grandparents were regents? Or something? 2) I had no idea where this was supposed to be. I initially thought it was a fantasy kingdom in another world entirely, but then the author brings up France and the U.S. How big is this kingdom? Is it just the palace, another town for her family to live in, and a lake house? Does the royal family do anything in particular or just go to occasional functions?3) I personally am turned off by the religious aspect. I say that as someone who is actively religious. I guess I just found it sort of bizarre that this imaginary European (?) country was also apparently entirely evangelical christians, with everyone going to church twice on Sunday and people casually bringing up the Bible and taking notes on sermons.4) The part that creeped me out the most was the discussion of intimacy, by which they clearly meant sex. Specifically the overtones that your husband needs you as an outlet and therefore regardless of your feelings you owe it to your man to get in the mood, stat. I thought it was weird that these deeply religious people, who hold sex as something sacred and special, nevertheless decided having sex before really loving the person was a super great idea. I also thought the frank heart-to-hearts between mother and daughter about their sex lives read as strange and uncomfortable. I know every family is different, but the strong emphasis the author put on modesty, not seeing even partial nudity etc. made such honesty and comfort talking about sex really not believable.This book is okay in the following circumstance:-You are in a situation where you desperately need any sort of distraction: an airplane, a desert island, a dull afternoon. I wouldn't seek out this book, but you don't have to avoid it either. -You are a very strict Baptist or similar denomination and the books you choose to read are limited to uplifting religion-centered texts. In that context, this would probably read as a good romance interwoven with uplifting messages.-I will say this: The cover of my edition was not embarrassing. No one needs to know that what you are reading is not great literature."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7545257-jessica", "userReview": "I haven't read many of Lori Wick's books. Only her yellow Rose series and maybe a few stand alone books. I found I struggled to rate this book. At times, it was really great. I loved the Christian values, I liked the characters, and the plotline was unique compared with so many generic reads these days. However, what had me torn was all the intimate scenes. Certainly I think it was just enough without being too detailed, however, the writing was blush worthy at times. Normally such writing would bother me, especially since I'm not a huge fan of romance books. However, the fact that the couple was married made a big difference to me. Normally, I get so annoyed with characters who flirt and kiss when they don't have any serious intentions of being in a relationship together. It was a nice change to see a couple married first and then finding their way to love and happiness.I loved both the characters of Shelby and Nick. I loved that they were both already believers and also that they were both really patient and dedicated to making their marriage work. I also was happily surprised to see the honesty on Shelby's part. While I've never been married, and even more so, not married a prince, I found I could relate with Shelby.The only thing I didn't like was, as I said, all the intimate scenes.

Seriously this woman cant write. I only got through 2 thirds before I wanted to shoot myself in the face. Usually i don't write really mean reviews but I'm going to make an exception for this book because of all the religious rubbish. Religion does NOT, i repeat, does NOT play a major part in fiction and this is coming from someone who has been religious all her life. Religion is a touchy subject at the best of times because of all the different beliefs out there so to mention it almost every third page? It got to the point where if someone mentioned the word \"Lord\" I skipped whole paragraphs just because It was so irritating and felt as if the author wrote this book for the sole purpose of ramming her beliefs down the readers throat. Worrying is a sin? Really? Also everyone is too perfect. Her characters lack passion and are pale colourless imitations. Maybe if the story wasn't so boring I would of finished. I give one star for plot line because the general idea is good but that's it. If you write a book for the purpose of publishing you need to write something your readers will like people!!! If you're into long winded religious babble where the characters are either vaguely happy, vaguely worried or cry a lot and the heroine is a spineless ninny this is the book for you!!!

The characters - especially the supporting cast - were all a little too perfect, and the plot was rather contrived. Wick, however, was able to mold the circumstances to convey heartfelt sincerity and realistic emotional conflict. I actually learned a lot from it, and even felt that I appreciated my own wonderful husband more after reading it.I would have stamped it with four stars, except that I felt like Wick went over the top with the Christian aspect of the plot - specifically, by adding an entire, random, pointless side plot about a little boy who wanders in and out of the story a bit and, through his associations with the royal family, comes to accept the Gospel. It not only didn't add to the main plot, it actually detracted from the emotional energy of the story - it even felt manipulative, as if it had only been added to illustrate what good, nice people the royal family were and that they were the kind of people who bore their testimony often."}, {"userName": "Lady", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1690078-lady", "userReview": "lame - that's the best word I can think of for this book.
