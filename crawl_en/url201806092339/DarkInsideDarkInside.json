The book had many faults, which I will go into, and it was on the whole not a great work of dystopian fiction.Basically, there's this earthquake one day and suddenly people everywhere start acting weird... becoming possessed by a violent rage, turning on their families and friends, searching the streets for new victims to torture and kill... and amongst all this are a few individuals (inc. Mason, Aries, Michael and Clementine) who remain unaffected by this, er, infection or whatever it is. At the beginning, our four protagonists have never met one another, but as fate will have it they eventually come together and their stories begin to entwine.Every so often the book would stop in it's fast-paced tracks and another mysterious perspective would be heard that is simply called 'Nothing' and reminded me a great deal of the voice of the darkness in the Gone series by Michael Grant. It is, much to my annoyance, still unclear at the book's close what this 'Nothing' is.You know, it's all okay. But it has that sense of \"oh my god, quick, run from the monsters!\" and then they get away and they're all nice and safe and they walk around a corner and \"oh my god, more monsters, RUN!!!\" And again, as in Divergent, the dystopia is mediocre. I used the following description to try and sum up what I expect a good dystopian novel to be:Basically, it's where the author imagines a hypothetical world that's usually set in the future and takes a relevent political or social issue or issues and creates a fictional society that could possibly be what might happen if humanity was to follow a certain idea or movement or perhaps even carry on behaving the way they are. For example, failing to improve the world's environmental problems. So far, that's not what's happening. I will be reading the sequel that I'm sure is coming so perhaps I will be wowed there and realise I was wrong to doubt Jeyn Roberts ability to create a successful dystopia. So far it all doesn't make sense as to why these people's minds have been hijacked... they're not zombies, if the author had gone down that route she could have used the whole 'cure for cancer gone wrong' thing that's popular today. But an earthquake that makes people get super angry? I'm not seeing the political/social relevance. So here's the five main things that turned me off in this book:1) 4 POVsThis does not work. I have never known it to work and I have never enjoyed a book with more than two (main) perspectives. In fact, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of multiple perspectives at all. Furthermore, these characters did not have distinct enough voices to allow four different POVs to work, I could only tell them apart by the stuff that happened to them, like \"so this is the one who's mum died\" and \"this is the one who's trying to find her brother\", but personality-wise I was clueless. 2) Throwaway CharactersIn a way that is exactly opposite to authors like Melina Marchetta, the author brings many characters into the story who are all unimportant and quickly disregarded. What's the point? There was a bit where Michael teamed up with a group of people he'd met and he spoke effectionately of two of these characters who he referred to as 'the mother' and 'the child'. There's a scene that should have been dramatic and emotional except it wasn't because I couldn't relate to Michael's feelings towards people who I knew only as 'the mother' and 'the child'. There were so many one-dimensional characters in this book.3) Quickly Pulled Together EndI thought the ending seemed rushed and lacked smoothness for it. All the four protagonists spent the novel doing their own individual things and telling their own stories and then, like lightning, they all just happen to, well, run into one another. It felt to me like the author had not given much thought to their meeting and wanted simply to get it over with, it was weird the way it happened so fast and read a little ridiculously. As with the turning a corner and \"oh my god monsters!\" thing I mentioned above, it was like: Aries would be running and she'd knock into a guy who says \"hi, I'm Mason...blah-de-blah\" and then they'd both turn a corner and there'd be another boy and girl who'd say \"oh, we're Michael and Clementine\" - see what I mean?4) We've Still No Idea What's Going OnI appreciate that this is probably the start of at least a trilogy, if not an even longer series, and that it would be a stupid idea to tell the readers everything in the first book. But I felt that there was so little given away in this novel that I came away at the end with nothing. We travel through the books with these characters, we witness earthquakes, murders, heartache... and in the end we remain entirely clueless as to what it's all about. You could have given us something!5) Casual MisogynyI had to mention this because I thought that it was the most in-my-face annoying fact about the novel. I was sick of hearing the female protagonists apologise by saying \"sorry, I'm such a girl\". All the time. One of them gets a bit teary and they're apologising for being a girl. And this novel was written by a woman! Come on ladies, KICK ASS! And if you want to cry, don't effin' apologise for it! Anyway, it could have been a lot better, that's for sure. But there is still potential here and I will wait and see what the sequel brings.Many thanks to Macmillan Children's Books for kindly providing a copy of this for review."}, {"userName": "Kat (Lost in Neverland)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5749698-kat-lost-in-neverland", "userReview": "4.5 Stars.Update: Fuck it, FIVE STARS! THAT WAS FREAKING AMAZING.An earthquake has destroyed most of the world.Humans have been consumed by hatred and anger and have become the monsters that they truly are. Surviving has never been this difficult. We follow the perspectives of four kids. Mason, whose mother has just died and he's fighting the madness inside of him.Aries, who was caught in the earthquake that killed her best friend but was saved by a mysterious stranger.Michael, narrowly avoiding death by betraying his group. And Clementine, who was forced to abandon her family to escape being killed herself and is now going to Seattle to find her brother. Four kids who will defy death, form new bonds, lose friends, and try to keep their own minds from becoming black. Extremely fast paced, vividly exciting, and bloody creepy too. First of all, thank you SO MUCH, Skyla, for recommending this to me. You rock. Second, FINALLY a good horror story for October!I am officially blown away. Whoops, there I go, blowing away in the awesomeness of this book.Ahhh, I can't even find words to describe it. Can I just keep skipping lines and gushing about it? *sigh* Fine, I'll make this review real. I loved how this book dealt with 'madness' and the 'darkness inside' people. You guys all know how much I'm fascinated with the art of insanity. Come on, you know you love me. There was only one thing I did not like about this book. The phrase 'Game over' was used way too much. I think it was said about five times throughout the whole book, maybe more, and it drove me crazy. 'Game over' should stay in video games, I swear to god. Another thing I LOVED about this book was;Daniel x Aries Ship, ship, shippity, ship, ship.Oh Daniel. He wasn't even in the story that much but oh I loved him so. Forget about Aries, Daniel, marry meeee! I strongly believe Daniel was 'Nothing' but I don't care. I like mah boys a little insane too. If you cannot already tell, I loved this book. If you don't read it you'll regret it.

I love good, graphic novels where the blood is bloody, the bones are crunching, and the terror is terrifying! The book started off with a natural disaster (earthquake), some weird spooky supernatural stuff, and 4 protagonists that starred in our show, I mean book. The 4 characters see some seriously creepy stuff and basically, they don\u2019t know whom to trust, were to go and what the hell is going on. Great setup right? Yup. It was soooooooo good. And then\u2026.. wellWash, rinse and repeat.That\u2019s it. It was one graphic scene after another, with no plot. It was just our 4 characters going through the motions of surviving without us, the reader, understanding (let alone the characters) of what the hell was going on, or why any of this was happening. The book was just a poorly made horror movie where the reel gets stuck and you play the killing/dying scenes over and over again.Why did we need 4 POV?We didn\u2019t. It seemed like such a cop-out. The reader never feels emotionally attached to any character because of the 4 POV\u2019s.You thought Divergent was screwy?Sometimes I become a bit picky about the world the book is set in. If I don\u2019t understand something, my entire review can be hyper focused on my confusion & I\u2019ve been known to write an entire review full of questions. (See Divergent). I\u2019m not going to do that here since, well, it\u2019s been a while since I read the book and frankly, a lot of the specifics have left me. However, I have placed my thoughts regarding some of the quotes from the book below.\u201cHe didn\u2019t go home. Instead he drove around until his gas tank was nothing but fumes. Stopping to refill, he grabbed a bag of chips that he ate but didn\u2019t taste. Glancing at the clock, he decided he\u2019d spent enough time away as the doctor ordered. He headed back to the hospital because there was nothing else he could do.\u201d If you have no clue who \u201che\u201d is, neither do I.\u201cThe old man twisted around on his crutches and scanned the road. \u201c So, these bad evil dudes are beating the shit out of people left and right. Here comes an OLD man on CRUTCHES and offers to take you in (well not you but the kid in the story). Either the old man is a bad dude in disguise OR is one of the luckiest old men around. Because if my understanding of \u201cold\u201d is correct, usually you cannot run from bad evil dudes and if you are on crutches AND old, you are in serious trouble and should not be alive at this point of the story. However, that doesn\u2019t prevent our character (at this point I cannot even remember who was the stupid jackass POV at this point of the story) from fully trusting old man in crutches even though he\u2019s seen some pretty graphic evil dude bone crunching deaths. This totally reminded me of the bimbo blonds that trip and fall when running from the slasher serial killer in the movie! Totally predictable and dumb.\u201cThe clouds were fat and gray, the land pregnant with swollen tears.\u201d All righty then!\u201cGlancing down onto the street below, he could see some people trashing a car with what might have been a baseball bat or a crowbar. A few blocks over to the right, a group of people had cornered someone. They were closing in on the kill. Even farther away, a group of people were stacking bodies into what looked like a gigantic bonfire.\u201d No, the kid doesn\u2019t have super human eyesight. It\u2019s fricken dark and he can see blocks and blocks and even farther down. Wow. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t overly familiar with the area, and it was even harder at night with the shadows mixing up her sense of direction.\u201d Ok so, um, exactly what is causing the shadows? Since, one of the big issues here is it is REALLY dark. Like, no electricity.\u201cThe last thing in the world she needed was a broken ankle\u201d. No really, according to the author, \u201cthe last thing\u201d many of the characters need is to come up with some other wording besides \u201cthe last thing\u201d. Maybe I was hyper-focused on these words but I swear the author loved the combo of \u201cthe last thing\u201d.OverallI\u2019m still whining\u2026.. such great potential!!!"}, {"userName": "Giselle (Book Nerd Canada)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle-book-nerd-canada", "userReview": "An unsolicited Advanced Reader Copy was provided by the publisher for review.

We follow along as each character is torn between being normal and being evil.I practically devoured it in one sitting! There\u2019s a lot of action, and a lot of moral questions I found myself asking: What if this happened to me right now? Would I be the leader that would help the other survivors?

I started DARK INSIDE without any expectation, but I've been left completely surprised by just how wonderful this book is. And hey, it's hell of a fast read. Have I ever mentioned how much I love my fast paced reads? They totally rock my world, and DARK INSIDE is no exception.After a series of earthquakes people completely turn on each other. There is no regret, no remorse. If the earthquakes haven't done you harm then these people will make sure they finish the job. All we know is that for some unexplained reason people have flat out started going on killing spree's. Sparing not even their own families or children.Let me tell you now. Although I found it pretty bearable, this will not be a easy read for some. Many innocent people die, and it does get graphic at times. Basically it's far from pretty.But it's more than worth it.We are lead into the lives of four particular teenagers. Clementine, Aries, Mason and Michael. But there is a mysterious fifth under the name \"nothing\". Although it wasn't much of a mystery who this was. As we watch on, each will struggle with their own inner demons and guilt. Let's just say they haven't survived until now without having to kill a person or two. But this is the perfect example of survival of the fittest. You either hide in a corner and wait for a bagger to find you, or think quick and come up with a plan. What the four will go through is horrific. Each will face their own journey and battle to stay alive whilst the so called *baggers* roam the streets. The freaky thing about the baggers is that they aren't necessarily all easy to tell apart. Although many of them are sloppy in their killings, some are more intelligent than others and can hold a conversation without you even suspecting. These are the ones that you really need to look out for. With rations scarce, the majority dead, hospitals, doctors and policemen practically nonexistent, there is no choice but to solely rely on yourself. No one is to be trusted, not even yourself.There were so many moments where my heart would be beating furiously and I would be an anxious mess. When I think of a premise like this, this is exactly what I expect from a novel. Something gritty, a little gory to add a touch of realism. I got that from DARK INSIDE, and the fact that there were so many creepy/horrific moments really helped build the perfect atmosphere.The story poses a strong question. Are we our own greatest enemy? Will the day come where we have so much power that we get carried away? I mean isn't that the reality of today? Isn't it us human who do most of the killing. May it be the environment, animals or each other. Will the time come when things go so out of hand that we destroy each other completely? DARK INSIDE makes you ask this very question, and as questionable some aspects of the book may be, you can't help but wonder - what if? As the story progresses and each character faces their own struggles, they are forced to question what or who is evil or good. Can you determine either and does it even matter anymore?Although I grew frustrated by some the characters reckless decisions and mistakes, I found myself feeling guilty for judging them, because, for example: as much as Michael' cowardly tendencies cheesed me off, who's to say how I would have reacted if I was in their situation? Most likely, I would have not lasted as long as they have managed to. You see, each of them bring something important to the table, and it's enough at least to keep them alive, and that's what counts - no matter what their flaws. The ending is quite abrupt and leaves as many questions lingering as I had in the very beginning. Is there going to be a sequel? I would sure love one, but there is also something wonderful in leaving us readers with that big hovering question mark - in not knowing what happens to them in the world they are now living in.For all you hopeless romantics, romance was pretty much non - existent. Oh there were feelings between certain characters, but it pretty much settled and stayed put around that line. So yeah, very tame and whatnot, and for some that may be a let down but it didn't bother me. It made sense actually and gave the book more of a realistic feel. I mean, where do you find time to make out/other things and such when creepy people are trying to kill you and the world is basically ending. So many books count on romance that it's refreshing to see that a book can hold it's own and the readers interest thoughout without it. Doncha think, eh.Is is apparent that I loved this book? Some who have read the book may not share my enthusiasm, but I, for one, thought it was pretty darn fantastic."}, {"userName": "Eh?Eh!", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137273-eh-eh", "userReview": "Even after 30 years in the US, my parents still have a very strong accent when they speak English. Eengrish. I'm able to interpret their pronunciations and grammar easily it since I grew up hearing it. But throw another accent at me - anything African, some European, or worst of all any kind of Asian accent other than Korean - and I can't tell you what the heck is being said without some knitted-brow concentration. And I notice I end up replying back in a louder voice, as if that'll help. I pfft myself.With this book, I find that my childhood \"accents\" of fantasy&sci-fi and the later piles of textbook logic make it difficult to enjoy the story. The half-a** explanation of why the bad thing is happening...I don't understand you!!Maybe that's part of why I'm finding Literature so difficult?? Brainpower is another reason, but maybe I'm not flexible enough to take in stories that don't have some magic(-al realism?) or enough of a futuristic tone or satisfying explanations?Back to this book, there is a huge earthquake and then some people, marked by savagery, lack of remorse, and black veins in the eye-whites, start killing everyone else. The book follows 4 teens as they see the collapse of society and try to survive.We never learn just what caused all this. How are the earthquakes and killers connected? Why did some change and others not? What's up with the black veins? The few places where the teens think about or discuss what's going on, there's 1) too much to be intriguingly mysterious and 2) not enough to be clear. Both those points made me appreciate Whedon's Firefly/Serenity Reavers even more. With the tv series, such mystery! Who were these psychotic killers who roamed the universe and made even Jayne scared! A friend of mine once explained why she found it pretty cool, the thought that humankind could go to the edge of the universe only to see nothing/everything in the blackness and go insane. With the movie, such a great explanation! It was the government! Sadly, that's kind of believable (see, Tuskegee). And then we're treated to a small group making a mess o' trouble with some clench-worthy action and I laughed and I cried and I laughed and I sobbed...anyway. Back to the book again, it gave an unsatisfying non-answer. Was it a malevolent force?? Was it something in the water?? What?! I don't understand!!The books seemed to be arranged around chapter-long horror setpieces, building up to each one and wrapping it up. I couldn't see why these 4 particular teens were the narrators, why a couple of them were supposedly natural leaders, why a hard-to-believe little love connection popped up near the end. The list of the 6 different kinds of killers was never well-explained (and really, you made the list 7 items long by including the title of the list as #1? I hope that was corrected after this ARC). One of the characters wanted to find her brother but the others had no drive for anything, nothing that made me care about them.But this whole book felt like horror, not just survival or zombie or whatever. Maybe I don't understand its accent."}, {"userName": "Max Lau  \u2022 Maxxesbooktopia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160777-max-lau-maxxesbooktopia", "userReview": "\u201cThe stranger smiled at her. \u201cHumanity has found a cure to a disease they never new existed.\u201d- Dark Inside, Jeyn Roberts.\n\nMy thoughts: Introduction\nLet us start off with the world-building and the atmosphere of this book. The atmosphere throughout this novel was crazily suspenseful. The constant pressure among the characters in the book filled the atmosphere with suspense- like I have said earlier, streams of tear-jerking tears and a spark of romantic vibes. All the atmosphere clung well together and that was what made the book great with all the mixed elements. However, the world-building in this novel was a little lacklustre. It was actually going very well in the beginning, with no info-dumps and the story just flowed like how it was supposed to be. Then, the story came to the middle of the story and everything became confusing from there. It was as if the story went 90 degrees downhill but was able to save itself. Besides the middle part, I thought the ending saved the story for me because the world-building went back to normal. Therefore, I am going to give a 15 out of 25% for the world-building. Moving on, let us talk about the pacing of the book. The pacing for this book was extremely quick with the constant action and the ongoing thoughts of the characters with their hopes and survival instincts to stay alive in a world that had gone mad. Although it was quick, it took me a couple of days to finish due to my school work and many other things that I had to accomplish during my days with this book. Thus, I was not able to finish it in 2 days. Furthermore, there are quite a number of unexplained plots in this book and those unexplained plots led to plot holes. The plot holes started off with the gap between the time of the scenes the character were facing. For example, they were running from the monsters and out of the blue, \u2018three weeks later\u2019 appeared and nothing was really explained on how they managed to escape the monsters. Then, from that particular plot hole onwards, the same thing happened again near the end of the book. Therefore, I did not really enjoy this factor of the story. In addition, I loved the way on how Jeyn managed to make the characters to intersect in their lives and although the scene of union between the characters was short, I still really loved it. Therefore, the score for the union between the characters is 10% out of 10% for me!Moreover, there is a quote that I really loved and I would like to share it with you guys, right here, right now, of course. Here\u2019s the quote:\n\u201cThere are different types of people in the world. There are people who accept what\u2019s in front of them unquestioningly.The live in the dark. In defeat. Ignoring what the future might bring or how they might help to make things happen.Then there are people like me. Optimists. They too live in the dark, in times like these, but dream of the light.I trust in the possibilities of betterness. I believe there is more to life than this. I have to. There\u2019s no other choices for me.\u201d\nOh my gosh! This quote. Okay. Some characters did not have hope in the new world but this particular character named Chickadee stood up to me as a glowing star in this book. She was full of hope, full of happiness in the darkest time and it was not fair that she had to go through all those crappy things in the past. Thus, this quote will forever have a place in my heart!As for the continuation of the review, I found the tone for this book to be very dark because there were a lot of killing and the author actually went to the length of describing the murder of a person including children as young as five years old. So, if you do not like those kind of things, I do not recommend you to pick this book up.Finally, let us talk about the relationships between all the characters in this book. I thought the relationships in this book were very well planned and rounded as they were very compassionate about each other although they were not as nice as they were in the beginning. Thus, I would say that they have a great character improvement!Now, let us move on to the writing section of the review!\nWriting:\n\n\u201cThere are so many empty people walking around on this little planet. Lonely people. Angry people. Bitter. Forgotten.\u201d- Dark Inside, Jeyn Roberts.\nThe writing style was crisp, articulate, flowery at times and mundane when it came to certain part of the story. It was crisp and articulate because it was easy to read and the story flowed smoothly along the trail.However, when it came to the romance part of the novel the writing style turned all flowery and I did not like that because the writing style did not stay constant. Plus, when it came to certain part of the attacking element in the story, the writing style transformed into something milky and mundane. Therefore, I have many thoughts on the writing style of the book.Other than those things above, I enjoyed the alternate point of views between the characters and I thought that it was a great addition to the story due to the fact that we, as readers, are able to capture the whole world and the struggles of each of the characters in the book. Therefore, a 5% out of 5% for the alternate point of views element!Now, let us move on to the characters section!\nCharacters:\nColin: He was the worse character in this book. He was a selfish little coward who does nothing to help up with his group of friends even if he voted to sacrifice himself to help them to get the food from the outside world. He was also a liar and an egocentric person who only thought for what is good for himself and not the others. Therefore, I disliked him and I will not care for this character.Aries: I loved her. She was thoughtful of others and was careful enough not to provide conflict into her and others lives. Plus, she was a leader with all the best qualities and therefore, she was my favourite character in this book and as for her character development, I would say that it shot upwards like a seed to a plant.Mason: The thing is, I did not really like Mason in the beginning. He was an alcoholic teenager with a mean personality that made him looked like a bully but as the story progressed forward, he started to realize that he was being an ass to everyone around him and when he opened up himself, it was the saddest and the most emotional scene in the book. Therefore, he had a great character development! Michael: I loved him in the beginning. He was helpful, brave and careful at first but unfortunately the author destroyed his character (Why?) and made him a coward that could not believe that he betrayed his own group. However, that scene was what made his character shone again. He helped Clementine and began searching for his brother and that was where he learned his mistake. Therefore, I still enjoyed his character!Clementine: She was in the middle of hilarious, smart and dumb. Everything she does make me laugh but sometimes it does not because she was going through a hard time and the action scenes between her and the crazies were not funny but scary. Therefore, I loved her character! Daniel: I do not really know what to say about him because he comes and goes with absolutely no reason and he was hiding something. Something he knows but would not want to share and the author did not reveal what he was hiding from the crowd and the things he knew. Therefore, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about his character!\nOverall:\nI am giving this book an 85% rating. I liked the book but it had its flaws and therefore, it did not make it up to the 90% list.This Review is also posted at MaxxesbooktopiaFind me on Instagram | Blog"}, {"userName": "Reynje", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5590906-reynje", "userReview": "3.5 starsHere\u2019s the thing about me and horror: it\u2019s not so much the content as the source that bothers me. Which is not to say I\u2019m not terrified by scary things, because I am. Absurdly so. But always in the back of my mind is the question: where did this come from? It has always been much more disturbing for me to know that someone, somewhere, came up with whatever horrific scene is playing out on screen or on the page. That even the most unrealistic scenrios were born in very real places, and the most horrible things we can imagine were spawned in the human mind. So if you ask me what I find truly terrifying, I guess I would say human capacity for evil. I find that idea infinitely more disturbing than say, a zombie apolocalypse. And this is why Dark Inside worked for me as a genuinely scary story, because it\u2019s about humanity unleashing their own evil upon the world. While this is immediately apparent in an obvious sense, as a suddenly released evil takes over much of mankind and causes them to become killing-machines, there is also a more subtle form. As those not overtaken and turned into \u201cmonsters\u201d are forced to fight for their survival, they are also faced with situations in which their moral compasses are no longer effective. Previously unthinkable actions become necessity. And fear causes even the most well-intentioned do abhorrent things. Dark Inside is told through five perspectives, which sounds unwieldy, but actually works fairly effectively for the story. Mason, Aries, Clementine and Michael are four teenagers battling to stay alive after the murderous rage (apparently instigated by a series of massive earthquakes) appears to have taken over most of the population. Their dawning cognizance of what is happening around them, and their reactions to it, essentially forms the bulk of the story; each of them trying to survive and navigate their way to relative safety. The fifth perspective, \u201cNothing,\u201d gives a voice and context to the darkness enveloping the majority of humanity, while remaining eerily evasive and difficult to get a handle on. This is a grim, violent book that doesn\u2019t pull punches, particularly when it comes to individual characters\u2019 actions. But it\u2019s not just the brutality that\u2019s depicted, occasionally the most shocking thing about this story is the choices the characters\u2019 make, and then the consequences of those decisions. It\u2019s not a predictable book, in that Roberts doesn\u2019t shelter her characters, and she compels the reader to question them. They do unsympathetic things. They may or may not be or remain \u201cgood\u201d people. There\u2019s an intensely unsettling atmosphere about the novel, on the basis of this uncertainy around some of the characters, and it makes for fast reading. While at a surface level this reads like an action-based novel, (which it is), I was surprised by how much Roberts was able to develop the characters in a limited amount of page time. Given the number of narrators and the rapid progression of the plot, a considerable amount of insight into each of the teenagers is provided, particularly through the choices they make to survive. Granted, it does at times feel very much as if this novel is laying the foundation, establishing the characters to be further developed as the series continues, but the charactersation is done well. The novel is written in the third person (with the exception of \u201cNothing\u201d\u2019s voice), yet Roberts manages to keep the characters distinct. It would have been easy for the viewpoints to blur in a novel of this pacing, but their storylines are substantial and fleshed-out so that they remain unambiguous. Dark Inside sets itself from much of the apocalyptic YA fiction of late because it doesn\u2019t adhere to the tropes and developments common to those novels. This book feels unpredictable, and almost unapologetic in its confronting content. There are no guarantees made, no assurances that things are going to turn out as expected. (By expected I mean as dictated by a lot of current apoc/dystopian YA \u2013 goodness prevails, love interests survive blah blah blah). I\u2019m curious to see where Roberts is taking this story, and while there\u2019s a measure of closure at the end of Dark Inside, there are more than enough questions left unresolved to make me pick up the sequel."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "Actual rating 3.5/5 stars.In making an attempt to pick up the oldest unread tomes on my shelves I stumbled across this book. With no real gusto I begun my reading and was quickly situated in a eerie dystopian landscape, immersed in intrigue, and ensconced in a terror of all the events depicted.I initially assumed this to be a zombie apocalypse story but the fact that it wasn't was where much of my early enthralment lay. Just exactly what has caused the destruction of our world and just exactly why humans have turned on each other in a brutal and sadistic fashion haunts the narrative and left me with the inability to put this book down before discerning these answers.One thing I had certainly not anticipated, before picking this book up, was the extent that the brutality of humans would be explored. There are many scenes that were horrific and graphic in nature, so I would not advise this as a read for those sensitive to depictions of human suffering and bodily harm. I appreciated how this world was explored from a variety of perspectives, and how each one added to the reader's understanding. I was especially intrigued by the perspective of 'nothing', which gave a chilling analysis to the events unfolding. Parts of this, however, were a little cliched in their construction and I found this, despite being limited in romance, to have set up for many relationships to unfold in the coming books."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789030-jamie", "userReview": "\u201cWe would not go gentle into that good night.\u201d5/5Wow-za.I haven\u2019t read many apocalyptic books in my time. Frankly the prospect scares the hell out of me, so why would I want to read about it? But I just happened across Dark Inside in my local bookshop and thought, why not? It looks good, looks all action-packed and has an awesome cover. So I bought it.It was one of the best things I have ever bought.I have to start off by saying that this book is tense. And I mean it. You know when you\u2019re watching a horror film? And you know something is going to happen, but you just can\u2019t figure out what? That\u2019s what it\u2019s like reading Dark Inside, and I found that so exciting. The foundation of this book may not be exactly original, with the whole end of the world zombie apocalypse thing going on, but I feel that Roberts has managed to inject enough of her own ideas to stop the book from becoming tiresome or boring. I liked how some of the \u201cBaggers\u201d (the crazy zombie-like humans that go around killing everyone) were highly intelligent, often talking to the human characters normally, sometimes even tricking them into believing that they are human. I also found the different perspectives compelling, they kept me reading because the story was always fresh and I found that I had to go on to the next chapter because I needed to know what was going on since I left the character last.Speaking of characters, there are four main ones in this book, with lots of others recurring. We have Aries, Clementine, Michael and Mason. I honestly don\u2019t have a favourite. I loved them all so much. Roberts has masterfully interwoven the sub-plots into the main story, like when Mason meets the chirpy Chickadee, and how their relationship blossoms only to be cruelly taken away by a twist of fate that changes Mason. And like how Michael has to make a vital decision, to live or die, even if it does mean leaving others to perish. Even Clementine and Aries have moments and decisions that impact their lives hugely, but I don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re as exponentially gut wrenching as the two boys\u2019. There\u2019s also the secrecy of this book that grabs you and doesn\u2019t let go. Throughout, we\u2019re confronted with a character simply known as \u201cNothing\u201d who often speaks in riddles and gives hints as to why the apocalypse may have happened. The reader learns, (or they think they learn, I could be completely wrong) who this \u201cNothing\u201d is. It didn\u2019t surprise me, but I don\u2019t think it was intended to be surprising, instead it just made me want to know more. I wanted to know why some people weren\u2019t affected by the madness, why the majority were. Why is this elusive \u201cNothing\u201d so perceptive, why do they know things that the others don\u2019t? So many questions! I can\u2019t wait to find out the answers.This book is chock full of action and adventure. It even has a smidgen of romance. Some comedy, and some sadness all the same. It\u2019s a crazy creepy book, but in a sense, it\u2019s beautiful too. It gives you faith in humans whilst also ripping that same faith away.Brilliant."}, {"userName": "Ashelynn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3428991-ashelynn", "userReview": "So, basically, Dark Inside is the scariest book I\u2019ve ever read and I now want to crawl into a hole and hide forever. If you read Ashes by Ilsa J. Bick, you will like this book\u2014and if you were one of those who thought Ashes would have been better had the second part not be so drastically different from the first part, you will freaking LOVE Dark Inside by Jeyn Roberts. Seriously.Okay, so, here\u2019s the deal: there\u2019s five points of views. Nothing (who scares the crap out of me), Mason, Aries, Michael, and Clementine. They\u2019re all told in third person, except for Nothing who tells his/her story in first person. And basically Nothing is crazy and his/her last chapter scared the ever living crap out of me! Just what s/he says (the first sentence especially) twists everything I knew about Dark Inside and if there isn\u2019t a sequel, I\u2019m going to throw a fit. But I think there is, so YAAAY!What\u2019s really scary is the crazies, the Baggers. Whatever you want to call them. They kill for fun, they kill for the game, they kill because they can. Most of them are quiet. Like I said, most of them are quiet, and that\u2019s how you distinguish them from others\u2014except for the ones who act normal and talk and will kill you when they can. You can\u2019t trust anybody in this story, yet I want to live in it. Dark Inside ranks high on the favorite books list. Like oh my god, so brilliant. Love this freaking book.Also, it\u2019s all about survival. There\u2019s none of that \u201cOMG we\u2019re the last people on earth, let\u2019s be in love!\u201d Okay, there\u2019s some romance, but not a whole lot because the focus is on survival. And avoiding the baggers. Which is the same, but holy crap, they\u2019re scary, I have to repeat myself.Each main character has their own personalities and voices. In the very beginning, I had a problem distinguishing their voices and wondered why there were four POVs (five if you count Nothing, but you know it\u2019s Nothing because s/he talks in first person). It makes sense at the end. I also liked that Roberts spread out each teen; like Clementine is from Midwest USA and Michael\u2019s from Montana and Mason from Canada, I think?Also I want to point out that there is a three-week gap in this book, but I think Roberts handled it very well and I didn\u2019t feel as if I missed anything major.One last thing: Read this book during the day, unless you can handle the baggers at night.

The huge crack in the barren earth from the earthquakes, the hazy ruined city in the background, and the indistinct people walking all work with the story (though it reminds me a little bit of the end of a music video), and I like the title rising up out of the fog, too. Even though black-veined eyes are a thing in the story, they don't really mesh here and are in fact really distracting. Why are publishers so enamored with close-ups of eyeballs anyway? Gross. Actual thoughts on the book to come later. This one didn't fully work for me for a lot of reasons (too many narrators with indistinct voices; no explanation of what's actually happening to change people except some vague, portentous comments about evil always lurking within humanity and how we maybe deserve to die out) but it's a decent, action-filled debut with a compelling enough premise that I'd like to at least see where it's going. It's a mix of a ton of other apocalypse/post-apocalypse novels and movies, some of which I mentioned in a status update, but it's at least putting them together well, and I hope there is more character definition in the sequel."}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "Definitely an interesting and yes, darker read.

(Though to be honest I don't even know if dystopia is the right descriptor to tag this with, but it's what the publisher called it so we'll go with that. ;)For starters, rather than set sometime in the future after the apocalyptic event, Dark Inside is a contemporary novel, set at the advent of the shift. This is not a story that builds a new world out of the rubble of the old, but rather tells the story of how our current world breaks down. And the way it breaks down is people turning on people. Not through world wars or a military coup or nuclear weapons as with so many other dystopians, but with a dark and insidious voice that infiltrates and overtakes the majority of the population, turning them into psychopaths bent on killing anyone in their path. There's a metaphor here, and a good one I bet, but unfortunately the way in which Dark Inside was written is so distracting, I can hardly grasp it. The story is told in third person limited narration style, through the eyes of five different people. Five. In a three hundred and change page book, that doesn't give me much room to get to know anyone, especially when there is a larger issue in play. I never felt I knew any of the narrators well enough to become emotionally invested in what happened to them, and had a hard time keeping track of who was who. And while their stories did eventually intersect, it was not until the very end of the book and by that point, I was just ready to be finished. I don't know if this is a series, but given the way it wrapped up I assume is has to be. It was not a cliffhanger, but it was very anticlimactic. Aside from those major issues, I found there to be too many coincidences and conveniences that allowed characters to escape or hide or remain undiscovered. Dialogue felt flat and trite in many instances, and the narrator's voice never shifted between the characters--and also never felt like an authentic teenage voice.In my opinion, this would have been a much better read if it had focused on one single character and had been written in first person. It needed the immediacy and the intimacy of being inside someone's head and going through the horrors with them. A very generous three stars for a great concept and a very poor execution."}, {"userName": "Alyssa Udall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3251905-alyssa-udall", "userReview": "This book is a grim, violent, but mostly empty post-apocalyptic novel that disappoints throughout.Because the narrative is split between 4 different points of view, the reader is forced to read the beginning of the novel 4 separate times. Each narrative shows a different story with different characters, but each is equally grim and disturbing. However, what Dark Inside fails to do is to make its grim and disturbing content actually matter. There is little significance to be found when characters that are thin and vapid are subject to such cataclysmic events in rapid fire and consequently feel numb and empty. In fact, the protagonists feel so numb that one wonders if they are even worth reading about anymore.The narrative itself was filled with awkward language and predictable plot situations. Reading Dark Inside felt a bit like watching every post-apocalyptic or disaster movie ever made in alternating clips.While many of the plot turns were predictable or at least unsurprising, the writing itself was stilted, awkward, and frustrating. For example, from page 118 of the US hardback edition: \"They both made fists with their hands and lightly punched each other.\"... Do you mean they fist-bumped?Again from page 125:\"'I'm looking forward to it. After living with you for three weeks, I can honestly say you need it.''This coming from the guy who farts and snores.''You've got to stop using that hair gel, kid. It's starting to rot your brain.'They grinned at each other.\"There are several problems with this exchange, but the primary concern is that it is so easy to pick apart. What teenage guy complains about an older guy's farting and snoring? How does snoring make someone gross? If they hadn't bathed in over 3 weeks, why would someone make a joke about using hair gel? How is the hair gel comment an appropriate response to the farting and snoring comment? With poorly written exchanges such as this, Dark Inside's grim action sequences and divided narrative are made the strongest part of the novel. But they are not strong enough.Perhaps Dark Inside would have been more successful being told with only one point of view with one really great protagonist. With the 4 narratives, it's too easy for a reader to say, \"who cares?\" If their situations are in no way significant from others in this world, then why read about them at all?"}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3922547-misty", "userReview": "This book really dives into the action and had me on the edge of my seat, heart racing, from start to finish. It really makes your think about kind of person you'd be if the world was in an apocalyptic disarray and what you'd do to survive, as it follows four different characters on their journeys.The book isn't sugar-coated either, terrible things happen that I didn't guess that made it feel realistic and though I suspect a supernatural element to 'the baggers' I think it really shows people can turn into monsters.I really enjoyed all of the characters but i'd say Aries was a favourite, after surviving an horrific bus crash she becomes a great leader for her little group and does things even though she's terrified. I also liked the dark side of Mason, it was really interesting that we also got to read about someone who was slightly affected by the darkness that has turned most people into vicious killers.The only problem I had was about a quarter way in everyone was left on a little cliffhanger and then it suddenly skipped ahead three weeks and there was no explanation as to how they got out of their situations.It was really great as the four stories eventually bled together and though it ended with lots of questions it still ended well and I can't wait for the second instalment for the answers and to see where they all go next.Favourite quotes:\"The nothingness. No fire trucks, ambulances, police cars. No people, cars, steroes, televisions, computers. All the things we use to replace the silence of loneliness.

I told myself I would NOT begin reading it until I had taken care of all the things on my to-do list. But then, I decided to take just one little peek to see how it started out. Before I knew it, I was turning the last page and scrambling to buy book two, Rage Within. This is not a read-a-little-here-and-there kind of book. This book consumed me, and I still haven\u2019t been able to think about anything else. It is exciting and thought-provoking and will have you questioning everything you thought you knew about humanity. Dark Inside is the gripping journey of four teens separately vying to stay alive in the disorder and chaos of the world that once was, eventually leading them to one another, unifying them in their fight for survival. I love multiple POV\u2019s, but this is probably my favorite example of how brilliantly multiple perspectives can be written. There are four main voices in Dark Inside: Michael, Mason, Aries and Clementine; and, for the first time while reading a book, I have a hard time choosing a favorite character because they are all so incredible. The chilling voice of \u201cNothing\u201d is a particular point of view that left me with goosebumps and more suspicions than I could count: \n\u201cThey know we\u2019re here. They\u2019re coming for us. What lies beneath has pushed its way to the surface once again. Time to get away while there is still air left in our lungs. But they will still come.\u201d\nAnd, although I included this particular quote in my Teaser Tuesday last week, it is worthy of another mention: \n\u201cI want to stop. I want someone to help me. Help me, before I kill her.\u201d\n Feel those little hairs standing up on the back of your neck? Darlings, I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. Amazing writing; wonderful, mesmerizing characters; and an unbelievably intense and thrilling ride have made Dark Inside my favorite post-apocalyptic read this year. \n\u201cWe carved our names in the fallen tree. Our tiny mark. Our proof that we still desired life. We would not go gently into that great night.\u201d\nNow, I really must fulfill some of those obligations before I begin Rage Within. Well\u2026 maybe just one little peek\u2026Review originally posted on my blog A Belle's Tales"}, {"userName": "Stephanie (Stepping out of the Page)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485722-stephanie-stepping-out-of-the-page", "userReview": "Dark Inside was a fantastic yet disturbing read. Although I shouldn't judge books by their cover, it looked a bit boy orientated which I found a little peturbing after finding Gone disappointing. The story was interesting and easy to follow. Right from the beginning, I was thrown into a world that had been completely shaken up by an earthquake and the consequent turning of a group of humans into zombies. This is my first zombie novel and it surprised me how much I liked it. The zombies weren't described as being overly gruesome but were infact quite hard to distinguish from humans, which made them even more frightening and dangerous. There seemed to always be some tension between the main characters and whoever they met, for this reason, which really built up the suspense. The story is told in four points of view, by Mason, Michael, Clementine and Aries, all of whom I found to be very interesting and well developed. It was interesting to see how their different situations in different places affected them. The 'Nothing' point of view was effective, but I did think it could've been developed some more. I found the whole situation to be really captivating and the writing was good. The descriptions really did make me feel unnerved at points, the atmosphere was terrifying and on-edge. There was action throughout but it wasn't too much, the book did feel well balanced. I wasn't wholly satisfied with the ending and though it was nice to see the protagonists unite, I think it could've been even more exciting and expanded upon. This was much better than expected and I'd love to see more from Roberts."}, {"userName": "Fleur (FranklyBooks)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32718543-fleur-franklybooks", "userReview": "The reviews for this are WRONG. Well, not wrong but they mislead me a little.  See, all the reviews that I\u2019ve read from people that I follow, are negative. They made me put off reading this book for a DAMN YEAR which was such a huge mistake. Especially since it was only \u00a31 when I actually bought it.Turns out, this book kicks ass. I mean sure, I get where those negative reviews are coming from. There are some faults with this book. I\u2019m not denying that in the slightest.

It's the kind of book that I have a great love/hate relationship with: the premise is so chilling and frightening but in an addictive, fast-paced way, but, like most people, I'm terrified of something so huge and inexplicable happening to my friends and family on a mass scale. In the opening chapters, \"Dead Inside\" lived up to its potential, with a hurtling, nauseous description of the four main characters getting into accidents, having their schools blown up, being randomly attacked and their families dying brutally. Like most people, this is pretty much all of my worst fears packed into several horrifying setpieces. As you can see, I read this long book in one day, probably my fastest read of the year, but, despite the fairly good pacing and the wince-inducing occurrences, looking back on the plot, I can't help but think that it's all a little...boring.Don't get me wrong. It isn't, at first. At first, it's fucking terrifying. Law and order breaks down totally, utterly and immediately in a realistic and making-me-rock-backwards-and-forwards-in-my-chair way. Good people die badly. People turn on each other in the most vicious ways possible. And while I know that YA couldn't really go all-out with the nasty violence and that it would have all felt like overkill by the end of this book and I don't object to some off-screen action - Greek tragedy shows us that sometimes what happens out of the audience's sight is far more awful than anything a writer could pull on them - it all becomes more than a bit samey by the end of \"Dark Inside.\" That, of course, makes me a horrible person, because a pregnant woman gets dragged away in the beginning and a little boy is almost murdered in the middle. Buuuuut it's all dampened by the fact that we know nothing about these people. Nothing. Not their names, not their families, not even their fate! By the end, it felt like shock value over substance.Although, in all fairness, Roberts treats all her characters the same, even her main ones. Maybe it's just me, as an English person (we prefer our mundane names over here), but \"Clementine\" and \"Aries\" (especially the latter) bugged me throughout. Third person is effective in these kind of novels because it allows for a greater sense of world-wide breakdown (which is sort of used well within the narrative), and gives unpredictability (which really wasn't). We don't know much about these characters, and even what we do know is pretty stock. Mason (who I will mess up with Michael liberally throughout this review; I really struggled with which was which) suffers from archetypal Survivor's Guilt because his mother's death is what caused him to escape the bombing of his school in which all his friends died. Daniel is the hot, brooding, unlikeable boy with A SECRET!!! Clemetine has someone to live and look for. Aries is our archetypal moron. Third person, which could have been perfect for this novel, was used monotonously and repetitively so that none of the rhythm of the fight scenes were really felt.Most of the characters were passable on the scale of Moron-->Genius scale. Mostly everyone was unrealistically lucky rather than totally moronic, with one very large exception: Aries. At first, she was understandably terrified and out of it. That is all fair enough. (I would be such a shivering, dribbling wreck in the sort-of-but-not-really zombie apocalypse that I can relate.) But, later in the book, when Aries is supposed to have got more clued up on survival tips to the point where she's actually the leader of her little group - right up until Daniel, the prick brooding hot boy who sort of saved her life by telling her to go to the high school at the beginning. Given what a mess she was, I can sort of understand being indebted to him. To me, the debt would have cleared once Aries risked her own life taking care of him for two days (a lifetime in the apocalypse). But oh no no. Apparently this not-very-special act of life-saving earned Daniel Aries's undying devotion, despite the fact that he is very shifty, has a habit of abandoning her and doesn't seem all that trustworthy. This gets to the point where she endangers all their lives - including her entire group's - by refusing to leave Daniel when he's essentially telling her to get the fuck out? He didn't want her, but ooohhhh noooo, Ariel thinks because she likes being in a group so much that Daniel will like it to. Ummm, what? Has she not seen what can happen to survivors in this apocalypse? Does she really want to pair up with a guy who doesn't seem all that fond of her? I can only assume by the description of her stroking his cheek and her heartbeat quickening that he is the Obligatory Love Interest. Shudder.The thing is, the plot is nonsense. We don't know why this virus/disease/personality disorder/THING has come over these people, or why it only affects some people. And that's okay. It fits very well for the book to evoke the chaos and confusion that can come with true, absolute ignorance, and fits so well with Roberts' horror mould of things that are beyond our control (total? EVERYTHING). It's totally fine. But accepting that the entire plot is based around very unlikely contrivance comes, to me, with the unspoken promise that the rest of your plot will concern very likely events. Roberts is good at this to begin with, what with society crumbling in an inevitable, horrible way, but, as time goes on, she seems to throw any mini semblance of logic to the wind in an attempt to craft surprises. For example: to begin with, the virus seems to be more or less uncontrollable, a brain-eating disease that takes away everything about you, including your free will. Then suddenly it's possible for some people to retain their (amazing) intellect and articulation, despite the fact that these zombies are supposedly governed by nothing but pure bloodlust-rage. Why? Who the hell cares. It just makes a good twist. My next point is a fine line to walk but it did bug me that every single one of the survivors'...survival skills were based on 99.9999999999% (more often than not, 100%) luck. Of course a massive degree of luck is required to survive any major disaster, and I could forgive all of the luck that happened in the immediate aftermath of the apocalypse, but afterwards, it was stretched to breaking point. Aries's team manages to collect an amazing amount of supplies, including stuff like bicycles, despite the fact that most of the zombies seem to be at least a little logic and capable of plotting, as the killing technique of most of them seems to be surrounding buildings and setting them on fire, to either burn everyone inside or catch them as they ran out. If the zombies are at least pretty smart - and some of them are shown to be incredibly so - why wouldn't they burn down all the supply shops to kill off any remaining humans? Well, because then it wouldn't be possible for Roberts' characters to survive. I swear this pattern repeats itself about a thousand times in the novel:1. Get attacked by 'bagger'2. Fight off 'bagger'3. Do something incredibly stupid4. Amazing luck and/or the 'bagger's' amazing stupidity facilitate escape that previously seemed totally impossible.This leaves \"Dark Inside\" with a grand total of Not Much Plot At All. I sort of think I should stop reading books that are going to be the first in a series/trilogy. Because, I'm sorry, this was not a story at all. This was a thorough exploration of the jumping-off point for a story, i.e. the beginning, so this wasn't even a novel. It was a third of a novel. I have no idea what the next book will be about; sure, we left our characters hanging - not the cliffhanger kind - but I can't see where \"Dark Inside\" could next go except for a lot more of the \"walking for miles and miles\" and \"repetitive fight scene\" combination. There is no intrigue, no sequel hook, no real reason why I should read on except for the world-building (which was good!) and the fate of the characters (who were skimmed over, bland and not remotely interesting enough to pull me back in). Ultimately, nothing really happened. Oh, sure, there were a lot of fight scenes, and lots of minor secondary characters got killed off. But I honestly can't think of one plot thread that I am excited to read about in the next book, or one revelation of importance that could tie the 'arc' (this is a trilogy, right? Surely it has to have an arc of some sort?) together. The most annoying thing about all of this is that the best moments of \"Dark Inside\" come when Roberts injects a cold syringe of substance into her ass-kicking plot. Twiggy, a Sociology professor turned zombie, theorises that the virus comes about because of the '\"push-button\" generation', and the innate frustration and repressed loathing - both of self and particularly others - are freed by the virus, but that they were also there are all along, as a product of urban rage and hatred. Twiggy's speech about how all great civilisations destroyed themselves from within eventually, and now it was our turn, was chilling and amazingly fascinating. Maybe it's a little trite, but that kind of widespread emotion is a dark and almost endlessly interesting place for a YA zombie novel, of all the things, to mine. Best of all, it's amazingly plausible; in a hyperbolic, science-fictiony way, there it's a wild but not stratospheric leap between road rage/the race of people who will kill each other over something as mundane as Thanksgiving turkey and the rage-fuelled automatons that mostly populate \"Dark Inside.\" It's just a shame that this dark gem is hidden inside such a bloated, monotonous plot."}, {"userName": "Jessie  (Ageless Pages Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863162-jessie-ageless-pages-reviews", "userReview": "Read This Review & More Like It On My Blog!Dark Inside was a number of firsts for me. It was the first zombieish/esque apocalyptic novel I've read. It was the first horror novel I've ever willingly completed (I gave Stephen King a try when younger. I think my delusional line of thought was: \"go big or go home.\" I guess you could say I \"went home\". . . but I digress.) This is also the first time in a long time that I have enjoyed being scared (and disturbed) so much. Unfortunately, all is not perfect in Ms. Roberts' tale of world gone awry, but I more than loved it enough to make it one of my favorite reads of the year so far. It may not be the most traditional zombie/horror fare (though I have just admitted I have no idea and no right to judge but try and stop me!) but it is GREAT read, and is one of the few young-adult novels that can successfully bridge the gap into more adult fiction.With a bleak tone right from the start, Dark Inside was a great change of pace for me. Not only are the \"zombies\" not technically zombies as usually defined, but darker, subverted and almost mindlessly enraged humans with no control and no compassion. That isn't to mean that the author stints from dark or disturbing elements - a scene with a pregnant woman being dragged by her hair into a murderous mob, or even just the casual mentions of people hunting CHILDREN at elementary schools still stand out in my memory days later - but they are simply not \"supernatural\" as in the undead. I liked that the monsters of the novel were actually humans, apparently those not immune to a force that has ravaged the earth before. And let me tell you, these monsters or \"baggers\" as in \"Let's go bag a deer\" \nwith the deer now being people\n, freaked me the hell out. There are several scenes that legitimately had my ears up underneath my shoulders. The introductory scene with Clementine and her family in the town hall was particularly well done: I was intrigued, freaked out and eager to read much, much more of what this author had in store. I loved that the zombies weren't brainless either, but actually capable of matching wits and besting their prey. It added ANOTHER level of suspense to a novel that already had me constantly on my toes. In a book where the monster can hide in plain site, or even set clever traps, and converse pleasantly, suspicion can and does fall on every character and it is best to do as Mason is advised and, \"trust no one.\"The rotating POV's of four main characters alternatively works for and hinders the novel. So many perspectives (the four main kids and also sporadically thing called \"Nothing\" has a few, short POVs) allowed for a wider, more varied view of the monsters and the destruction of the earthquakes, but it can also get quite repetitive with the minutiae. How crazy/insane/inhumane the \"baggers\" are is repeated a little too often between Mason, Michael, Aries and Clementine. It is a little hard to differentiate between all four characters as none is what I would call a fully three-dimensional, realized personality. It's just too hard, for me as a reader, to identify, connect and empathize with four different people that closely with a limit of less than 400 pages. It just shifts too frequently, with too little time between the narrative change. I liked all the teenagers well enough, but if I had to pick two specifically I wish had more screen time I'd definitely have to go with the two resourceful and smart girls: Aries and Clementine. While neither was so distinctive or vibrant I didn't have trouble blurring their individual storylines up until they meet, they both impressed me more than their male counterparts. I just wished for more from each - more personality, more individuality to distinguish Michael from Mason and Aries from Clementine.All four kids end up independent and in charge of themselves - the exact situation most would have wished for before the earthquakes and now obviously the last place they want to find themselves. Mason, whose mother and entire school died the day of the quakes, is the most extreme example of the isolation of this new world, but none are exempt. I liked the spin on what most teens would dream of: complete independence.. but at what cost? Clem at least still searches for a brother named Heath, representing her hope for survival in this cruel world, Aries has her quest for a mysterious boy named Daniel who knows too much, and Michael has a dad lost somewhere out in the wild world of America. Watching the world shatter through the eyes of these four disparate teens was entirely compelling. Though they are not perfect characters, I found myself slowly hoping for a better outcome: for Heath to be alive, for Mason to lose his anger, for Clem to live until the end.. (She was occasionally so naive it pained me! But she was my favorite! Conflicted!) Especially because this is clearly a series, I have high hopes that these characters will grow into some all-time favorites. The potential is there: either more length or a trimmed POV list is hopefully coming in the next volume.The author also does a subtle job of slowly doling out the information about what happened the day everything changed: from the unpredictable acts of nature (6 9.5 Richter scale quakes) to the eerily similar acts of terrorism (123 schools bombed all over the world) - all while fueling even more questions.  How did some people know beforehand? (i.e. man on the bus, the bombings) Why are only some people turned into the \"baggers\"? What determines the intelligence of each bagger? If this is the earth clearing out the bad - why does it seem the innocent are the victims? Who/what is \"Nothing\"?As the kids learn that no one safe, either alone or in groups, each moves towards Vancouver and I began to have a few issues. First of all, none of the above questions are really answered. The first third sets up all these questions and none are fully solved to satisfaction - I'm already going to read book two so I just felt unsatisfied by the lack of resolution for any of the characters. The predicted and inevitable meet-up of all four teenagers felt rushed and unnatural for the novel - in a book of distrust, they just literally run into each other right in Vancouver and. . . . everyone's all hunky dory? - and threw me off from the flow. Which.. speaking of, seems to be in need of a little polish as well. Some of the transitions for characters, both between and within POV transitions, were awkward and repetitive. This is a violent, gory, disturbing, emotional and funny book. I loved this way more than I had thought I would. I had initially passed this over in my monthly Simon and Schuster Galley Grab email but decided to give it a go on a random whim: what a great decision in retrospect. This is not a perfect novel but I had such fun reading it I can't imagine any rating lower than a 4 out of 5. It is consistently taut with tension and occasionally fraught with emotion (Chee! Clem's parents!) and definitely not one to miss for anyone looking for a zombieish novel. A pulse-racing novel from start to finish, I can't wait to get my hands on book two - especially after such an open-ended conclusion."}, {"userName": "\u2b50Anni\u2b50", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63666087-anni", "userReview": "4.5 starsI went into this book knowing barely anything and ended up really loving it!

They're not zombies, but sometimes they resemble them.
