Oh, right, it is the novel. So the psychopaths hire an assassin to kill off federal judges, and Mary Crow, an assistant district attorney, must help protect one of those judges, as she (the judge) has been like a mother to Mary since Mary's own mom was brutally killed years before. Mary is a wonderful protagonist, intelligent, kind, strong, and yet, like all of us, imperfect. Love her character and the series. Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23606512-elizabeth-kennedy", "userReview": "I am not kidding when I say this one left me breathless. The ending in this book is so thrilling and so surprising that I cannot express how mesmerized I was. This is the third book I have read in this series, even though it is the second one featuring Mary Crow. There is something about Mary Crow that keeps drawing you in. She isn't fully characterized yet as you are not told everything about her past and why she acts the way she does, but there are new glimpses. Her bravery and resourcefulness are refreshing in the genre and your heart breaks for her as she struggles to let her old love go. I have to admit, I was afraid something would happen to the horses, but I don't think its giving away anything to tell future readers that they are all fine. Tommy Cabe was a very interesting character as well, inadvertently becoming the star pupil in Wurth's camp by being opposite to everything he taught. And Wurth may have well have been a Hitler protege. This book has a supremely boring cover and title but you will be sorry if you let that sway you from the experience the story is. I cant wait to read \"Call the Devil by his Oldest Name\", the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Angela Risner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9972516-angela-risner", "userReview": "This is the second book in Sallie Bissell's Mary Crow series. I read the last book first, not realizing it was a series until it was too late, so I'm starting it with the knowledge of where the characters are now. I am now working my way through the series in order.In this entry, Mary is an ADA in Deckard County, GA. She stays in touch with the hometown crowd in Pisgah County, NC, but her life is in GA and she is determined to move forward after the events of In the Forest of Harm. However, her surrogate mother figure, Judge Irene Hannah, is in danger, and Mary is asked by the FBI to convince Irene that she needs their protection. I need to talk about some plot lines, so SPOILER ALERT!1. It's what, 18 months, after the girls were terrorized on their camping trip. I'm not saying that these girls can't move on, but I have yet to see real people go through something like that without having PTSD or some other lasting effects. That part was a bit disappointing to me. Maybe if Bissell had moved the time to 5 years after the first book, it would be more believable. 2. What we're told in the first book is that once Mary's mother was murdered, her paternal grandmother came and took her away. No mention of Judge Irene Hannah in the first book (that I can recall.) But all of a sudden, Mary has this huge relationship where Irene was practically a second mother? 3. Did Irene REALLY have to die? Mary's lost her parents, her grandmother, and now her second mother? I mean, come on.Now that I've told you what I didn't like, let's talk about what I did.1. I am glad that Mary just doesn't pine over Jonathan. They tried it to be together for awhile and it didn't work. Good for her for being open to others.2. I started to worry that this series would become like Kathy Reichs' Tempe Brennan series, in which the character is NOT a detective or FBI agent, yet still investigates crime and manages to nearly get herself killed every time. Mary, also, is NOT a detective or FBI agent, but she has a personal connection to each case. That saves it for me.3. The writing is still very good. Even if I don't agree with the inconsistencies or the end, the writing is still solid in general. Good entry."}, {"userName": "Chanel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5140994-chanel", "userReview": "Once again I was up past midnight, reading. The Mary Crow series is interesting and keeps you guessing from page to page.I love the setting of Upsy Daisy farm and would like to know if it really exists or if it's a place Mrs. Bissell visits in her imagination.I enjoy reading Sallie Bissell's book's. I am close to the areas she writes about in her books and it brings them to life for me. I took her writing class several years ago and she is amazing."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "The first mystery I've actually cared enough about to finish from the year, even though my pile from the library had at least four. I have found that setting matters almost more than everything, and this one is set in the mountains of North Carolina, not far from where I am living. So just the discussion of the landscape alone was enough to peak my interest. And I didn't hate the detective - she was somewhat amateur, as a DA but not a trained cop or detective, but she was smart. And being part Cherokee was interesting too."}, {"userName": "Normalene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2279708-normalene", "userReview": "I didn't like this one as much as I loved the first one but Mary still kicks butt and the supporting characters are fun too. Bissell doesn't play it safe by making Jonathan's new girlfriend unlikeable but there were times when she should have had more confidence in her relationship and been able to say that Mary was there. I wanted to slap her when she just decided to not mention it, while Mary is being tortured. The end was okay and we learn more about Mary's past and I'll still read the next one, but I'll hope for more."}, {"userName": "Jaime Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12583190-jaime-stevens", "userReview": "I liked the first book, but I really got into A Darker Justice much easier. The ending was good and had a nice twist. I liked that we got to see a softer side of Mary. Lots of sadness in her life and it seems like she can't catch any luck with those she loves and cares about always getting hurt. I went to the library to get the next 3 books. Can't wait to read the rest of them."}, {"userName": "Amie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12395797-amie", "userReview": "I really like this series, even though I have only read two books.
