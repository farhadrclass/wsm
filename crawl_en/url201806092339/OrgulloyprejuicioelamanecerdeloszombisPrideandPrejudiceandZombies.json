The story is really a precursor to the Pride And Prejudice with Zombies book which caught everyones attention. However as fun as the story is (and as gruesome) it has nothing - or should I say even less to do with the works of Jane Austin than the original.And this I think was its downfall - since the original had a famous storyline to follow one which has been so heavily ingrained in British literature you instinctively recognise the story even with the odd undead thrown in for good measure. This book however cannot claim any such lineage and as a result feels a little lost. Now if you are a fan of zombies this is a fun read with enough shocks and humour to stand alongside many of its peers however it does not have the same feel. So for me even though it claims to come from the same time line (and even goes as far as to explain events and drops names like leaves in winter) it still cannot capture the same sense of fun as the first book. So if you are a completist then by all means read the book its not bad- but do not expect it to come close the to the first."}, {"userName": "Mehrshad Zarei", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2017",

As the prequel to the very successful Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, it delves into the circumstances that changed the Bennett girls into lean, mean, zombie fighting machines. When a recently deceased corpse reanimates into a zombie during its own funeral, it heralds the return of the Unmentionables. It is then that the girls learn that their father fought nobly during The Troubles of years ago, and even trained in China. Reclaiming Mrs. Bennett\u2019s potting shed for his dojo, he begins to teach his daughters the Asian fighting techniques that had proven effective before. Soon, an extraordinarily handsome young man, Master Hawksworth, arrives to take charge of their training. The War Office dispatches a company of soldiers led by Captain Cannon, a limbless veteran of The Troubles. The company includes Dr. Keckilpenny who has some rather unorthodox ideas on the way to handle the zombie problem. As more and more unmentionables begin to appear around the countryside and must be dealt with, the news of the Bennett girls\u2019 fighting prowess spreads, and their reputations as proper Englishwomen diminish.When the invitation to the spring ball, scheduled to be Elizabeth\u2019s entrance into society, is withdrawn, can the girls now ever hope to find proper husbands? Will Elizabeth favor Master Hawksworth or Dr.Keckilpenny? Can Lord Lumpley successfully seduce Jane, trapped in his home as his personal bodyguard? Will zombies overrun the countryside and make all the previous questions irrevelate? Set four years before the original story, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn if the Dreadfuls manages to somewhat keep the flavor of Austen\u2019s writing style, but is a completely original story of its own. The basic character of the principals remains intact, and the new characters are imaginative additions. Liberally dosed with humor throughout, and a fair amount of gore, the fast paced book is an enjoyable quick read for those who favor parody novels, or can take their classics with a twist."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Dawn of the Dreadfuls (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies 0.5), Steve Hockensmith, Jane Austen\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u063a\u0631\u0648\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0639\u0635\u0628 \u0648 \u0632\u0627\u0645\u0628\u06cc \u0647\u0627 : \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u062d\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632\u0647\u0627\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0648 \u0647\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u06cc\u062a\u061b \u062c\u06cc\u0646 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0628\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0627\u062c\u06cc \u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u062f\u0627\u062f\u060c 1395\u061b \u062f\u0631 500 \u0635\u060c \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9786009584727\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0632\u0627\u0628\u062a \u0628\u0646\u062a - \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc - \u0632\u0627\u0645\u0628\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645"}, {"userName": "Dustin Reade", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4905607-dustin-reade", "userReview": "I know these \"mash-up\" books are stupid.

When Quirk released Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, the prequel to PPZ, Austen was probably so angry over the irreverent use of her work that she may just rise from the dead herself. This would, most likely, lead to sightings of a zombified Jane Austen shuffling through the streets, her arms outstreched, a low moan coming from her mouth (along with a few pieces of skin here and there). She would search the earth to find the people at Quirk Classics who further defiled her work by writing Dawn of the Dreafuls, and, well, eat their brains. If Austen didn't make an appearance, one of her dedicated fans may make the trip on her behalf to protest the novel's completely irreverent treatment of the source material.While I'm a huge fan of Austen's original novel, I was won over by the original Pride and Prejudice and Zombies thanks to its quirky, absurd and just downright fun premise. I was a little uncertain when Quirk announced the prequel, primarily because there was no Austen novel to build the plot from. Instead, the entire thing would just be, essentially, a fan fiction prequel of PPZ. But when given an opportunity to read the book, I thought I'd give it a try. I found that if I could let all my inhibitions go and just enjoy the book for what it is, it's incredibly fun, original, bizarre and fabulous.Set four years prior to the events of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the Bennett family is attending a funeral, when the corpse suddenly starts moving. Mr. Bennett finds that his worse fears are coming true: the dreadful are returning. He decides to thoroughly train his daughters in the warrior ways so they can be prepared to fight off the dreadfuls and keep them from overrunning the land.Fans of the parody/monster mash-up will eat up PPZ: Dawn of the Dreadfuls. While haters of the original PPZ won't be converted, skeptics of this prequel really should just give it a chance. This is horror/comedy/parody at its best.Can't wait for the PPZ graphic novel next month and Android Karenina this summer."}, {"userName": "Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206464-bookworm", "userReview": "What can I say about Dawn of the Dreadfuls? This was a fun, creepy and strange book and I enjoyed it. This book is a prequel to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies which I read back in January. Author Steve Hockensmith does not take the storyline directly from Pride and Prejudice, he does however use Austen's characters and adds a few of his own, then mixes that with zombies. The zombies a.k.a. The Dreadfuls, long since thought to have all been slayed, have now returned to Longbourne. Mr. Bennet, who was once part of a secret order and a warrior himself, takes it upon himself to train his 5 daughters on how to slay the undead. It's either learn to fight or be disowned and eventually, most likely, eaten by zombies. 'It was a cry that hadn't been heard in Hertfordshire for years, yet nearly everyone there knew what it was.The zombie wail.'I'm a sucker for these kinds of books. I know some die hard Austen fans don't care much for these types of spin-offs. Pride & Prejudice is my favorite Austen, so while reading this one, I knew that Elizabeth and Jane were not going to pick any suitors, but I still enjoyed seeing some new characters vie for their affections.All in all, a fun book, I recommend it if you enjoy zombies and Austen spin offs. The last part of the book actually reminded me a bit of Night of the Living Dead.

Astute readers will notice the absence of Jane Austen's name from the byline of second book in the Pride and Prejudices and Zombies trilogy. With good reason, for Austen never wrote a prequel. Yet if she were around today, she might have written Dawn of the Dreadfuls. Minus the zombies, of course.In the movies, zombies are often nameless until one of the heroes is bitten. Then we experience the horror of seeing beloved characters turn into monsters. This plays havoc with our emotions, as a kitten toys with a ball of yarn. We want the newly infected to live; yet we know their salvation will mean the community's damnation. In contrast to the movies, the first two zombies to appear in Dawn of the Dreadful are known to our heroes, the Bennets, and so everyone is thrown immediately into emotional chaos. To my chagrin, these random zombie awakenings develop into throngs of rampaging cannibalistic dead. I preferred reading about the smaller encounters, such as the captured zombie whom one of Elizabeth's suitors tries to humanize. Whereas the attack of Lord Lumpley's home resembles epic CGI scenes, diminishing some of the humanity that attracted me to a book about zombies.Yet like its predecessor, the zombie scenes are among the best parts of the book: \"Two dreadfuls looked her way. They were on the other side of the clearing, turned toward each other, as if they had been chatting away like two friendly neighbors....\" The rest of the scene goes onto vividly depict the clothes, skin, hair, and even facial expressions of the zombies. Hockensmith could have broadly painted every zombie scene; instead for the most part he portrays zombies as vividly as the humans: \"A moan from the front of the church broke up the tussle. It started low, almost literally so, as if bubbling up from the depths of the earth, a distant wail from Hell itself. Then it built to a high, piercing howl.... It was a cry that hadn't been heard in Hertfordshire for years, yet everyone there knew what it was. The zombie wail.' Eerie!Hockensmith is equally careful with the love scenes. While her five daughters put away their fine clothing and forego formal balls to become zombie hunters, Mrs. Bennet remains her feminine self. Yet even she is effected by the war. When her husband converts her greenhouse into a \"dojo\" and retreats there to teach their daughters to fight, Mrs. Bennet becomes lonely and susceptible to the wooing of an old flame. Despite being uninvited from a ball due to their warrior ways, the girls also dabble with romance: The oldest daughter Jane wins the eyes of many suitors who consider her the nicest creature God ever created, Elizabeth garners attention from a ninja master and from a scientist, and even Mary has infatuations. Through these entanglements, familiar motifs in Austen's novel of a woman's place in society, along with the notion of what true love is, are explored and make Dawn of the Dreadfuls timeless and universal. At some point, all of us face societal expectations, \"monsters,\" and love.I faulted Pride and Prejudice and Zombies for its dark tone. There are still occasional violent lines in its prequel: \"dip me in honey and stake me to an anthill\". Yet for the most part, Hockensmith injects a lighter tone into Dawn of the Dreadfuls. I believe his dedication: \"To Jane, we kid because we love.\" Although sometimes the tongue-in-cheek humor is overdone, it saves the book from slipping into the dark side. So does his betrayal of the Bennet girls. They are innocent children and I grew fond of the less frivilous-gossipy older siblings. True, as their tale progresses, I glimpsed signs of the hardening process. I understand to a certain extent why Elizabeth becomes almost as heartless when an adult as the zombies she tries to kill. Yet in her youth, I see her mostly as heartbroken and sympathetic.Hockenmith's failings are minor. In the first few chapters, no valid reason is given for why one Bennet girl is picked over another for battle. Although Dawn of the Dreadfuls is mostly told from an omniscient viewpoint focused on the Bennets, some chapters take us into the head of Lord Lumpley. Again, this seems like a random choice. And sorry, but the ninjas and Eastern references still don't seem to fit.Otherwise, Dawn of the Dreadfuls is a remarkable achievement. Hockensmith has written in the spirit of Austen, yet without her words. I can't wait to read the final installment!"}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124284-misty", "userReview": "In Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, we witnessed one of literature's favorite heroines, Elizabeth Bennet, fall in love while fighting valiantly against the zombie menace that had overtaken England. Now, in this lively prequel, PPZ: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, learn how the hoardes of unmentionables became said menace, and lively Lizzie found herself becoming one the British Isles foremost warrior-maidens.There are going to be some of you reading this review who are going to be surprised that I decided to read this. You may recall from my review of Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies that I was, shall we say, less than pleased. You're thinking, 'Why would she even bother if she didn't like the first one?' It's simple: Dawn of the Dreadfuls has a different author. It was a risk I was willing to take.It was worth it.PPZ: Dawn of the Dreadfuls blew the socks off the first book. Now, Steven Hockensmith did have some advantages in that writing a prequel was a bit more of a clean slate; though he did have to remain faithful to the world and characters created, he did not have to try to work his words into those of another and make it seamless. That's not to say he had an easy task. He still had to mimic Austen's writing, create a believable prequel that could plausibly lead up to both the original text and Grahame-Smith's altered one, and he still had to find a way to strike a balance between Regency-era novel and zombie romper. I think he did admirably on all counts.In PPZ: DOD we get to watch as the dreadful plague, thought vanquished for years, returns to England. The Bennet girls find themselves in a peculiar situation, as their father intends them to learn the ways of the warrior, whilst their mother (and society) wishes them to go to balls and marry well. Young teens all, they've never been faced with the zombie menace -- or the handsome, red-coated officers who come to Meryton to battle them. The resulting mash-up of their experiences -- learning how to wield battleaxes and practice the Pouncing Panther and remain demure, proper English ladies at the same time -- makes for exactly the type of story Quirk Books is trying to present: fun parodies of literature's Greats that hit the mark without being condescending, insipid, or utterly ridiculous.The best compliment I can give Hockensmith is that there were times, in the midst of the ridiculous Regency zombieness, that it felt like Jane Austen could have written it. Nearly all of the things I didn't like in the first book were well done in this prequel. Unlike G-S, Hockensmith captured her tone and liveliness and humor well, and he remained faithful to the characters and world she created. Lizzie is both the sharp girl of Austen's classic, and the budding fierce warrior of Grahame-Smith's parody. Her sister, Jane, is as charming and sweet-natured as ever, and Mrs. Bennet is ever anxious that her daughters marry well before someone fall victim to the unmentionables and leave them all ruined. He kept their characters and personalities intact, while skewing the story just enough to make their actions still make sense in much-altered circumstances.All told, there's a little something for everyone: fans of Jane will find a fun twist on her work, and a real effort to stay true to her and her language, with little surprises planted for those familiar with her most famous work; fans of zombies will find brain-munching dreadfuls in abundance; fans of romance will find some romantic plot twists and general funness; fans of strong female characters will certainly love Elizabeth. If you didn't like the first one, I think you'll like this. If you did like the first one, I think you'll like this more. And if you've been unsure of whether to try one of these lit parodies that's suddenly all the rage, I think this is a good place to start. I would recommend getting your hands on a copy in time for Helluva Halloween II...(yeah, it's coming)."}, {"userName": "Sheila Majczan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29962439-sheila-majczan", "userReview": "3.5 starsAs one review stated you have to read this as a tongue in cheek farcical take-off of Pride and Prejudice. I was smiling at the nonsensical action all the way through. This is not my usual fare in reading although I have read hundreds of Jane Austen Fan Fiction books and P&P is my favorite variation. But it is almost unthought-of for me to read of fantasy creatures in connection with these romances. Books about Vampires, Werewolves, Sea Creatures, and Zombies belong on other book shelves in my opinion.However when I learned that a movie is being released in February of 2016 titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (from the sequel to this book) the thought of reading the novel began to rattle around in my brain. I then learned from a friend, Claudine, that there was both a prequel and a sequel. So I finally decided to dive in.I don\u2019t want to relate too much of the story although I can\u2019t really say that there was much mystery involved. Language from canon is used on various pages but rarely as in canon. The characters are few of those with which we are familiar: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and 5 daughters, Charlotte, Mrs. Long and Mrs. Hill and the setting is Hertfordshire with Meryton, Longbourn and Netherfield. We have 3 men posturing for 2 of the sisters. But nowhere to be found in this book are the Bingleys or the Darcys or even Colonel Fitzwilliam. There is, however, a mention of Lady Catherine and her role is a surprise. The undead/THE DREADFULS enter upon this tale immediately as we read of a funeral service during the which the corpse stirs from his casket. His wife is all happiness as she believes he was NOT dead and that a mistake has been made and she wants to embrace him. We learn here that a plague of the Dreadfuls occurred a number of years back and that Mr. Bennet was one of the successful warriors against that incursion, BUT he has failed in his oath\u2026he has not reared his daughters to be warriors! Enter one Master Hawksworth, trained in the oriental martial arts, he wastes no time taking over a garden shed to use as a training center, a dojo, and ALL the Bennet girls are soon under his command. As this action evolves we read of a ripple in the connection between a Master and one of his students. But as we read of how he holds her in esteem we also learn of a secret he holds concerning his own abilities.Close behind the Master enters into Hertfordshire a Dr. Keckilpenny who seeks to use science to turn these savage undead creatures back into the English gentlemen and ladies on which the British Empire is founded. He too sees Miss Elizabeth Bennet as an asset to help him seek his goal. Meanwhile in Netherfield lurks a different type of monster. One who is not a fantasy creature, but nevertheless one who preys on the innocents and then makes sure they don\u2019t get in his way. Lord Lumpley is no Charles Bingley but he does admire the beautiful and demure Jane Bingley.So can I recommend this book? I would say that if you plan to see the movie that you might want to read the books which are the source of that. But if you are looking for the romance for which P&P is so well loved, you may be disappointed. However I say that having only read this prequel and the first several chapters of the main book. Those chapters seem to follow canon very closely\u2026except for a disruption at the Meryton Assembly. Poor Mrs. Long: she will never be able to gossip about how Mr. Darcy sat next to her for all of a half of an hour without speaking one word to her!"}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810111-alyssa", "userReview": "\"Half the soldiers whirled away to do as he asked, desperate for any excuse to put distance between themselves and the unmentionable about to sprout like some ghastly flower. The other half simply stared with their mouths agape.\" (p. 175)The hamlet of Meryton has been in a state of peace for years since The Troubles. It seems an ordinary day for an ordinary funeral where most of the town is in attendance. Suddenly, the dearly departed is no longer at rest and sits upright during his own funeral. The congregation is shocked, yet unsure of what to make of the scene before them. Mr. Bennet, however, realizes before anyone else what is happening. Having fought during The Troubles himself, he recognizes that Mr. Ford has become one of the sorry stricken. As the church empties of frightened mourners, Mr. Bennet calls upon his daughters to help him with the corpse of the former town apothecary. Thus begins the return of the dreadfuls to Hertfordshire. Mr. Bennet spares no time in beginning the training in the deadly arts for his five daughters. He sends word to the military and to his former Masters informing them of the zombies as well as asking for assistance. Soon a Master Hawksworth comes to Meryton to aid in the Bennet girls' training. As Elizabeth and her sisters accomplish their training and slay the sorry stricken, it is clear that more dreadfuls are coming. Elizabeth learns the ways of a warrior all while contemplating her feelings for her Master and the new Dr. Keckilpenny who believes he can stop the zombies by examining them. The Bennets prepare for war against the walking dead and for the ball; because in regency England, there will always be a ball.Dawn of the Dreadfuls is set to take place about five years before we meet the Bennets in Pride and Prejudice. To enjoy this read, one cannot be an Austen purist. There is no continuity pertaining to Pride and Prejudice, nor Pride and Prejudice and Zombies for that matter. I chose to view it as the Bennet family has been plucked from the pages of the classic and placed into a zombie novel during regency England. The characteristics of each member of the Bennet family largely hold true, this story is far from providing plausible history of Lizzy and her family. One point that bothered me was Mr. Bennet's attitude toward Mrs. Bennet. Yes, Mrs. Bennet is annoying and Mr. Bennet remarks on it in his dry humor, but Austen always had affection hidden under his words, in my opinion. This Mr. Bennet seems too cruel, though passionate about his daughters especially Lizzy and Jane. When I started Dawn of the Dreadfuls, I assumed it would be a true prequel to the first story by Seth Grahame-Smith. I could not find hardly any continuity between the two. There is no mention of the girls going to China to learn the deadly arts. The readers are only informed that Mr. Bennet did study in China. Having won this book through First Reads giveaways, the book was accompanied by a poster of the cover. I must say that it was my favorite part of the package. It was a fun read, but not a favorite of mine. The creepily elegant poster of the young girl with bloodied hands and mouth proudly hangs in my apartment. =)"}, {"userName": "CJ - It's only a Paper Moon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1357098-cj---it-s-only-a-paper-moon", "userReview": "Ok, surprisingly, this was pretty good. I didn't know how I was going to feel reading a prequel of P&P without the angst of Darcy and Lizzy but I found that with a good enough premise, an already existing solid novel and the character development that even Ms. Austen would appreciate, I could get over not seeing Darcy.This book begins with Lizzy about to \"come out\" to the ton and the Bennett's are all assembled for a funeral for one of their neighbors. It starts off with Mr. Bennett's POV and I never thought I would like the man more than I did when I read the original novel, but the long-suffering, slightly negligent father has his  reasons  as we see as the book progresses.Anyhoo, the monotony of a funeral is broken by the deceased making the grave miscalculation of etiquette of coming back to life and trying to eat people. Well, Mr. Bennett decides to take advantage of this situation by correcting a mistake he long ago made - allowing his daughters to live the life of privileged women as opposed to warriors as he had sworn long ago.Well, upon seeing the 'dreadful', he realizes two things. One, the plague that affected England not so long ago, is back. Two, his daughters seriously need an education on how to be warriors.Enter the \"Master\". About 18 and solidly trained, he becomes the Sensei to both Mr. Bennett (because it is apparent that he has forgotten his training) and the young ladies. It wouldn't be an Austen mash-up without the hint of romance. And who do you thing the Master has an eye for?As a foil, please enter Doctor K. The exact opposite of brute force, the Doctor is a thinker and he hopes to tame the zombies so that he can learn from them and turn the plague away by re-civilizing the undead.While all this is happening, the dead are rising from their graves, Mrs. Bennett is trying to get Jane married to a notorious letch and oh and let's not forget that Lizzy  still  has not come out yet and frankly with the girls taking up swords, nobody wants anything to do with them.Until they find that they have need for the 'poor crazy' Bennett girls.This is the prequel for P&P and Zombies and it is a good prologue to the series (if there's a series, I don't know but I'd like to see Lizzy and Darcy's marriage while kicking zombie ass). It explains a lot about Mr. Bennett, the girls and the Dreadful plague that so infected England in the P&P/Zombies book.While it's weird to not hear of hind nor hair of Bingley and Darcy, this book is simply not about them. While the book does veer off to different POV's (all entertaining), the book is about Elizabeth and her journey from naive young woman to strong capable warrior woman.It's funnier than PPZ and is has more illustrations and simply put, it's entertaining.

So when I heard that a prequel to PPZ was being released I was excited. I mean, finally, we get to learn all about how Elizabeth Bennet and her sisters got their awesome fighting skills. I got a copy of Dawn of the Dreadfuls through Quirk Books. I actually enjoyed this book more than PPZ; Hockensmith has created some great tongue-in-cheek characters and the book was very well done!This book follows the Bennet family as they discover the first dreadful rising (out of a coffin at a funeral), through training the Bennet girls receive, to the inevitable massive zombie attack.Hockensmith did a great job in keeping the tone of the story similar to PPZ. Mrs. Bennet was definitely the Mrs. Bennet from PPZ and Jane and Elizabeth also maintained their character very well. I thought the story actually flowed much better than PPZ; probably because Hockensmith got to control the storyline this time and could match it to the characters better. Hockensmith has created some fabulous character additions. Master Hawksworh (the Bennet's instructor in the deadly arts) and Dr. Keckilpenny (a doctor who seeks to cure the dreadful affliction) are a lot of fun. The fighting scenes are well done and more inclusive than in PPZ, again I think that being able to incorporate the action scenes fully into his own story helped Hockingsmith out on this one. The plot takes some interesting twists and turns towards the end of the story which I really enjoyed.My only complaint would be at times the characters are a little bit over the top. This is a small complaint. I know these over-the-top characters are there for humor, and many times, they are very funny. At times though it goes a bit over-board and feels forced. The dialogue is witty and entertaining enough all on its own; it didn't need any more than that to be funny.Overall I liked this book even better than PPZ. It was entertaining, engaging, and had me chuckling a number of times. Hockensmith did a good job staying true to the main characters nature, even if the additional characters sometimes went a bit over-the-top with their actions."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349906-marlene", "userReview": "DAWN OF THE DREADFULS is the prequel to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES and takes place when Elizabeth is sixteen.

The break-out best seller of 2009 (and soon to be major motion picture staring Natalie Portman) took the publishing industry quite unawares making its co-author Seth Grahame-Smith a hot property, oodles of publicity for its publisher Quirk Books and mega moola for all involved. Who\u2019da thought combining Jane Austen\u2019s genteel Regency-era novel and bone-crunching zombie mayhem would create the literary mash-up genre and spawn a plethora of knock-offs using Austen novels and other classic authors in an attempt to cash in on the craze. I will admit the original novel was fresh and funny but the publicity it received was way out of proportion to its merits. Now its prequel Dawn of the Dreadfuls has risen from its grave placing the story four years before we first met Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy and the maraudring horde of unmentionables invading Meryton, Hertfordshire. Well \u2014 of course we need to know how the plague began and why the Bennet sisters are trained ninja warriors battling the sorry stricken. *Ahem*While attending the funeral of a neighbor, Mr. Oscar Bennet, his wife and five young daughters witness the corpse return from the dead and attempt to attack the congregation. The unmentionables have returned after being vanquished for several years and Mr. Bennet a former ninja zombie slayer must train his daughters in the deadly arts to defend themselves and exterminate the scourge of sorry stricken who are among them again.

Along the way we are dished out a hefty dose of campy comedy, discover how dreadfuls sprout from the grave and witness enough rotten flesh, goo, gore and killing to appease any thirteen year old boy who hates to read. La!The plot is \u201cstoopid\u201d but it is meant to be. This is a zombie book with Jane Austen characters in it, not a Jane Austen novel with zombies mashed into it as we previously experienced in P&P&Z. (no defense implied) On the upside, Hockensmith does get many of Austen\u2019s character traits correct: Mrs. Bennet wines, wails and waves her lace hankie, Jane Bennet is beautiful and biddable, Mary is blossoming into an inspid moralizer, Kitty coughs and follows Lydia\u2019s lead, and Lydia is the most precocious eleven year old going on twenty five that you could ever wish to meet. Our heroine in the making Elizabeth is spirited, intelligent and as fierce with her tongue as she is with her weapons. We do get more back story on why Mr. Bennet takes action and converts his daughters from genteel young ladies into ninja warriors. His character is the most altered from Austen\u2019s original negligent father who lives in his library in order to tolerate his harpy wife and that was a challenge for me, among other things.The new characters add animation (in the cartoonish sense) to the narrative and are all caricatures atypical in a wacky Monte Python skit: Lord Lumpley the lascivious aristocrat who lusts after beautiful Jane Bennet, the mutton chopped Capt Cannon who has survived multiple amputations from battling unmentionables and must be transported about in a wheelbarrow assisted by his aids who act as his limbs, Dr. Bertram Keckilpenny the eccentric doctor/Sherlock Holmes who wants to study zombies so he can cure the \u201cunmentionable plague\u201d, the handsome ninja Master Jeffrey Hawksworth who teaches the Bennet girls the deadly arts and falls for his best student Elizabeth, dashing Lieutenant Tindall who ignites Lydia and Kitty\u2019s passions for officers in red uniforms and many more. (unfortunately no lumberjacks) The downside, it is all pretty predictable fare. However, I will commend Hockensmith on his skilled wordsmanship and cleverly crafted prose. He has captured the flavor of Austen\u2019s novel with Regency-era words and phrases that are not too dense and intimidating for his target audience who complained that P&P&Z had too much Austen in it, and he has certainly squelched their objections to not having enough zombie action. I found that reading this novel made my head hurt after an accident so I listened to an audiobook recording read by Katherine Kellgren which made it much more palatable \u2014 except for the girls shrieking warrior cries which startled my cats and interrupted my knitting. If movie producers like P&P&Z, they will love the easily adapted plot of DOTD into animated movie.Did I like it you ask? Well, sort of. As previously highlighted the author is an accomplished writer who gave it his all. Some of the inside P&P humor made me chortle. If you love zombie grossness, than I recommend it highly. If you love Jane Austen, \u201cI am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety.\u201dLaurel Ann, Austenprose"}, {"userName": "Malarie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12783418-malarie", "userReview": "I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of this book.

If you don't like zombie books where the zombies are of the hoarding, mindless brain-eater variety, then you probably won't like Dawn of the Dreadfuls.If, however, those sorts of zombie stories appeal to you and you don't mind inserting a little zombie slaying into Austen's classic, then you should definitely seek out a copy of this book!Funny and fun timesThis is kind of a strange mash up, but I thought it worked pretty well. There's just something about combining the \"proper\" civility and over the top husband hunting of Pride and Prejudice with the decidedly improper brain-seeking zombie that I find amusing. When Mr. Bennett is trying to drive home the importance of an impending apocalypse due to the rapidly spreading zombie infestation and Mrs. Bennett is simultaneously worrying about finding eligible bachelors to throw her daughters at, well, I giggle.That's pretty much the strength of the book for me. It's just all so absurd and over the top, but it never once tries to take itself seriously. Even the humor seems to be of the level of a really bad pun that is hilarious precisely because it is so horribly bad, and it knows it. I was never really laughing out loud, but I did smirk through most of it.The action is steady, not quite as brisk as I would normally like, but never slow. Short chapters also helped to move things along. The zombies were more amusing than scary, though there were a number of pretty gross images. Think typical zombie gore with rotting flesh and easily detached appendages. The final showdown at the end was the highlight of the book for me and the only part that really got my pulse pounding. Up until that point the zombie threat didn't seem all that threatening, but that climax really had me wondering if our heroes were going to make it out alive or if everyone was going to die (even though, yeah, obviously everyone doesn't die given this is a prequel. But it still felt like it was possible).Is there really a story here?One of the biggest things I wondered when I picked up this book was if it would actually have a plot that could stand on its own beyond the gimmick of inserting zombies into a classic. The fact that it was a prequel worried me even more. I'm happy to say that Dawn of the Dreadfuls is fully able to stand on its own with a solid and original storyline that kept me entertained throughout. While the girls do learn how to slay zombies like the blurb says, the plot revolves around a lot more than just watching them practice swinging a sword. Original characters help flesh out the cast and provide romantic interests, antagonists, and comedic relief. None of the characters, even the Austen-created characters, were very fleshed out (I'm sure there's a pun in there somewhere), but I really wasn't expecting much depth of character anyway. The Austen originals behaved pretty well in line with the Pride and Prejudice versions.Bottom lineThis was more fun than horror, and is best approached with mild expectations. It wasn't my favorite book ever, it didn't change my world, and it won't stay with me for years and years. But I'm glad I read it. I had fun and I would read the rest of the series (though I'm less interested in the one with Jane Austen's text and the other author. Steve Hockensmith is a big draw for me and I enjoyed his book \nHolmes on the Range\n even more than this one). Recommended if you're looking for something light and fun with zombie slaying.

It's not exactly the start of the zombie troubles, as people have been off fighting long before this, but it is the Bennett girls' introduction to the undead and to their ku fung training or whatever the hell that was meant to be. There's the usual zombie beheadings, seige and final stand that you'd expect of zombie fare. Because the follow on book came out first, and far more importantly because everyone knows what happens in Pride and Prejudice, it's easy enough to work out who is going to survive, and which couples are not going to make it.It's meant to be a comedy horror and a bit of a send up, so it works ok on that respect. Personally I find the whole kung fu element a bit stupid and tedious, but I suppose this had to be included as it is in the second book. Surprisingly for a zombie book, there are all rather dull stretches, especially in the first half of the book.It's comedy and it's light reading so you've got to take it for what it is. But I said it with the Pride and Prejudice one, and I'll say it with this. I think it could have been SO much better if it had been done seriously. The voice of Jane Austen really isn't here. In the other one, because the guy had the original text to pilfer, he could lean heavily on that. With this, it's relying on imagination, but the dialogue and so forth really isn't convincing Austen - probably doesn't matter so much as it's meant to be a comedy. But my main thing is that if this had been the start of the zombie apocalypse proper, it would have been fascinating to experience this in Regency England and to see how society would or wouldn't have coped with it. This is a time when the social hierarchy essentially made some people lesser humans; women weren't considered capable of much; and many subjects simply weren't spoken of. There were many unmentionables. How on earth would this world have reacted to a zombie stumbling through a churchyard and eating someone? Now that's a book I'd really love to read."}, {"userName": "Peggy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/275001-peggy", "userReview": "This review originally appeared at RevolutionSF.com: \u201cAnd if you preserve genteel English womanhood while  serving up genteel English women as so much steak  tartare, I would say that you have most definitely lost.\"Dawn of the Dreadfuls is technically a prequel to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, giving us the story of how the Bennett family came to be the people we met therein. It gives us the first return of the unmentionables to Meryton, and the beginnings of the ly martial arts training of the Bennett s. We also get hints of romance, with two suitors each for Jane and Elizabeth.Hockensmith does an excellent job creating younger, more versions of the Bennett s and he does equally well in showing their growth. We meet a young Elizabeth Bennett who's still smart and feisty, but who is much more open to romance than she would later become. And we see the hopes and disappointments that lead to her mistrust in love. We learn more of Mr. Bennett and the first invasion of the unmentionables, and we even get to see a new side of the impossible Mrs. Bennett. But Hockensmith is especially adept at creating the foppish, stupid, arrogant, and downright evil people who look down on the Bennett's, especially Elizabeth.Who knew just how satisfying it would be to see all of those stuck-up, classist, horrible, horrible people eaten by zombies? I know my high school English classes would have been a lot more fun (and more people would have paid attention) with a judicious application of zombies. If Hockensmith can figure out a way to off Heathcliff and Catherine in this same delightfully gross way, I might just ask him to marry me.The writing style is just as -on as in the first book, so if it gave you troubles there, it's likely to do so again. But the rewards of the story itself are worth the effort.If you liked Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by all means give this one a look. But even if you didn't read it, even if you never read Jane Austen in your life, if you like your stories full of action, romance and a dark sense of humor, you'll still enjoy this tale of love and zombies."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12647941-rebecca", "userReview": "\"Journey Back to Regency England - Land of the Undead\".\nNow, I know A LOT of people despise when someone comes along and re-writes a classic tale with a bit of a twist to it, but me? I absolutely love it! And re-writing it with zombies just makes this book that little bit more awesome! So, you have the same characters, they all have the same personalities, the same traits, Mrs Bennet strictly focused on finding rich husbands for her daughters, Mr Bennet ignoring the majority of what comes out of his wife's mouth, Lydia and Kitty giggling constantly, Mary in a world of her own, the beautiful Jane seeing the goodness within everybody, even if there is no goodness to be seen in the first place, and then my favourite of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth Bennet, who has the skill of a warrior, the wildest battle cry and is usually found kicking zombie ass ;)The Bennet sisters are introduced to Master Hawksworth, a master of the deadly arts, and who is to teach and train the girls the techniques and tricks to overcoming the \n'Unmentionables\n. One by one, the girls make progress with their learning and are soon putting their skills to the test, face to face with the ZOMBIES themselves. As well as meeting some fantastic characters along the way, the girls are sent on their way to save their family home and the countryside that they live in. With the undead making their way up from underneath the ground, will the Bennet sisters be able to keep it all under control? Fantastic book!

I loved PPZ and was very excited to read the prequel. Steve Hockensmith did an amazing job of envisioning the rise of the Bennet girls as zombie fighters.I was expecting something a little different when I first started Dawn of the Dreadfuls. I was misled by the title. I thought this prequel would be focusing on the first occurrence of the zombie menace, perhaps with an explanation as to why the zombies had risen. Instead, Dawn of the Dreadfuls focused on how the Bennet's shifted from the family Jane Austen envisioned to the one Seth Graham-Smith wrote about in PPZ. As much as I love zombie creation stories, I never once was disappointed by the route Hockensmith took.In Dawn of the Dreadfuls, the characters stay true to both PP and PPZ. They begin just as Jane Ausen originally wrote them and continued on a great path leading to the girls we know from PPZ. I loved seeing Mr. Bennet in a large capacity than previously seen. His standing up to his wife and training his daughters in the deadly arts was wonderful.I also loved two of the new characters introduced in Dawn of the Dreadfuls - Master Hawksworth, the girls deadly arts teacher, and Dr. Keckilpenny, a academic taking the scientific approach against the zombies. Another great addition was Captain Cannon, a limbless army man who used to date Mrs. Bennet. He provided great comedy throughout the book.Dawn of the Dreadfuls is an wonderful and very funny account of the Bennet girl's path to infamy. If you liked Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, you won't want to miss Dawn of the Dreadfuls."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "Elizabeth Bennet and her sisters don\u2019t have a care in the world, other than finding good husbands to marry.

He also joins the fight against the undead but his ways are more unorthodox. Dr. Keckilpenny believes he can interact with the undead versus killing them. Elizabeth feels something for both men but who will she choose?If you are looking for something a bit different to read, then you might try Dawn of the Dreadfuls. This book is the prequel to Price and Prejudice and Zombies. This book is based on events four years prior to PPZ. I have never read PPZ so I have nothing to compare it to in regards to if this book was a good prequel or not. What I can say about this book is that I thought it was an interesting morbid twist to Jane Austen\u2019s P&P novel. If you are looking for a romantic, flowerily read then this is not the book for you but if you are looking for a dark, and sometimes gruesome zombie story then you should consider trying Dawn of the Dreadfuls. I enjoyed reading about Elizabeth and her sisters training to be zombie slayers. It was fun to watch as they went from meek to full blown slayers, who were not afraid to slice a head or two off. As much as I did like this book, there were a few times when it got a bit dry.
