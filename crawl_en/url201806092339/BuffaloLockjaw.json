Usually when I read, I don't want to be conscious of phrasing or paragraph construction or themes; I don't want to see the underpinnings. I just want to read what happens next. But with a few authors, Steinbeck, Stegner, Krakauer, Vonnegut, I am so startled by moments of brilliance that I have to take a break to applaud and honor the craft. This book had many of those moments for me, from the relationships between characters, the fullness of James' character (what a tender jerk), the vignettes of Buffalonians, the insights tucked into the narrative that felt like being gently slapped with a wet branch on a rigorous hike through the woods, refreshing and a delight to experience."}, {"userName": "Cyndi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9864-cyndi", "userReview": "Sad, bleak and often beautiful...just like the city it's named for."}, {"userName": "J.A.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1049480-j-a", "userReview": "The third and final of my pre-Winter Institute reads (since WI4 has already commenced), Buffalo Lockjaw by Greg Ames will be available in April. In some regard this novel is a fusion of two previously reviewed works, Downtown Owl by Chuck Klosterman and Stalking Irish Madness by Patrick Tracey. Ames delivers biting humor and a frost-bitten terrain like Klosterman, while the alcoholism and a family struggling with a mother\u2019s mental illness is compatible to Tracey\u2019s own experience. Beyond my reading experience, I was also able to relate to the long-suffering fans of the Buffalo Bills. I was a Bills fan through all four of the consecutive heart-breaking Super Bowl losses and the shocking playoff loss known as the \u201cMusic City Miracle.\u201d Even more heart-breaking and shocking to me was the team\u2019s outright release of Hall of Famers Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, and Thurman Thomas during that off-season. That was the final indignity I suffered as a Bills fan. On a personal level my mother has been an registered nurse for going on 30 years, like the narrator\u2019s, but thankfully she is not suffering from a debilitating mental illness. I echo the narrator\u2019s sentiment of \u201cGive me a good RN over a fireman or a police officer any day.\u201dThe narrator, a recovering addict and copywriter for greeting cards, returns to Buffalo to spend Thanksgiving with his stoic father, his Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted mother, his sister and her girlfriend. As a nurse his mother supported assisted suicide for terminal patients, and now he\u2019s coming home to grant the final wish she is no longer capable of expressing. All he needs to do is avoid old acquaintances and stay sober long enough to screw up the courage to do something with his life, beginning with ending her\u2019s. It\u2019s never that simple in Buffalo!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth K.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k", "userReview": "I'm always eager to read novels set in Buffalo, and then really hyper-critical of them after. The narrator, James, is one of those guys in his late 20s with a job that he hates who lives in Brooklyn, and returns to his hometown (Buffalo) to visit his mother who is living in a nursing home with early onset Alzheimer's. His father is in the process of selling the family's home and moving into a smaller apartment, and his sister, the Most Favored Child, is also in town visiting.The family dynamics were done very well. The characters and their relationships really developed nicely over the course of the book. At first, I was a little hesitant about the mother in a nursing home bit, I felt like I've read this story a lot recently. But this was well-managed and I was soon very committed to this aspect of the plot. I was more mixed about the Can't Go Home Again threads of the plot - James's ambivalent attempts to reconnect with his Buffalo friends. There were some points that worked, I loved the writing in the passages that showed James aimlessly driving around town trying to recapture the geography of his past. However, there was something about the handling of these friends that I thought fell flat. They never took shape for me as believable characters, they felt too buffoony and their only purpose seemed to be to set up situations which were intended to be humorous but were far too forced. The difference in tone between the family episodes and James's interactions with his friends is jarring and mismatched. As always, the things that make growing up in Buffalo unique feel too contrived and expository when thrown out there on the page like that. However, I remain faithful that someday I will find the book that manages to succeed in this area."}, {"userName": "Regina Mclaughlin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1181152-regina-mclaughlin", "userReview": "New York City is James Fitzroy's current home, where daily he confronts the gap between his aspirations and his ability. That is, until the native son returns to the Buffalo of his birth. Except, of course, things have changed. Both his parents and home town are dying in a white-out of superfluousness. But expect more than tainted home thoughts from abroad. This is a book that lives with death, testifying for the frail and the faulty, and treating them as equal communicants with the rest of us.While it's fair to say that the Great Buffalonian Novel remains to be written, Greg Ames has certainly taken a heroic stab at it."}, {"userName": "Brent", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9896283-brent", "userReview": "Being a somewhat-recent Canadian transplant in Buffalo, this was a wonderful, almost \"personal,\" read. Ames takes the city of Buffalo and more or less includes it as a character, with all it's buckled charm. Living in Buffalo now, I recognize how much influence goes both ways for border towns and the Canadian-ness comes through more often than not throughout this novel. Ames writes deft and personable dialogue for his patched-up, broken-but-healing cast of characters, helping the reader to care more about these drifters than they realize.

To do that, you have to find a theme - a big theme, that will sustain an entire novel, or a life, without once seeming clunky or contrived or making the whole text one extended metaphor in any way that you've heard it all already. Yeah, who would want to go there? What is it we all avoid? Could that be where the humanity is? Could it? Can we look hard at the City of No Illusions and retain any illusions for ourselves?People give up, you know, fall back, from dreams and accept life in its fullest mediocrity, take pride in that to the point of delusional boosterism, so? But why would you want to go there if given the chance to go somewhere else? Lots of creative types get born here, but they call it their beloved home. They don't stay. Visiting celebrities, filming, say, love it here. Why would they stay? Maybe aging football stars find a place where they can remain a celebrity for the rest of their lives.From the inside, Buffalo seems a place of might-have-beens, if-onlies. Petty politics, advantaging local bigshots, trump vision every time and so we build our perpetual wanna-be flagship university out of town, wipe out our waterfront with highways and dead industrial tracts, and conspire to route traffic around our natural transportation hub. Hell, we even sell our hydro-power down the river, downstate.So, it's in the person of a once-vital Mom, a noted expert in the care of elderly demented patients, who herself becomes a living shell of who she once was, that Buffalo can come alive, in words at least, as something larger than its life. Something about each of our lives, no matter how accomplished, no matter how smug or self-satisfied must remain in the world's capitals of mediocrity. You will find yourself less than you could be and at the same time find the lock-jawed striving in the face of white-out blizzards determination to find in yourself and in your life something still better. Something to make light of. Something to brood about, and mostly long long lists of friends who care for you as you are.This is not the fictional Buffalo. This is the real thing, real places named and authenticated. Real characters. I live here. I know them. I am them. If you want to be judged by your proximity to beauty, to power, to accomplishment, then this is not your place. But you are not those things, and if you are, you won't be for long.If you realize, as did de Kooning in an essay which was for me, the central figure in this novel, \"Content is a Glimpse;\" if you realize that perfect beauty is always only glimpsed, perfect accomplishment, no matter that the glimpse may last an entire performance. I haven't read that essay, but it's title gives a glimpse, right? into its content.In the end, that's all we are to each other, unless we make more of it than that. Unless we commit to stark beginnings and endings. Unless we understand that regret perpetuates the dissected stare, the bloodied guts-revealed loss of what might have been which is the city of Buffalo. Where only a glimpse is required for a father and son to bond, to conspire, to complete life.Our natural disasters merit guffaws. No hurricanes, no oil to spew, just perpetual and powerful Falls. No Superbowl wins, ever, before they will inevitably move to another town more celebrated. More besieged by worse disasters. Ours are merely relentless. And of our very own making, if you'd like to have some excuse to pass us by.But this novel makes of Buffalo what it truly is. A life. Worth living in and by and through. Stark. But not Carol-Oates stark. These are lives moving up, the way you feel when facing the Falls."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/195700-david", "userReview": "This is the best book I\u2019ve read all year. I kind of wish I\u2019d read this in December so that this statement would carry more weight. Alas, it is only January, but I really think that this statement will hold up for the rest of the year. Yes, it\u2019s that good.There is such an obvious love for the hometown that comes out in the writing, coupled with the cold reality of facing a parent\u2019s dementia. It is so well-done and observant (without being too cute or too clever) that it is a pleasure to read.Buffalo Lockjaw\u2019s main character and narrator is James Fitzroy, a near-30 year old who writes verses for a greeting card company in New York. His life, as it is, is probably not the success which all parent\u2019s hope for, or sacrifice their own lives for. He is spending his Thanksgiving break visiting his parents in Buffalo. His mother, Ellen, is 56 years old and is suffering from a crippling dementia: she does not even know who James is anymore. His father is Rodney, who is stern and strong while dealing with his wife\u2019s mental disintegration, but James knows that it is killing him inside. This is a story that for many may hit close to home. James\u2019 love of his hometown, the obvious love that the author has for it, struck a chord with me. I understand what it is like to love something even when it is completely fucked up and in many ways, hard to defend. The fact that James/Ames can find the beauty in Buffalo and its people is one of the most endearing qualities of this book. His parents are unavailable, and for James, seeing his mother, the woman he loves and respects who spent years helping people now in such a helpless position, fuels his desire to try to seek a way out for her.None of this feels phony. Every step of this journey toward middle age, and adulthood feels real, and that is what makes this such a satisfying read. I think any adult with living parents could identify with the perils of trying to relate to them on an mature level, especially the children of this generation (28-35). There is no World War 2 or Great Depression to define what this generation is, but Buffalo Lockjaw seems to suggest that it is more defined by a sort of slouching response to everything. Our occupations are meaningless (Greeting Card writing being a wonderful metaphor and foil for the more serious work of nursing that James\u2019 mother had done), and no one is counting on us to save the world. And if anyone is, God help them.Buffalo Lockjaw is a love story for a hometown and I loved reading it. I look forward to whatever Greg Ames writes next."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158184-stacey", "userReview": "What a wonderful book! I love how BUFFALO LOCKJAW managed to be moving without being overwrought or sappy. I thought the letters from Ellen added a lot of substance to her character but to the book overall, not to mention that they made me misty-eyed on the train. They were perfect--spot-on. We really got to get a better feel for who she was before she got sick. Of course, James' memories peppered throughout the novel helped us understand the kind of person Ellen was and the chapter \"the side effects of mercy\" also revealed her character in an important way. I applaud Greg Ames' ability to write about her deterioration with such deliberateness. Not easy to read but raw and necessary.Because I mostly read stuff by contemporary female writers, I'm not often exposed to the male mind from the male point of view. I was really impressed with the inner workings of an analytical person like James, and I appreciated his uh, assessment (for lack of a better word) of women he meets or is involved with. I thought it was a realistic portrayal of the 28 year-old male mind; it wasn't too much, but it was necessarily present. I almost felt like at times, it helped me understand what men in general are thinking! Perhaps that's going too far, but I've never been one to have very close guy friends, so I haven't been able to pick their brains on various things. I think James is, in many ways, unique as he is, a very universal character and therefore a likable one. He's got flaws and shortcomings and can admit his faults. It's the mark of an intelligent person to note his or her own failings, even if the power to change hasn't been fully realized yet."}, {"userName": "MarySiedman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4413667-marysiedman", "userReview": "Review of Buffalo LockjawMy father was born in Buffalo in 1915, my mother from Aurora in central New York on Cayuga Lake. As a child growing up in Buffalo in the 60's and 70's, I experienced contradictions. I lived in a freezing, harsh environment with a loving, supportive family. Buffalo is a city that was prominent at the turn of the 20th century until the steel and chemical companies that built that prosperity proceeded to contaminate Lake Erie with its industrial waste. When the authorities instituted pollution controls, those industries abandoned Buffalo and its blue collar workers, leaving it in a desperate economic mess. Buffalo Lockjaw is a story which takes place in this declining town. It's about a writer coming to terms with changes in his life, and specifically dealing with his mother's Alzheimers disease. Ames is an amazing writer, vividly depicting his mother's condition so that although she speaks only a few words, she becomes a main character of the book. The book portrays a man devoted to his parents and his family home, his friends and his city.Many of the passages resonated for me, but I was particularly impressed with the ending, which Ames elevates. Some of the most memorable images: The snow looking like rhinos, patting his father's bald head, watching his aunts sitting together under harsh lighting.The writing is absolutely first rate.

Always looking for something new to read, and something to jolt me out of my historical fiction obsession, I ordered it from Amazon and started it the day it arrived.This book has such vivid imagery. Every scene plays out in one's mind like a movie unfolding on the big screen. It's not hard to lose oneself in the novel, as bleak and depressing as it is, as James grapples with the pain of seeing his mother lost to Alzheimer's, of having a distant and chilly relationship with his father, of always coming in second place to his golden-child sister. Even the city itself becomes a character through the vignettes told by the residents interviewed by James in another time. Some reviewers mentioned that the ending is weak, but I believe it's because they're not looking deep enough. Finally James is growing up, becoming a man the way he should have become years ago, realizing that he's screwed up his own life. There's a lot of self-realization throughout the book, and the end is the most poignant. With a simple, \"Who wants coffee?\" he finally begins to put others ahead of himself. I find it to be a positive and uplifting end, but then I've always been an optimist."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730330-tim", "userReview": "\"Buffalo Lockjaw\" is a well-written, enjoyable little book that can mark a nice respite from \"bigger\" reads. Nestle it in between two meatier books you just can't wait to read, and you'll enjoy it fine. In other words, don't be deceived by only three stars; it's on the plus side of being a pretty good read.The basic recipe is one we've seen before: lots of local color and family dynamics weaved into a twenty-something's tale of his former hometown (Buffalo, obviously!) and his slacker friends from the bottom half of society. It made me think of Stephen Jaramillo's \"Going Postal\" for some reason. Ames' prose is tart, occasionally evocative, funny. Yes, \"Buffalo Lockjaw\" often is very funny even as it mixes the pathos of a parent with Alzheimer's and the gut-wrenching decisions of a son who can't stand to see his mother living that way and is determined to do something about it.This is a very fast, though not an empty, read. I knocked this out in two days, which is unusual for me. It's a simple story with real-life problems and a minimum of forced literary props.

Someone else mentioned in a review that it was \"a rewrite of The Corrections\" and I see where they were coming from with that, but I think it matches up more closely to the movie \"Garden State.\" This sounds bad, but I think this book could have been much better. My bigggest issue was the protagonist/narrator. He wasn't all that likeable (though I think he was supposed to be), and while an unlikeable narrator doesn't make a bad book, the fact that he is uninteresting does. The plot of the book isn't overly original, and that in and of itself doesn't make a bad book either, but coupled with the uninteresting and, honestly, overdone \"slacker returns home to deal with family issues and grows up in the process\" type of character, makes the book, at the very least, kind of stale.

All content and opinions are my own.James Fitzroy left Buffalo, his hometown, to make his fortune in New York City. His success has been rather tepid - he writes greeting cards - but his friends and family back in Buffalo believe he\u2019s making it big. Back in Buffalo for Thanksgiving, James is faced with his old friends who seem to be stuck in time, his relatively young mother suffering from dementia in a nursing home, his grieving father selling the family home to pay for medical bills, and his successful absentee sister and her girlfriend. James is tormented by his mother\u2019s fate, especially since she was a nurse in favor of assisted suicide.The protagonist James, is not the most lovable character. In fact, half of the time I hated him and the other half of the time I sort of felt sorry for him. Still, he seemed real. He has flaws. Lots of flaws. But they are real flaws. He\u2019s selfish and makes rather stupid mistakes, but he cares for his family. The characterization of James as a whole was deftly done, though I wish some of the other characters were a little rounder - in particular James\u2019s father and sister.I loved the layers in this book. There is, of course, James\u2019s story as he copes with his hometown over the holidays. And, always, always in the background there is this turmoil over his deteriorating mother and the possibility of assisted suicide. And then there is the decline of Buffalo. I loved the technique the author used of interspersing short oral histories of Buffalo residents with the rest of the story. It added a layer of history and a sort of timelessness that otherwise would have been lacking. Though I loved that Ames tried to intersperse these layers, it felt like there was a little too much going on. A lot of the story lines felt incomplete and underdeveloped.The writing was bleak and masculine. Here\u2019s a sample from the beginning where James talks about his short career as an urban ethnographer:The tone and James\u2019s character tended to keep me removed from the characters and the action, but I still enjoyed the story.

So when I saw it at the dollar store, I snapped it up, not expecting much. First off, I'll say that it doesn't deserve to be at the dollar store with all the religious self-help books and knockoffs of bestsellers. It's a good contemporary literary novel. It reminds me of the books from the literary brat pack in the 80s; the theme of a young person returning home to find he's outgrown his old friends is one that never really gets old for me. The details about Buffalo got a little tedious, although I have to admire the photographic accuracy of them. When he says he and his dad went to a Bob Evans a few miles from the airport, I know which one it is. It probably helps that the book takes place in the years I lived there, so it's exactly like I remember it. When he's remembering the 90s on Elmwood, I can hear a friend telling me how Elmwood in the 2000s wasn't the same and how it used to be, back in the 90s. :-) The oral histories are a lot like that too: I'm not sure they added much other than local color to the story, but they were very real. But what really sold the book to me was the dead-on description of dementia and the nursing home. Greg Ames just NAILED that part. He got it exactly right, down to the smallest detail. The protagonist is completely believable: a little pretentious, drifting along in a job he doesn't mind but doesn't love, exactly at the age when he can see how he failed to appreciate his family when he had the chance. Because of the first-person POV, he can tell the kind of almost-lies that you tell people when you feel like they *could* be true.Of course, that's also the source of my biggest quibble with the book. James never gets impatient with his mom (except early on in her dementia), never seems to get angry about the way she's changed, never has any issues with the nursing-home staff. For a guy who's not particularly nice, he's way too nice about all of that. It seems like he's going to have to make a big decision--whether or not to kill his mom--but when the time comes for him to make that decision, the story fizzles out. His various romantic encounters are much the same. Every time it looks like James is going to have a major turning point, he just kind of walks through it. Other people get to make the big decisions and do the big things. While that's in keeping with his character, it doesn't make a strong story. Basically, the writing is excellent, but the plot is... less so. It could have been a truly amazing first novel, but the meandering plot weakens it. In other words, it's a typical first novel from a really promising writer. :-)"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1730104-meredith", "userReview": "As a native Buffalonian, I was excited to pick up a novel that took place in the City of Good Neighbors. The only other Buffalo-set novel I've read, City of Light, was pretty decent, though with some flaws, but it was historical fiction, taking place during the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. This book is a nearly-contemporary work about a Buffalo expatriot, living in Brooklyn (of course), and which takes place during visits back to his family. You can read a synopsis elsewhere, though. I'll give you my reaction: This book is depressing. And not in the way a Paul Thomas Anderson movie is depressing. Depressing as in I wondered why I was reading it and who the hell did this guy think he is anyway? Honestly, if you are familiar with Buffalo, you'll probably enjoy the references to things like Allentown and Anderson's. Otherwise? The book is more about a 20-something son's internal debate over assisted suicide in the face of his mother's severe dementia. Like many people in Buffalo, he's nominally Catholic. Or at least his family is. Unlike many people in Buffalo (in my opinion), he's a depressed, alcoholic loser and I really got sick of his loser friends. It's a wonder this guy ever moved out of his parents' house, let alone to a place like Brooklyn. No wonder his friends are impressed with him. I fear people will judge Buffalo by this book. You all know the stereotypes. There's lots of chicken wings and snow. The narrator DOES mention at one point that Buffalo has beautiful summers (and honestly, the winters aren't THAT cold), but I think that message is lost in his depressed self-pity. Buffalo is a lovely, vibrant city, made up of many different kinds of people. Buffalonians are extremely nice, and many are successful. Perhaps we bond over the failure of our sports teams, our rust belt status and snowy perception of outsiders. Not everyone is stuck in a perpetual adolescence, or unemployed, as this book would have you believe. You don't have to grow up and move elsewhere to be popular, successful and tanned. I can think of many cities with a much seedier underbelly than Buffalo. I hope the main character/narrator, James, wasn't THAT autobiographical, because he seems a very unlikeable person in several ways. I had much more sympathy for his family members. Especially if they had to deal with being related to someone with such a woe-is-me attitude. From always playing second fiddle to his sister, to not being able to find and commit to a girlfriend... it got old. It does have a theme of homecoming, transience, and changing family dynamics, which many will identify with (including me, since I live in Los Angeles). But really, it's mostly about Alzheimer's. Take that as you will."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086844-kyle", "userReview": "Ames straddles the micro and macro themes of his first novel fairly well. That being said, the story features some of the common issues present in many debut novels.First, the \"b\" story is lacking and seems foisted upon the plot at times, awkward and jaunty in places. As a stand alone, the b story isn't bad. But, in the shadow of a heavy and broad question (that of euthanasia, home, and responsibility) the narrator become a sketch of Sal Paradise/Holden Caulfield at these points. He's considering the complexities of youth and hedonism when he's facing a situation that is far more important and gray. That technique could work as characterization, effectively rounding out James, but he seems whiney and a navel gazer instead.Second, a lot of Goodreads reviews have complained about the characterization of Buffalo. Relax everyone. Ames doesn't hate Buffalo. Quite the contrary. Ames seems to have fallen into the \"this old car/house\" trope. It's that odd phenomenon in which a person blasts his hometown (though Ames is hardly taking shots) from a place of dirty pride. \"This place is a shithole, but it's my shithole.\" Every small city is like this. There's beauty in the dirt and ugliness in the pristine. Now that that's out of the way, consider the role Buffalo plays in the story. It plays huge in the small vignettes between chapters. Snow and weather play a part, but the fact remains that the story is hardly about Buffalo. It could have easily taken place in Milwaukee or Pittsburgh or Cleveland. I get the impression that Buffalo was there more for Ames than the reader, which is totally fine. Steinbeck wrote masterpiece that effectively shit all over a place he loved that didn't need to be the setting (Salinas Valley in East of Eden if anyone's wondering).Overall, I think Ames has moments of profundity and cynical appreciation. There's a genuine struggle between youth and aging responsibility that resonates. His style is certainly effective and the voice of his narrator jumps off the page. Buffalo Lockjaw is by no means an instant classic, but it's a promising start for a young writer. I'd gladly read another novel by him with the expectation that he pushes his style outside of an obvious comfort zone and challenges readers with new perspectives. I think Buffalo Lockjaw doesn't quite reach 4 star levels, but it's certainly a solid 3 that showcases brilliant moments and gains momentum as it goes."}, {"userName": "Catherine Siemann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2123931-catherine-siemann", "userReview": "James is an aimless Brooklyn hipster, writing greeting cards for a living and not quite connecting in relationships. In the course of a visit home to Buffalo, to visit his mother, in a nursing home with premature senility, he has to face up to uncomfortable truths about himself, about his mother's loss of self, and his realization of how much he's lost in her.I'm not sure I would have loved this book quite as much as I did if I didn't have aging parents just outside of Buffalo; it pressed a lot of buttons about the immanence of loss in that particular landscape. (One of my parents, in particular, is in the midst of a long slow fade, though physical rather than mental, and at a much later age.) Unlike Ames and his narrator, I grew up elsewhere, and only know the city itself well enough to have flashes of recognition, but those made the narrative very real for me. (At one point, for example, he reprints the letter his mother wrote in resignation to her chair at UB's nursing school; I believe that is the real first name of the real person in the position, who is a friend of my family's . . . )Jim is a typical twenty-something screwup; he's not an unusual character, and that sort can border on tediousness. But the dysfunctions he chronicles are connected to his environment, the economic disarray and the balance between the desire to stay close to family and friends vs. the desire to escape to more opportunities or warmer weather. I'd never heard that \"Buffalo lockjaw\" was a thing, but it makes sense with the people I've come to know there. And I laughed at the condescension of James's NYC coworkers and cabdrivers -- I've had that conversation many times myself. Aside from his own mistakes, he spends a lot of time considering assisted suicide and whether his mother, who'd written extensively on the topic but left no instructions relating to her own case, would want that. This is a tough subject, and James reacts in, I think, a very human way, endlessly turning it over in his mind.This is a good book, but it really hit me where I live (or, er, where my parents live), so for me, it was even more."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25964310-maureen", "userReview": "I'd give this 3 stars.

I enjoyed it a lot, and honestly I think (for me) it resides closer in the 3.5/4 star range, but for some reason, I can't quite give it four stars...The good: it's the most accurate description of Buffalo I've ever read. As someone who grew up there and escaped at 17, it's pretty accurate of both what I remember and how I've come to view the city: dead, dying, bleeding jobs and hope, but with a certain sense of resilience. Buffalonians hate their city, but somehow a good chunk of them always end up coming back to it, no matter how hard they try to stay away. It's a magnetic sinkhole in some ways, but you still love it. There are some cities you can unabashedly love or hate, but Buffalo resides in a complex, murky area. So A++ for the descriptions of the city.As for James, though... I wasn't quite sure how to feel about him. When I finished the book, I had a moment of, \"So what? So why bother telling this story?\" Losing a parent to dementia is certainly no walk in the park, and of course I felt bad for his mother, but I couldn't quite figure out why we were hearing from this guy, especially when he has so many conflicted feelings about his mother's disease and then doesn't quite act upon them. I suppose I wanted a more defined character arc for him: that maybe his mother's illness would pull him out of alcoholism/push him back further, that he'd meet someone and they'd change his outlook on his mother or maybe he'd dump them to spend more time with his family, perhaps more resolution with his father. Real life is ambivalent, I understand that. We are not given plots to live by. BUT. This is a novel. I like my novels to have stories and purposes, and I'm not quite sure this book satisfied that craving as much as I wanted it to.A note on the prose: solid throughout, with good mastery of voice for the chapters where we get interviews with Buffalo locals. I don't regret reading this book but I remain a bit puzzled by it."}, {"userName": "Kim D", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2146184-kim-d", "userReview": "Full disclosure - I am from Buffalo and hopefully my love of this city doesn't color my review to badly. I read this a few years ago and was cleaning out my bookcase so I thought I would share my thoughts.James lives in NYC and comes home to Buffalo to finally set his mother free of her current suffering. She has Alzheimers and had begged him to help her end her life. James writes greeting cards for a living and does not love his job and he has no real substantial relationships in NYC. Thus begins his trip back home.He comes home to find that dad is wallowing and sad, his old friends that are still in town are still doing the same thing and that it's cold and snowy. This could be Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Syracuse - wherever, but I am glad this author chose Buffalo.It was fun to hear him mention Mike's Subs - a place all high school kids go for a sub (still to this day) and they really are only ok - nothing special at all but for some reason we all went there. It was fun to picture the actual streets he was talking of and how many times I have been to those same spots.You can see the symobolism he is creating here - he is bummed, his dad is depressed, he is going to end his mom's life, his friends haven't changed, his job sucks and all of this is in the backdrop of a cold, somewhat depressed locale. His life mirrors the city or the city mirrors his life.Anyway - there is a twist to the ending that surprised me - I mean really surprised me. Kudos to the author. This book is fairly well paced and has some great one liners - the humor is perfect and there are a few tears. Give this a try - I don't think you will be disappointed"}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1837350-carrie", "userReview": "This book actually reminded me a lot of the movie Garden State - a man returning to his hometown after a while away and reflecting on the oddities that used to be \"life\" and also dealing with some family problems all while having interesting relationships with women, lol. I should say that I LOVE Garden State though, so the comparison is definitely not a bad thing. I really enjoyed that the novel was set in Buffalo, and I kept getting excited every time a place a recognized was mentioned. For someone who lives in the Buffalo area, descriptions of these places aren't really needed, but I felt that the descriptions the author gave were great. Buffalo really is an interesting place when you think about it...it's constantly labelled as one of the worst places to live in the country, and yet people who live here feel a really strange sense of pride. I could definitely feel that resonating throughout this novel. I also really liked the main character, he reminded me a lot of many men I've met throughout my life...he was a good person with good intentions, but seemed afraid or unaware of how to show it. The scenes that involved his mother were truly heartbreaking - I can't imagine \"losing\" someone and yet they are still there. It got me thinking about how I would feel if my parents or my husband had dementia, and how much I would miss them, even though they were right there in front of me.Overall, great book. Will be looking out for more by this author for sure!"}], "description": "James Fitzroy isn't doing so well.
