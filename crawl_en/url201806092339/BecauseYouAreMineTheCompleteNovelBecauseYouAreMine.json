Because You Are Mine series, book 1-8 of 8. Another whirlwind romance with a dominant & controlling, rich & sexy alpha male hero!\u201cBecause You Are Mine\u201d (Ian\u2019s & Francesca\u2019s story) is an 8-part series, released in the fall of 2012. Combined they make a 368-page read. Please note that the Omnibus will be released in March 2013. And there will be a sequel to this series, \u201cWhen I'm With You\u201d (Lucien\u2019s & Elise\u2019s story) to be released in 8 weekly installments starting March 3, 2013 (series complete by April 23, 2013).Since I am a reader in need of a HEA, I made sure I waited to read this series until all installments had been released. I read it in one sitting, thus I will review as a set. Hero: Ian Noble/British/30 years old/mogul-playboy/$$$$/dark hair/blue eyes/domHeroine: Francesca Arno/American/23 years old/student-artist/red-gold hair/brown eyes/innocentFrancesca is a young artist, who entered her painting in a competition held by the billionaire, Ian Noble. She wins the competition and is commissioned to create the centerpiece painting for the lobby of Ian\u2019s new Chicago Skyscraper. The book opens up at the reception held in her honor. Ian and Francesca are introduced and she feels in instant attraction (recognizing he is out of her league) while he is intrigued, but reserved. He knows she is too innocent for the likes of him. Francesca is a bohemian; she is na\u00efve, sweet and kind. She has a strained relationship with her parents, never quite measuring up. She lives with her three male roommates who are very protective of her. Ian, on the other hand, is the rich and extremely successful business mogul; he is enigmatic, worldly, handsome, sexy and oh so dominant and too \u201ccorrupted\u201d for her. But there is much more to it, because Ian is full of secrets. For starters: The reception was not their first encounter. Four years prior Francesca had painted \u201cThe Cat That Walks By Himself\u201d. As it turns out Ian had been the inspiration for that painting. She had been sad to have to sell it. And Ian had bought and tracked her down\u2026Ian tries to fight his attraction to Francesca, but it\u2019s a losing battle and so their whirlwind romance begins, taking us across the ocean while Ian and Francesca get to know each other and have lot of scorching hot sex. But as Ian\u2019s secrets are revealed, his mysterious past continues to cast shadows over their relationship. Their love is challenged and their future threatened.I thoroughly enjoyed Ian\u2019s & Francesca\u2019s story. And I very much look forward to Lucien\u2019s & Elise\u2019s story in \u201cWhen I'm With You\u201d.***Hero rating: 5 stars Heroine rating: 4 starsSex scenes rating: 5 starsSex scenes frequency: 4.5

"userReview": "This was originally put out as one of those new \"serialized series\" which i think is what had turned off many people from reading it, myself included. Yes, the cost was kind of steep at $1.99 per installment and there are 8 total so that's a whopping $16 for a book, however, when i used to read and purchase actual books, Shelly Laurenston's Pride series came in Trade size and they ran about $14 per book and i didn't even think twice about purchasing each and everyone of those books when they came out because i loved them! For me, it was having to wait a week for each installment of the story. Having read them ALL in one book i can say for certain that i would NOT have liked reading a story that way!! Some of the chapters ended in the middle of a scene and if i'd had to wait an entire week to get the rest of that scene i would not have been happy! I'm not really sure WHO the publishers were thinking would enjoy this way of reading a book but they must be people like my husband who will open a book every few nights, read ONE chapter then turn off their lamp and go to sleep!! That would def. NOT be me! When i'm reading a book, if i'm really enjoying it, the last thing i want to do is put it down! Having to read a book in that way would have lessened my interest in the story, it would have felt disjointed and i really don't think it would have allowed me to feel fully invested in the couple. Shame on you publishers! This is a cruel and unrealistic way to expect someone to read a book!Ok, RANT OVER.As i said above, i DID read this all as one book and the story as a whole was really quite enjoyable!! Yes, it's the same premise as a lot of books out there right now...the yummy tortured billionaire, who is very controlling and likes his kink in the bedroom, falls for the young innocent woman. Been there, done that...many times...but if the writing is good, the story is well told and i like the characters, i have no problem reading books like this. I like the way Beth Kery writes, she has a really good mix of extremely hot sex and romance with a little bit of emotional angst thrown into the mix. Her characters are smart and real. Ian is obviously a self made billionaire and Francesca is an artist, i loved the little twist of how she \"discovered\" him the first time without even knowing who he was until much later, The Cat Who Walked Alone. I loved that he saw and accepted her for who and what she was and wasn't trying to make her into the perfect woman for him. Ian could sometimes be cold but not enough to make him unlikeable, he def. had his moments of being sweet and romantic with Francesca and she was not your typical immature whiny heroine that you often find in these books, she was intelligent and had a good head on her shoulders.I just recently found out that the next book, When I'm With You, which is also serialized (unfortunately), will feature another couple (that was introduced in this book) but Ian Noble and Francesca Arno's story will continue on in there as well. Apparently there will also be a third book, which will NOT be serialized (Yay!!) that will complete Ian and Francesca's story. I'm very much looking forward to reading them all and i would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of books! :)"}, {"userName": "Mafi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237043-mafi", "userReview": "Est\u00e3o a ver o Christian Grey de As Cinquenta Sombras de Grey est\u00e3o?

An author (usually) writes the book that he/she would want to read, and then each reader synthesizes the words, absorbing them through the filter of his or her own experiences, tastes, background and mores, with the end result being a unique reading experience. No two readers will ever experience a story in exactly the same way. Because of that, it always intrigues me to read negative reviews of a book I have loved, or vice versa. This was especially true today, when I read some of the low-rated reviews of Beth Kery's Because You Are Mine, an erotic romance that I just finished and loved. Foremost among the criticisms was that it is in many ways a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. There are similarities...we have Ian, the dominant alpha billionaire hero with a troubled past and an affinity for BDSM who needs to punish and control Francesca, the beautiful, naturally submissive heroine. Ian, like Christian Grey, professes that he can offer sexual pleasure but not love or romance. Furthermore, a few of the scenes, set-ups and secondary characters in Because You Are Mine are deeply evocative of Fifty. While these similarities made a negative impression on some readers, for me it was just the opposite. (And we can't forget: Fifty itself was the retelling of another tale.) Far from being a hindrance, I loved seeing how Kery would take these similarities and make the story her own, and she did not disappoint. The caliber of her writing, the crafting of her characters and her beautiful language make Because You Are Mine very compelling fiction--erotic writing at its finest. Writing in third person (my preference because it allows an author to tell a broader, richer story), Kery took me on an emotional journey with Ian and Francesca. One of my favorite elements of the novel is the fact that, years prior to their first meeting, Francesca, an artist, had seen Ian from the rear and been moved enough to capture his desolation on canvas:\"She\u2019d painted him four years ago. That\u2019s what he was telling her\u2014that he knew she\u2019d observed him walking the dark, lonely streets in the dead of the night while the rest of the world slumbered, warm and content in their beds. Francesca hadn\u2019t realized the identity of her inspiration at the time, nor had he probably known he was being observed until he saw the painting, but there could be no doubt of it. Ian Noble was the cat who walked by himself. And he\u2019d wanted her to know it.\"That's a beautiful scene, one that speaks to the heart of the connection between these two characters. When it comes to erotic romance, Beth Kery is at the top of her game and the top of my list.There were also a few things about this book that I loved on a personal note, e.g. when Ian takes Francesca to Paris, they stay at the Hotel George V. Apparently, it's the hotel of choice for fictional billionaires. (I have it on good authority that Heaven in the Dark 's David Swift always stays there.) Also, as the book is set largely in Chicago, the protagonists visited many of my favorite spots. Dinner at Trump's hotel? Yes, thanks.In summary, the person that I am--my tastes, my experiences--had a fulfilling journey with these characters. For me, Because You Are Mine was a work of beautiful, nuanced writing, and each turn of the page was time well-spent."}, {"userName": "Dragana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5084213-dragana", "userReview": "DNF-ed at 10%.

O nosso mercado tem sido inundado de romances sensuais/er\u00f3ticos, mas penso que uma nova categoria deveria ser criada - a dos livros pornogr\u00e1ficos. E com isto n\u00e3o seria exagerado que as editoras come\u00e7assem a adoptar um sistema de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o como nos filmes, Maiores de 12, Maiores de 16, Maiores de 18. Mas concentremo-nos na obra em si.Porque \u00c9s Minha traz-nos a hist\u00f3ria de Francesca e Ian, que se conhecem numa festa dada em honra de Francesca por ter ganho o financiamento de Ian atrav\u00e9s de um concurso de pintura em tela. Nem meia centena de p\u00e1ginas depois, estes encontram-se no ch\u00e3o da sala de esgrima prestes a terem rela\u00e7\u00f5es sexuais. Da\u00ed em diante, tudo evolui de forma bastante fren\u00e9tica e explosiva.Ian \u00e9 um dominador nato cujo prazer sexual passa sempre pela submiss\u00e3o total da sua parceira. \u00c9 atrav\u00e9s de um misto de dor e prazer que ele consegue atingir o seu cl\u00edmax. Quando se come\u00e7a a envolver com Francesca, uma virgem, depara-se com algumas barreiras e incredulidade por parte dela. No entanto, Francesca n\u00e3o coloca muitos obst\u00e1culos e para al\u00e9m de se deixar dominar por completo, aprende a tirar o m\u00e1ximo prazer de tal, mesmo quando a dor poderia parecer insuport\u00e1vel.Ao iniciarmos esta obra, come\u00e7amos uma viagem por um mundo de lux\u00faria e erotismo. Caracterizada acima de tudo pelas v\u00e1rias fantasias do protagonista, acaba por carecer bastante de um desenvolvimento mais rico e maduro do romance em si. O sexo acontece com bastante facilidade, as crises existenciais de ambos por vezes deixam o leitor exasperado e o fim n\u00e3o poderia ser mais previs\u00edvel.O ponto forte deste livro acaba por ser toda a descri\u00e7\u00e3o das cenas sexuais. Para um romance er\u00f3tico, que ro\u00e7a o pornogr\u00e1fico, sou da opini\u00e3o que os cen\u00e1rios est\u00e3o bem descritos e deixam muito pouco \u00e0 imagina\u00e7\u00e3o. S\u00e3o bastante expl\u00edcitos e obviamente que se destinam a um p\u00fablico adulto.Beth Kery tem uma escrita flu\u00edda utilizando um vocabul\u00e1rio bastante pr\u00f3prio. Nesta sua hist\u00f3ria concentra-se muito mais nos aspectos sexuais, a ro\u00e7arem o sadomasoquismo, do que num poss\u00edvel trajecto rom\u00e2ntico. Para quem procurar uma boa hist\u00f3ria de amor com erotismo \u00e0 mistura, este n\u00e3o \u00e9 o livro ideal. Por\u00e9m, se procura uma obra que lhe possa proporcionar cenas picantes, extremamente er\u00f3ticas enquadradas num contexto BDSM este \u00e9 um deles.(http://branmorrighan.blogspot.pt/2013...)"}, {"userName": "Amy Jacobs", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682353-amy-jacobs", "userReview": "When this series was introduced as a serial novel and released a section at a time on Amazon, I anxiously awaited the final installment to be released.

I could not bring myself to enjoy the dominant ways of Ian Noble. He could be sweet at times, but overall he was a pushy prick. Yes, I went there. He was cold and nothing about him appealed to my romantic side. When it came to Francesca Arno, she was the naive virgin that had so many conflicts in her character that I was getting whiplash trying to keep up with them. One minute she is the sweet virgin unsure of herself, then the next page she is all of a sudden the sexy temptress teasing the men.

It is an erotic book par excellence, and it cannot be considered soft, rather the contrary. The action takes place between Chicago, Paris and London, and we find as central characters of the plot, as has become somewhat stereotyped in this kind of stories, a sexy, seductive and mysterious billionaire, of British origin - Ian Noble, and an innocent, vivacious , rebellious and curious artist, the young Francesca Arno, who has become acquainted with Noble, because she is the winner of an art competition whose Patron is Ian Noble.Both characters come to reveal a traumatic past [and here also nothing new or unusual in this type of narrative], each in their own way seek to find ways to deal with these traumas. Ian and Francesca are allowed to hold a very strong physical attraction, the strong point of the descriptions of the several meetings between them, by the way it is told us by the author, seem to convey a kind of electrical vibration, an energy that is almost visible and easy to be perceived by the reader.What really pleases and surprises in this story are the constant references to the world of art, the creative process in its various stages and nuances, and Francesca Arno, truly talented and passionate about what she does, portraying emotions in her paintings and capturing what she feels and also what is in her surroundings. And among the protagonists show us a very clear cultural and artistic connection that goes beyond physical and sexual attraction, but certainly also contributes to this aspect, leading to approach two people who, by their age, education, and the lifestyle they lead, are different in everything else except for the passions they have in common. One of the most striking phrases of the book is quoted by the characters, and the title of a painting of Francesca, and ends by describing Ian Noble in its purest essence:\"I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.\" The novel contains several quite detailed and explicit descriptions of sexual nature, some of them guided by some rawness, as Francesca, a virgin in her twenties, will awaken to sexuality with Ian Noble, who being a control freak in everyday life, just happens to be dominant also in sexual context, taking extreme pleasure of domination practices in this area. If it is true that the book is not smooth in this type of sexual descriptions, and more than half includes explicit sex, sex games, erotic instruments, it should be noted that this reality is well contextualized reality as we watch the emotional and psychological evolution of the two protagonists, and all this it is not shocking when you consider that there is consensus in all the practices described at the novel. One of the parts of the book I liked the most was their trip to Paris, where Ian will start fighting with himself about being completely obsessed with Francesca, fearing already becoming involved beyond the physical component. Francesca, in turn, lives divided between a discovery of a whole sensual world in which she was totally inexperienced, and the fear that she might loose Ian Noble anytime, because of her age and expectations, she soon begins to feel a lot more for her Maecenas than mere physical attraction and sexual yearning. She wants to know more and more about his whole life and help himto fight the ghosts of an unhappy childhood and their impact in his present. Besides Ian and Francesca, we get to know a good range of characters that surrounds them, and these characters end up interacting with each other. The friends with whom Francesca shares the house - especially her confidant Davie - a friendly gallerist! The efficient Lin Soong - Ian\u00b4s secretary, his faithful housekeeper - Mrs. Hanson, James, the chauffeur of the Millionaire, Ian\u00b4s aristocratic grandparents - the Earls of Stratham, and his best friend - Lucien Lenault (Manager of a Renowned restaurant). Together or not, Francesca and Ian grow up as lovers, can love fight Noble\u00b4s heavy past ? And what secret world hides London? Can this secret from Ian Noble be powerful enough to prevent a future with Francesca by his side? An engaging book, well written, openly erotic, but it goes beyond this component, containing cultural references and bringing up some thoughts on the psychological world of characters who could well be real in their respective dramas, faults and virtues!I liked it and recommend it to lovers of the erotic genre._______________________________________________Um livro ousado, com alguns detalhes diferentes e que faz pensar.

(leia no blog a review completa)\"O que verdadeiramente agrada e surpreende nesta hist\u00f3ria s\u00e3o as constantes refer\u00eancias ao mundo da arte, ao processo criativo nas suas v\u00e1rias fases e nuances, sendo Francesca Arno uma jovem verdadeiramente talentosa e apaixonada pelo que faz, retratando emo\u00e7\u00f5es nas suas pinturas e captando o que sente e tamb\u00e9m o que a rodeia. E entre os protagonistas surge de modo bem n\u00edtido um elo cultural e art\u00edstico que vai para al\u00e9m da atrac\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica e sexual, mas que certamente tamb\u00e9m contribui para este aspecto, levando a aproximar duas pessoas que, pela idade, pelo contexto em que foram educados, e pelo estilo de vida que levam, s\u00e3o em tudo o resto distintos, excepto nas paix\u00f5es que t\u00eam em comum, de forma inusitada. Uma das frases mais marcantes do livro \u00e9 citada pelas personagens, sendo o t\u00edtulo de uma pintura de Francesca, e acaba por descrever Ian Noble na sua mais pura ess\u00eancia:\" Eu sou o gato que anda sozinho, e todos os lugares s\u00e3o iguais para mim\". O romance cont\u00e9m diversas descri\u00e7\u00f5es bastante detalhadas e explicitas de natureza sexual, alguma delas pautadas por alguma crueza, visto que Francesca, virgem aos vinte e poucos anos, ir\u00e1 despertar para a sexualidade com Ian Noble, que sendo um control freak na vida quotidiana, acaba por se revelar dominador em termos sexuais, retirando extremo prazer de pr\u00e1ticas de domina\u00e7\u00e3o neste \u00e2mbito. Se \u00e9 certo que o livro n\u00e3o \u00e9 suave neste tipo de descri\u00e7\u00f5es sexuais, e que mais de metade inclui sexo expl\u00edcito, jogos sexuais, instrumentos er\u00f3ticos, deve referir-se que se mostra bem contextualizada esta realidade, pois que vamos assistindo \u00e0 evolu\u00e7\u00e3o emocional e psicol\u00f3gica dos dois protagonistas, n\u00e3o sendo chocante se considerarmos que h\u00e1 consenso em todas as pr\u00e1ticas aqui descritas.\" (...)"}, {"userName": "Beanimous", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21233378-beanimous", "userReview": "It is one of those Fifty shades of Grey type of books. It shares many parallels to Fifty Shades of Grey and I can not say that I like it.It is not a badly written book, I was engaged enough to finish the book, but I remained detached from the two main characters and grew to really dislike the Hero and found the Heroine spineless and weak.Frankly i don't think it is healthy to allow ourselves to be treated so carelessly and rudely, because he is really really really good looking and happens to have a tragic past.I like Beth Kery enough to finish the book, but I can not say I like the book very much."}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17238061-lily", "userReview": "\"Because You are MIne\" ( Ian Noble and Francesca Arno love story) another whirlwind love story with a dominant ,controlling,rich,sexual,exotic , and sexy alpha male hero and a artistic, art student,naive, and virginal,innocent,beautiful and inexperience heroine. If you loved fifty shades of grey you will love this book. The story line is the same rich dominate man meets young submissive Virgin. He gives her an offer she can't refuse sex,submission,pleasure little does he know that poor Francesca is a virgin. But to his surprise she's the perfect woman for him she is a great submissive that loves his punishments and is up to please him in which any way she can. The story shows how Ian changes the life of Francesca , the straight forward sexual relationship blossoms to something neither of them thought was possible \"love\" .\". Because you are mine\" is full of hot erotic sexy scenes that will make you want to take a cold shower Afterwards :) Would recommend this book to whoever loved fifty shades , it is a fast read and the sex scenes are very detailed :) you will grow to love and dislike Ian noble the British blue eyed 30 year old playboy who believes that he is he is incapable of love but also takes his dominance I a little to seriously the only reason I didn't give it a four stars because I think the ending was to abrupt it made me want more felt a little unfinished to me. After Ian finally told Francesca he loved her which was the first time throughout the whole book that he said it it ended :( that was the only downside a lot of sex not enough romantic emotion \u2b50\u2b50\u2b503 1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Katrina Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16120649-katrina-taylor", "userReview": "What to say about this book?? Hot, sexy, emotional, raw, all encompassing. I've read so many erotic novels and it warms my....heart when I find one that is so much more than its genre. I love a flawed character. I love the simple yet complex action of giving over power to someone else. The exchange if power between these two is palpable. Ian knows from the moment he sees himself in Francesca's painting that she knows him better than anyone else. That she has seen him as he is never seen by others. Francesca thinks she has control of her life and that she must maintain this control when is actuality she is out of control if you will and not until he shows her this does she finally get some semblance of control over her life. I thought it was well written and emotional and it drew me in and made me fall in love with the characters as they fell in love.

I started on this series thinking I'd give it a few pages. It was not as hard to get through as I expected. Keeping in mind I don't care for the tragic tormented hero in BDSM (because its done so poorly), there were some things that I thought worked well in this book. I was particularly pleased with Ian who was never overly dramatic. He struggled with his emotions but he was honest. He was never cruel to Francesca. He was not only redemptive but was rather likable all the way through. He's a Good Guy in a genre where so many of the men are not. So he's worth reading about.

It is the second erotica book that I have ever read, Fifty Shades of Grey being the first. I enjoyed this book more than Fifty Shades of Grey. This book was an extremely sexy read and indulges in erotic fantasies in every chapter. While reading Because You Are Mine: The Complete Novel I saw many similarities with 50 Shades (sexy dominant millionare, emotionally unattached and controlliing who falls for a young innocent female with no sexual experience). I found, however, that Kery did a much better job at adding a quality storyline that flowed better. Ian is a great example of a dominant male. He needs to be the dominant in all aspects of his life, not just in the bedroom. He portrays himself to others as an educated man who is in control of every aspect of his life. Yet there is a piece of him that is vulnerable and a part of his life that he is not in control of. As you read the book and get to know Ian Noble you begin to understand where his vulnerability comes from and why he needs to be in control. He became someone I could relate to on a more personal level and not just a sexual deviant.Francesca - Even though she was inexperienced, she wasn\u2019t a timid female. She has a very stubborn streak that clashes with Ian's stubborness. The chemistry between Ian and Francesca increases through the book. Even though Francesca has no experience with sex, it was interesting how eager she was giving herself over to Ian completely and how trusting she was of him. I thought it made their chemistry that more steamy.Because You Are Mine is a book that you read when you are in the mood for something sexy and erotic. The book is good at what it is and is an enjoyable read. I thought the story was well written with interesting characters that have substance beyond their erotic sexlives. Kery has become one of my go-to authors for erotic romances and I will continue to read this series to see where else Kery takes us with Ian and Francesca's budding romance."}, {"userName": "Romance Bound", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31785029-romance-bound", "userReview": "View Original Review: http://romanceboundreviews.wordpress.comBecause You Are Mine was a fantastic read! Beth Kery delivers a sizzling hot erotic romance featuring two completely opposite people, innocent virgin Francesca and sexually dominant and BDSM god Ian. Suffice it to say the sex scenes went beyond steamy and straight to raging fire (I\u2019m still tingling with aftershocks!). These scenes are so detailed they could be considered instructional manuals with some kinky tips and tricks with whips, paddles, and toys galore. Hot, hot, H-O-T!Unlike the virginal Anastasia Steele of Fifty Shades of Grey, which many people reference in their review of Kery\u2019s book, Francesca is open to learning about the world of BDSM and is ready to please Ian as long as it gives her pleasure in the process. She takes the whole sexual world in stride unlike the forever timid Anastasia. I liked the dom/sub relationship much more with Ian and Francesca because it wasn\u2019t explicitly defined and overly discussed with absurd sex contracts like in Fifty Shades of Grey. Because You Are Mine shows two adults having a mutually fulfilling sexual relationship that doesn\u2019t involve at lot of planning and hashing out of details, it just is. And if you were into the whole \u201cred room of pain,\u201d then you will love the sexy room that Ian has at his penthouse {commence drooling}.As this was my first time reading a book by Kery, I was really happy to discover that her writing is spot-on in terms of view points. Throughout the novel, Kery goes in between Francesca\u2019s and Ian\u2019s narration. If we didn\u2019t have Ian\u2019s thoughts, then he wouldn\u2019t have been such a likable character. He comes off as a cold jerk a lot of the time from Francesca\u2019s observations of his body language and tone of voice. Getting a glimpse into his mind from his point of view makes each scene so much more poignant.Even though alpha, dom, billionaires with dark sexual/abusive pasts are the hottest male characters these days in erotic fiction, Ian Noble is a breath of fresh air. Unlike Christian Grey in Fifty Shade of Grey and Gideon Cross from Sylvia Day\u2019s Crossfire series, Ian Noble has not been physically or sexually abused. His darkness comes from having to take care of his mentally ill mother without a support system, thus leading him to want to have complete control over everything. It\u2019s nice to see an author find a new twist on an overplayed theme.From a private jet to the backseat of a luxury car, these two cannot keep their hands off each other. And boy was it fun to watch them find ways to make each other crazy. Because You Are Mine is definitely on my re-read list and is a READ IT NOW book!"}, {"userName": "..Mary..", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13296640-mary", "userReview": "Dopo una lunga sfilza di fantasy ho voluto staccare un p\u00f2 la spina con un bel romance, ne ho preso uno a caso dalla mia libreria virtuale.

Mi sta bene, se l'uomo nel sesso prenda l'iniziativa e il controllo, pu\u00f2 andare bene fare qualche gioco pi\u00f9 audace, usare bende e manette, ma arrivare a usare frustini, palette e picchiare una donna, \u00e8 troppo e secondo me di cattivo gusto. Uso il termine picchiare, perch\u00e8 l'autrice usa questa parola. Io sono rimasta veramente schifata, perch\u00e8 in questo libro, la donna viene tratta come se fosse una bambola gonfiabile, lei non pu\u00f2 toccare lui, certe volte viene utilizzata solo per il piacere di Ian, e non per il suo, come succede nel viaggio di ritorno da Londra. Ok alla protagonista piacciono tutte queste cosa, ma non giustifica il fatto che sempre secondo me, non ci sia stato il rispetto verso la figura della donna. La prima volta e l'unica volta che lei ha preso l'iniziativa, lui l'ha punita sculacciandola e attaccandola in una specie di altalena, che non saprei neanche come spiegarvi.Magari qualcuno penser\u00e0 che sono antica o roba del genere, ma non tollero quando sento alla tv che una donna sia stata picchiata, mancata di rispetto ecc.. e non posso giustificare queste cose, anche se fatte a letto e anche se la donna sia consenziente, per me resta sempre mettere le mani addosso.
