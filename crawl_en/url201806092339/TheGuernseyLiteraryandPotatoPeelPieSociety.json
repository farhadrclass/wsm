Though I loved the art, I wasn\u2019t much good at selling it. More often than not, I just chatted up the customers, who were from all over the world.One night, four elderly people wandered in. They told me they were from a tiny island off the coast of southern England called \u201cGuernsey\u201d. I\u2019d never heard of it, so they proudly explained it was the only part of British soil that had been occupied by the Nazis during World War II. The island was occupied for a long five years; an experience to which they had all been witnesses. At that moment, Guernsey was marked in my mind.Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrow\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u201d is an opportunity to travel back in time to 1946 Guernsey.Beginning early 1946 in London, Juliet Ashton, a British writer, and former war journalist, is emerging from the ashes of the war to rebuild her life and her identity. She has lost her home and all her possessions, most regrettably her book collection. Out of the blue, she responds to correspondence started by a resident of Guernsey, who has managed to obtain a second-hand book once owned by Juliet, in which she had long ago written her name and address. Through this initial contact, Juliet meets an entire community, and the course of her life is redirected.Easily reminiscent of Helene Hanff\u2019s epistolary classic, \u201c84 Charing Cross Road\u201d, the novel is written in the epistolary style. Shaffer and Barrow skillfully use this medium to successfully establish their characters and a solid storyline.Charming, funny, sweet, and thoughtful, \u201cThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u201d is a story that women might find more appealing than men. Yet, it is unflinching in its wartime recollections. The deprivations and devastation of the time are imaginatively and convincingly conveyed.At its core, this is a book about the love of reading, and the magic of books.I highly, highly recommend \u201cThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u201d."}, {"userName": "Megha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1727205-megha", "userReview": "Dear Mary Ann Shaffer,I recently read your book 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. It brought a few questions to my mind.Juliet writes in one of her letters: \"Dear Sidney, What an inspired present you sent kit - red satin tap shoes covered with sequins\" Didn't Sidney know what present he had sent?If you had to resort to sentences like these to speak what you wanted to, didn't you realize that the letter format and your writing didn't go well together?Learning from your bad example, I will quit trying to be fancy, stop this letter here and write a regular review.A Reader.** Spoiler Alert **Novel written in epistolary format. Set in post WWII England.1946.Juliet is a 30-something writer living in London. (She is like this perfect human being who is universally loved. The only people who dislike even the smallest thing about her are the evil people). One day she receives a letter from a man living on Guernsey islands who found her address on a second hand book he had. Soon Juliet is exchanging letters with the members of Guernsey literary society and people talk about what books they like and why. Then suddenly everyone forgets about the books and Guernsey people start sharing their most intimate experiences from the time during the world war with Juliet, who is only a stranger. A few weeks later Juliet goes to the Guernsey islands to meet and interview these people. Of course everyone there just loves her (except the evil woman). She stays there for a few months and decides to adopt a four year old orphan girl she met there. The girl of course loves Juliet more than the people who have raised her. And then Juliet marries a pig farmer and settles down on the Guernsey islands.So much for the ridiculous plot. (I should have just known better, just look at the cheesy title.)It shouldn't be difficult for a decent writer to develop good characters when using a letter format, since each character gets his/her own voice. However, all the characters in this book seem to talk in exactly the same manner. Be it an accomplished writer from the city of London or farmers from a remote island, their letters sound just the same. Irrespective of whether the letters are being written to a close friend or to a complete stranger. Almost all of the characters have only a single trait. For some of the characters I can't recall even a single distinct characteristic.Mary Ann tries to have everything in one book. She has grazed the surface of numerous topics like books, world war, art, nature love, bucolic life, friendship, love, homosexuality, religion and so on. None of these get more than a superficial treatment. Stories about Nazi occupation of Guernsey don't tell you anything real about the war. They just revolve around this saint of a woman who died during the war while trying to show-off her heroism. To add to this drama, halfway through the book Mary Ann shifted the focus to Juliet trying to decide between different love interests (too many people love her, you know). Why is this book being marketed a historical novel?Another one of those recent successful books that everyone is raving about. I don't get it."}, {"userName": "Emma  Kaufmann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/918165-emma-kaufmann", "userReview": "Once again I find myself reading ten pages of a book which is meant to be 'great' and wondering why it is just rubbish. I was meant to read this for a book club but it was about as palatable as a potato peel pie so I spat it out uneaten.Now, I'm sure there are American authors who can write in an authentic British voice (no one springs to mind, and Elizabeth George is terrible at it but at least her plot is not clunky) but Mary Ann Shaffer isn't one of them.This book has an epistolary plot that just goes clunk clunk clunk.Firstly, it is set in London in 1946 where we meet a fairly posh author who, rather than using the polite and rather stilted language that people used in 1946 sounds like Sex in the City circa 2008.I mean, come on, Mary Ann, have you ever even read a letter from 1946?So, you have letters flying around in 1946 which sound like they were written sixty years later. How are you meant to get into this?Then of course, a man in Guernsey writes to this author woman, says he has found a book with her name and address written on the flyleaf, there are currently no books in Guernsey, can she procure him some from London? Of course the lady author sends this poor man in Guernsey some books and writes him long letters. As if.Note to Americans: posh English authors in 1946 would not have been quite this effusive to a person who wasn't even a fan of her books. Obviously this clunky device is meant to start a stupid story going about this guy in Guernsey telling her all about his experiences when the Nazi's invaded Guernsey. Save me. All about as authentic as a Hallmark movie about the Nazis.This book reminded me of the children's American Girl series which take periods in history, and have a girl heroine who gives a personal and hightly sanitized view of American history, but does a fairly good job seeing as the audience for these books is 6 to 10 year olds. But this book is meant to be for adults. Save me. This is WWII lite.Take this quote:\"I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\u201d Or maybe someone bought it in a bookshop and took it to Guernsey?This sums up the tone of this tome. Twee beyond endurance."}, {"userName": "Beth F.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310564-beth-f", "userReview": "Gush, gush, gush, gush, gush, gush, gush!!! GUSH!!!!! So yes, clearly I loved this book.I think the only person I wouldn\u2019t recommend this book to is one of those people who only read meaty tomes that might give regular people a brain embolism while they\u2019re trying to make sense of the 17 different layers of subconscious meaning. I\u2019d also hesitate from recommending this book to most men. However, if you have the ability to find joy and delight in the simple pleasures of a feel-good book, you too might fall in love with this story. The book is written entirely in an epistolary format, consisting of letters back and forth between Juliet Ashton, a young author in 1946 London and several of her contacts and friends. It is just after WWII and people are trying to reclaim their lives and figure out if and how to move on from the tragedy of the war. Juliet receives an unsolicited letter from a man who lives on the island of Guernsey, one of the small islands situated in the English Channel between France and England (known for having loose regulations and financial secrecy in the modern world thereby making it attractive to fraudsters, money launderers and criminals, but that has nothing to do with this story and why it is enjoyable, I just couldn\u2019t help myself from mentioning it). But anyway, Dawsey Adams of Guernsey acquires a used book that had originally been owned by Juliet. She had penned her name and address inside the cover and Dawsey decided to write her a letter to share how much he\u2019d enjoyed her secondhand book and how reading books had helped several Guernsey residents cope during the time of the German Occupation of their island. Before long, Juliet is corresponding regularly with Mr. Adams and several other Guernsey residents, all who had been a part of the Literary Society. She learns that the Society was initially formed as a front to explain a broken curfew but eventually became a rewarding opportunity to meet with friends and discuss a love of books. Eventually, Juliet travels to Guernsey to meet her island pen friends and it was hard for me to put the book down and get any work done!The letters back and forth between Juliet and her friends gave the book a personal touch and it felt like we were being given an inside look into these peoples\u2019 lives. I subscribe to the belief that letter-writing is a lost art form and appreciate books that are heavy on the letters and found the format enjoyable and easy to approach. There is also a very sweet love story in between these pages that made me sigh with contentment when the book ended. It was a highly satisfying read and I think that most book lovers would also enjoy this story.Even though most of us don\u2019t write letters anymore, I think we will identify and be attracted to the notion of maintaining a long-distance correspondence with someone and developing a friendship with someone we\u2019ve never even met (hello? Anybody chat/email with friendly strangers on the internet?) Juliet becomes quite close to her Guernsey friends and there was one passage in particular when she is finally embarking on her trip to meet her pen friends that rung true for me because it was eerily similar to the thoughts I\u2019ve had on the occasion when I\u2019ve met \u201cnet friends\u201d who crossed that boundary to become \u201creal life friends\u201d and it\u2019s that, \u201coh god, oh god, oh god, what if we don\u2019t like each other? What if my words misled them? What if I\u2019m not as interesting in person as they thought I was online?\u201d \u201dAs the mail boat lurched into the harbor, I saw St. Peter Port rising up from the sea on terraces, with a church on the top like a cake decoration, and I realized that my heart was galloping. As much as I tried to persuade myself it was the thrill of the scenery, I knew better. All those people I\u2019ve come to know and even love a little, waiting to see\u2014me. And I, without any paper to hide behind\u2026in these past two or three years, I have become better at writing than living\u2026On the page, I\u2019m perfectly charming, but that\u2019s just a trick I learned. It has nothing to do with me. T least, that\u2019s what I was thinking as the mail boat came toward the pier. I had a cowardly impulse to throw my red cape overboard and pretend I was someone else.\u201d As if I hadn\u2019t already fallen in love with Juliet and her friends by this point, reading that passage actually brought tears to my eyes (not even kidding) because I knew exactly what she was feeling at that precise moment because I\u2019ve been there before. So yes, I loved this book. It was beautiful and charming and a sheer delight to read. However, I think potato peel pie sounds disgusting and I wouldn\u2019t want to eat it."}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/827193-alisa", "userReview": "I'm in favor of:-pig farmers as romantic leads-parrots named Zenobia who eat cuckoo clocks-women who do the askingI'm not in favor of:-strong silent types as romantic leads-adorable children-parrots getting more page time than goats"}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "\u2018\u2019Real dyed-in-the-wool readers can\u2019t lie. Our faces always give us away. A raised brow or a curled lip means that it\u2019s a poor excuse for a book, and the clever customers ask for recommendation instead, whereupon we frog-march them over to a particular volume and command them to read it.\u2019\u2019\nFollowing an exciting April, I chose to start May with a focus on more contemporary, approachable reads that are simple but rich in themes focusing on the relationships within a family, within the members of small communities. One of these choices was a a book with the striking title The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Now, this work and yours truly have been through a stormy relationship. Ever since it came out, I\u2019ve included it in my list only to dismiss it again and again. It just didn\u2019t look like something I\u2019d choose to read. However, I recently watched a documentary about the Channel Islands and I took it as a sign. And I am very happy to tell you that it is a delightful, meaningful novel.Even though I\u2019m not an admirer of novels written in the epistolary form, this is the kind of book that benefits from the style. It protects the reader from awkward dialogue and repetition. So. The story in a nutshell. Juliet is a rather successful writer who desires to finally write something that will be fulfilling to her aspirations. A letter of chance by Dawsey, a resident of Guernsey, brings the literary society with the astonishing name and the special background to her attention and what was meant to be a simple research becomes a journey of self-discovery.I love the way the setting and the era come alive through the pages of this book. We are in 1946 and the island is trying to recover from the consequences of the German occupation. Juliet is going through a similar situation. She fights against dark memories, against prejudices and discriminations and bossy men who think she is incapable of producing a serious work just because she is a woman.The islanders want to be taken seriously. They\u2019re not there to be laughed at or to be pitied. So, Juliet and Guernsey have much in common. Their thoughts and feelings are vividly shown and the reader has the chance to feel a part of both stories.\n\u2018\u2019The bright day is done and we are for the dark\u2019\u2019 Anthony and Cleopatra, William Shakespeare\nI appreciated the way Shaffer chose to focus on human relationships. People so different and yet so similar, brought together by the primal need to survive and the unique love for reading. A society that starts as an excuse to fool the Kommandantur becomes a haven, a shelter for the islanders who derive strength from heroes and heroines of tales. Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, The Secret Garden, The Bronte sisters, Dickens, Wilkie Collins, the Bell siblings and, naturally, the One, the Greatest of the greats. William Shakespeare. The process of how people who had little to no association with books become dedicated readers was a joy to witness. And the fights, the antagonist, the passions that are inevitable in a small community where tensions have amounted for too long are always exciting\u2026I didn\u2019t believe that in an epistolary novel there would be space enough for the characters to develop but I was wrong. We have the sympathetic ones and those who suffocate the others because of their beliefs and their ego. And, of course, we have Juliet who is such a fascinating heroine, full of life and endless determination. I loved her from the very first letter. So, if character development is one of your concerns regarding this novel, fear not. You will come to know quite a few exciting people, you will love them while others will give you some trouble. Just as in real life.I didn\u2019t come to think of this novel as a \u2018\u2019feel-good\u2019\u2019 story. What is this term, anyway? For me, there aren\u2019t \u2018\u2019feel good\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019feel bad\u2019\u2019 stories. There are well-written stories and badly written ones and many times, the most poignant tales are the ones that spring from togetherness and coincidences. They are told in a simple manner, in beautiful, quirky and sometimes sad prose. What could be more memorable than that? No pseudo-philosophical gimmicks or cheap sentimentalism but reality. ...plus there\u2019s a plethora of references to Wuthering Heights and yes, I\u2019m completely biased..\n\u2018\u2019I didn\u2019t like Wuthering Heights at first, but the minute that spectre Cathy scratched her bony fingers on the windowpane- I was grasped by the throat and not let go. With that Emily I could hear Heathcliff's pitiful cries upon the moors.\u2019\u2019\nMy reviews can also be found on https://theopinionatedreaderblog.word..."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "I loved this book - it's on my favorites shelf. So obviously I recommend it!In my March 2018 buddy read with Trish (which kind of disintegrated because she raced ahead and finished the whole book in like one day :p) I was impressed with how well the authors melded actual historical facts about the island of Guernsey during WWII, and people's wartime experiences, with the novel's storyline. I could see the seams a little - interesting true stories and anecdotes tend to show up in the book as random people's letters to the main character, Juliet - but I have to say overall I still enjoyed this book thoroughly. While it deals with some harrowing experiences, it does so with a fairly light hand, which some readers may roll their eyes at, but others will appreciate. It tends toward the \"cozy\" type of read, which isn't a bad thing in my book. There's a rich cast of characters, just a touch of romance, and some truly delightful humor. I'll definitely reread this a third time someday.This historical fiction novel is set shortly after WWII, with frequent wartime stories being related in letters between the characters. Through these letters (this is an epistolary novel), we follow Juliet Ashton, a fairly successful author of a British humor column, who is searching for a new topic to write about, and trying to decide what to do with her life and her boyfriend. She gets a letter out of the blue from a man on Guernsey Island, Dawsey Adams, who saw her name in a book and asks her for the name of a London bookshop, and tells her a little about his local book group, the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. One letter leads to another, both from Dawsey and others on Guernsey, and gradually Juliet finds out more about her new friends on the island, what they experienced during the German WWII occupation of the island of Guernsey a few years before, and how their book club was formed and got its name. When she decides to go visit Guernsey and her pen pal friends there - upsetting her current boyfriend in the process - her life gradually becomes intertwined with theirs.This book includes some fun and often quirky characters, quite a bit of interesting (and sometimes harrowing) WWII history, a love for literature, frequent humor, and just a little bit of romance."}, {"userName": "Cayenne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278240-cayenne", "userReview": "This was one of the lovliest books I have ever read.

The stories about their experiences were so touching, not just because they were hard, but because the people were so brave.

There is a distinct air of wholesomeness, inoffensiveness about it, plus it is occasionally funny (in a cute, inoffensive way), with a bit of tragic war business thrown in. But it got tiring for me very quickly. From the moment the main character, Juliet, a young writer, came to Guersney to visit her pen pals, the whole story just got way too cute for my taste. Everyone on the island was so nice, so into doing the right thing, so in love with Juliet, I just couldn't stand it. They were not real people.

The core of the story is Elizabeth, a particularly brave and wonderful individual. She is the emotional heart of the tale, as the many characters all have some experience that relates to her. Another important aspect is how all the characters relate around literature. Shaffer offers us a charming and wide-ranging palette of humanity trying their best to cope under very trying circumstances. As someone who knew very little about the occupation of the Channel Islands I found it educational as well as a fun read. I was reminded of Alexander McCall Smith, not, clearly, for the specifics of the location, but for the warmth of the authorial tone.

I don\u2019t dare ask.At any rate, this is easily one of the most charming books I\u2019ve read in a while. Our heroine, Juliet, spent the war writing light pieces for a women\u2019s magazine, and now she yearns for more substantial material. When she receives a letter from a Guernsey man who has in his possession a book she used to own, and finds out that during the war he belonged to a \u201cLiterary and Potato Peel Pie Society,\u201d she\u2019s intrigued. She writes him back. It turns out that at the beginning of the occupation (Germany occupied the Channel Islands from 1939-1945), a group of friends had gathered for a covert pork supper, only to have to make up some excuse for breaking curfew when a Nazi officer discovered them walking home late at night. The Literary Society was the result. Juliet begins corresponding with the various members of the society, but eventually decides she wants to go to Guernsey to meet them in person \u2014 as will you!! What a delightful assortment of characters \u2014 most of their letters made me laugh out loud, and several made me cry. Juliet\u2019s letters are an absolute scream. Plus, as a bonus, you get an intriguing glimpse into what life was like for those trapped on an occupied island for the duration of the war. The hardships, friendships, and everyday heroism of the characters actually warmed my heart!My only complaint is that it wasn\u2019t until page 61 that the author managed to write in a different voice. In other words, most of the characters sound exactly alike, as though the same person is corresponding with herself. Creating distinct voices is a trick for any author, but good ones do it far more successfully. And there\u2019s one woman, a non-member of the Literary Society, who\u2019s so absurdly interfering that she makes Mrs. Kravitz of \u201cBewitched\u201d look like an Arthur Miller creation. But the rest of the book (ridiculous sitcom character aside) is delightful enough to make up for the contrived and often predictable aspects.

What a painful read.I won't dwell too long on what makes this book so wrong, but let's start with the problem of how difficult it is for a GOOD writer to develop character via the epistolary form. Now for two mediocre writers, it's even worse. I distinguish no voices among the twelve million uninteresting characters. Second, how about the \"plot?\" There isn't one, and what is moderately plot-like is so loosely strung that it's impossible and laughable. The woman's boss lets her skip town, not do her work, and then she decides she wants to adopt some kid she's known for a couple of months and then marries one of her subjects? That's unethical and gets people fired in the real world. Granted, it's the 1940s, but, I think that actually makes it less believable. The setting and timing of this story never come together, and descriptions of war are thrown in on the side for added drama. I should have stayed away when I saw the rave, run-on sentence of a review from Elizabeth Gilbert ( Eat, Pray, Love  fame) giving this one glowing reviews. The book is not worth your time or frustration, as you can never really care about the characters or their half-slopped-together miss-mash of a story. Additionally, the language leaves something to be desired when it could have been so much more. The book HAS such potential but never gets anywhere near it. Feckless, really (feckless being the word I kept reading overandoverandover when it wasn't necessary)."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1175468-amy", "userReview": "I don't do this often, but I am commanding my fellow Good Read Sisters to stop what they are doing, order a pizza for the family and hide yourselves away with this book!

It wasn't a bad ending, per se, but it felt really rushed. I was honestly taken aback by it's abrupt ending. That was a bit of a bummer. Nevertheless, this was a really endearing story about the power that books have to bring people together\u2014so how can it not be great?It's told in a series of letters and telegrams between characters, but mostly from the perspective of Juliet Ashton, a journalist and book lover from England, just after the end of WWII. The novel also follows the perspective of a lovable and unique cast of characters who live on Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands that was held by Germans during the war. I loved how this book grew to have a lot of emotional depth while maintaining a lightness in tone that made it very readable and almost fun. Granted, it deals with some pretty sad material as you'd expect with a story following WWII, but the characters don't wallow and aren't full of despair because they have each other and their shared loved of books to bind them together.Again, my only issue was the ending. The book could've been at least 50+pages longer and I wouldn't have minded at all! I was expecting some sort of epilogue or concluding chapter to tie it all together. I know the author unfortunately was unable to finalize the manuscript before publication because of her health, and so her niece finished it for her. It never feels like two authors wrote this, and maybe that's because we are reading letters from so many perspectives that even if they had very different writing styles it would've worked well with this format. But that could've contributed to the novel's ending not necessarily stacking up compared to the rest of the book. Otherwise, this is a great novel that I think would appeal to a lot of readers, and I'd highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "Don't let the title put you off. Or the fact that it has two authors (the second recruited apparently when the first, her aunt, sadly became too ill to complete it.) Or the fact that it is a series of letters, or what literary types call an \"epistolary novel\". Or the whispering on the grapevine that it's a cosy piece, mostly read by women. All these tended to make me hesitate. But I'm so glad I persevered.The book has a post-war setting, but much of the action refers to the Nazi Occupation of Guernsey during World War II. I was dubious that American authors would really capture the feel of these times for Guernsey folk, or the nuances of life on such a small island. I was wrong.The island characters are a delight. The viewpoint character with her London-based world less so, though I appreciated that there needed to be a contrast here. Neither does the novel pull any punches when describing events in Nazi Concentration camps. To cover such a broad spectrum of experience and mood requires a skilful author, whom we have.Enough has been written elsewhere giving descriptions of this novel. It seems to be the sort of novel you either love or hate. I personally enjoyed it a lot and found it to have a unique angle on WWII fiction. There was one flaw however. I did find that the ending was somewhat hackneyed and totally predictable.Has it been made into a film yet? If not, I can guarantee that some bright spark will want to adapt it.

The story of the occupation of Guernsey is facinating and really well told in this book and the story of Elizabeth really stays with you.

These friends had just enjoyed a meal of roasted pig, which was a novelty after the occupation. Not wanting to give the real reason for being out one of the group, Elizabeth, concocted the story of being at a literary club meeting.Juliet is looking for subject matter for a couple of projects and becomes interested in the people she communicates with in Guernsey.

It's 1946, January, and Juliet Ashton is on a book tour around England for her recently published collection of humorous columns that had been so popular during the war, Izzy Bickerstaff Goes to War. She's not used to being a success and she does tend to throw things at people, but on the upside a very wealthy and attractive man keeps sending her flowers.A surprise letter from a complete stranger from one of the Channel Islands, Guernsey, provides a new friendship and the germ of an idea for a new book. He, Dawsey Adams, had one of her books (works by Charles Lamb), which had her address on the inside cover. Her old address, her beloved flat that was bombed. The letter reaches her, and so begins a new friendship not just with Dawsey, but the entire community of St Peter Port and the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.Intrigued by this amazing name, the story of the literary society's origins are revealed and soon Juliet is caught up in their story, and that of the island which was under German Occupation during the war. Everyone has a story, and one woman in particular shines through all their tales: Elizabeth McKenna, a resourceful and quick-witted young woman whom Juliet feels an affinity to.Told through letters between various characters but predominantly between Juliet and her publisher and best friend's brother, Sidney Stark, this poignant and bittersweet story is skilfully revealed and celebrated.I'm not normally a fan of books told through letters, though it's an unfair assumption that they must always be boring. A truly skilled writer can reveal much through letters - and Mary Ann Shaffer, who died just before the book was published, and her niece Annie Barrows who finished the manuscript when her aunt fell ill, have completed a remarkable book that I cannot recommend highly enough.This is a book that made me laugh, made me cry, and sometimes made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. Yet it's not a morbid or sad book. Juliet is a delightfully funny woman whose teasing tone reminded me of one of my sisters; and the Islanders each have their own quirks and remind me of shows like Seachange and Hamish Macbeth - that small town, close-knit community feel. So much is cleverly revealed to us through their correspondence, things that the characters themselves, writing the letters, don't notice.It's beautifully written, slightly tongue-in-cheek and with that real British sense of humour - which is wonderful considering the authors are American. They really captured that tone, of the period as well as the place. There's also a great deal of subtlety, and an undercurrent of excitement, that completely beguiles you.There are stories within stories as the past and the present overlap, and the complex relationship between Islander and Occupier is gently explored, while the horrors of a concentration camp are lightly touched upon - the full import is there, but not thrust in your face. A light touch, this book proves, can be more powerful that a hard-hitting one.I felt close to all the characters in this book, who came vividly to life through these letters and their personal stories and adventures. It also makes me want to visit Guernsey! It's a quick, light read that will have you fully engrossed within the first few pages.

Can you find it in your heart to forgive me for this long absence and absolute neglect or will any reason I give you for this absence be taken as naught but excuses? I have failed and I accept that but you should know that you were never forgotten. In fact, many a times, I thought of writing to you, just like in the old days, but what with the changes in time and advent of other means of communication, you were left untouched, simply waiting for the right moment to be loved as you were before. Ah my friend, do you remember how we used to go to the stores selling letter pads and how much we agonized together on the perfect pad for our letters? I still remember those good days and miss them a lot today. The sheer beauty in choosing the perfect pad to write our stories on, to send those thoughtfully created letters to our other friends and the agony of waiting for their replies and finally the exhilaration of receiving one, the rushing to one\u2019s room for reading in privacy and the cycle of creating a reply for those messages. It was a beautiful time indeed and I am really sorry that it is now almost lost forever. I wish my daughter would know you my friend but her tastes unfortunately are different with the times, she prefers calling and talking. While I know that communication has become easy today, I still miss the beauty of those olden days. I know that you must be wondering as to why I am waxing poetic about the good old days of letter writing and must be shaking your head in confusion. You are right to wonder and to be confused and I do have a small secret to share with you. It is because of a book I read recently that I have realized just how much I missed you. Don\u2019t hide your pain behind that smile, my friend, for I can see it even if you think me to be insensitive to have left you alone for so long. I cannot deny the fact that it took me a book to realise how much I had lost by abandoning you but trust me that the pain is mine as well, for I had lost something more precious than you had and I have to thank this book and its author for reminding me of the jewel that I had in my armoire of life. I can predict your next question. What book you ask and why did it affect me so, am I right? Well, it is the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, which brought me back to you. Don\u2019t laugh at the title my friend for the pages within the covers of this book are definitely more beautiful than anything I have ever read. Poignant and serene, this book talks about a book club formed in an island, out of necessity and filled with people who had never read all their lives. The narrator is an author who is in between books when she receives a letter from a member of this book club, who incidentally has found a book that was inscribed with her name and address. The member was reading a second hand book that he found in a library on that island.I can see the small smile playing on your lips as you read this and the mischievous twinkle in your eyes and I am sure that you are thinking of the same thing as I am, remembering our adventures of scouring second hand book stores in the town. Do you remember the sheer bliss we felt when we found a book that was simply beautiful? Do you remember how the shop keeper, who despite being barely educated and not knowing much English, used to tell us which books to buy and which to avoid? Do you remember the pleasure of spending the last of our pocket money in the middle of the month on books and rushing home to read who it belonged to and creating stories of how this book must have left their hands and come into ours? Ah those were really good days weren\u2019t they my friend? I remember that shop keeper very well and how he knew that we didn\u2019t have much money and used to tell us to borrow it instead of buying it and how he kept books for us, those that he knew would be of interest to us, telling the other buyers that it was sold out! He was a gem of a man, wasn\u2019t he? And do you remember our going to the Sunday flea market to get books at a real pittance, haggling with those vendors, who knew us so well that they would haggle only for fun? And then on coming home, I remember that I used to rush to write of a letter to my friends on my purchases and other experiences and how like the best friend that you are, you would go readily to their addresses and bring back their replies that I would be waiting for. Treasures they were and still are, lying in the bookshelves of my home, waiting to be perused again, read again and treasured again.This book talks about all that and more. It is a wonderfully lyrical ode to both books and letter writing. While it is written around the aftermath of WWII, I believe that emotions expressed in this book is applicable to all times. The characters of this book are common people like you and me, with the usual likes and dislikes. The only difference being that they have withstood the war and are actually limping back to life. The prose as I said is lyrical and doesn\u2019t falter one bit to hold the reader\u2019s attention. In fact, you would want to read it as you would sip wine while you are out wine tasting; gently, sip by sip, filling your mouth and allowing it to flow to all corners and then swallowing it, so be sure my friend to allow each page, each para, each word to be experienced by all corners of your mind and soul and you will see just what a beautiful book this is. Like with any person, these letters contain joy, sorrow, heartbreak and love, in various forms. While reading it, I remembered what a faithful friend you were to listen quietly to my heart\u2019s pouring and gave me such peace of mind. Whether it was the first tingly feelings of a crush or the angst and glory of being in love or even the pain and sorrow of heartbreak, you my friend were the first to know. Like a soothing balm you helped me get over each experience of mine, if it was bad and at the same time, you were the first to rejoice if it was a good one. Through this book, I realized that it was not just me but so many others who you have helped by just being you and I am both humbled and elated at having had you as my friend. Though modern communication systems have ensured that we are well connected with our loved ones, my dear friend, you shall be always cherished by me, merely because the pleasure and beauty of that angst and exhilaration in writing, waiting and receiving, is no longer there today.As much as I want to set time back again to ensure that you live gloriously, I know in my heart that it is no longer possible. However, dear friend, do not fret for you will always stay alive through the medium of books as long as there are authors who write in ode to you and your beauty.It's farewell now my friend but I bid you adieu with the promise that you won\u2019t lie forgotten for long and I shall give you the place you deserve in my heart and mind.Your ever loving and faithful friend,Srividya"}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "4.25\u2605A group of connected stories told via letters about \"how [people] held on hard to [their] kindness and [their] courage.\"Thirty-five of my GR friends have read this book, thirty-two of their ratings were 4 or 5 stars.

Since its release, The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society has been an international bestseller. Long standing fans such as myself (I first read the book in 2010) can finally get excited over the release of the much anticipated film. I exclaimed a great squeal of delight when I received a wonderful book package in the mail from publisher Allen and Unwin, which contained this surprise book. The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society has been re-released with a spanking new film tie-in cover.The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society takes the reader to 1946, the war has just ended and Juliet Ashton, a novelist, has a case of writer\u2019s block. Luck comes Juliet\u2019s way and breaks her spell of writer\u2019s block when she receives a letter from a gentleman named Dawsey Adams. Dawsey\u2019s letter comes all the way from the English Channel Islands, more specifically from the island of Guernsey. In his letter to Juliet, Dawsey reveals how he came across her name inscribed in a second hand book. So begins a long line of correspondence between the two and in time, with the other eclectic members of The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society, a secret society formed during the German occupation on the small island. A deep affection forms between Juliet, Dawsey and the various society members. In their letters, secrets, life stories, an appreciation of literature and life on the island is expressed. Eventually it spurns Juliet\u2019s decision to visit Guernsey and finally become a part of the world that has been presented to her via the letters she has received. It is a life changing experience for Juliet and the people of Guernsey.I will let you in on a bookworm secret\u2026 in my lifetime of reading I have re-read only a handful of books. I take the viewpoint that as a seasoned bookworm there are just so many books to read on my shelves that I simply do not have the time for re-reads. I also worry that if I re-read a book, it will never produce the same wondrous experience as my first encounter with the book. Anyhow, I digress. I first read The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society in 2010. At this point in my bookworm career I rarely read anything outside the historical genre. I was going through a spell of devouring anything that resembled a World War II story (I blame The Bronze Horseman, my favourite book of all time for this). As it stands, I still believe The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society is the best example of an epistolary book I ever have read. My re-read confirmed this fact.It was a surreal experience to engage in a re-read, but I am appreciative of the kindness of the publisher, Allen and Unwin, who gifted me this title in a recent book parcel. I have been eagerly awaiting the film version of this book (released April 19th in Australia). I will be sure to pay a visit very soon to my local movie theatre, to see how my love for this book has transferred to the screen. In the meantime, my re-read was a swift one but I was reminded of just how perfectly The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society captures the community of Guernsey and their heartbreaking war time experiences.Although The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society is tinged with moments of sadness and heartbreak. However, there are poignant moments of peace, inspiration, courage and hope. There are also many instances when the delightful character set made me laugh. The relationships highlighted in the novel were filled with a deep sense of community spirit. Often I felt like I was a beloved chum of this warm and engaging group. I loved the set up of this novel, especially the ingenuity of the people of Guernsey, who in an act of defiance and self protection, work together to form the society. The added bonus of the linked literature references sprinkled through this novel are a true delight, especially for a booklover.I loved the insertion of Juliet and the pivotal role she plays in the relay of stories to arise from the Guernsey war experience. In these exchanges between Juliet and the Guernsey crew, what comes across strongly is the mixture between the stiff British upper lip, the stoicism and an unwillingness to sink into defeat, despite the fact that times were extremely tough. We are given a great insight into the difficulties, restrictions, danger and deep oppression experienced by the people of Guernsey as a direct result of the German occupation. But somehow they banded together, overcame their situation and made the best of things.As I have mentioned, the letter aspect of The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society is what makes this novel truly special. I do not think I have come across a novel since my 2010 experience of this book that has come close to capturing the magic of this novel. The letters in this novel are a mixture of informal and formal, short and lengthy, from a variety of character voices. Peppered in between the letters are telegrams and cables that contribute perfectly to the unfolding storyline. I loved the echoes to yesteryear that the role the letters presented within The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society.Readers of The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society will find plenty to keep their hearts and minds busy. From a thorough overview of the German occupation of the English Channel Islands, through to heartbreaking stories of loss, the acts of heroism, the gentle thread of romance and the enchanting friendships that bloom in the face of such adversity. It is no wonder that The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society has endured and has remained high on the list of many top 100 books you must read since it was released. A one of a kind novel.*I wish to thank Allen & Unwin for providing me with a free copy of this book for review purposes."}], "description": "Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.\u201cI wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\u201d January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she\u2019s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb\u2026. As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends\u2014and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u2014born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island\u2014boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society\u2019s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.", "title": "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6979801-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406668419l/6979801.jpg", "reviews": 42504, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1194527.Mary_Ann_Shaffer", "name": "Mary Ann Shaffer"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/63116.Annie_Barrows", "name": "Annie Barrows"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Romance", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6979801-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2728527-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4666058-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3279999-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36532585", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13219316-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6404106-la-sociedad-literaria-y-el-pastel-de-piel-de-patata-de-guernsey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10296957-the-guernsey-literary-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8125982-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8116091-a-sociedade-liter-ria-da-tarte-de-casca-de-batata", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3708951-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40026602", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29487910-le-cercle-litt-raire-des-amateurs-d-pluchures-de-patates-le-secret-de", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17787430-gone-tomorrow-folly-the-pyramid-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-p", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
