This will likely be a disaster. \u201cI still recall the taste of your tears.Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore.\u201dLike so many young people before me, I always thought that sixteen was going to be my year. I was absolutely convinced that my life was going to irrevocably change within those 365 days. And it did! My life changed exponentially that year, it just didn\u2019t change quite the way I always dreamt it would. I was at a friend\u2019s party when he walked into the room. Ruggedly handsome, with startling blue eyes, slightly crooked front teeth and a shock of dark brown hair artfully spiked up in the fashion of the day. A singer in a local metal band; he had tattoos, scars and an almost palpable aura of anger. He fascinated me, and when he turned those gorgeous blue eyes my way he would change my life forever. It was this beautiful, angry young man who first put a copy of Lost Souls by Poppy Z. Brite into my trusting hands. (Like Jess\u2019s ex fianc\u00e9 this was his favourite book and he talked about it constantly.) In great sleep-depriving bites, I devoured it. This deranged novel about a teenage boy who meets a trio of vampires and becomes consumed by them. I don\u2019t remember feeling the irony at that time, but in hindsight it\u2019s undeniable, that this larger than life creature would put a book about a troubled young man named \u2018Nothing\u2019 into the hands of a sixteen year old girl who felt like nothing.  \u201cYou always were the one to show me howBack then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.This thing is slowly taking me apart.Grey would be the color if I had a heart.\u201d  I could never figure out what he saw in me back then. When I looked in the mirror all I saw was a reflection of disappointment in resigned grey eyes, limp blonde hair and too-wide hips. Here was this God of a man (I taste bile in my throat even thinking this now but at the time it was true) telling me he loved me \u2013 a hundred times a day \u2013 and that I was his everything. This man who turned heads in every room we entered, who commanded so much attention that there was rarely any left for anyone else. And he had this way of making me feel guilty if anyone paid more attention to me than him, he was poisonously jealous. Any time a boy talked to me, even if he was a mutual friend of ours, he would become crazed. Quizzing me about it at the best of times. Screaming into my face and punching walls at it's worst. I fell in love with Lost Souls the same way I fell in love with him, entirely and without precedent. This dark, deranged parody of love. Consuming because it is both foreign and familiar. It\u2019s a story as old as time. Obsession. Destruction. Dark monsters that come out of the woodwork when you are too exhausted to fight them, so instead you embrace them. Call them lovers and friends, when really they are eating you alive. Just like the darkness inside you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a very good job of explaining why I love this novel, and always will. I think rather I may have inadvertently explained why I SHOULD probably hate this book. And all the poison and toxicity that even thinking of it brings back, like a dark blue bruise that is slowly fading to greens and yellows along the edges but still hurts like hell when you stare too hard at it. But I don\u2019t hate it and I can\u2019t hate it; any more than I can hate the sad-eyed girl with the fake smile staring back at me from pictures I keep in a box in my closet. This book is a part of me, and maybe that part is a little ugly and a lot terrifying but I can\u2019t deny that whenever I see this book on my shelf I run my finger along its binding and remind myself of that innocent sixteen year old girl. And what happened when she let someone make her their everything\u2026.\nNight is the hardest time to be alive, and four a.m. knows all my secrets.\n  \u201cIn this place it seems like such a shame.Though it all looks different now,I know it's still the sameEverywhere I look you're all I see.Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be.\u201d (Lyrics from \u2018Something I Can Never Have\u2019 by Nine Inch Nails)"}, {"userName": "Brendan Detzner", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/514539-brendan-detzner", "userReview": "A crazy, almost plotless explosion of violence, wanderlust, and sexual energy, written when the author was nineteen and possibly a little nuts.

I'm up for a personal review I think.My human bestie counts this book as her favorite, so when I saw it on sale for $2 on a visit to 2nd & Charles, I snagged it.Because it is my human bestie's favorite book, she and I have had many conversations about why. What it is about this particular book that is so important to her and why she always looks back on it with that reverence reserved for only the best of the best, those rare books that somehow help define who we are or who we were or give our souls shapes and colors and flair. For me, that book is The Stranger, for Karly, it is this one.And I cannot say that this book affected me the same way it affected her, just as she can't say the same about my favorite. But I do understand more of why this book is her favorite. And in a weird way, this book affected me similarly.This is a vampire book. An old school vampire book. These vampires do not sparkle. They do not wear black lace and ruby amulets. They do not don mullets and ride around Santa Barbara on motorcycles. They do not double as zombies. They do not turn into bats or live in Transylvania. They don't play in rock bands with snakes around their necks. No brooding. No capes. No haunted houses.These vampires break into people's lives and wreak all sorts of havoc. These vampires kill without mercy and without remorse. They drink blood and green chartreuse and party and fuck anything and everything. These vampires truly have no souls. There is nothing but emptiness. Nothing.Then these vampires meet a young runaway named Nothing. At first he is simply there, an easy target. A kid full of shame and self-loathing who epitomizes the early 90s goth scene. He doesn't fit in with his family or his friends. He feels so different and has no idea why. When the vampires Molochai, Twig, and their enigmatic leader Zillah meet Nothing, they only have their next meal on their minds. But maybe this young, mysteriously beautiful, dark soul has more in common with them than they think. And Nothing finally feels like he belongs to someone, for the first time in his short life. He and Zillah form a bond that is simultaneously beautiful and repellant. All-consuming and destructive, and totally vile, but also there is something there that shines briefly. And I can't really say anything else because spoilers, but those of you who have read this book know exactly what I'm talking about.And that relationship between a vampire and a young goth kid kinda sums up this book. It is totally vile. There are some downright disgusting things at play here. Loathsome and foul. Things that no self-respecting girl likes to read about. But as I read, these things became.....lighter, less foul. Still raw, but somehow less so. And that's something I love in my books, my TV, my movies, my music. That fine line between two strong energies. Once it happened here, this book naturally started to pick up for me and show me its magic. Because this book is a vampire book, but its more than a vampire book. It's not really horror or paranormal. It's a book about identity. About finding yourself. Making mistakes and living with them. It's about those places deep inside you that you don't like people to see. That darkness which lives in each of us. It's about those who succumb to that darkness and those who rise above it. Each character has a darkness and a light inside of them and it became fascinating to see which characters embraced the darkness and which characters embraced the light. And the darkness and the light meant so much more than just \"good\" and \"bad\" and those blurry lines that realization created was the meat and potatoes of this story.And these themes that this book embraces really spoke to me as I was reading. When I got about 50 pages in, something about this story seemed familiar. Almost too familiar. But I knew I had never read this story before. I was texting Karly asking her if it had become a movie or a TV show or a stupid TV miniseries. I kept reading but couldn't figure out how I knew it. About a third of the way through I was introduced to a character, a very unique albino character, and before I even got the story about this character I knew how this character would meet his end. How in the hell does that happen?That's when I realized that not only is this my best friend's favorite book, it was also the favorite book of the man who almost became my husband. And he used to talk about it all the time which is why it became so familiar to me. It was the book he read when he was in school and throughout his life. It was a book that epitomized his childhood, and he is a man who has struggled with that inner darkness and his inner demons his entire life. So reading the remainder of this novel knowing what it meant to the man I used to love most in this world was a bit cathartic and a bit weird but also eye-opening. So though I found parts of this story repugnant and awful, this story forced me to read it through the glasses of the woman I was a decade ago when he and I were engaged. I was the art student who listened to Type O Negative and Bauhaus records on repeat. I smoked hash out of a homemade grafittied steamroller called \"The Stinger.\" I drank and did pills every day. I wore tons of dark eyeliner and read The Stranger. I had no idea who I was nor who I wanted to be. And I was set to marry a man with even more demons than I had. And in retrospect, I know now that our relationship was doomed to fail even before his drug addiction tore us both apart. This book helped me recognize the darkness that was inside him the entire time. He was not a character like Ghost, who retained his cracked but pure inner beauty, but rather Ann, who took her experiences and let them turn her. Ghost is the only character in this book who epitomized hope. Life struck him down, and he was a character who was more sensitive than most. And Ghost at first seemed fragile, but had a strength in him that every other character lacked. Ann started out strong, but let her inner demons control her, causing her to make bad choices, choices that in the end, forced the demons to eat her alive. This part of the story broke my heart, because it was too reminiscent of the demise of the person I used to be and the life I used to live.So yeah, this book..... It is a story that opened up something inside of me. Something raw and hidden. Something I wasn't expecting. This book embraces that whole 90s goth culture perfectly, but also captures the culture of New Orleans, a dark, seedy New Orleans that hides in the shadows. So that dark and twisty girl from ten years ago eats this for breakfast lunch and dinner. But the girl I am today probably would have blown it off. So this 4 stars is built of nostalgia and darkness and memories of a life already lived. I will always remember this book and keep it with me always, but I most likely will never read it again. I have it stashed somewhere with that past life, and that is where it needs to stay.4 bittersweet stars"}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "I totally crapped out on this buddy read.

All driving must take place under the influence of alcohol (and all alcohol must either be chartreuse or absinthe), especially when the character behind the wheel is underage; all sex must be homosexual or non-consensual (and preferably both); every scene must contain reference to either David Bowie, or an obvious goth band (Bauhaus, Sisters of Mercy...).I finished reading this book because it meant so much to a very dear friend of mine...but suffice it to say, it's been (and will continue to be) my last foray into Poppy Z.

I needed someone to relate to in those days, I needed to know that I was not alone in this crazy, fucked-up world, and then I met Nothing. I traveled with him on his journey, meeting Zillah - a perfect, deadly, damnable, heartbreaking, irresistible bastard - and fell as much in love with him as Nothing did, living vicariously through him as he drank blood, smoked opium, and savored the taste of home on Zillah's tongue. I met Christian and saw into the darkness of his soul, peering through his eyes to witness the melancholy of eternal existence with only your memories to keep you company. I loved him too, much as I loved Ghost for being a young man with an old soul, fair-haired and extraordinary, willing to sacrifice everything for the bits of ordinary he had to hold onto, like Steve. Steve, the brash, crude musician - I didn't like him any more than I liked Anne, she in all her desperation to find something beautiful to leech onto. I wanted to feel for her, but honestly couldn't blame Zillah when he tossed her aside, having no use for her once her body had indulged his hedonistic pleasures. Zillah, with eyes green as limes, as green as the last drop of Chartreuse in the bottle.

Brite's novels. Of course I didn't do that, but the mental image conjoured up by this novel couldn't be a stronger draw. It is the first of PzB's novels to feature the loveable twosome of Steve and Ghost and it is the only novel to feature the fabulous character of Nothing.

Now, I haven\u2019t read Twilight, but I do have a few acquaintances (significantly younger than I) who can not get their fill of the brooding teen bloodsuckers, and I\u2019ve heard more than my fill of the plots or the groundbreaking nature of the books. Except, you know what? None of it sounds particularly groundbreaking to me, and I have to point out to the fans of this newest vampiric incarnation that much of what they are describing has been done before and\u2013from what excerpts I\u2019ve read of Twilight and the various literary reviews\u2013done better.Since Stoker first published Dracula in 1897, vampires have fascinated readers and writers alike, and vampire fiction has gone through every cycle of life and death imaginable ever since. The vampire literary genre has been declared dead more times than Elvis has been sighted in roadside diners. And just when you count (pun entirely intended) the bloodsuckers out, someone slips through and breathes new life into the old beast. George R.R. Martin wrote the fascinating Fevre Dream and in the process re-imagined what everyone thought of as vampires. And of course Anne Rice, in her overly verbose way, created one of the literary world\u2019s most enduring vampires in Lestat from her wildly successful Vampire Chronicles series of novels. And then the genre once again lapsed into a coma, every vampire thereafter becoming a deeply affected, brooding, depressive, sexually ambiguous prettyboy who tended to whine over every little problem being undead brought along. Once again, the vampire became anemic in its portrayal, and the world again decried that there could be nothing new. And then, in 1992, up-and-coming short story horror writer Poppy Z. Brite surprised everyone by spinning the vampire lore on its head with her remarkable debut novel, Lost Souls.The plot of Lost Souls really is very simple. Zillah and his vampire cohorts Molochai and Twin, venture into an off-the-beaten path bar in New Orleans where Zillah becomes enamored with a young girl, brooding and dressed all in black, who has been waiting for the vampires\u2013any vampires\u2013to come for her. After a few nights of passion, Zillah and his pals disappear into the night, leaving the girl devastated that they hadn\u2019t taken her with them, or better yet, turned her into one of them. She returns to the bar night after night, week after week and month after month, as Zillah\u2019s baby grows in her stomach, and the bar\u2019s kindly owner Christian\u2013who knows a thing or two about vampires\u2013looks after her. When the baby finally tears its way through her body, the girl\u2019s life ends and Christian leaves the young baby on the doorstep of a family as far from New Orleans as he can manage. Flash forward 15 years, and that child has grown into a young man, someone who doesn\u2019t know why he is different from everyone else, why his heart is filled with a longing to find where he truly belongs. His name is Jason, but he calls himself Nothing because that is what he feels like in his parent\u2019s Wonder Bread world, and that was the name given him in the note left pinned to his blanket when he was left at his adoptive parents\u2019 door: His name is Nothing. Care for him and he will bring you luck. It is when Nothing discovers the note and the fact that he was adopted that he decides to find who he truly is, where he truly belongs and he goes on a road trip headed\u2026well, headed wherever the road takes him.As Nothing goes on his journey, we also catch up again with Zillah his crew as they drink chartreuse and eat Ho-Hos and revel in the joy of being young and eternal. In short, they relish being vampires. No regrets, no brooding angst here. We also get a third road trip as we meet Steve\u2013a shit-kicker from South Carolina\u2013and his best friend Ghost\u2013a painfully thin young man with psychic abilities\u2013as the two do a mini-tour as Lost Souls, a rock band that has developed a cult-like following amongst the disaffected and outcast goth youth. And one of those youths just happens to be Nothing. It is then that we realize that these three different road trips will all come crashing together, and we\u2019re fascinated to see just how Brite manages it.What made Brite\u2019s vampires so groundbreaking is the blend of the gothic scene, vampiric lore, and honest to god real people with real depth and emotion. Brite threw out most of the vampire clich\u00e9s, however. Brite\u2019s boys have no problem with sunlight, and their fangs have been bred out of them, forcing them to file their teeth into sharp points, and\u2013in a really nice turn\u2013the appealing bad boy Zillah is not some tall lanky creature and his cohorts are not ultra cunning. Zillah is short, but still enigmatic and charming, and Molochai and Twig\u2026well, let\u2019s just say that the vampiric chandelier has had brighter bulbs. The vampires here of course love blood, but they revel just as easily in the haze of alcohol and drugs and the taste of each others\u2019 bodies. And Brite did something else that hadn\u2019t been done before\u2026.she didn\u2019t mince words one bit when it came to her character\u2019s sexuality. Unlike Rice who cloaked her characters in a mist of homoeroticism, Brite went balls-out and made her vampires bi-sexual or gay, the body being one of the extreme pleasures in life that shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against. Brite (who has admittedly never read Ann Rice, despite claims by many that she had to be influenced by her) also threw out the verbosity that had choked the genre, making her prose clean and crisp and evocative. She created not only the feelings of her characters in precise ways, but also used her words to capture the sights and smells and essence of her settings, each locale becoming a character in its own right. She veered into purple prose upon occasion, but the images she created were stunning and utterly true in every way.But the characters she created are the heart of the story. Nothing\u2019s longing to learn who he is and where he comes from is palpable. It\u2019s not so very different from the feelings most adopted children feel when they lean their parents are not who they believed them to be. The childlike joy in the vampires Molochai and Twig is infectious, as is the viciousness and pride Zillah takes in being omnipotent, or so he thinks. And while all the characters resonated with readers, none were quite as appealing as Steve and Ghost. There is so much love between these two men and so strong is the need for them to be there for, and to protect, one another, that their relationship transcend brotherhood and friendship. The dynamic is so utterly real that one even began to wonder if Steve and Ghost were ever more to one another than just friends. The relationship Brite created between these two men was erection inducing for a lot of us. We wanted to see these two together, but this was not some calculated trick of Brite\u2019s. She simply wrote two men who would be lost souls without each other, and we the reader just wanted (and in some cases needed) it to go beyond that. It was masterful, and years later\u2013because the topic was such a fervent one amongst Brite\u2019s fans\u2013she would answer the question as to whether Steve and Ghost\u2019s relationship was ever more than just friends in a limited edition chapbook (no longer available).In the end, Brite re-wrote the book on vampires. She blended splatterpunk and the gothic scene and vampire mythology into an excellent character study about finding who you are and how you fit in. It\u2019s a story of self-discovery and the building of families and for once it was a story that spoke to and included my kind, gay people, in an unabashed, unapologetic way. There was nothing wrong with being gay any more than there was anything wrong with being a vampire; it all comes down to each person and how they react and treat others.Unfortunately, many stood on Brite\u2019s shoulder\u2019s after Lost Souls, and the literary world was so glutted with vampire-meets-goth-rock novels, that those new to the novel often find it clich\u00e9. But, as I like to remind people, when Brite wrote the work, most of this was new and exciting. It has only become clich\u00e9 because of the pale imitations that followed. So when your niece or nephew comes to you to rave about Twilight, tell them they don\u2019t know Nothing\u2026or his father\u2026or his favorite band, Lost Souls, all of whom have been there and done that\u2026likely before they were born.Originally reviewed for Uniquely Pleasurable."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18711982-kristin", "userReview": "[Wallace described thrusting up into his daughter (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4816194-debra", "userReview": "Stephen King endorsed the entire Dell Abyss Horror line.

I figured jaded me would soon tire of the gothic kids but I think I enjoyed this even more the second time around. I don't, however, remember being struck by the fact during my first reading the only female character in the story was a victimized, bewitched, weak-willed 20-something with horrible taste in men.

Nearly every page is wrought with sensual descriptions of booze, blood, food, flesh, boy love and the music of Bauhaus, as Brite's cast prowls for spiritual and physical satiation in the American South. Centered around several road trips to New Orleans, the conflict that eventually emerges is between an (unsigned) alt-rock duo and a van full of Dionysian vampires who may as well be on furlough from a William S. Burroughs cut-up. Neither sides are particularly heroic, the closest thing to an innocent being an asexual space cadet clairvoyant named Ghost. Over-written passages abound and the romanticization of alcoholism is out of control, but much of Brite's descriptions melt well on the tongue. What I liked best is that Lost Souls serves as a time capsule of the early nineties, a quaint time when music still felt like it had the power to be subversive, and when nipple piercings, tattoos, ankhs and boys with black lipstick still seemed edgy."}, {"userName": "Juushika", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika", "userReview": "Fifteen-year-old Nothing runs away from his adoptive home and falls in with three vampires, one of whom is his unwitting father. In a haze of drugs, sex, and blood drinking, Nothing is drawn closer to New Orleans and the climactic events that will reveal his past and determine his future. Lost Souls is indulgent and gratuitous to the extreme, which will either delight or disgust the reader. Personally, I loved it\u0097and though I preferred the concept to the actual plot, I found Lost Souls visceral, darkly intriguing, and difficult to put down. It's a bit over the top and perhaps not a piece of \"great\" literature, but I heartily recommend it.To be quite honest, Lost Souls feels like a combination of the self-indulgent, gratuitous content of fan fiction and the skill and editing of a published book. It is an playground of sin: lush sexuality and frequent homosexual relationships, incest, teenage sexuality, unapologetic amorality, angst, plentiful violence and blood drinking, drug use, goth kids, punk kids, rock bands, vampires, and New Orleans, all of it so gratuitous that it nearly become an art form. It's over the top and hardly subtle, yet Brite writes well. Her prose is sometimes florid, but it is evocative, visceral, and as lush as the content. She creates a cast of vivid, intriguing characters and weaves their disparate lives into a single story. Sadly, the plot veers away at the end of the book, doing a disservice to one character and straying too far from Nothing and his family\u0097but the story is often intriguing and always competent, and it will keep the reader interested and engaged until the end.Brite is not the most subtle or most gifted author, but she writes rich prose and a strong story. As a result, her book revels in gratuitous content rather than being dragged down by it. That may not appeal to everyone, and perhaps it prevents the book from being truly \"great,\" but the reader who enjoys it will find Lost Souls a gleefully indulgent bit of wish fulfillment. Personally, I loved the combination of content and style, and I throughly enjoyed the book. I fell in love with the characters (especially Zillah), enjoyed the glut of blood and sex and angst, and found the prose so visceral that it triggered physical reactions. I did enjoy the premise more than the actual plot, and so I preferred the first half of the book. Nonetheless: Lost Souls is a wholly immoderate, indulgent vampire story, and my inner hedonist adored it. I recommend it to anyone attracted to the premise\u0097pick it up and read the first couple of pages, and it will soon be apparent if this is the sort of book you'll love or hate."}, {"userName": "Andrea Poulain", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7459473-andrea-poulain", "userReview": "http://cuevadelescritor.blogspot.mx/2...La m\u00fasica de los vampiros es un libro crudo, crud\u00edsimo, no apto para personas sensibles.

I loved this book, i loved the semen, i loved the gothic girl in the bar, loved the purple glasses, the velvet clothes, the incest, the love, the rock'n'roll, the chocoalteness in Molochai, the chartreuse as green as limes (oh who can forget!) and the descriptive way in which Poppy Z.

As you can see, the above should tell you that Lost Souls influenced my teenage upringings; took this favourite book beyond fiction and portrayed myself at times like these characters.After i finished reading the book, i went into a mini-depression as i was undoubtedly torned that the story had forever finished and i was to return the book to the Central Library.Years later, i went to a Mormon thrift store, just admiring the antiques, when all of a sudden i saw it! Oh, did i see it! Right there, so lonely and only 98 cents! Lost Souls! I now hold this novel in my little book shelf along with Exquisite Corpse (must read!) & Drawing Blood (re-reading).I am now 20 years old & i am glad that i read this book at 14.Lastly, I can see why most reviewers are a bit saddened that they read Lost Souls as adults, but i am sure Lost Souls is still a good read for teens and adults looking for that horny-ness pleasure."}, {"userName": "Fenriz Angelo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29834721-fenriz-angelo", "userReview": "It is very dark i guess I'd have loved it if i were the 12yo goth kid i used to be.

I mean that must be boring after so long right?.There's some pretty fucked up shit here, like incest, rape (lots of it IMHO) and i felt concerned about the girl, Ann. She suffered a lot throught the book and her friends' reactions was a little disturbing :s that's what bothered me most of the book tbh. I think Poppy does a great job providing good horror and vampires.

So I went \"home\" to work it out. I was lost, I was overly dramatic. I was totally seduced by Brite's nihilistic characters. But now I'm 36, I have a child and a life and some much more grown up sensibilities (though I don't feel like a grown up really), and it reads totally differently. I'm not the target audience any more. The nihilism feels lie immature stupidity, all the party-party-drink-fuck-blood-fuck-party-drugs stuff just seems empty and wasteful. I don't really find any of the characters likeable any more (except Ghost - I still love Ghost). It just all feels... shallow. But I loved it when I was 21. So maybe it's just a sign of how far I have come. And I do have to say that PZB's language is still gorgeous. It drips. Beautiful writing. I just... I guess it's no longer a story to which I relate. And maybe that's a good thing. :)"}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5469695-darlene", "userReview": "I received this audiobook for review from Crossroad Press through Audiobook Jukebox's Solid Gold Reviewer Program. I did not receive any compensation for my review, and the views expressed herein are my own. I love vampires, and I love audiobooks \u2013 so I jumped at the chance to review a vampire audiobook! It was not at all what I expected.Lost Souls is about three androgynous bisexual (although mostly homosexual) vampires: Zillah (the leader) and his two sidekicks (Molochai and Twig). They come to New Orleans to party during Mardi Gras and they come across a bar that is owned by a vampire named Christian. There is an underage human girl (Jessy) at the bar, and she winds up having sex with Zillah while Christian has sex with Molochai and Twig. Jessy discovers that she is pregnant long after Zillah and his cronies have left New Orleans. Knowing that human females tend to not survive vampire childbirths, Christian takes Jessy in and has a sexual relationship with her throughout her pregnancy. She does indeed die during childbirth and has a boy whom Christian names \u201cNothing.\u201d Hoping to spare him of his destiny, Christian leaves Nothing on a doorstep and hopes the couple will love him as their own and that Nothing will never know of his true identity.The book then jumps ahead 15 years when Nothing is a teenager, and he feels that he is totally misunderstood. He decides to run away and find the singers of a band whom he idolizes, and he hitches rides to the town where they live. He turns some tricks here and there, and then is picked up by Zillah, Molochai, and Twig. The vampire trio first intended to drain him, but instead have sex with him. Yes, that\u2019s right...Zillah has sex with his son, unbeknownst to him.From here, the book continues on a downward spiral. This was not so much a vampire story, but more a story of getting high, getting drunk, and getting laid. I am a pretty open-minded person, and I wasn\u2019t so much bothered by the M/M and M/M/M and even M/M/M/M action \u2013 different strokes for different folks and all that. I am not one to judge, and it takes a lot to shock me. But it did really bother me when Zillah and Nothing hooked up. But wait, it gets worse: They do eventually discover that Zillah is Nothing\u2019s father, but they still continue having a sexual relationship! And Christian even tries to justify it saying that there are so few of their race left and that, if they can make each other happy, why not? Ok, this is disturbing. Christian also eventually has sex with Nothing, which brings on a whole new level of \u201cewwwwww\u201d since he had sex with Nothing\u2019s mother and is now having sex with her son.Let's recap: This book contains teenage prostitution, incest, sex with minors (statutory rape), and there was even an incident of rape. There was also another occurrence of incest, this time father/daughter, that I won\u2019t even go into because it was just too offensive.I did not find this book entertaining. I found it dark and disturbing. It was not at all what I expected, and I will be steering clear of this author in the future!The narrator, Chris Patton, did a fine job with the book. His voice was clear and expressive, and he was probably what kept me listening despite the book\u2019s content.MY RATING: 1 star. I did not enjoy it at all. This was not for me."}, {"userName": "Tobin Elliott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/624440-tobin-elliott", "userReview": "Twenty-five years after my first reading, I decided to dive back into this one again. I remember little about the first read other than not being that impressed and not knowing what to think about all that \"gay stuff\" that I read.All this time later, I like to think I'm more mature and understanding with the \"gay stuff\"...and no, I don't call it that anymore. And this time around, I was impressed with what I read.For the sake of clarity, though I know Poppy Z. Brite, female at the time of the release of this novel, is now Billy Martin and prefers masculine tags, I'm going to stick with \"she\" for the review, as it does refer to Martin 25 years earlier.To be clear, the novel is not without its faults, but, if what I've read is true and this story was written when Brite was just 19, then it's almost impossible for it not to have some awkward moments.It is, of course, much less shocking that it would have been upon its release, but I still applaud Brite for taking it in some of the directions she did. I can't think of another novel that so perfectly captures the vacuous emptiness of the Eighties and the directionless morbidity of America's youth at the time. Tying in the music of Bowie, Bauhaus, and the Cure, and the poetry of Dylan Thomas, it helped set the mood and the tone for the story.As others have mentioned, there's little plot, at times feeling like an Eighties vampiric version of Kerouac's On The Road. But if I had to compare it to any other works, I'd say it's a mashup of the New Orleans atmosphere of Anne Rice, without all the boring shit (which is most of Anne Rice), the carnal sensuality of Clive Barker, the casual violence of John Skipp and Craig Spector, and the confused, nihilistic youth of S.E. Hinton. That's quite a punch.Could the story have been laid out a bit better? Yes. But overall, the word choice, the ideas, the examination of youth...all of it...gorgeous. The movie The Lost Boys only wishes it had this much depth and soul.Well done."}, {"userName": "Zachary Hanes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4761925-zachary-hanes", "userReview": "Young Poppy Z. Brite truly outdid herself with this book. Though currently shunned by herself to this day, I find inspiration within it. Where else could I go to read about my favorite bands? Bauhaus, The Cramps, Cocteau Twins, The Cure, all of which play a huge role in who I am. This story is told through several characters throughout the story whose path's coincidentally cross several times. In fact, the whole story is one big coincidence. We follow an inspirational band, three party going vampires, and one child, named Nothing. Nothing's life feels empty so he runs away from home to visit a band called Lost Souls. (Consisting of Steve and Ghost) Along the hard going journey he \"shoots up\" with a biker, blows a 'messenger of God,' hitches a ride in a black van, eats his only tie to the past, and gets blazed out of his mind with opium. The Occupants of the van (Zillah, Twig, and Malochai) are vampires and they sneak into the house of Lost Souls and huge conflict arises between the two parties, Eventually it is told that Zillah is Nothing's father, Zillah also impregnates Steves girlfriend which causes the bloodied ending of this book. I absolutely loved Brendans Review so I'm going to quote him on it because it is so true. They \"Meet up, split up, meet up again, kill eachother, have sex, kill eachother while having sex, get lonely, do drugs, and so on\" An absolutely splended read for a young mind into the gothic subculture, which I'm sure has died out in todays youth some time ago. I myself am 15 years of age and my relationship with my friend is that of Nothing and Laine, myself being Laine, oh if only I knew a girl that looked like Robert Smith.."}, {"userName": "Madeline Knight-Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5518809-madeline-knight-dixon", "userReview": "There\u2019s a reason that most of the best vampire novels are not part of the mass media; because they\u2019re dark, fucked up, and would make most people cringe. That\u2019s how this book is. If you like things like Twilight or The Vampire Diaries (I\u2019ll say softer vampires, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with them) I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. If however you like things like Dracula, True Blood, or Anne Rice, you will be obsessed with this book.It practically drips with sensuality, but the kind of sexual imagery that makes you uncomfortable. Something about the incestuous relationship completely unnerves you, and yet you can\u2019t help being drawn to it. There\u2019s no concrete sexuality, or even identity, which I find really relevant to the gender-fluid ideas of this generation.Of course, they\u2019re badass vampires. The rip people apart, use people up, murder, seduce, indulge. This book is everything you want every vampire movie you\u2019ve ever watched to be, minus the bad filming and terrible acting. It\u2019s dark, and introspective, and completely obsessed with the idea of restless youth. When reading it, you can\u2019t help but remember all the angsty feelings you\u2019ve ever had-angry that no one understands, superior because no one understands, alone because no one understands, and that beautiful moment of epiphany when you DO find \u201cyour real family\u201d.I think I could go on about this book for another\u2026 six paragraphs. But instead I\u2019ll just say that if you\u2019re invested in vampire literature/culture, this is definitely a staple to that canon in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Corinne Stoppelli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012278-corinne-stoppelli", "userReview": "Dans son au coeur de la Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans, Christian, cr\u00e9ature myst\u00e9rieuse et centenaire, re\u00e7oit la visite d\u2019une adolescente \u00e9trange.
