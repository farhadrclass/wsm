Her sister, Nancy, is a big film buff and she hopes to see some movie stars there. When they get to the canteen Catherine meets a young soldier (Johnny Danza, 25) who is friends with her father and is in his squadron. They dance and talk for some of the night. Johnny finds out Catherine\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Douglas, is currently fighting in the war. Catherine\u2019s family is sad because their father has enlisted in the war and he will be leaving tomorrow along with Johnny, so this will be their last night together for a while. Later that night, when Catherine goes home she finds out her fianc\u00e9 Douglas has been killed at war. As time goes by, while Johnny and her father are overseas, Catherine begins to correspond/write to her friend (Johnny) she met from the canteen. They begin to know each other through their letters. Then, one day, Johnny arrives on her doorstep with injuries. He was sent home to recuperate but, unknown to Catherine, due to his injuries Johnny can no longer fight/serve in the army and he is getting an honorable discharge. Catherine has been working in her father\u2019s manufacturing factory while her dad is at war and Johnny eventually begins to work there and help her out. This was a really charming read. It was told from many POV (points of view). It showed how the women of that era dealt with their husbands, fathers, and boyfriends being away at war.I liked Catherine, she was a strong, classy heroine. I thought she did a great job running her father\u2019s factory, even while the men sometimes opposed her (they didn\u2019t like taking orders from a girl/the boss\u2019s daughter.) I also liked Johnny. He was abandoned as a child and went from orphanage to orphanage. But he learned a lot through jobs, working with his hands, experience in the army\u2026 Catherine\u2019s family was likable, I enjoyed the New York City setting.This was a sweet 1940\u2019s romance.Entertaining and helping the troops."}, {"userName": "Saly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3192922-saly", "userReview": "3.5 starsThis was a very different book, very quiet in tone and is set during WWII and shows how the women cope when the men are gone fighting while they hold down the fort. There are loads of letters exchanged in the book between the the heroine's parents, her sister & a soldier & her and Johnny, a solider in her dad's unit. We see the heroine lose her fiancee and how she copes and makes her dad's business flourish, how she faces crap from men because she is a woman. Then Johnny comes home and she nurses him to health and we see deeper feelings develop between them. We also see how despite holding down the fort when the men were gone, the heroine's work isn't appreciated. I liked how the heroine stood up for her rights. All in all a different book, it was not a 100% romance per say."}, {"userName": "SheLove2Read", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708674-shelove2read", "userReview": "This was a really good read about a family during the pivotal wartime years of 1944-1945. The main focus is on the romance between Catherine and her father's GI buddy Johnny. There's also a side romance between her sister Nancy and a sailor she writes to overseas, and Catherine's mother who misses her husband while he serves with Johnny in Europe.Catherine first meets Johnny at a sendoff dance in NYC for GI's heading overseas, including her father. She sparks a friendship with Johnny and promises to write to him so he won't be so lonely. (He's an orphan with no family) After the death of her fiance in France, Johnny's letters become a lifeline to Catherine and slowly help her to heal and to deal with being stateside and the difficulties her family faces with her father gone. Soon the letters blossom into more than friendship and when Johnny returns unexpectedly Stateside, the romance slowly unfolds. Parts of the book are told in letters between the 3 sets of lovers. I especially enjoyed reading these, as sometimes a person will say in a letter what they fear to say face to face.The HEA is well done and not contrived at all. I could easily see the drama unfold after their return stateside and women who have been in charge of families and businesses for years are suddenly thrust back into the role of homemaker."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Eckel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465880-jennifer-eckel", "userReview": "I do not understand how so many people loved this book. I thought it glib and superficial. The characters truly lacked depth. Whenever the author wanted to conjure up the era she dropped a product name into the story. I was horrified that the author (editor shame on you) got important dates wrong. In the early pages the heroine repeatedly sees the movie White Christmas a movie made in 1954! Come on any true movie fan knows that the song White Christmas was introduced in the 1942 movie Holiday Inn. And then another time date error concerns the timing of V-E Day. The novel says that V-E Day was proclaimed the day after Hitler's suicide which would be May 1. The author does no service to the Greatest Generation who fought that war and the children they raised to remember and respect what May 8 (or May 9 in Russia) stood for. This was a defining moment in the war, and getting it wrong would be like saying I know Pearl Harbor was in early December. And who cares what that date of infamy really was. I will not be finishing this series! How sad that this novel is described as historical."}, {"userName": "\u269c\ufe0fTrea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223520-trea", "userReview": "I'd read this several years ago, back when it was part of the Century of American Romance from Harlequin.

This story made me feel as if I was living Cathy's story, experiencing her emotions, and had been taken back to New York in the mid 1940's, during wartime. Can't wait to read others by Ms. Bretton."}, {"userName": "Sharayu Gangurde", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452841-sharayu-gangurde", "userReview": "Reading about war especially World War II triggers something inside me that I can't quite pinpoint to. This is a fictional work about a family from World War II that find their father and fiancee of the daughter on the war front. The author has written about the helplessness of families with such sensitivity that I could not stop myself from getting deeply involved in their stories. Although it's fiction, I feel the letters between the characters and the entire atmosphere of rationing shortages and women working in factories after the men left for war convict such a tragic sense of loss and belonging for humanity from the era. The entire gamut lies in the deep intertwined bonds of wait and living on hope for the war to end between the characters. I loved Catherine and her strength of mind in supporting her family and running her Dad's factory, being in charge of it while he's away at the war. Women like her represent the true capable people that we are underneath all the soft and feminine masquerade we have been associated with since ages. She is trying hard to forget her fiancee's death in the war, writing encouraging letters to her father assuring him of the well being on the home front as well as running his factory and still dealing with the emotions these war years have made her to grow into the person she has become. I could resonate with her resolve to not break down when her mother and younger sister are so easily affected emotionally. I know there were a lot of women who dealt strongly and impassively when they took control of their families during the war. So Cathy is one of my favourite persons from the book. Johnny, the orphan soldier who befriends her father and promises to look after him and ends up wounded while protecting him also is written about sensitively. His recovery and his mental state as being one who's seen as a saviour and therefore indebted to gratitude by Catherine's family and his own state of dilemma at having to return back to a place where he has no home or family waiting for him pierced my heart. It's very rare when we can climb into characters' skin and feel the emotions so personally. Eddie Martin, the guy who couldn't enlist himself for war service because of a physical handicap made me realise the social standing between men and women. Parts of this book is so brilliant and so emotionally gripping that at times I forgot this is a work of fiction which obviously draws a lot from the reality. There's also something about the mental state of veterans who return from war back to their homes as completely changed people. I wish this were given some precedence too in the story. But is it only true that the young recover quickly from signs of distress than the elderly is something I'll never know. It must have been terrifying to find our beloved as changed individuals and I really empathise with the Dad in the story. We can never know what the bad of the war affected them in what ways because we have never experienced it our self. I liked the sensitive representation of people in the book. It indeed was a sentimental journey for me to embark upon because I got so involved with all of them. Also, this is my first Barbara Bretton book. Even though it's a Kindle freebie, I am hoping I find further good works from her to read."}, {"userName": "Melanie S Read", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38508207-melanie-s-read", "userReview": "A Heartwarming RollercoasterThis story brings to life the trials and changes brought a bout by the war.

A Must ReadWhat a wonderful story by Barbara Bretton, one of the best! This book will pull you into the lives of the characters. There is Dot and Tom, parents of Catherine and Nancy. Catherine is going to marry Douglas when he returns from war. The war is going on between United States, Germany and Japan. Tom is going to leave the family and enlist even though Dot does not want him to leave her or the girls. The family goes to a banquet the day before Tom leaves and they meet Johnny who will be leaving with Tom. Catherine does ask Johnny to protect her father while they are away. The next day news comes that Douglas died at war, Catherine is heart broken and Tom hates leaving his daughter after the news yet he has to go. Catherine is taking over the plant that her father owns and writes letters to her father and Johnny. Nancy is writing to a guy named Gerry who is fighting the Vietnamese. Of course Dot is sending letters to her husband Tom. There are months when they do not receive any mail and all they can do is pray for their safe return and the war to be over. Then on Christmas eve Catherine is awakened by a knock on the door, when she opens the door she sees Johnny who is unconscious, she gets him inside and calls the Doctor. Johnny has shrapnel in his chest, infection in his arm and a high fever. The doctor gives directions to Catherine on how to tend to Johnny. When Dot and Nancy come back home they are shocked to see Johnny and they go about trending to him. They locate a letter in Johnny's pocket, it is from Tom and they are elated to find out that he is alive and Johnny saved his life. This is such as great read, you will have to read the book to find out if Tom returns back home, will Johnny pull through, will Nancy meet her pen pal, Gerry, that she has been writing for 2 years, will Catherine find love after losing Douglas? This is A Must read!"}, {"userName": "Dusti Dasilva", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33670994-dusti-dasilva", "userReview": "I was sent this book for an honest review. I was a little weary about this book at first, you see I am going outside of my box and trying to review different genres, and this book makes me so glad that I did. I loved how the author wrote this book, between the letters, to the actually whats happening and conversations, to the newsletters being released. I also loved how it made me feel like I was sitting down with my Grandpa and he was telling me about his time in World War II. It made me smile, and break my heart at the same time. When I first started reading I knew Douglas was going to die, it was a given (the about me part of the book even says so) but it still broke my heart even with knowing it was coming. Catherine is heart broken and the way it not only affects her but her mother and sister is just as sad. Johnny I loved, well until the end when he went \u201cI\u2019m man hear me roar\u201d and decided that the place for Catherine was barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, and NOT working. To me that is who Catherine is now, she ran her father\u2019s business while he was away and improved it, and for her father and fianc\u00e9 to make it seem like she was good enough to run it while they were away at war and not while they are home pissed me off. So while Catherine was pissed at Johnny so was I. and then there is younger sister, Nancy who falls in love with her soldier pen pal. I love her care free attitude. She brought a lightness to the story when it needed it the most. I can\u2019t to read her story!"}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quotes:\u201cNancy had been beside herself. It seemed to Catherine that her little sister had been baptized with stardust and blessed by Max Factor. Nancy pored over her stacks of Photoplay and Modern Screen as if they held the secret of life. Nancy believed in love at first sight, that Clark Gable was the most handsome man in the whole world, and that if she only had Betty Grable\u2019s legs, Rita Hayworth\u2019s hair and Lana Turner\u2019s smile, her happiness would be assured.\u201d\u201cThe war made you feel so powerless. Reports about cities with names that lay strange upon your tongue were made by voices on the radio that had become as familiar as that of your local butcher. It took something like this, the simple act of caring for another human being, to remind you that there was still goodness in a world gone mad.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me that I\u2019m good enough to run a company when there\u2019s a war on, but once peace is declared, I\u2019m just a helpless woman?\u201dMy Review:I had previously read a few of Barbara Bretton's romances, and have always enjoyed her work. This book is so much more than a romance, and while the period of the tale would have been during my mother\u2019s childhood and well before my time, I fully related to the story and loved each character as if I had known them all my life. The writing is insightful, thoughtful, and of high quality.

I blazed through all of Sarah Sundin's novels that are set in WWII and then started looking for more. Bretton's first book in the \"Home Front\" series opens in 1943 and follows the Wilson family: patriarch Tom Wilson is off to war, leaving his wife and two daughters, Cathy and Nancy, behind. But a year later, Johnny Danza, a soldier in Tom's platoon, shows up injured and nearly unconscious on the Wilson's doorstep. As Cathy nurses Johnny back to health, they grow closer each day.I thought \"Sentimental Journey\" started off strong, but came to a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion. For much of this book, there is no conflict between the main characters (Cathy and Johnny). When the inevitable conflict does come, it's at the very end of the book and is solved in half a chapter. Additionally, I just didn't care for Johnny that much. He is a man of his era who wants a wife who \"lives for her husband\" (yep, actual quote from the book). Sure, he comes around to appreciate Cathy's work ethic and personhood in the end, but it happens so quickly it rings false. Perhaps Bretton's follow-up, 'Stranger in Paradise\", is better since it has a slightly older hero and heroine, not the naive, doe-eyed early 20-somethings of \"Sentimental Journey\"."}, {"userName": "Cary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931580-cary", "userReview": "Lots of historical facts thrown into this romance but maybe there was too much it was a slow read."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34180269-michelle", "userReview": "Catherine's fiance is killed in the war. This is a story about her coming to terms with this, her father going to the war, and her little sister writing to a soldier. I liked the time frame. It was a simpler time in some ways, but they difficulties they had to endure, with loved ones going to war, I can't imagine. A soldier that Catherine's father was serving with shows up, wounded, at their door on Christmas eve. There were good descriptions about what would happen after the war. All the women that had been working were expected to now get married and stay home raising kids. Catherine has been running her father's factory in his absence. I felt that the ending was tied up a little too quickly. Also, there was so much in this book about Catherine's sister and her pen pal, if the second book is about them, I don't think I'll even bother reading it."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10947907-leslie", "userReview": "Barbara Bretton is one of my newest favorite authors. This is the 3rd book I've read of her's and each one has been unique but filled with well-developed characters. She has a way of taking you to the time and place with descriptions that make you want to book the next flight out. This story is mainly a romance but is set during the second world war, so there is also drama and the feeling that some of the characters may not return from the war. As a woman, I felt the emotions of what it must have been like to correspond with someone overseas during the war, hoping and praying that person would return.
