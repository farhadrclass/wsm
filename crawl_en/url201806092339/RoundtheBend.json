Shute. I love his work. I have all 22 of the books he wrote from 1920 to 1960. He is probably best known for On the Beach, a post nuclear war doomsday story. Popular at the peak of the Cold War. This story, however, is a great read. I find his work very intense. It is one of those kind of books that you'll be 50 pages into before you know it. I LOVE those kind of books. This is about a mystic in a modern world. Down to earth. Simple. Yet deep. Most of Shute's books are about boy meets girl, boy goes off to war, then reunion. Very formulaic. That said, every book is intriguing and totally enthralling. A teacher friend and I started a Dead Author's Society when I first \"found\" Shute (it was around the time that \"Dead Poet's Society\" came out). Others love him, too. Google Nevil Shute and you'll find fan clubs from around the world."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon", "userReview": "I confess I don't know how Nevil Shute does it. This novel, written about 1951, purports to be the autobiography of an airline entrepreneur after WWII. He starts in England with a single small plane and gradually builds an airfreight empire centered in Bahrain. He has no interests other than his business, and he achieves success by pluck, unremitting hard work, sinking every penny back into the business, and hiring the best people as mechanics, engineers, and pilots, even if they aren't white Europeans. His narrative is plain, spare, un-ironic, and toneless. First this happened, then this. It sails very close to boring. His philosophy seems to be \"Forget prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude; the real virtues are competence, practicality, honesty, and once somebody has demonstrated those, open-mindedness towards his possibly strange and foreign way of life.\" The real subject of the story emerges only very slowly and with increasing fascination--it is that his oldest friend and chief engineer seems to be some kind of religious nut who has gone \"round the bend.\" He preaches a kind of mindful work ethic to his co-workers. \"Good work and right thinking are as one.\" Do your job carefully and with respect. Done that way, it will be God's work. His presence and charisma are apparently irresistible. Slowly he begins to attract followers and his reputation grows. He attracts Muslims in the Mideast, Hindus in India, and Buddhists in the far East. The narrator (his friend and boss) is only slightly aware of all this, but he is happy to let it go on--he has a supremely expert workforce and marvelously well-maintained planes as a result. What's not to like? But gradually political and other tensions grow. Finally his friend is diagnosed with leukemia and dies the calm death of a holy man, worshiped by many thousands. Gradually the book has completely shifted from its apparent subject. The narrator can't quite believe in his friend's holiness, but even he in his skepticism has been moved. Near the end he admits with typical simplicity, \"I don't think about things in quite the way I used to.\" And neither does the reader."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana", "userReview": "Just finished rereading this one, and it's my favorite Shute novel and one of my favorite books of all time, notwithstanding the sexism of the era and the rather quaint and patronizing view taken of \"Asiatics\". For the time it was entirely enlightened. Nevil Shute was a great writer and a wonderful person. Aviation in his time did for those few people who pursued it what the internet does in ours for everyone: makes the world into our own small neighborhood. Connie is one of my favorite characters in all of literature. Though we only hear a bit of his philosophy, it's enough to see the outlines of his path, a form of devotion applicable to Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, or whatever religion one follows, and brought to bear upon the whole of one's life. To be a very good aircraft mechanic one must become a very good person. As an engineer, designer, builder, and mom, I do aspire to be a Shaklinist."}, {"userName": "Roz Morris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4228408-roz-morris", "userReview": "There's something about Nevil Shute's prose that is quite beguiling. It's not poetic or florid; more it's a quality of the way he scrutinises the emotions of his characters. His narration is cool, but much lies under the surface. The usual mood is reserve, endurance. But under that quiet exterior there is turbulence indeed.The narrator of Round The Bend is Alan Cutter, an aircraft engineer, pilot and entrepreneur who starts an air freight business in Bahrain. The story is the account of his friendship with Connie Shaklin, an engineer who founds a new religion. This is the second novel of Shute's that I've read. The first was the most famous; On The Beach. As with On The Beach, Round the Bend begins slowly and in an unassuming way. But this quality of observation is just acute and intelligent enough to keep you reading. And then something happens that strikes a lightning bolt through the life of the narrator. Shute reminds me of another of my favourite novelists, Andrew Miller. They share the same quality of tenderising you. Their characters' interior landscapes draw you into a place of sensitivity. Shute's characteristic flavour is emotional burdens such as guilt or yearning, and especially missed opportunities. This book's plot is quiet, but you are still gripped by a sense of increasing pressure. Despite its title it is not meandering. One of the triumphs of this book, for me, is the setting. It has great charm. The Bahrain airstrip is a stripped-down place of sand, hangars and engines. The main characters hop between the continents, delivering goods, setting up more export bases, leaving behind personnel who spread Shaklin's infleunce. Shute would never be so clumsy as to make the comparison with angels, these people who spend so much time in the sky in their machines, but you are drawn to entertain yourself with the idea. A charming, haunting story."}, {"userName": "Chrisl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl", "userReview": "Using multiple rereads as criteria for favorite novelists, Nevil Shute is easily my most liked. Set in the years after WWII, written then, it provides useful perspective on the Middle East. Here's a quote about one of the minor characters :\"Dwight was an American, a soldier of fortune by profession. Wherever there is trouble in the world the Dwights of all nations foregather. There are not very many of them, thirty or forty perhaps, and they are all supremely competent men because because the others have been killed.\"Dwight had spent some years in Central and South America, and he had flown for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He had been flying for the Chinese against the Japanese in 1938 and 1939, and he had come into the United States Army Air Force via Major Chennault's Flying Tigers. He delivered two or three disposals B25s from America to the warring Israelites in Palestine just after the war, but by the middle of 1946 he was back in the East, flying loads of sub-machine-guns from the Philippines to Indonesia for the benefit of brown men fighting the Dutch.\"\"At that time there was considerable sympathy in South-East Asia for the Indonesians in their struggle against the Dutch. In Indo-China the Viet-Minh forces were engaged in a similar rebellion against French rule ...\"5/3/17 - Here's a quote I like :\"By John AndersonPerhaps my favourite of all Shute's novels, \"Round the Bend\" contains many of his usual elements - aviation, enterprise, a mild love interest, and an unusual story very well told.Tom Cutter got into aviation the hard way before World War II, working his way up first in an Air Circus that toured England in the summer season, then with Airservice where he became a competent ground engineer, servicing planes all over the Middle East during the War. With the suicide of his wife just before his return to England, he cannot face going back to work at the aerodrome where they met, and he buys an old Fox Moth aircraft to charter out in Bahrein. The enterprise is highly successful and his business develops so that he has to take on other pilots and engineers. To keep his costs down he employs only Asiatics - Sikh pilots and local engineers. The rapidly developing oil industry uses his charter service to link operations between the Persian Gulf, Indonesia and Australia. There, by accident, he meets his old friend Connie Shaklin - a first class aircraft engineer, half European, half Asian, who joins his operation as Chief engineer,Connie's method of teaching aircraft maintenance combines the practical and spiritual - right thinking and good work are inseparable. An ascetic and modest man, Connie is soon established as a religious teacher in Bahrein gaining the respect of the local Imams and Sheik. The book unfolds the story of the spread of this teaching throughout the Middle and Far East among ground engineers and religious leaders. This spread parallels the development of Tom's aviation business eastward from Bahrein to Australia.Shute handles the interwoven themes in masterly fashion - pioneering flying across India, Burma and Indonesia, Tom's tolerance of Connie's religious teaching and the attention it brings, the hostile reaction of Colonial authorities and Tom's ultimate support for his friend, and his love for Connie's sister Nadezna.In writing this book, Shute must surely have drawn on his experiences during his flight in a light aircraft to Australia in 1948. The descriptions are evocative, the characters believable and there is much emotion as the story unfolds.

I didn't even know it was actually a book about religion, or really, about God more than religion, thank goodness, because otherwise I probably wouldn't have thought I'd like it much. But I did. There's something I love about the just post-war novelists--this style was a bit similar to Jessica Mitford or Somerset Maugham, not in any tonal way, but in the sort of clipped dialog, and passages of very matter of fact description, and some of the lovely British slang of that period. In addition to being completely ahead of his time in matters of religious understanding, tolerance of the Other, and male-female relationships, Nevil Shute is such a good storyteller. Maybe the start of a Shute kick."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4905469-peter", "userReview": "Mystical and magnificent - this book was real surprise to me. Post WW2, Shute is asking himself the fundamental questions of man's existence, through what starts off as an adventure story based on the life of a young Briton obsessed with aircraft. The other main character is a charismatic young man - half Russian and half Chinese - who is a skilled aircraft engineer. Shute and the characters he creates embark on what effectively becomes a search for religious enlightenment. One of them finds his God.......in aircraft workshops. It might seem a sort of Zen and the Art of Aircraft Maintenance, but it's not as weird as it sounds. It's moving, thought-provoking and a worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Stuart", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1062920-stuart", "userReview": "My favorite Shute book.

It's a bold book - all the bolder given its historical context - and in common with all Shute's work its examination of how human beings can live decently, faced with extraordinary circumstances, is thought-provoking and involving. It tells a good story too. Its weakness really lies with a naivety, or overoptimism, about some aspects of human behaviour which, sadly, seem irreducible, regardless of one's good intentions. Let me explain...This is a tale told by an Englishman of humble origins who, at the tail-end of the British Empire, anticipates the economic rise of the new world of oil wealth in the Gulf and builds a successful business servicing its need for air transport. But it is more especially his account of the growing fame and influence of one of his friends and employees, a Eurasian mechanic who introduces a philosophical, religious approach to the work of aero engineering, and in doing so gains a following as a religious teacher among his fellow engineers - Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist - wherever the air transport company operates. The barriers and prejudices the two encounter from the old order are intertwined. Our narrator, Tom Cutter, has to cope with his culture-bound English parents' casual racism in referring to all non-Europeans as 'wogs', although he himself apostrophises the same people - Arabs, Indians, Pakistanis, Burmese, Thais, Vietnamese, Indonesians - all as 'Asiatics', and is very candid that he prefers to employ them because they will accept low pay. There is one particularly shocking episode in which one of his planes is prevented from unloading in 'white' Australia because it is piloted by an Indian, a boycott led by trade unions and supported by the government. Institutional racism, condescension and paternalism are the norm: Cutter has to go cap in hand to an aircraft company to buy one of their planes, despite clearly being able to pay for it; the 'British Resident' in Bahrain censures him for accepting a business loan offered by a wealthy local Sheikh; the preacher Connie Shaklin is all but deported by the same panjandrum because of his closeness to the local people and their religion.Shute saw and challenged the absurdities and injustices of these aspects of his 'own' world, and by extension the inevitability of change, including that effected by armed anticolonial actions taking place at the time, the late 1940s: Cutter first employs Shaklin when his previous boss, an American running guns to Vietnamese and Indonesian rebels, is imprisoned. He also understood the importance of religious faith as a focus for collective identity and personal conduct in many places throughout Asia, although it's here I fear he was overoptimistic in describing a wholly positive response to attempts to 'modernise' people's application of that faith to everyday life. Even in the 1940s, I have grave doubts that a non-Muslim outsider, preaching unconventional applications of the Qur'an to a deeply conservative people, would have gained the approval and collaboration of imams, local leaders, or even those people themselves in the open-minded way that Connie manages.As a novel, this is a fine and interesting book, an insight into a vanished world which only half a century ago was a live one for many of its author's fellow Englishmen seeking to maintain their own moral, social, and ethnic assumptions in an environment very different from that in which they had grown up. It's a generous and, as I have said, optimistic book, and it tries hard to establish common ground between disparate peoples through the shared central tenets of their indigenous religions, in order to suggest the possibility of a better, less divided world. It is interesting that Tom Cutter, who has evinced throughout absolutely no interest in his own nominal Christianity is, by the end, speaking of Connie in explicitly Christian terms. Sadly, however, I think Nevil Shute allowed his own decency and desire for better things to come to occlude the evidence of much religion as a deliberate tool of division, politically and parochially manipulated, and preferred by many practitioners as a mark of exclusivity rather than its opposite. 'Twas ever thus, and a great shame. But as a study of what might have been hoped for, in the comparatively recent past, this novel is very much worth the read, and Nevil Shute's reputation as a chronicler of a humane, idealistic British attitude to a changing world deserving of preservation."}, {"userName": "Yvor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679752-yvor", "userReview": "Nevil Shute is one of my favorite authors.

I think this book is his best, and it remains my favorite book I have ever read.Perhaps what I like best is that is seems the last kind of book a post-Victorian English Man would have written, especially one born into the \u201cupper middle class\u201d. He treats the \"non-Europeans\" like people, and not \"wogs\". He shows disdain for Europeans who do treat people like \"wogs\". As a wog myself I appreciate this especially. As an \u201cAir Force brat\u201d the aviation aspects were a great read. All the religions mentioned were handled rather more even-handedly than I would have expected. None were denigrated. The Arabs were not demonized, there were no jingoistic references and the only people dealt with critically were members of the diplomatic core who behaved in a stupid fashion. The story has inspired me to live my life better. It (the story) calls attention to injustice in many forms (especially racism and religious intolerance) and shows that people of good intention can affect solutions to common problems. I related to both one character\u2019s love of flying and the other\u2019s \u201ccollecting religions\u201d as a way to better understand how different people see the world.I like this book so much it has become the only book I give as a gift on a regular basis.

Or ON THE BEACH. Both of those had characters who were emotional in complex, gripping life-and-death situations.This one, other the other hand, involved Tom Cutter, a Brit whose main emotional ties were with aircraft from the time he was very young. The novel is rather like a tedious log of flying and buying various planes as he builds his own flying business in the Middle East and Asia from his home airfield of Bahrain -- an island nation in the Persian Gulf (had to look this one up, I confess) -- which was not yet independent from Great Britain at the time of this book soon after WWII.In the later parts of the book, Connie (a male), a partly Chinese character from very early in the novel, become a quasi-religious figure venerated by Muslims (especially those involved in aircraft maintenance) across a very wide area with the area. His followers charter planes to travel great distances to simply touch something he has touched.

The three others being Pied Piper, A town like Alice and No Highway. Shute is a wonderful writer and story teller and his books are so intelligent and wise. As in many of his books, this one also revolves around airplanes and the aviation world. It is worth reading this book because it can give the reader an understanding of the world after the 2nd World War. The book was written in 1956 and it is incredible how things have changes in not such a very long time. The whole western point of view on race and religion has changed completely. It is difficult to believe that less than 60 years ago, as Shute describes in his book, an aeroplane could not land in Australia because it was maintained by an Asian crew. Indeed, today we are living in the other extreme. This it is the age of politicly correctness that in its best only masks an inconvenient truth but so often comes very close to sheer dishonesty and cover-up.I enjoyed this book, but not as much as his other books.

On the surface simply the story of an airplane mechanic and pilot, it is also a reworking of the Jesus story -- something I am glad I didn't know in the beginning, as that might have put me off reading it. The value of the religious aspect for me is that it shows how quickly people can become caught up in new religious or spiritual ideas and ideals.

Naturally, we have airplanes or boats or both. Actually, it's mostly airplanes, or aeroplanes I suppose, given that Shute was a Brit/Aussie. Anyway, Tom Cutter got enamored by airplanes at an early age. Basically, he ran away from home at 12 or so to join the circus, the air circus. He made friends with Connie Shaklin, also a young man in the circus. Shaklin was also half Chinese, for what that's worth. Well, the war comes (WWII) and Tom gets into the RAF. The war ends, and Tom wonders what to do. He decides that he might get himself a small airplane and start up a flying service in the Middle East, Bahrain. So, he hooks up with the local oil companies and what not and flies engineers and equipment around the Mideast. On a longer flight, he finds himself in Southeast Asia, Siam, perhaps. He ends up delivering something/someone to a hidden airfield set up by a gun runner, a guy who was supplying arms to the rebels in Cambodia and Vietnam who were trying to expel their French colonial rulers. He runs into his old friend Connie Shaklin, who was maintaining the planes for the gunrunner. The gunrunner, himself, is taken into custody. Tom does him a \"favor\", by taking his plane, larger than the one Tom owns, back to Bahrain. He also takes Connie with him to be his chief ground engineer. Now that he has a larger plane, he can expand his business. Next thing you know, he decides he needs even a larger plane so as to carry more gear. He gets a loan from the local Sheik. That pisses off the British colonial rulers in the Middle East, and they try to shut Tom down, but back off when the Sheik threatens to cut off the oil...or something. But, the important part, actually, is about Connie and his unique methods for airplane maintenance. While he is repairing something, he gives little spiritual talks to the engineers working with him. He views his calling as having come from the Creator, and he best honors the Creator by working very hard, very carefully, and very thoroughly. They start having daily prayer meetings outside the hangar at the end of each day. The other ground engineers take up the teachings, and as they disperse to other jobs through out the Middle East, they disseminate Connie's teachings. Amazingly, aircraft maintenance improves wherever Connie's disciples travel. He becomes a cult figure. Well, there's a lot more. The central question is whether or not Connie has become a religious leader, which is a threat to the colonial authorities, or if he's just gone \"round the bend\", i.e. gone a bit crazy.

The basic premise of Round the Bend feels like a modern retelling of Herman Hesse's Siddhartha, but with an aviation twist somewhere in between. What Siddhartha succeeded in doing, however, is to discuss spiritual/religious topics through the lens of the titular character, Siddhartha \u2014 that isn't the case here. Shute's Siddhartha, a man named Connie Shaklin, barely factors into the story at all until about 65% into the book. In fact, vast majority of the book is populated by painstaking details of the protagonist's aviation business \u2014\u00a0how much money was made, which countries he expanded to, which local official he had tea with, what time he met with the official, how long they stayed for lunch, who else he visited along the way, who he had to talk to to acquire a more planes, etc. Even though these details added much colour to the time period in which this story is set (mid 20th century), it becomes tedious after some time. This book numbers at around 370 pages, but feels a whole lot longer. Every itty-bitty detail of the protagonist's business dealings is documented here, which means that the deeper meanings are somewhat buried beneath everything. I also feel that, for a book about how a religious person impacted the lives of those around him, it doesn't feel like the book achieved what was advertised. I don't feel like Tom Cutter, the protagonist, is in any way changed by the end of the book. I feel like he begins the story as one character, becomes another character some time in the middle and... stalls. Connie Shaklin, unfortunately, does not leave a mark on the book's main characters, at least not the main ones, and certainly does not leave much of anything on me as a reader. In short, this book is overly long, with some colourful descriptions of Southeast Asia and the Gulf during the post-war years. If you are looking for some spiritual enlightenment, you are not going to find much of it here."}, {"userName": "Edmund Bloxam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51960700-edmund-bloxam", "userReview": "A Lesson In Taking Advantage of 'Foreigners' and How To Use Religion to Manipulate People.This book is so matter-of-fact, I will write my review as much like it as possible. It is a first person book. There is virtually no description at all. There is only the story. It is a story about a person starting an aviation company in the Middle East. Somewhere early on, somebody dies, but there's no emotion in this book either, so there we go. It just happened. Much of it reads like a travel itinerary ('I flew from Bahrain to Bali, flying across the West coast of Siam, stopping in Singapore to refuel and rest' or such like). Alright, this is a poem to hard work and straight talking. Fine. How does he become successful? 'I only employ Asiatics, because they live simple lives and I can pay them less. I don't employ white people'.The author goes out of his way to show that his character is not racist (apart from that massive fundamental mentioned above). About two thirds into this desert (literal and figurative), it becomes clear that the real plot is about one of the worker's who has, inadvertently, started a religious cult based around hard work. Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus (and a Sheikh) begin to follow him around and begin to write down everything he says and treat his every word as god-like. (His name isn't Brian). He says working hard is like being with God. Which means that the first-person narrative character has a low wage staff who work extra hard because they think that God has told them to. The main character is extremely tolerant to all religions, so there are some lists of religious practices. There might have been a love story too, but it is less important than the planes.As an unintended critique of how religion is a tool to control the masses, it works really well."}, {"userName": "Amy Heap", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12511991-amy-heap", "userReview": "I am usually all about the feelings, but I strangely enjoyed this novel about planes, the Middle East, Asia, attitudes to race and marriage just after WWII. Tom Cutter is a practical, dispassionate sort of fellow who loves planes, and after the war and a disappointment in love (much more tragic than that makes it sound, but he was very cool about it), he ends up running a charter business in the Middle East. One of his old friends, a Eurasian man, comes to be his ground engineer, and ends up a religious figure, based on his work ethic. There's a lot of travelling, much airplane and travel detail, and a really fascinating look at serving God by doing the very best job."}, {"userName": "ErnstG", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63842935-ernstg", "userReview": "One of my favourite books. Every time I read it I get something more from it. A little dated in its social attitudes, although those are interesting as well. This book (like A Town like Alice) comes from Shute's flight to Australia after WW2, and the people and places he came across.The problem with Nevil Shute is that he writes so well and therefore you read so effortlessly that you think this is just a story. It actually is a vehicle for exploring some thoughts on religion, seen through the eyes of a doubting Thomas -- a working class Englishman who sets up an air freight company in Asia without white expats. And a sidebar sad love story too."}, {"userName": "Inge Van Delft", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24185638-inge-van-delft", "userReview": "I have yet to read a book by Nevil Shute that I don't like. This one was, as usual with Nevil Shute, thought-provoking and an easy-read at the same time. You really get to like the narrator, Tom Cutter, though I disagree with a lot of his ideas. The story revolves around Tom and his friend/colleague Connie Shaklin. Connie slowly gathers a religious following among aircraft engineers without really setting out to do so at all. The novel puts forth a lot of ideas and questions about religion and cultural differences that are still very current."}, {"userName": "Glenn Strickland", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39559571-glenn-strickland", "userReview": "OCR scanned Kindle Edition is of Low QualityThis book deserves five stars for it's content but the kindle edition is so rife with spelling and punctuation errors that I can't recommend it.

Like all Shute stories, it puts an ordinary Joe in extraordinary circumstances, and let's them deal with it by dint of common humanity and decency.

I was never in the R.A.F., and my parents hadn\u2019t got fifteen hundred pounds to spend on pilot training for me at a flying school. My father was, and is, a crane driver at Southampton docks, and I am one of seven children, five boys and two girls. I went to the council school like all the other kids in our street, and then when I left school Dad got me a job in a garage out on the Portsmouth Road. That was in 1929. I stayed there for about three years and got to know a bit about cars. Then, early in the summer, Sir Alan Cobham came to Southampton with his flying circus, National Aviation Day, he called it. He operated in a big way, because he had about fifteen aeroplanes, Avros and Moths and a glider and an Autogiro, and a Lincock for stunting displays, and a big old Handley Page airliner for mass joyriding, and a new thing called an Airspeed Ferry. My, that was a grand turnout to watch. I knew from the first day that to be with that circus was the job for me. He was at Hamble for three days, and I was out at the field each day from early in the morning till dark. The chaps fuelling and cleaning down the aircraft let me help them, coiling down a hose or fetching an oil drum for them to stand on; when there was nothing else that wanted doing I went round the enclosures picking up the waste paper that the crowd had left behind and taking it away to bum in a comer of the field. It was fun just doing that, because of the aeroplanes.", "title": "ROUND THE BEND", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33128205-round-the-bend", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480129419l/33128205.jpg", "reviews": 95, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21477.Nevil_Shute", "name": "Nevil Shute"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Adventure", "Religion"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33128205-round-the-bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/953962.Round_the_Bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6084788-round-the-bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6084746-round-the-bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2332239.Round_The_Bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17428239-round-the-bend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107301.A_Town_Like_Alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107300.Trustee_from_the_Toolroom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107315.Pied_Piper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107318.The_Far_Country"]}
