You will not be aware of this fact because it is the custom of the LEP to mindwipe oour human allies. We do this so they cannot remember being recruited. If you cannot remember the fairy people or our underground city, then you cannot betray our existance to the greedy humans. Of course, not all humans are greedy. You, deputy, are a noble member of your species. And clever too. We only recruit the best. Our intellegence department has studied your file and concluded that you were suitable for LEP membership. At the moment, you are only a deputy officer. To become a fully fledged officer, you must complete four tasks. Number one, decode this message. Something you are well on your way to completeing. Number two, save the life of a member of another species. You can complete this task in any number of ways. Open a window to release a trapped fly. Build a birdbath in your garden. Release a mouse from a trap. Number three, acheieve a perfect score on a school test or homework assignment. In this job, you need to be smart as well as fit. Number four, wash yourself every day for a week. This is a difficult assignment, especially for human boys, who do not like contact with water. If you are going to work underground, often in crampted tunnels, you appreciate a partner who does not smell like a hermit dwarf. Once you have completed these tasks, you must summon your recruiting officer in the ancient fashion. Go to your back yard, or nearest green area. Make sure you are not being watched. Find a soft spot of ground and burrow a six-inch hole with a broom handle or a short stick. When the hole is ready, type out the letters LEP in morse code. The code is as follows:L= tap-tap-wiggle-tap.E= wiggle-wiggle-tap.P= tap-wiggle-drill.Do this at least a hundred times and our underground sensors will pick up the vibrations and send and LEP officer with your uniform and orders.

I still think it's beyond weird how I never read these book when I was in school. Thank god I'm starting them now because I'm hooked and I can't wait till I get my hands on the next book in this series.I'm so happy that I got to see my favorite character Mulch again! I'm also really happy that the whole gang is back too. Well, not everyone.. but hey I'll take what I can get. Artemis is back and I love it!The villain is Opal, who is very intelligent. Where her character was involved I feel like I was also second guessing myself. I always thought I knew where things would be heading and then find out that I was completely wrong. Which is why I loved the little twists and turns within this book.Holly, Butler, Mulch, and Artemis are probably my favorite group of people ever. I love how they all work so well with each other. I like how together they are stronger and smarter than any villain out there - but apart they aren't. Besides being super happy that everyone I love is back in my life.. I mean this book. The overall outcome was just fantastic. I loved getting to see a different side of Artemis in a way because he was slowly learning back his memories. When he did remember someone it just left me overjoyed. I seriously can't wait to dive into the next book. I definitely need more of Holly and Artemis right now!"}, {"userName": "Connor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22027176-connor", "userReview": "Artemis Fowl begins another fantastical adventure with Captain Holly Short, Mulch the Dwarf, and Butler to save the world as we know it.

The action level was high, and the villain was more than a worthy match for Artemis, Butler and Holly Short. There is a very intense and tragic moment that is the catalyst for what follows in this book. Holly thought she'd seen the last of Artemis, but when the chips fall down, she's rushing to save him and Butler and knows that he's the only one who can deal with the villain, the nefarious Opal Koboi.The characteristic wry humor is here, but Colfer takes things seriously in many ways (no patronizing tone). Artemis might be fourteen, but he is a mature fourteen who doesn't view the world from the vantage point of a child. I was happy to see Butler in the action as much as Artemis, and their back and forth, and that of Artemis with Holly, is what makes these books so enjoyable. Opal is a very evil villain, not troubled by any morals that would preclude murder or even feeding a boy to bloodthirsty trolls. What makes it even worse is she looks like a cute little girl. I was very happy to see her dealt with in a fitting manner by Artemis and Co. This is a clever and enjoyable series that many younger readers and some older ones will enjoy."}, {"userName": "Jaemi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1893374-jaemi", "userReview": "As a late-comer to the Artemis Fowl phenomenon, I'm glad I did eventually pick it up. These books are really fun and highly entertaining. The Opal Deception didn't disappoint.Here we are, all mind-wiped and uncertain, everything under and above ground going crazy all at once, but still the heroic group pulls together to fight yet another battle. And quite the group at that: 14-year-old Artemis, his behemoth bodyguard Butler, the dwarf-thief Mulch Diggums, and the ever-fiesty fairy, Holly Short.This book may have been the best read yet--with the missing memories and an unbelievable scenario taking place, the excitement was high. And instead of just sinister plots and attempts to survive, in this story we also get friendships forming, and personalities shaping. And of course the leanred-the-hard-way lessons: you can never be anyone but who you are, and be careful what you wish for, you might not like it when it comes true.Since we were left with a wide-open opportunity for more at the end of the book, I for one am hoping to see yet another Artemis adventure in our futures."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "The Artemis Fowl books are very good when you need a break from heavy 'grown-up' books.

Nevertheless, they team up with Holly and Mulch to defeat Opal before she can expose the Faerie underground to the human world. This series is great!! I highly recommend for a middle schooler.

I adored the idea of mystical creatures that lived in an underground city. They lived among us cloaked and ready to stop the endless cruelty that humans are so well known for.Plot:In the book Artemis Fowl the Opal Deception there were mythical creatures like elves, goblins, trolls, and centaurs that lived underground to hide from the mud men. This incident involved Opal Koboi who was a sprite that became an enemy of the Lep. She thought she could kill Artemis Fowl, Butler, and Holly. She had already made Holly Short kill her commander by telling her there was a spot on the restraints that held him that could be shot to save him. However, when she shot the spot, it caused him to explode violently. Artemis was blanked of all memory of the fairies in the last book in order to keep him from turning on them again. He had it all planned out by giving a microchip disguised as a gold coin to Mulch Diggums. When Mulch realized that the coin Artemis gave him was a micro-chip, he also found out that the coin was supposed to given back to Artemis when he got out of prison. Before he was able to give the coin to Artemis, he had to go through a program in which Commander Root was supposed to attend, but was murdered. Mulch ended up escaping on his own. While Mulch was going through all the ruckus, Artemis was stealing a priceless painting known as the Fairy Thief. He succeeded in stealing it, but Opal was using it as a way to target Artemis with a Bio Bomb. He escaped the blast by sheer luck jumping off a hotel roof and surviving only because Holly made it there just in time to heal him. Butler jumped off the roof holding a mattress while Artemis was on his back. When they landed, Artemis broke a rib which pierced his chest causing excessive bleeding. After being healed by Holly Short, she told Artemis everything that he had forgotten. They defeated Opal Koboi in the end by ruining her plans of taking over the planet. Opal was going to be the smartest human child ever by getting surgery to make her human-like. Characterization:Artemis Fowl was the main character in this story. In the earlier books he was a pain to deal with. Nobody wanted to deal with him because of his evil mind, but in the end he became an ally of sorts to the Lep. His dad was lost in Russia for about two years until he was rescued by Holly Short. Artemis Fowl Senior was healed by fairy magic which turned his attitude into a more positive one. Instead of being a power hungry business man, Artemis Senior changed into more of a family man. Impacts of setting:This book took place mostly in the underground city of Haven which was the largest Fairy city in the world. The story took place approximately around 2002. The place that Opal Koboi resided was a factory that was completely surrounded by stone. This was an important problem that Artemis Fowl had to overcome.Thematic Connection:A primary theme in this book was good conquers evil. When Artemis was good he became more successful than in previous schemes. Good overcame evil when the Lep, with the help of Artemis, defeated Opal Koboi in her attempt to ruin human life.Recommendation:I think this book was a very good book for anyone in which fantasy and mythical creatures are an interest. I would give it at least 4 out of 5 stars. Teens and younger adult males (13-20) would like this book because of the non-matured humor."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1728845-chris", "userReview": "Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception By Eoin Colfer 342 pp. New York, New York Hyperion Books for Children ISBN 0-7868-5289-5\tThe boy genius is back at it again. With two years of fairy memories erased from his mind, Artemis Fowl is back to his criminal mastermind self. This time he has his eyes set on a painting that sits in a very secure German bank vault. But this theft is only the first of many adventures that Artemis takes in the Opal Deception. With trolls, gunfire, and a plot to expose the fairy world, Eoin Colfer keeps this book intriguing and suspenseful. You will have to make your self stop reading. Eoin Colfer seems to have a knack for adding one more piece of the puzzle in every chapter, enticing you to continue on. In his latest novel in the Artemis Fowl series, Opal Koboi is back-out of her self induced coma-ready to enact her revenge on all those that foiled her evil scheme one year ago. Those on her hit list include Commander Julius Root, Captain Holly Short, Butler, and none other than Artemis Fowl. But without his knowledge of the fairy world, will Artemis be able to save the entire underground world from a collision with the humans? \tSome would say that Eoin Colfer is a very considerate author. I definitely would. You see, I\u2019m sure there are people who\u2019ve read Opal Deception without reading the first three books, so they have no idea what all this \u201cfairy\u201d stuff is about. Without making it as obvious as coming right out with it, Colfer \u201cslips\u201d the information in there. He finds a way to incorporate information from previous books into the character\u2019s dialogue, so that the readers get at least a glimpse into Artemis\u2019 past adventures. In Opal Deception, Holly Short, in a time of crisis, tries to jog Artemis\u2019 lost memory to help them out of a sticky situation. Those memories include his father\u2019s rescue and the cube of fairy technology that Artemis himself created. \tArtemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is not without its share of themes. A major theme in this novel would have to be family. Now that Artemis Senior is back and the Fowl family is together again, Artemis the Second is torn. After losing his memory, Artemis resorted back to his life of criminal activity, but in the back of his mind, there\u2019s this nagging feeling that he should be with his family now, being a normal teenager. On the other hand, how normal can Artemis\u2019 life be? It could be argued that after the past two years, Artemis Fowl\u2019s life can never be the way it once was.\tWhile family is a very important theme, friendship is the basis of the Opal Deception. Every thing in this book revolves around friendships. Artemis doesn\u2019t even remember Holly, but she claimed to be his friend and he felt an obligation to help her when she was in trouble. Their friendship was so strong that even when he lost his memory, he knew he had to help her. Some people think that they don\u2019t need any friends, but everyone does. Friends are there when no one else is. \tAside from the heartfelt themes of family and friendship, the Opal Deception offers intrigue, suspense, drama, and adventure. Eoin Colfer\u2019s style of adding piece by piece as the book goes along, traps the readers as it hooks on to your own intellect. I would even recommend reading the whole series, start to finish. Each chapter brings insight into previous chapters, giving you that \u201cOh Yeah\u201d realization as you read on. If you love fantasy, pick up a copy of this action packed novel. Amidst the action, this book speaks on how you don\u2019t have to get a reward for good deeds and being a good friend."}, {"userName": "Lisachan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10268413-lisachan", "userReview": "Emotivamente mi ha dato un cazzotto meno intenso del terzo volume, ma Roots mi ha piegata in due dal dolore comunque, va detto.
