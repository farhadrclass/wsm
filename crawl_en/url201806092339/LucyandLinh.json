Something I wasn\u2019t expecting in the slighted bit? There is absolutely no romance inside of it. Sure there is a girl-boy encounter, but no flirting is involved. It really isn\u2019t about that, and this made me respect the book as well as the author all the more.I simply hate it when a plot mainly depends on the romance, as if nothing else matters, which is why I found this so, so refreshing.It\u2019s about discovering oneself, especially one\u2019s true qualities, values and life expectations. But it\u2019s also about not losing yourself when uprooted from your normal life and thrown into a pit of snakes.I make it sound very ghastly and dreadful, but the girl\u2019s only school \u2018\u2018Laurinda\u2019\u2019 is a scary place. Not only because horrid events occur inside the school, but because of its oblivious students, corrupted by a manipulative trio.Think Regina and her cronies. They run the school. They\u2019re at the top and no one can reach them, since everyone\u2019s afraid of them. Well, there\u2019s a similar thing going on at Laurinda. Except, Brodie, Chelsea and Amber form the Cabinet because their parents donate large amounts of money to the school or have their own influential place inside of it, making their daughters almost impossible to touch, among other reasons. They seem nice, of course they do, and cunningly control their classmates. But the only person who seems to see beneath that layer of sweetness is Lucy.Lucy learns so much about the school, life and herself. She goes from being no one to someone. But there is a time when she has to re-evaluate her life at Laurinda and make new choices. I loved witnessing her character development more than the ending, which is top-notch. This is a book you don\u2019t read to be entertained or because you have nothing else to do. This is a book you read because you can\u2019t bring yourself to put it down and not know what will happen to Lucy in the end.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "Thank you Goodreads for my signed copy and my first 'First Reads' win. Signed copy was unexpected but great!Alice Pung is a young woman with a vast cultural history and a very important story. Here is a piece of fiction, but knowing some of this author's background, this stuff is real. The main subject I took from this is the issue of 'outworkers' and the extreme hard work of those that need to do this and work very very hard to earn such little pay. I was not surprised to hear that Alice works in the area of wage fairness as a solicitor. Her family has worked hard in silence with doors shut and blinds pulled down tight. Do many people know about this??This is an insightful story told to us from a young girl, Lucy, who at fifteen years of age earns a scholarship to a prestigious girls school. Here we see some horribly self absorbed, pretentious and downright horrible nasty teenagers, preening themselves and cunningly trying to make everyone bow down to them. This little group have the 'entitlement' phenomenon right here. Lucy is a smart girl, and ends up on top in more ways than one. Along the way we learn how hard people work to get by and how the priveliged just don't get it. She learns so much about herself and we see this coming of age in such a lovely way. Alice Pung is a brilliant writer, she just gets everything right in relation to setting and character. This is a great book for all ages and is so very real. I enjoyed every minute of this read, and can't wait to read more of her books. A solid 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Mish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4045725-mish", "userReview": "In Laurinda we follow the life of 15 years old, Lucy Lin, through a series of letters to unknown friend Linh. Lucy\u2019s parents immigrated to Australia by boat from Vietnam, now living in lower suburbs of Stanley. Her mother\u2019s place of work is in their garage, sewing clothes till all hours for minimal pay, and as well as her father, who works nights shift (long hours) at Victory Carpet factory \u2013 they\u2019re battlers trying to get ahead. Lucy attends a catholic school, Christ Our Saviour where she\u2019s found her place and can be herself around her peers. For a young girl, she has caring nature and is well grounded. Life changes for Lucy when she granted a scholarship at a prestigious girls college, Laurinda. She befriends a group of girls called The Cabinet, who are not interested in Lucy as a person but to mold her to become, and think, like them. They are rich, and influential, and just plain nasty. They will they use their powers of influence and intimidation to control their peers and teachers. Everyone is too frightening to stick up to them. Lucy eventually loses herself, her identity and integrity. She is shown wealth; and is now ashamed of her illiterate parents and family\u2019s home. She\u2019s lost her voice; afraid to speak up when she knows someone has done wrong. Somehow the old Lucy has gone and she needs to find a way to bring her back.Laurinda is Alice Pung first work of fiction. She is best known for several published memoirs. One in which I\u2019ve previously read called Unpolished Gem, a heartwarming and delightfully story of Alice\u2019s family whom immigrated to Australia from Cambodia, trying to live the Australian way of life. While I adored this book, it\u2019s evident in Laurinda that Alice has come a long way in her writing and storytelling. Alice explores a range of serious issue in Laurinda, not only of racial prejudice, but also of one\u2019s perception and treatment of lower class families, respecting and understanding different cultures and ethnic background, and when people with power abuse it. The extent they will go keep their status, in the form of manipulation and bullying, targeting unfortunate ones that get in the way or play on individual\u2019s weakness. Ruining careers, reputations and self-esteem with no remorse. Alice writing is so tight, her main character, Lucy, is complex and genuine, and her in depth observation of human behaviour is couldn\u2019t be more accurate.Laurinda for me rang true on a very personal level.I was fortunate enough to attend a school like Christ Our Saviour, where I felt accepted and could be myself; it was outside the school grounds where I felt different. I grew up in Maltese/Australia household. I\u2019ve seen how tired my parents and grandparents were from working hard, long hours in factories or cleaning jobs; occupations some people looked down upon. I have seen the shame in my grandmother eyes when a banker made her feel inferior, when she asked for help filling out a withdrawal slip - she couldn\u2019t read or write. I have witness racial slander directed at my family because of their thick Maltese accent. So whilst reading Laurinda I felt as though I\u2019m home; Alice Pung spoke my language, she knew my family. A remarkable and important book, in each and every way."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "This is a coming of age story and all the highs and lows and woes that go with this.Growing up is a difficult journey at the best of times without finding your roots uprooted and planted in forgein land.

An outsider learns to navigate the unfamiliar world of the upper classes. Only in this case the outsider is a child of Vietnamese boat people. Tho\u2019 it\u2019s a little more complicated because whilst having been born in Vietnam, Lucy\u2019s parents are actually Chinese. They live in a downscale suburb of Melbourne, but the 15 y/o Lucy has won a scholarship to a posh girls\u2019 day school called Laurinda.In some respects, I think posh day schools are the worst of both worlds, offering neither the rough-&-tumble mixture of social classes found in a state day school nor the 24/7 on-top-each-other nearness that creates the condition of belonging in a boarding school. (Lucy would have done much better @ Melina Marchetta\u2019s Jellicoe School.) Lucy is adopted by the clique of leading girls called \u201cthe Cabinet\u201d (not in the political sense but in the jeweller\u2019s) but goes home to her family Warwick & Quyen Lam (I don\u2019t think we\u2019re told how he acquired the name of an English county). Mother spends day and most of the night doing piecework sewing shirts for a family business. There is also an infant brother called \u201cthe Lamb\u201d\u2014frankly that gave me the creeps because every time Lucy mentions him I thought of Sunday roast. Till I was about 70% into the story I\u2019d not realised that mum speaks only about three words of English & that the shirt-making operation is thoroughly illegal. I\u2019d kept thinking it was also unnecessary. We learn that is true, as well as unsafe & unhealthy, esp. for \u201cthe Lamb\u201d!Before attending Laurinda, Lucy went to a Catholic School called Christ Our Saviour even tho\u2019 her father is an atheist. Every time on the audio Lucy enunciates the name of her former school, she pronounces it as if it were an expletive\u2014not the theological designation of the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, the Son of God. Which for me was the principal failure of the book\u2014Lucy & her family are totally materialistic, as materialistic as the Cabinet girls with their expensive uniforms and classy motorcars. The school has no ethos but snobbery, but Lucy & family appear equally without spiritual values. Genuine albeit patronising attempts at friendship, as by Amber\u2019s mother Mrs. Leslie, arouse resentment & ingratitude. It is easy to sympathise with Lucy & to understand her touchiness & hypervigilance towards anything that suggests condescension, but she seems to be dying of an ebola level of class envy.I didn\u2019t sympathise with some other characters Lucy liked better. Ms Vanderberp the history teacher whom the Cabinet\u2019s prank involving a tampon & red ink drives into early retirement should have been grateful. Tho\u2019 I loved & am proud of my career as a teacher, one should retire early enough to develop other sides of one\u2019s personality, & when we learned that she had subjected her 89 y/o father who was dying of cancer to chemo, I realised if she had become a hospice worker she could have spared him a lot of unnecessary agony. Mr. Sinclair, the politics teacher (a subject, btw, that ought never to be taught below university age in my opinion) starts out as the girls\u2019 heart throb & then @ about 30 goes all defensive lest he be accused of harassment. Lucy blames the Cabinet for creating suspicions, but sorry, goes with the territory\u2014cute junior master is a very ephemeral role. A 15 y/o cannot be expected to have a accurate take on things, & I think Lucy needed very much something every young person must have: a grown-up friend & mentor who is not a parent, & can model for her what an adult should be.Tho\u2019 listening to this book was often an unpleasant experience, I\u2019m not sorry to have read it. (Love this dual feature on Kindle where you can listen & read simultaneously or alternatively.) Witnessing the educational deformation both Christ Our Saviour & Laurinda offered Lucy, I really came to appreciate what good schools like those in Along the Jelllicoe Road & Friendly Fire can accomplish. Both Taylor & Sophia\u2014main characters very much outsiders too\u2014emerge with so much better formations spiritually, emotionally & intellectually, than I have hope for Lucy. Perhaps we can learn something worthwhile from reading about bad schools too."}, {"userName": "Veronica \u2b50\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6716390-veronica", "userReview": "I think how you feel about this book may have a lot to do with the readers own upbringing.

Her family are refugees who arrived in Australia on a fishing boat and think they are lucky that her father has a job in a factory and her mother works at home illegally making garments for minimal wages. So this is a big chance for Lucy to break out of her poverty and into the privileged world of Laurinda.For Lucy, who was accepted and confident at her previous multicultural school, Laurinda is daunting. Power and wealth are the important drivers in the girls relationships with each other and their teachers and Lucy struggles to deal with the trio of girls who wield the power and can make life hell for anyone who goes against them.Alice Pung, herself growing up a refugee, has written a brilliant account of what it is like to be a teenager suddenly thrust into an alien environment while at the same time struggling to find her own identity. She raises many important topics, not just those of race and class but also of abuse of power, manipulation and bullying. Some favourite quotes:On a girl give to making nasty comments: \"She wasn't a bimbo after all, I saw, but was just prone to say snide things every seven minutes or so, as if she had bitch Tourette's\"On the suitable race of eligible boys: \"In their white-daisy bouquet of slim pickings, they cast out all the chrysanthemums, and anything brown was considered wilted\"On the three girls who rule the school:\"They were like three big albino rats in a cage full of brown mice. You wanted to be close to the glorious creatures, not only because they were so compelling, but also because you hoped that if they smelled your familiar scent often enough, they would not eat you\" On her urge to remain hidden and uninvolved:\"And here was the most bitter paradox of adolescence: alone, I was most myself, most true. But the self that really mattered was the self that was visible, the self that could be shown to other people\"On the suffocating atmosphere of Laurinda itself: 'There was something creepy about the femininity at Laurinda, something so cloistered and yet brimming with stifled sex that it reminded me of the Victorian whalebone corsets we once saw at the Werribee Park Museum, which kept everything cramped tight, until the stitches unravelled and out poured mounds of naked pink and white.\""}, {"userName": "Emily Mead", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12221873-emily-mead", "userReview": "This book is absolutely incredible.

We load and reload movies of ourselves in heroic postures and outlandish triumphs, movies that, if they were ever to be played in front of an audience we know and love, would cause us to shrivel in shame.

It's written in an epistolary format; the whole book consists of letters from Lucy to her friend Linh as we follow her journey from ordinary public school to an elite Australian private all-girls school Laurinda. This was a difficult read for two reasons: first, I found the writing style a bit weird and unengaging, and second, it was quite emotional!Lucy Lam's family is poor and Chinese: her father works in a carpet factory, her mother sews clothes in the garage, and Lucy is mostly responsible for her baby brother Lamb. Whilst she fits in well with her friends at the local school, when she secures a scholarship at Laurinda, Lucy's entire life in upheaved. Laurinda is ruled by The Cabinet, a \"Mean Girls\"-style trio consisting of Brodie, Amber, and Chelsea who play cruel tricks on students and teacher alike, whilst promoting a wholesome image of Laurinda spirit to the administration and parents. \"White lies be damned - sometimes I loved the truth\"I loved Lucy's relationship with her family. As she grows accustomed to the extravagant life of her classmates, Lucy begins to see the things she has always loved about her house - the furniture, the films her parents watch, how she looks after her brother - and the things she never really noticed - how her parents eat loudly and dine off of newspapers - become embarrassing, cringy, and tacky, and Lucy is ashamed of these thoughts. She's caught between very different two worlds and I found it really emotional!\"I wish I could say I didn't have a chip on my shoulder, but I knew I had a whole Pringles factory up there\"But I found Lucy and Linh quite repetitive: the Cabinet pulls some harmful prank on someone and Lucy disapproves; the headmistress complains that Lucy is not participating in Laurinda-lifestyle (debating, sports, or any extracurricular activities at all); the parent of one's of Lucy's classmates has a massive white saviour complex; Lucy withdraws from her new friends and spends all her lunchtimes in the library, thinking about her new life. There's a lot here that seems cyclic.Overall, I definitely loved Lucy and thought the whole book was quite thoughtful. I laughed a couple of times and felt tears threaten a few more, but the book lost a lot of its impact as it seemed to drag on and become repetitive.

The Cabinet at Laurinda are not the type of girls who peak at high school the way you see in American high school movies a la Regina George--- they are the kind of girls you seen all the time in reality who go on and run companies or charities and climb easily on top of whatever field they want to be in because they are padded with the privilege of wealth and whiteness. And they're intelligent in their own way. But they are so sheltered and have such a narrow view of the world that you cannot expect them to care about anyone that isn't up to their social status. When The Cabinet takes on Lucy Lam, our protagonist--- it is not about an act of kindness, as is them trying to make themselves look good by turning Lucy into their pet. Trying to mold her into the perfect image of what the school wants because the school looking good reflects on them. The exploration of Lucy is fantastically nuanced. Being a teenager is the one time where you are actively constructing your identity and trying to figure out who you are and letting outside forces influence you a lot. Author Alice Pung really plays into that construction of identity. Lucy flits from friend group to friend group from her old school to Laurinda, never really fitting in with anyone despite the fact that she's not exactly socially awkward. She just hasn't really pinned down who she is and where she belongs. So even though she KNOWS she doesn't fit in with The Cabinet at all, she passively allows them to take her under their wing initially. It is only when she DOES figure out who she is that she breaks free from her passivity and has the strength to stand on her own, rather than stand with others for the wrong reasons. Unlike Heathers and Mean Girls, this does not have a comedic edge, and is not satirical in any way. These kinds of people really do exist because I went to school with them as well--- they are charming (especially to adults), manipulative, rich, beautiful and popular and will want for nothing. There is no comeuppance in their lives."}, {"userName": "RitaSkeeter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21914765-ritaskeeter", "userReview": "I've been stalking this book on Amazon for a little while, so when I saw it on sale yesterday I hastily downloaded it and started reading straight away.This is an insightful and honest account of a teenager from a 'problem' suburb in Melbourne, who changes to an exclusive school from her local Catholic after winning a scholarship. An extra dimension is that the teenager, Lucy, is first generation Australian. Whilst this is a book about a teenager, I hesitate to say it is YA fiction due to the depth of the themes explored by the author. Not to say that YA can't or doesn't do those things, but rather my concern is that there is so much junk in the genre that this book being defined as YA may lead to some not reading it because of that definition. I can't relate to some of Lucy's experiences. I didn't attend an exclusive school, and nor was I an immigrant, but the feelings of identity, belonging, power, leadership, and personal integrity are things most can relate to.This is an acutely observed (and at times satirical) novel, with a distinct Australian flavour. I was a teenager around the same time the novel was set, so smiled at many references. With the YA market flooded with much from the US, I realised how much I miss being able to relate to a book on a more basic level, with it reproducing the cultural context in which I live; where there are references to Australia and being Australian.Back to comment at the start about having purchased this book on sale; this is a book that I would pay full price for and feel satisfied with my purchase. I'm not usually into memoir-y type things, but this book impresses me so much I will check out Alice Pung's other books.

Well, they'll have a go, at least. I got the sense while reading that now that Lucy has them sussed out, she'll never let those bastards grind her down. I'm not in love with the framing device (it's in the form of a long series of letters from Lucy to Linh), but the themes are so well-developed and Lucy's voice is so powerful and subtle. And once you get into the unflinching beauty of the sentence-level writing...well. I see this as a strong Printz contender.LAURINDA is being republished in the US this fall as LUCY & LINH, but I'm an impatient dummy who didn't know that & so I bought a copy of the Australian edition a few months ago. Read it as soon as you can, friends!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "This is a story of an Asian immigrant teen's life in Australia. Like Cloudwish, it explores haves and have nots, privilege, and relationships that are complicated inside and outside of school. What this book excels in in a way that Cloudwish doesn't, though, is really giving us deeper insight into the main character, with less focus (none at all, in fact, seeing Laurinda is an all-girls school) on romance. There are a lot of similar elements, though, so readers who like one will likely enjoy the other. A big difference absolutely worth noting is that this is an #ownvoices story.At times, the \"Mean Girls\" cliche felt tired and none of those girls were quite developed. That said, the way Lucy rectifies her relationship with Linh is brilliant; I kind of suspected what was going on at the beginning, but Pung's way of telling the story in that capacity really added nuance and layers to the idea of insiders, outsiders, appearances, and authenticity. Readers who love Aussie YA will find those hallmark writing and voice aspects. Pung's writing, too, is excellent and evocative."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614430-todd", "userReview": "This is one of my top teen picks for 2016. Lucy is one of the best-written characters I've read in a long time, so believable that you want to call her your friend. The way the author evokes the worlds that Lucy embodies is sensational, from her dilapidated home to the prestigious private school, and all the places in-between. I've rarely read and better understood the stark class divisions that are felt by an immigrant community and the second generation. Looking forward to reading more by Alice Pung."}, {"userName": "ALEXA", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4988733-alexa", "userReview": "I had expectations going into this book, and I think that's what tripped me up a bit.

She sees herself as two distinct entities. Linh is the rough-as-guts western suburbs girl who's not afraid to stand up for herself, to tell people to get the hell out of her way, the one who knows exactly where she fits in with her family and her social group and her school as a whole. In contrast, Lucy is the outsider, the girl who's struggling to keep her head above water, who's struggling to make friends. She's stuck between two worlds - the elite opulence of Laurinda and the houses of her fellow students, and the world she grew up in. She starts to see the things she's always loved - the way her family have always eaten dinner on newspapers on the floor, her parents slurping loudly as they eat, their house and their furniture, her possessions - as disgusting and tacky and embarrassing. Linh is, essentially, the part of herself that she doesn't want to admit exists when she's at Laurinda.

There are some parts where Alice Pung really nails the differences, and the snobbery, and the key values between the two cultural groups she is trying to bridge (and, in fact, the subgroups within them), but others where she choses an unrealistic scenario or scene which is supposed to appal (and, while they are not very pleasant, in reality, sadly, I have heard far worse school experiences, with more subtle undertones. These are far tricker to navigate that the school year that Lucy had to live through). However, maybe because it is a young adults novel, the author chose not to go so deeply into dysfunctional school behaviour? And the redemptive ending to me didn't really ring true (although lovely if it would occur). Nonetheless, an entertaining read, and some elements to think about. Some quotes - 'This was shocking to me. I thought that women like this, especially in houses like this, would site and discuss art history or antiques or literature, Linh. Like my father, I had believed that educated people were gentler and kinder than the uncouth and unlearned masses - but now I wasn't so sure' (p174)'An insecure person here is like a loose nut,' said Chelsea. You just have to screw them up properly.' ..'We purified the school,' said Brodie, but by now it was hard to tell whether she was being ironic or deadly serious.'You don't have to be the best at this new school,' she told me. 'You don't have to be the smartest. You don't have to be like that girl with the phone. All you have to be is a good person I see everyone around me getting the things they want in life ... And every time I go over to one of their houses they always talk about it. But that proud talk soon turns into a list of complaints... do you know what I never do? I never tell them about us. I never tell them that your father often works in the garage with me after his shift and we talk, That we made a tent out of netting for the Lamb. That I sometimes let you stay home with me when you're not sick'.I couldn't look at my mother, but I could sense her looking at me. She always figured my excuses out. 'I never tell them about our lives. You know why? It's not because I am ashamed. It is because some things are just too good, too good to be judged'.(p268)'So for me, leadership is about building your own character before you start influencing anyone else. To be a true leader, I think you must learn what it is like to follow, even if it means squatting on the ground with a toddler to look at old things in new ways. And to follow without losing your own moral compass, you have to know yourself and appreciate where you come from' (p332)"}, {"userName": "Sonja", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4798422-sonja", "userReview": "The social commentary in this is PHENOMENAL, but it took me a really long time to actually get into it.

She talks a lot about how ambitious she is, about how poor her neighbourhood is, about how hard working her parents are. She talks about the snobby girls at her school and about the down-trodden teachers and especially about the Cabinet.The thing is, she talks about it so much that she doesn't let us see any of it. Looking for Alibrandi is one of my favourite books, and it's hard not to compare it to this (Pung herself mentions its author in her acknowledgements). Melina Marchetta rendered such a truthful, painful and whole picture of her characters' lives: rather than just saying \"I don't fit in\", they take readers through the whole experience.It's not in Laurinda. The setting isn't anywhere. I didn't realise it was supposed to be the 90s until mention of Wonderwall on page 194. That's true of the characters too - they're kind of trapped under this layer of Lucy's episolary storytelling. While Puberty Blues perfectly executes the stereotypes everyone who's ever been at high school knows, I closed Laurinda and found that not a single character came with me.There's no doubt that the subject matter is important. I started at a (co-ed) private school when I was five years old, and the kind of behaviour Pung has addressed here is rife. There's a great story within her book, of prejudice and unfairness and the luck of the draw, about privilege and what money can really buy you, but to be honest, I struggled to find it."}], "description": "A literary Mean Girls meets Fresh Off the Boat that follows Lucy as she tries to balance her life at home surrounded by her Chinese immigrant family, with her life at a pretentious private school.", "title": "Lucy and Linh", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25695574-lucy-and-linh", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1452362204l/25695574.jpg", "reviews": 484, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/576550.Alice_Pung", "name": "Alice Pung"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Realistic Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25695574-lucy-and-linh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22603951-laurinda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26827645-laurinda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23514363-laurinda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28185992-lucy-and-linh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28185991-lucy-and-linh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1182481.Unpolished_Gem", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4497311-growing-up-asian-in-australia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11728433-her-father-s-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28052141-my-first-lesson", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23591546-meet-marly", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider"]}
