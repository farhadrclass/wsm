My Cussler deprivation is not due to any calculated or irrational dismissal of the author; I just never got around to reading him. Starting with the 20th book in the series is probably not wise, as Cussler has reached that \"I can basically write a 200-page shopping list and any publishing company will publish it\" status, which is never a good thing. For proof, see anything by James Patterson.Cussler also has a co-writer for this one (his son, Dirk Cussler), which, in my opinion, is ALWAYS a red flag. When well-known authors start writing \"with\" other people, it usually means they have become so lazy that they can't come up with any new ideas of their own, or they wrote a quick outline for a novel and had someone else actually write it. Again, see James Patterson.So, truth be told, I was a bit leary about this one, and I didn't have high expectations. Consider my surprise and delight that I actually enjoyed the book.I'm not going to lie: it starts slow. The real action didn't kick in until around page 150 (out of 600), the first 150 pages devoted mostly to scene-setting and necessary (but excruciatingly dry and, at times, textbook-like) backstory. I'm guessing Cussler books all follow a similar formula: at some point in history, a ship carrying treasure or objects of vital importance is lost; fast-forward hundreds of years to modern times when a clue is uncovered that reveals the possible whereabouts of said lost ship; adventurer and treasure-hunter Dirk Pitt and his crew go off to find it, only to encounter numerous obstacles and nefarious villains trying to prevent him from finding it.I'm guessing each Cussler book is a \"fill in the blank\" in terms of historical period, lost treasure, modern-day clue, and nefarious villain. In this case, the book starts with a dying Genghis Khan in the 13th-century. The treasure is the long-lost burial place of Khan. The modern-day clue is a scroll found on the body of a dead archaeologist. The villain is a mysterious multi-billionaire who has access to untapped oil riches in Lower Mongolia and a giant gun that can create earthquakes. Yes, it's pretty silly. It's part Indiana Jones and part James Bond, and it's all ridiculous, but it's good, clean fun. While it's not exceptionally good writing, it's good enough that it makes me want to go back and read Cussler's early work, when he wasn't just getting published on his name alone."}, {"userName": "Stefan Ellis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2296733-stefan-ellis", "userReview": "Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! An outrageously outlandish plot barely within sighting distance of reality. The \"coolest\", know-it-all, wise-cracking archaeologists-as-protagonists to have ever walked the earth. Decent dialogue is replaced by a bunch of dumb one-liners. Bad writing (ex. \"The chills crept up her back like the Polar Express\").This was my first Cussler book, although I have been familiar with the character of Dirk Pitt. And it seems that Pitt is unashamedly based on Indiana Jones. Late in the book Pitt is replaced with his son. Guess his name: also Dirk Pitt! This is lame writing, because he is not nearly distinguishable from Pitt Sr. This is merely a device the writer employed to show us how good Pitt is, since he can now simultaneously fight villains in locations on opposite sides of the world. What really sent me over the edge was the action scene where Pitt and Giordino escape from an enclosed space behind a truck after being nearly surrounded by Mongolian sniper-archers battering them with God's Armageddon of arrows, spears and even bullets. They do so on a motorcycle with a sidecar that happened to have been standing on the truck, dressed in wooden boxes (yes, that ridiculous), not being hit once (because why would they be hit?), while Giordino-in-the-sidecar incapacitates most of the Mongolian sniper-archers by throwing them with horseshoes while Pitt makes donuts with the oh-so-mobile motorcycle...with a sidecar!I gave the book about 200 pages after this ridiculous scene to redeem itself.

Clive Cussler is, of course, a well-known thriller writer with a large number of sales to his name. If Treasure of Khan is representative of his style, however, I have to ask the simple question; why? In common with most people these days, I have a limited amount of time, and my reading choices are therefore important: I\u2019ve no desire to spend time reading something which is poorly written, when there\u2019s such a wealth of well-written work out there. This book is supposed to be a thriller. The genre has the reputation of racing the reader through events, using action to drive interest. Character is, understandably, a less vital part of such books and I took up this book knowing such would be the case.The story starts in 13th century Japan, moves in the next chapter to China during its war with Japan and then travels to Siberia in 2007. In 3 chapters we have travelled a vast region of an area with which most readers have no connection and little knowledge. There\u2019s no apparent link between the events described in these opening chapters, but, hey, this is supposed to be an adventure story and, eventually, the back story will hopefully appear relevant. I\u2019ll never know, however, because, although the action has already started by this point, I\u2019ve lost all interest. I\u2019m not hooked. I don\u2019t care about what might or might not happen next. I have better things to do than invest more time in this particular pot-boiler.There will be Cussler fans who will, no doubt, accuse me of blindness or some unspecified bias. But the simple fact is that this thriller failed to thrill, in any sense of the word. I was bored by the multitude of apparently unlinked facts, uninterested in any of the characters, confused by the apparent lack of any actual story thread and unmoved by the action scenes. These, the very essence of the thriller, were tedious and written in a style more suited to a factual report than to the presentation of exciting fiction. I expected the characters to be two-dimensional, but not as cardboard as I found them. I expected to be moved to the edge of my seat and not bored into lethargy and total indifference, as I was. In defence of Cussler, I gather this is the umpteenth volume in a series starring the same major character; that, however, doesn\u2019t excuse inadequate characterisation for those new to the series. Certainly, on the evidence of this book, I shan\u2019t waste my time picking up another by the same author.Ironically, this was one of four novels enclosed in a single volume I received free as a sampler from a book club. The other three books were excellent, so this piece stood out like the proverbial thumb; sore and in need of amputation.So, sorry Cussler fans, I shan\u2019t be joining your ranks. I hope you enjoy your fiction by this author but I seriously hope he, in turn, rewards your devotion by producing books of a far better quality than I found in Treasure of Khan. Unless someone tells me, I shall never know what that treasure was, and, to tell the truth, I really couldn\u2019t care less. Need I say more?"}, {"userName": "Zeke Chase", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035018-zeke-chase", "userReview": "Personal Rating: 1.3 / 10Abandoned. \tThe prologue began with some promise, but quickly descended from there. The authors chose to blather on endlessly instead of telling an orderly story. The characters were flat, and the prose was nearly unreadable. \tTo be fair to the Cusslers, I did \u2018read\u2019 the audiobook version, read by voice actor Scott Brick. Mr. Brick has precisely one emotion in his voice: ominous. It gets quite tedious quite quickly.\tHowever, father and son Cussler do share much of the blame for my abandonment of this novel. Case and point, Clive Cussler, being one of the most successful authors of all time, chose to sell out on the art in order to get there. One doesn\u2019t become a king of pulp without the approval of whom I call the MFCC: The Midwestern Fuckwad Censorship Caucus. As soon as Giordino said \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d, I knew I was in for some bad prose that accents characters so contrived they may as well have been plastic. Real people don\u2019t talk like that.\tAlthough I find the Khan Dynasty fascinating and the history surrounding it was well done, the incredibly tedious detour to Lake Baikal and the Cusslers\u2019 inability to write intriguing characters or anything with more anatomical correctness than a Ken doll, I abandoned the book about a third of the way through."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180589-jenny", "userReview": "I picked this out at the library when my last audiobook ended. I hadn't read a Clive Cussler book in ages, but I remembered the plots being pretty engaging, so I started it with no small sense of anticipation. The plot did not disappoint, but the writing sure did! I don't know if it was the audiobook format or the grammar snobbery that comes with being a literature major (just kidding! I was a grammar snob long before I was a lit. major!), but the errors were just inexcusable. I mean, there were subject/verb agreement issues. I know that no one reads Clive Cussler for his high-flown prose, but COME ON. If you're going to make millions as a \"writer,\" at least make sure your nouns and verbs agree. In addition, I found it extremely odd that Dirk Pitt had mystery twins with his long-lost love, Summer, and she named them...Dirk and Summer. That is bordering on creepy. It also makes it difficult to tell who is talking when Dirk and Dirk are in the same scene, as Cussler refuses to refer to them as Junior and Senior, instead just calling them both Dirk. The elder Summer is dead, so no confusion there, but the gents pose a bit of a problem. Anyway, aside from those (admittedly possibly personal) issues that I had with the book, it was fine. Lots of stuff happened and lots of stuff got destroyed, so a pretty typical Cussler, if I am remembering them accurately."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5677208-rebecca", "userReview": "I read this book as part of the June Reading Challenge for one of my GR book clubs. It was recommended to me by my husband. I was intrigued to start with because it is something my husband reads and we normally have very differing taste in books. This book gets off to a good start by pulling you in to the historical context that will lay the foundation for the entire book. However, around page 150 or so I started to lose interest until about page 550! Too, too much unnecessary detail! This book could have been told in half the amount of words and still have the same impact. The story was true enough, being about oil and the associated greed. It was good adventure fiction and the fact the Pitt's never die! The treasure hunt throughout the book was fun.

Of the dozen or so Cussler novels I've read, this isn't the best written. Yes, it was an entertaining read, but certainly not up to the quality and sheer enjoyment pleasure of, say Spartan Gold or The Chase.The short of it is, a Mongolian descendant of Ghenghis Kahn wants to return Mongolia to its former glory by cornering the oil markets of major nations. He does this using a device that causes earthquakes. The sheer massiveness of the endeavor and the destructive forces unleashed are the stuff of pure fantasy, but then this is fiction, is it not?While certainly larger than life, the characters (who I've come to know well) are believable and quirky enough to be entertaining by themselves. The story line moves along with Cussler's usual efficiency as the protagonists meet and overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.For a mass market Cussler novel, this was okay, but not great.

You actually get an audience in the court of an aging Kublai Khan.

I know the gun-ho action etc is very tongue in cheek and unbelieveable- a cross between Bond and Biggles there is still a good entertainment value in each book. This book has the historical facts based around Gengis Khan leading to a treasure hunt. Again the action takes place in various countries mixed in with some interesting travel guide type information and colour.

He even went out of his way to not kill anybody off (except at the climax where is was kind of necessary)even though the circumstances would warrant it.

This was one amazing book. It did run true to many of the things we've come to expect from the super adventures of Dirk Pitt. Other than the fact that no one real would perhaps survive what Pitt and his team survives, this book had everything that kept me at the edge of my seat at well paced intervals. I love it when a book is paced so that you have plenty of action, but also plenty of backdrop which builds narrative and character arcs, while also serving as a contrast against the adrenaline pumping action. I believe Cussler has mastered this art in all of his writing. I have said this in other reviews of Clive Cussler's work - I am not a fan of his cameos in his work, but that doesn't detract from the technical mastery of the adventure story as an art form here. This is absolutely worth putting your eyeballs on. Spoilers from here on:So, it may be far fetched that two enormous historical finds were both found in the same adventure, and it may also be farfetched that the same airplane in the desert idea that was used in Sahara was used here also, as well as the murderous trek through the desert idea. Some of it does read stale if you've read lots of Cussler, but I didn't find that it lessened the enjoyment of the book. Pitt's longevity in the face of enormous odds is one of the reasons these books are so much fun, but they are also reasons to disbelieve that it's ever humanly possible.

From a priceless discovery, to a plane crash, to a machine that can cause earthquakes with sound, follow Dirk and Al as they try to save their friends, and the world oil economy, from a man obsessed with ancient Mongolia, and hell-bent on keeping his secrets safe. Clive Cussler does an amazing job getting to feel how he wants you to, making you hate the bad guys, and love the good ones. He even makes you understand that the reason Dirk and Al overcome seemingly impossible tasks is not that they are the main characters, but because they are good enough to do so. Cussler is a master of details, giving you enough that you could draw a given scene from memory, but doing so in a way that is fluid, and relevant to the current events. I would recommend this, as well as many of Cussler\u2019s other books, for many reasons. They hold your attention, they are action packed, and they are just written well.
