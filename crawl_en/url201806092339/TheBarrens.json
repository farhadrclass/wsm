I've never read anything by Joyce Carol Oates before. When we were driving to Baltimore recently to go to my guys father's funeral, Simon mentioned the Pine Barrens. I'd never heard of them before, but the area and the people piqued my interest. We found a small book from the 70's about them...they're in New Jersey, a densly populated, by pines, area of New Jersey, the people there are referred to as Pineys, and sound rather singular, and sheltered by choice. This book mentions the Pine Barrens, as a locale, but doesn't really delve that deeply into the nature of the Barrens. It is a serial murder mystery, and a pretty creepy one. It reads right along, but somehow, this book reminds me of when I used to hitch hike in my early 20's and how trusting I was, and of some of the creepy stuff that happened to me, and how easily, I could have wound up decomposing somewhere. Hind sight is all that they say, I'm relieved to think that I smartened up, before it was too late. This book deals with artists, money, voyeurism, and sicko creepy stuff. How do you put your life back together if you have been questioned about a creepy crime, when you are innocent all along? And, what do you find yourself doing in light of your inability to help yourself prove your innocence?"}, {"userName": "June", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/415744-june", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates \"writing as Rosamond Smith.\" I can see why she didn't want to put her name on this one...Interesting note: Not one single character in the book has a pet.

Matt McBridge appears to have a very good life. As a partner in a large, prestigious New Jersey real estate office, his income is above average and allows a high level of comfortability. A country club membership, nice clothes, a wife and two sons and a very nice home foster the image of a man who has it together. But, there is a dark side to Matt. Calling himself the night stalker, he is excellent at taking photos, particularly those of crime scenes of young murdered girls, or car accidents wherein people have died. Obsessively, Matt places himself in the unhealthy position of the murderer, so much so that the reader cannot help but wonder if he actually is the one who murdered the innocent victims. As Matt discovers the killer, he places himself in a dangerous position. The author also takes the reader into the ugly thoughts of the man who slaughters girls/women who have talents. With a sick religiosity bent, at times I felt uncomfortable learning of the depravity.As always with the books of Joyce Carol Oates, I love to hate her subject matters, while always returning for yet another book."}, {"userName": "Josh Ang", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4870273-josh-ang", "userReview": "This is the first JC Oates book that I didn\u2019t enjoy. Written under one of her pen names, Rosamond Smith, this less-than-engaging thriller centred on a thirty-something real estate agent Matt McBride, who is forced to confront his memories of the abduction and murder of his high school crush, when a young female artist disappears.Matt\u2019s connection and attraction to this missing girl is never fully nor convincingly explained, which leaves the reader wondering about his obsession with her. Did he or did he not have a relationship with her? It appears even Oates did not quite know. His deteriorating relationship with his wife is also rather sketchily played out. Although there was some attempt to address Niezsche's quote 'Ultimately one loves one's desire, not the desired object', this was also rather hastily inserted with Matt's transference of attraction to the missing girl's twin.Perhaps this novel was not written in Oates\u2019s name for good reason \u2013 it bore none of her incisive characterisation and breadth and depth of her other works. Definitely an off-day effort by an otherwise accomplished writer."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "And I remember now why I went almost ten years without reading Joyce Carol Oates. Even this book, written under a pseudonym, is your basic trash. I thought maybe the serial killer \"suspense\" aspect of it would at least make it an interesting read. Oh, so sorely mistaken.Like her older books that I read years ago this read like textual vomit on soiled toilet paper, sewn together with used dental floss. Which, interestingly enough, is the exact way I described her ten years ago when I initiated my boycott against her.So this leads to the question... did Oates really write A Garden of Earthly Delights? Read these two books back-to-back and it's like night and day. One is a masterpiece. The other is a masterpiece of trash.These are moments of my life I will never get back.

Even the characters who where absent in the course of the novel were so well-defined I felt like I knew them. The author is also a master at depicting intense emotions, obsessions; it is disturbing how these feelings radiate throughout the story. I wasn't quite sympathetic with the protagonist as he was plagued by his own obsessions that were rather frightening, but that is simply a fulfillment of his character.

Aging urbanites who seemingly feed off of each other's eccentricities pile on top of one another in a deceitful dance of love and anguish. They live for one another, and yet secretly despise those who are not themselves.Enter Mathias McBride. Formerly of the nowheresville township of Forked River (somewhere along the coast of south Jersey), Matt managed to create himself the perfect life; a singularly powerful position (though still technically an underling) within a rising real estate firm, a loving wife with two precocious sons, a palatial home, a number of female lovers, and a high-octane freelance photography/art career which occupies his nighttime hours. Matt truly seems to have everything he could ever want.Though his fatal flaw is his naive romantic heart. Matt wants to be the one who comes to rescue damsels in distress. And, throughout the course of The Barrens, he perceives several opportunities to do just this - failing at each given chance. As a youth, a female acquaintance (with whom he falls in love after her tragic disappearance) is found naked and dead in the Pine Barrens. Then, as an accomplished adult, Matt meets a woman who likewise vanishes from sight, finding himself terribly in love with her as well. Foul play is suspected.And Matt becomes a prime suspect.What has an incredible premise with a cast of vibrant characters, Joyce Carol Oates's novel (written as Rosamond Smith, Oates' not-so-secret pseudonym) starts out strongly... and begins to dissolve at some point past the halfway mark. By the end of the novel, the reader feels as if Oates gave into the baser desires to \"talk down\" to her readership, having poured a number of incredible contrivances and transparent characters who grate on one's nerves.Take the character of Oriana (no last name), a venal artist who loves her single name so much that she not only names her gallery after herself, but name-drops it at every given opportunity (\"I, Oriana, am preparing for a triumphant ending to this nightmare,\" she says on the televised news, in reference to the disappearance of her sometime-friend Duana Zwolle). Oriana is the mawkish sort of character who prattles on endlessly, without progressing the plot of the story so much as establishing her singularity of character. She laughs \"extravagantly,\" draws \"a provocative finger across Matt's knuckles,\" and \"in a dramatic gesture\" asserts her presence. A creation of two dimensions is the character of Oriana, bringing nothing to The Barrens as a literary work so much as providing another warm body to wind up dead by the end of the story. (With so many irritatingly tenuous adjectives to describe how Oriana looks, moves, speaks, etc. one wonders whether Oates kills the character off after the author finds herself completely devoid of superlatives.)Also, there is the half-hearted attempt at comic relief in the character of Hugo L. Chauncey, resident serial killer \"connoisseur.\" Poor Hugo L. Chauncey is a character fleshed out to be even more vapid than the pervasive Oriana, appearing to be some kind of savant when it comes to digging up protected information on serial killers. Poor Hugo L. Chauncey, living the stereotype of being the rotund, bespeckled (with unfortunate-sized cheap lenses), mama's boy computer nerd (at one point, he actually calls out to address the maternal figure with whom he lives: \"Ma-aaa! My friend has arrived. Don't disturb us, ple-ase.\" The humour being, besides the obvious reference to a grown man still living with mom, ha ha, that he had been talking about Matt McBride as being his \"friend\" even though he had only known him from a number of Internet \"exchanges\" prior to this visit.) His pathos stretches beyond the limits of credibility, and taints the story with its absurd contagion of disbelief.By the end of the novel, Weymouth, New Jersey becomes the kind of place where major characters volunteer to become judge and jury, their goal to single-handedly destroy the story's evil villain. It is the kind of township where physical altercations take place in aloof, dimly-lit settings which spontaneously burst into flames as protagonist and foil battle it out. In Weymouth, New Jersey, an obsessed lover can stalk his prey fearing only her wrath, as she never thinks to report the man's suspicious activities to local authorities. And, to add a semblance of depth to what has now become Hollywood blockbuster material, Nietzsche's words are prodded from the grave in the form of a one-liner, as if to explain all: \"Ultimately one loves one's desire, not the desired object.\"As the highly esteemed American writer, Joyce Carol Oates seems to use the name \"Rosamond Smith\" as a kind of shield, knowing that she is capable of writing much stronger, cohesive material than this. And as \"suspense\" writer Rosamond Smith, she seems to rely upon the marquee value Joyce Carol Oates' name lends to the work, as if to differentiate The Barrens from other dime-store thrillers. It is an amalgamation which serves to keep both names afloat (or to drag them both down into the harsh waters of those Pine Barrens)."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1880256-jan", "userReview": "Found the book better than I expected, but still confusing at times."}, {"userName": "Thomas Rose-Masters", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13481955-thomas-rose-masters", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates' incredibly prolific output has stirred quite a few literary ghosts, many critics believing that no person producing such an astounding body of literary and non-literary work can maintain the required (?) and sufficient level of quality. Those puerile qualifications aside, such is the flow of Ms. Oates' writing that at one point she found it necessary to utilize a pseudonym to cover some of her more genre-based experiments in literature. Reportedly, her fist aim was to allow herself the freedom to create psychological suspense novels without the burden of her fame. Her second, to discover whether this type of work would find a publisher if an unknown woman by the name of Rosamond Smith offered her decidedly offbeat and unusual form of suspense novel. Not only was she published, she also allegedly incurred the wrath of her long-serving agent and publisher for going somewhere else with such a lucrative new venture. The Barrens now bears both names on its front cover. Surely an immediate invitation into Oates' world of duplicity, duality, twin-ness and mirror images. As in other novels written as Rosamond Smith, she is here interested not in the crime itself, but in the wide-arching web of circumstances, choices and accidents that often lead to tragedy. Her characters are almost uniformly disturbed, they lead double lives and seem to have multiple identities, and again they are, almost uniformly, not likeable. The mood she sets is dark and lacking in hope, the setting wild, rurally aggressive, and as usual with this author even the language often disintegrates into shockingly effective ramblings. A literary effort which is definitely not everybody's cup of tea.Despite all this, or, proverbially, because of it, the novel is hypnotically alluring, for those who can bear it. Her own brand of high gothic applied to a brutally modern setting is anything but a restful read. But then, it is hardly supposed to be. By this time nobody who has ever heard of Joyce Carol Oates would approach her expecting anything less than to be deliciously discomfited. She offers this with glee."}, {"userName": "Buchdoktor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21076478-buchdoktor", "userReview": "Mathias MacBride hat die Tote aus dem Moor nie gesehen, doch das M\u00e4dchen, das zwei Klassen \u00fcber ihm war und das er zu seiner Schulzeit nicht kannte, bereitet ihm auch zwanzig Jahre sp\u00e4ter noch Alptr\u00e4ume.

When I saw The Barrens at a secondhand shop, I picked it up thinking it would be a good introduction to Oates. Apparently I am dead wrong.

The protagonist has so much emotion and love inside of him that it makes him unstable and unbelievable (those artist types, you know). His own children seem like stock characters written into the story by someone who hasn't ever come into contact with a human child. And then there are the characters I would have liked to hear more about, like the enigmatic, morally ambiguous, and super-rich Krell.

People like Matt McBride. Matt was barely out of junior high when the mutilated body of the first victim\u0097a popular, pretty teenager\u0097was uncovered in the desolate New Jersey Pine Barrens. Although he had hardly known the girl, Matt has long felt guilty at not having been able somehow to prevent the atrocity. Now another attractive young woman has disappeared, and Matt knew this victim, too. Just possibly he knew her more intimately than he is prepared to admit. By degrees Matt becomes obsessed with a guilt he can neither comprehend nor assuage. His seemingly happy marriage begins to deteriorate, while his increasingly erratic behavior heightens police suspicions. It also draws official attention away from an artist\u0097a man of limited talent but of fierce, demented vision\u0097who signs his work Name Unknown. Under the spell of the missing woman, Matt follows a path that leads him out of the maze of tortured memory to a confrontation with not only the baleful Name Unknown but also his own long-unacknowledged self. The outcome is shattering.
