And unabridged. And translated from the French by Robin Buss.The greatness of this book can be illustrated by the following simple equations:(\n + \n) < \nWhereas, the majesty of the Count of Counting added to the deliciousness of a Monte Cristo sandwich from Bennigans still does not overmatch the inherent kickass value of the Dumas novel [which is, it can therefore be said, greater than the sum of its parts, both obsessive-compulsive (The Count) and mouth-wateringly fattening (of Monte Cristo):]. Similarly:(\n + \n + \n) = \nThe coolness of Batman, once introduced into the equation, thus balances the scales, probably because the Count of Monte Cristo (character) is equal parts Wealthy OCD Recluse, Delicious Sandwich (um, metaphorically), and Batman-like avenger.

I never thought I would like something like this book. I never thought I would fall in love with Dantes! I never thought I would have so much anger, sadness, despair and happiness in this book! I never thought, did I! *********SOME SPOILERS**********Edmond Dantes was a wonderful man of 19-years-old. He had a woman he loved and was going to marry named Mercedes. A loving father. And he was going to be captain of the wonderful ship, Pharaon. The the jealous bastards or just bastards in general ruined life for Dantes. 1. Danglars2. Fernand3. VillefortI hate these men with such a passion I just wanted someone to kill their evil selves. All of the jerks had a hand in putting Dantes in prison for 14 effing years! Yeah! For what? For NOTHING! Dantes was in such despair he was going to starve himself to death. I can't even! Then one night Dantes hears a scratching sound and soon realizes someone is tunneling. Dantes decides to tunnel as well. At some point the two of them tunnel to each other. Dantes gets to meet Abbe Faria, the mad man (so they say) in the cell next door. Abbe Faria thinks he's tunneling out to freedom but he made a miscalculation. But Dantes and Abbe devise a new plan and this takes some years to do all of this tunneling. But the Abbe is old and sick and having seizures. He's not going to be able to make it so Dantes waits with him. He is like another father figure to Dantes. And who in the hell but Dantes would wait and not leave his friend. Because Dantes is good and kind and loving. Abbe Faria is also the one that opens Dantes eyes to who the culprits were that put him in jail. Poor Dantes couldn't see this at the time and he couldn't read what we were reading so he had no clue. Abbe Faria also tells Dantes about tons of gold and jewels that he has hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. He makes Dantes remember everything about getting there and where to find the treasure. Unfortunately, Abbe Faria dies and it was so sad. Dantes was so grief stricken over his friend. Dantes decided to leave then as he had nothing else to stay for and he put himself in Abbe Faria's place all wrapped up waiting to be buried. Well, he doesn't actually get buried but thrown out to sea and luckily Dantes managed to save himself. We go on to read of the tale of how Dantes gets to Monte Cristo and soon he is beyond rich and he is so smart and ready to get IT DONE! And Dantes doesn't just run off and kill people. He's smart. He tears down their houses, their world without them knowing who he is until the bitter end. And all of the riches they acquired while he rotted in jail was disgusting. Anyway, some people did die but that's of little importance. Dantes is also kind to all of the people that were kind to him or tried to help him while he was in jail. He's such a wonderful person. Yes, I know I keep saying that. He helps Morrel and his family when they were about to lose everything. They even lost the Pharaon but Dantes brings him a new one without Morrel even knowing where the ship came from. Dantes gave them money. He helped the family even after Morrel was gone. I cried and cried at his generosity. And to sit and read of all the plans and all of the people crumble. The only person to recognize Dantes, even with his disguises, was Mercedes. But she went and married freaking Fernand and had a kid. Dantes was friends with Mercedes son but things could never be good for them again. And it's so, so sad for so many involved. Oh, and Dantes called himself \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" Of course I guess if you own a rock and gold and jewels and many other things, you can call yourself anything you want! :-) I can't sit here and go on and on about the book. It's freaking 1276 pages! I'm not that good of a reviewer to tell you something good about that many pages. Just know. . . THIS BOOK is freaking AWESOME! If you have been debating on reading it and afraid of it's size, who cares, just read it. I mean you can take two months or however long to enjoy Dantes and his adventures, but don't let the \"tome\" bother you. It's not boring at all! NOT ONE BIT! I give it all the stars! Sail on dear, Dantes! \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/324433-cynthia", "userReview": "** Spoiler alert**First, make sure you find a copy that is unabridged. Most editions in English ARE abridged, but usually don't say they are. Not sure if this Penguin edition is, it's not the one i read. Readers generally think of this as a tale of revenge. For me, it was much deeper. I'm not a religious person at all, but for me this is a book that makes you question the existence of God or a god. Edmond Dantes is without flaw, a truly good person, and his life is ruined because a) others envy him and b) he was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence. Even when he escapes prison and finds a monumental treasure, it is years before he finds peace (I dont think he ever finds happiness). The questions it raises are: why are good people so often punished by horrible tragedies when truly bad people are so often able to float through life with all the rewards that this world can bestow? The other question: Dantes spends much of his life after prison seeking the people who tossed into the oubliette \u2014 not to get revenge but to punish them. He believes he is the angel of god and that he has been freed from prison so he can do god's will by punishing these evil men. But as he proceeds in his quest, he begins to question whether any man can actually be the angel of god, whether it's a sign of mania or even insanity to think you can possibly know what is god's will. In the end, evil is punished, and it is because of wheels that Dantes sets in motion. But I don't think he is ever able to know if he is just another man seeking to ruin other men, or if he is in fact the angel of god. It's a question that, as a journalist, I try to always remember: we are none of us the angel of god. All we can do is try to live the best life we can and not decide who deserves to be punished or even ruined."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris", "userReview": "Why did no one tell me about this book? I mean seriously, I was about a hundred pages in and I wanted to go find my freshman high school English teacher and inflict terrible, intricate revenge on her for depriving me of a great book. I figured first I could assume a new identity, perhaps insinuating myself into her life. I'd make her trust me and put all her faith in me, and then I would UTTERLY CRUSH HER!!! MWAH-HA-HA-HA!!!!Seriously, this was an awesome book. I am not a big fan of the Classics, really - I usually get very bored very quickly with them, especially the Russians. I don't know if it's the characters I can't relate to, or the writing that puts me off, but I try to get through them and my interest drops off abruptly. Especially the Russians. God save me from the Russians.But this? This was 1200 pages of concentrated awesome. A grand, intricate story of vengeance - and I do love my revenge stories - that I will definitely read again. And watching \nV For Vendetta\n is a lot more fun...."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "Over 1200 pages of suffering and revenge! I enjoyed it. I did not like it quite as much as some of the other big classics I have read, but it was very good. The two things that brought it down a bit for me were:- It felt a bit more drawn out than it needed to be. At a couple of points I was ready for Dumas to get to the point.- Some of the plot was very convoluted. While this did lend itself well to the Count's intricate plotting, I would occasionally get to a chapter and say, \"Wait, what!?\" A few times I tried to reorient myself with chapter summaries online, but stopped after it became difficult to avoid spoilers. With all the negative out of the way, I will say that is was definitely a great book. At times it was riveting. At others it was clever. At pretty much all times it was dark and seemingly hopeless. The unabridged is great because it has everything as Dumas wanted it, but it does require quite a bit of commitment.Final judgement: A must for those who want to read all the classics, but probably a bit much for the causal reader."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Picture this: you are nineteen years old with your whole life ahead of you, you've just been offered the job of your dreams, and you're about to marry the person you've loved since childhood... when suddenly a couple of jealous men decide to frame you as a Bonapartist (a crime which was punished by death or life imprisonment) and have you sent away to rot in an island prison. Let's just say you'd be feeling a touch bitter about the whole ordeal.This is what happens to the young Edmond Dantes when he is betrayed at first by men jealous of his career and fiancee, then again by a man who sees the possibility of benefiting himself by sending Dantes to his jail cell. After spending fourteen years in a gloomy dungeon, Dantes finally has a chance to escape and seek revenge on those who wronged him, whilst also rewarding those who stuck by him and fought to prove his innocence.I always try to read both positive and negative reviews of books so I can understand why people had a different opinion from my own, and the verdict on this from negative reviews seems to fall into one of two categories: 1) the book is too long, or 2) they were unable to side with Dantes when he sets out with his vengeful aims. Personally, I agree that The Count of Monte Cristo is several novels in one and I'm not surprised that it was originally published in installments. I think it could do with being split into volumes today, the size is off-putting. That aside, though, the story itself is fascinating. It brings in historical elements and combines them with a great set of fictional characters to make a very rich story. There are parts that are sad and parts that are heartwarming and it all adds up to a great balance of the two.As for the second problem, it is my own personal taste that I love a good revenge story. I know forgiveness is supposed to be a virtue of the giver and perhaps it doesn't make me a great human being that I couldn't shake the hand of the person who'd ruined my life. Perhaps. But I believe Dantes suffered more than anyone in this tale, even after he had got his revenge. And I always did cheer for the likes of Beatrix Kiddo. So when the \"avenging angel\" struck, I was right there with him.I think it says something when a 1200+ page novel doesn't bore me for a second, and The Count of Monte Cristo never once dragged as it took me through a plot spanning many years. There are several stories being told throughout and I found all of them interesting: Dantes' betrayal, The Shawshank Redemption-style time in prison where Dantes makes a close friend, the historical story of Napoleon's return, and Dantes' search for revenge. It's hard not to be enthralled by this complex world and variety of characters. My one complaint is the direction Dantes' romantic life took in the end, but whatever, there are over a thousand pages of awesomeness here and if you have the time to spare for this book/doorstopper/possible murder weapon, you should definitely read it."}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL":

That's because they make television drama series and soap operas instead. To my mind, this novel is the 19th Century equivalent of a long-running and compelling television series. I can readily imagine being a reader of the Journal des D\u00e9bats between August 1844 and January 1846, impatiently waiting for the next installment of Le Comte de Monte Cristo to be published, eagerly discussing each installment with my friends around the 19th Century equivalent of the water-cooler, exclaiming at each plot development, gasping at every cliff-hanger. What fun it has been over the past few weeks to consume The Count of Monte Cristo in much the same way as I watched all seven seasons of The West Wing one after another a few years ago: wanting to spend as much time as I could with the story, yet simultaneously wanting to slow down in order to prolong the enjoyment, loving (almost) every moment of it. The Count of Monte Cristo is probably more Dallas than it is The West Wing, but you get the general idea. The plot\u2019s the thing here. Dumas (and his collaborator August Maquet) created a dense and complex story, the many threads of which are woven together into a most satisfying whole, with no threads left loose at the end of more than 1200 pages. This is the story Edmond Dant\u00e8s\u2019 revenge against the three men who caused him to be unjustly accused of treason and imprisoned for fourteen years. Dant\u00e8s, who becomes the Count of Monte Cristo, carries out his revenge after developing a careful plan over many years. For him, revenge is most definitely a dish to be eaten cold. It\u2019s also a dish which causes a degree of moral indigestion, as he comes to realise that what he sees as a divine obligation can have unintended (and horrific) consequences.It\u2019s far from a plausible story and it\u2019s fair to say that the theme of revenge is more successfully realised than is the theme of redemption. The plot is indeed totally over the top, with elements of fable and fairy tale, replete with Orientalist imagery which for me brought to mind The Arabian Nights. Luckily for such an intricately plotted novel, the story moves along at a cracking pace, much of it in dialogue, which makes for an easy read notwithstanding the novel\u2019s length. Characterisation is somewhat sacrificed in the process of weaving the many strands of the plot together. While the Count himself is a compelling character, other characters are less so and female characters in particular are rather flat. One exception is Eug\u00e9nie Danglars, who has the potential to be very interesting in her own right, although not enough time is spent with her for her potential to be fully realised. However, deficiencies in characterisation are more than made up for by the sheer thrill of the tale. My enjoyment of The Count of Monte Cristo has been increased by it being a buddy read with several members of the Comfort Reads group. It has also been increased by listening to it as a French language audiobook downloaded from www.audiocite.net. Apart from hearing Dumas\u2019 words as they were written, there was the immense joy of hearing beautiful, literary French, including the wonderful simple past tense, never heard in regular speech. I can\u2019t say that this is a flawless novel and deserves five stars for that reason. But I was on the edge of my seat as I listened to it for some 47 hours. As I neared the end, I started wondering just how soon I could justify a re-read. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406752-joe", "userReview": "[Paraplegic mutes communicate with only their eyeballs (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1162892-j", "userReview": "What does it say about me as a critic when the best book I\u2019ve read all year was first serialized in the 1840s? From start to finish thoroughly enjoyable, Alexandre Dumas\u2019 1200 page revenge epic The Count of Monte Cristo wastes little time in not thrusting the plot along, quite violently so at times, and includes within a brief, sketchy history of the return of Napoleon and his subsequent second defeat, a primer on hashish, and a proto-seed for the detective tale that would later blossom under Poe and Doyle.The story is less well known than that in The Three Musketeers, though the outline is familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent time reading and watching noir fiction and movies. A young sailor, Edmond Dant\u00e8s, engaged to be married to the beautiful Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, is accused of a crime he has not committed by a man in love with his fianc\u00e9e. The accuser, Fernand, is assisted in his perfidy by one of Dant\u00e8s\u2019 shipmates, Danglars, and an envious neighbor, Caderousse, as well as the political calculations of the young royal prosecutor Villefort. Cast into prison for fourteen years, Dant\u00e8s befriends an Abb\u00e9 written off by prison officials as crazy who bequeaths to him on his deathbed a hidden fortune. Escaping from prison, Dant\u00e8s finds the treasure, buys himself the title of Count, and returns to France to put into effect his long-nurtured schemes of revenge.All of that takes place within the novel\u2019s first 250 pages. The remaining one thousand allows the plot of slow-planned revenge time to stretch its legs, look about, and move forward with the inexorable pacing of Fate. Dant\u00e8s, now in his persona of the Count (as well as in other various disguises such as the Englishman Lord Wilmore and the Italian Abb\u00e9 Busoni), plots a revenge that capitalizes on each character\u2019s weakness and vanity.Sensing the malevolence in Villefort\u2019s young wife, he introduces her to a sleeping draught/poison of his own devising, with which she begins to poison members of the prosecutor\u2019s family in an attempt to secure a sizable inheritance for her son by a previous marriage. Through one scheme after another he reduces the proud banker that Danglars has become to a penniless wreck. A similar betrayal in Fernand\u2019s past is resuscitated in part by the Count and rises up to disgrace him permanently. Caderrouse destroys himself through his own base greed and cunning.All of this unfolds with delicious grace, and you relish each move the Count makes in his ongoing revenge, but underneath it all, a creeping note begins to sneak into the story. When Dant\u00e8s himself was sent to prison, it was an action aimed solely at him by the three conspirators, and yet the ripples of this violence stretched outwards, consuming his fianc\u00e9e Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; crippling the business of his former employer Morrel, who never found a young captain equal to Dant\u00e8s; and crushing the life out of Dant\u00e8s\u2019 father, who eventually died of starvation. The Count comes to see, through his friendships with the next generation of all the major players, how his actions cause grief and suffering that extend beyond the targets of his own revenge.This realization makes up the novel\u2019s closing chapters wherein the Count mulls over the right of vengeance and the notion of redemption and comes to peace with his idea of a godly revenge. Partly this is inspired by an earlier episode when he is required to save the life of Villefort\u2019s daughter as she is in love with (and is loved by) Morrel\u2019s son Maximilian. But also a great deal of this has to do with Dant\u00e8s\u2019 love for Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, as well as his newfound love for Hayd\u00e9e, a young Greek, daughter of the Ali Pasha, and his (Dant\u00e8s\u2019) slave.In fact, these are the twin threads around which the entirety of the story revolves, love and revenge. It is Fernand\u2019s love for Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s that leads to his conspiracy against Dant\u00e8s. It is Dant\u00e8s love for Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s that keeps him alive in prison. It is Maximilian Morrel\u2019s love of Valentine Villefort that saves her life, as much as it is Dant\u00e8s\u2019 love of Maximilian\u2019s father. Likewise, Madame de Villefort\u2019s love of her son directs her toward her poisoning scheme.And while it is Dant\u00e8s\u2019 revenge that brings every character to a reckoning, there is in each of the characters\u2019 pasts delinquent accounts that eventually must be paid, a revenge against them by Fate of which Dant\u00e8s is only the tool. Caderousse\u2019s backstabbing and betrayals will eventually get the better of him; Villefort\u2019s illegitimate child will also return to play havoc with his name and reputation; Danglars\u2019 cupidity will trap him in a bandit\u2019s layer; and Fernand\u2019s own treachery will lead to his public humiliation.In this, it is as if Dumas is saying that all wicked men carry within them the seeds of their own destruction, carry it close to their hearts as part and parcel of who they are. Those who live to a ripe old age without a calling to the judge, jury, and executioner of Fate are only blessed in that they never double-crossed a Dant\u00e8s.In part based on a true story, Dumas\u2019 novel runs through its 1200 pages with a leonine hunger and rapidity. While he may have been paid by the line, the man was such an elegant craftsman that it is hard in thinking back through the novel to come up with any one part that could be successfully pared away without hurting much of the novel\u2019s concerns and central conceits. To lose many of the complicated subplots would make a hash of not only Dant\u00e8s\u2019 schemes and plans, but would also fatally weaken Dumas\u2019 central message of justified vengeance versus pure malevolence.If there is any part of the Count\u2019s character that at times must give the reader pause, it isn\u2019t his heartlessness toward his enemies or his financial profligacy en route to his revenge (he literally tosses around millions of francs), it\u2019s that he lives so strongly for a certain structured effect. The scene of the Morrel family salvation, when Dant\u00e8s, in his first act since coming to his wealth, rescues his former employer from ruin and suicide, plays itself out up to the very last second. This is no doubt Dumas playing suspense thriller with his readership, but it leaves somewhat of a bad taste. We are given a Count who prefers design to humanity, and while this is all very good for one\u2019s enemies, a bit more heart toward one\u2019s friends would be appreciated.It\u2019s a minor enough quibble in well over a thousand pages that, let me repeat unequivocally, barely lets up or gives you time to turn your attention elsewhere. But it remains, long after other larger scenes have left my memory, as a kind of capricious cruelty. Perhaps we need to be somewhat frightened of the Count ourselves; perhaps it is a warning, slyly inserted well to the beginning of the revenge scenario. See, before you plot yourselves, the author seems to imply, see what inhumanity revenge can make you capable of. It is a haunting suggestion."}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste", "userReview": "Full review now posted!I finally finished! I feel like I\u2019ve been reading this forever. Not because I didn\u2019t like it, of course. Au contraire, I loved it! It\u2019s a wonderful book, and definitely deserves it\u2019s status as a classic. But it was dense and intricate and long, and wasn\u2019t a book to be sped through. This tome is meant to be savored, and savor it I did. The Count of Monte Cristo is without a doubt the best tale of vengeance I\u2019ve ever read, and one of the most intricately plotted books I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of picking up.Edmond Dantes seems to have it all together. He loves his career aboard a merchant vessel, and the love of his life is waiting to marry him when he returns home. But there are those in his life who are jealous of his good fortune, of his love, of his happiness. And so, jealous \u201cfriends\u201d plot the downfall of Dantes, and he\u2019s arrested on his wedding day. His prosecutor, though he knows Dantes is innocent, is faced with information that would shine a terrible light on himself. Information that only Dantes knows. And so, the prosecutor has Dantes sent to Chateau d\u2019If, where he hopes the prisoner will never be heard from again. But fate has other plans, and vengeance will be wrought on these four men who had succumbed to jealousy and ruined the life of another.The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most mysterious characters I\u2019ve ever encountered. He\u2019s richer than Midas, no one knows anything about his past, including his name, and he takes Paris completely by storm when he appears on the scene. He is both an avenging angel and an angel of mercy. As he ingratiates himself into three important families on the Parisian scene, we get to know these families and watch as their lives fall apart around them. I\u2019ve only ever read the abridged version of this book before. The Great Illustrated Classic was my very favorite book when I was about 8 or so. And I read the more \u201cgrown-up\u201d abridged version in eighth grade. I thought I knew the story pretty well, but I wanted to have read the book in its entirety, so I finally picked it up. And I almost put it down. There were so many little details in the middle section of the book that I thought were superfluous. I got so bogged down for a while, and almost decided that the abridged version had been enough. But my mama didn\u2019t raise no quitter, so I stuck with it. And I\u2019m so glad that I did!Those little details that I thought were pointless? They really mattered. As I started nearing the end and seeing how all of these small details were coming back into play, I was completely stunned by complex the plot was. Every single tiny aspect of this book, all of the things that I thought weren\u2019t necessary were totally necessary. I was blown away by how everything came together in the end.I could write a thousand more words about the characters, the methods of vengeance, the plot twists, and more. But, even though this is a classic story, I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for those who have little exposure to the story. Suffice it to say that, without this book, our culture would be missing something, as this book has served as foundation and inspiration for countless stories in various formats. Is this a quick, easy read? Not even close. Is it worth the time and effort necessary to read it? It is indeed. Give it a read, but take your time.

Everything about it feels long--from the words, to the sentences, to the scenes. Given that it was serially published and Dumas therefore made his money by the word, it's obvious why. But trust me, this story is NOT a waste of time.What it is--is everything. What starts as a thriller, becomes a Game of Thrones-style soap opera, and finishes as a murder mystery. It's a revenge story, in theory, but more than anything it's about love. It's really an existential coming-of-age for adults. The length of seven books, The Count of Monte Cristo contains nearly as many themes and plots and characters. Probably, it covers twice as many subjects. It's basically a Bible.Something tricky about it is that the first hundred and some pages are absolutely phenomenal. The story starts better than just about anything else, which kind of surprised me. For something of this length, I expected it to be slow--and at times it is--but the beginning is definitely a page turner, one that doesn't read dated at all, which again surprised me. This book is like two hundred years old and translated from French--and while at times it's as head-scratching as Shakespeare--the beginning feels like reading a really good Michael Crichton book.Edmond Dantes / The Count of Monte Cristo is, logically, the first character introduced. He's incredibly likable from the start: he's 19, has his shit together, treats his father like gold, is madly in love, and excellent at his job. In short, there's a Disney story ahead of him. Just thinking about it is exciting, until in quick succession several extremely unlikable characters are introduced whom all conspire against him. They're jealous little evil bitches and they plot and scheme, and as their deeds unfold, the story becomes a thriller. Unfortunately, the characters that start the book are definitely the best, beside one or two others. Fortunately, after they throw a giant fork into Dantes' road, they don't just disappear. No, this is a revenge story. They come back and get what they got coming to 'em.The problems start to arise after the first 300 or so pages, after Dantes gets screwed, suffers, loses hope, becomes bitter, and transcends into the Count of Monte Cristo. After this, about 15 new characters are introduced, only one of whom really measures up to the previous cast. Dumas spends the next 500 pages of the story predominately fleshing out these characters in the form of a soap opera, which is frustrating. The previous ones are so good, you're way more eager to learn about them. It feels like you're getting off topic, lost in new characters that only fit into the story tangentially by theme. And, although this part isn't necessarily bad or insufferable, compared to the thrilling first act, this soap opera seems that way. It doesn't help that this part of the story is when the language dates itself, the sentences grow to their longest, the dialogue seems like one soliloquy after another, and the words they speak are plain archaic. The story seems to go downhill, quickly picking up steam, ultimately headed for a nasty crash and burn.It doesn't. If the first hundred pages aren't the best in all of literature, it's only because the last hundred are somehow even better. All of the crazy complexity Dumas writes into the second act of the story comes together in the third. What seemed to only tangentially fit into the story becomes the glue that holds together a masterpiece. And when The Count of Monte Cristo starts exacting his revenge you spent 900 pages eagerly anticipating, of course it's satisfying as hell. What makes it even better is seeing Edmond Dantes resurface himself in the ugly skin of Monte Cristo. After all his misery has made his existence merely to put others through worse (albeit somewhat justifiably), you start to love him again, and he shows that The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a simple revenge story that went on for way too long. No, it's much more than that.But if you want to know, you'll just have to read it for yourself.

There is a catch of course, and Abb\u00e9 Faria himself knew that: he had not only given his student a perfect education, and taught him the art of deduction as well as social behaviour. He had also, with regret, taught him the dark and painful passion of revenge. That, of course, is not necessarily a skill I would wish my students to acquire. But there is another layer to the jokingly expressed thoughts in the staff room:What made me think of the Count of Monte Cristo in the first place? Why did it give me and my colleague a moment of pleasure while we shared frustration over the lack of focus and concentration that comes with consistent exposure to online activities on screens and their random thread of information without depth or context? The imaginary story is our revenge on the reality we can't change! By remembering childhood reading pleasure, we escaped the Ch\u00e2teau d'If of contemporary educational issues for a moment, and travelled in time and space to a world of adventure, excitement, and entertainment that lasts a lifetime. I doubt if students even remember after half an hour what they \"really needed to check on google\" very quickly, but the itinerary of Edmond Dant\u00e8s is with me forever. I will never forget him, and how he learned what drove his presumed friends to send him to imprisonment: love, money, career. The driving forces in humanity. And I will never forget how utterly satisfied I was with his perfect revenge, even though I realised from the beginning that it would be rather evil if carried out in real life, instead of on paper.That is what literature is for, partially at least. To let the imagination take over, to offer satisfaction and closure for the story lines that just confusedly continue in real life, with no end in sight (like threads on the internet).I wish my students would read the Count of Monte Cristo to experience the feeling of escapism in the old-fashioned way, by diving deep into one literary mission and following that one thread to the bitter end, instead of letting themselves be carried away on random odysseys in the shallow waters of the internet. I think that would help them concentrate and focus, just like Edmond Dant\u00e8s. But I hear myself sighing in response to my own suggestion:\"They don't read anymore! Not that kind of book!\" But maybe, if we shut them into the Ch\u00e2teau d'If? I'd be prepared to take their revenge afterwards, if they came out prepared for life and equipped with the skills they need! And for those of you who do not know me yet: my introductory lesson plan with each new class is always: 1. \"How to understand my teacher's sense of humour?\"2. What is irony?3. What is sarcasm?Example: If I say I want to lock up my students, how likely is it to be true?

I still retain a hope that a Modern Classic that I enjoy as much as I do pre-20th works will pop up somewhere, but I am thinking it is becoming an increasingly unlikely scenario.The Count of Monte Cristo is a behemoth of French 19th Century Literature of a decidedly vengeful flavour. I have read very little French literature, having spent most of my time on the English variety, but this book still retains some very English-type Classic Literature qualities (I would presume the translation had a little to do with this) and read true to the Classical style. Descriptive yet punctual, with large amounts of dialogue that are not just diatribes or means to translate the plot to the reader.Edmond Dant\u00e9s is a poor unfortunate soul whom fate seems not to like as he is betrayed by men he has no reason to dislike-or so he thinks-and is thrown in to the Ch\u00e2teau d'If and the key is thrown thereafter (but in a different direction). Edmond Dant\u00e9s-later the Count of Monte Cristo-is a most marvellous man, with many flaws, many perfections and many wonders. I enjoyed him immensely, as I did most of the characters. I find that women in Classic Literature are treated in varying ways, but Dumas has a kind of Dickensian way about his writing of women: they are not weak or placid or there only to be abused or looked at, but there again they are often very 19th Century in other ways. Very few people can make me feel a sympathy for the Upper Classes of society and Dumas appears to have done it.Another side to Classic Literature that I love is the world-building. Whilst most of the land that we read about in these books still exist today, Classics evoke the true sense of how they were over a hundred years ago and I rarely feel that in other types of books. You can describe a place in Scotland for a Scottish Noir Crime Thriller as detailed and grimy as you want but I rarely get the sense of the place as a whole: Dumas truly evokes the destitute calmness of the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, of the spartan and isolated island of Monte Cristo and of the many luxurious abodes of the Count himself. I have not felt as transported with a book like I have with this one.Of course, it was not without fault. I feel almost every single same emotion and opinion on The Count of Monte Cristo as I did with War and Peace and that includes the reasons for not giving a perfect rating. It was too long-it just was. There are plenty of long Classics ranging from 400-700 pages that are perfectly serviced by their Not-1000-Pages and I feel that's where this book fell short. This means that there are paragraphs, here and there-dotted about in no particular pattern-that are utterly tedious and don't contribute to the story very much, if at all. I cannot bring myself to ignore such moments of tedium, no matter how much I enjoy the story, the characters or the plot, because I know-and have read-books that are not this long but are just as well written.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"}, {"userName": "Manju", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11166121-manju", "userReview": "I generally don't read classics. it's only in last 2-3 years that i have started collecting these lovely penguin classics editions and i emphasis here on \"collecting\" as it is easier than reading. But now i have been slowly going through my physical bookshelf. last year I read David Copperfield and this year it's Idiot and now this. Okay, I started Idiot and Cristo last year and finally finished reading them this year. Finishing this tome was a real challenge as you get to know within few chapters that it will be a revenge story. There are plot twists that one would guess about miles ahead, the character at times felt shallow and sometimes it seems like things were exaggerated for no reason. but would i change this for anything else? No. because it would feel like you have cut an essential limb from the body.it is scary to see how close Dumas has come to predict the future through this story. He talks about betrayal, corruption, jealousy, politics, and love in this book and even after 170 years society has not changed, if possible things has gotten worse. With a length of 1276 pages and utterly predictable, this book is still an amazing adventure to go on.

Alas, it's a lot more than just that! At 1200 pages, don't you think it ought to be? :)I'll skip a breakdown of the plot because a ton of people will already have done this or watched some version on TV, but since I have also never watched a movie of this, I cannot say how well they do.I CAN, however, say that I was never bored. Not once. From conspiracy and intrigue, the hope of a grand happy life, dashed, the fear of Napoleon coming back to the mainland driving some jerks to frame the poor kid Edmund Dantes and sentence him to a life in a nasty castle prison on the eve of his own wedding... it sounds glorious, fantastically evil. And it is. But that's just the start of the fun.In prison, he befriends and is befriended by a learned man of the cloth with great knowledge and the secret of a great treasure, but it still takes Eddy 14 years of his youth to orchestrate a grand escape by way of a cannonball attached to his leg, being tossed into the sea as the dead.What drives him is REVENGE on those people who put him away through no fault of his own.The other 850 pages is a wild rags-to-riches story as he takes on the guise of the brilliantly rich Count of Monte Cristo as he inveigles, bribes, buys, and cons his way into high society in Paris. He never loses sight of his overarching theme of revenge, looking up and looking into every one of the creeps that took away his whole future, but unlike the modern tales of revenge we're familiar with, he does it in a very Christian way.If a man properly repents and does good deeds, Eddy forgives. If the jerk remains a jerk, then Eddy conspires with all his intelligence and wealth to bring about the utter ruin of his enemy. And I mean utter ruin. Not just their wealth, but their family, their hopes, even their very souls... he casts them down into the abyss. :) Slowly. Carefully. Eddy is never blithe about his task. He makes sure it is the right thing to do, always questioning, always giving his enemies more and more and more rope... and through many diverse plot threads, we see the noose close around each and all... unless they are good.And like judge, jury, and executioner, Eddy gives each of them their just desserts. :)Classic? More than classic. It's still an easy and delightful read even for us moderns. Timeless? Perhaps. One of the best novels ever written?Yes.With one caveat. There's a lot of modern favorites in the movies and novels that take directly from the plots and themes here. Like, huge swaths. Like Shawshank Redemption and V for Vendetta. These movies even make huge references to the Count. :) It also has a rich tradition in my own personal favorite genres such as SF. The Demolished Man by Bester very strongly comes to mind, as does the Lightbringer books by Weeks in Fantasy. :) It's telling that stories like this are still such huge crowd pleasers, no? What's wrong with us??? lol"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ Edmont Dantes question his righteous conviction that God is on his side.

I want to be Providence, because the thing that I know which is finest, greatest and most sublime in the world is to reward and to punish. ... and only later asking the hard questions about the right and wrong of his path, especially when trying to accuse the children of the sins of their fathers.

I joined a classics reading group and carefully chose books that I thought I would like, and am thrilled to say that I have read some wonderful stories. I gave books like East of Eden, Wuthering Heights, The Odyssey, and The Master and Margarita a solid 4 stars because I thought they were fantastic. I gave books like Hamlet, Bleak House, and The Idiot 5 stars because they are those rare books that change lives. They definitely changed mine. Using those criteria, I would give The Count of Monte Cristo a squintillion stars if I could. This is not only the best book I have read this year, it easily surpassed my favorite book of all time. I remember when I finished the last sentence of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and I cried so hard because it was all over. I wanted to forget that I had read it and start over to experience that amazingness again for the first time. This is the first novel I have read since then that made me feel the same way.This is a story of a young sailor who had everything going for him: a good mind, a good soul, the respect of his crew, a future job as a captain, the confidence of his boss, the adoration of his father, and the love of a beautiful woman who had promised to be his wife. In an instant, and truly in just the first few chapters of this very long novel, all that was taken from him by a bunch of envious, jealous, and greedy shitwad bastards who \nDESERVED TO DIE THE MOST HORRIBLE DEATHS FOR WHAT THEY DID\n................ I'm sorry, I guess I got a bit emotional there. Actually, I got emotional through this entire novel. I cried; I cheered; I laughed. I went to sleep thinking about the characters and woke up thinking about revenge. I wanted to find a way to go back in time and burn down France for a fictional character. The author did an admirable job of putting me right in the story and feeling the hatred, love, fear, sympathy, and all the other feels that the characters experienced. This is a novel that will put your emotions through the ringer. This is also a novel that will make you think and question. How far is it okay to go? When do you stop? For whom do you stop? Is this okay? Is God on the side of the good guys or the bad guys? Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? Does checking out from humanity protect you or isolate you? What happens when you want to return, and how do you get there? As The Count himself said, \"All human wisdom is contained in these two words: 'wait' and 'hope'!\" Here are my words of wisdom: Read the unabridged version translated by Robin Buss. It has a chapter that many versions leave out, and that chapter, at least to me, is vital."}, {"userName": "Lizzy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575403-lizzy", "userReview": "\u201cLife is a storm, my young friend.

His boss promoted him, his lady-love's family beams approvingly at their wedding feast, and......the police arrive and arrest him for treason (this takes place in the Napoleonic War era, so this was a hot-button topic), he's sent to the Chateau d'If, tortured, held despite protestations if innocence, and finally escapes with the terminal assistance of the Abb\u00e9 Faria, whose death offers Edmond the means of escape and the means to achieve revenge on the horrible people who, out of jealousy, deprived him of his youth.Revenge is, indeed, a dish best served cold.

Dusty pages - GDL ClassiciEcco l'ho finito. Non mi sembra vero. Mi ero ormai affezionata ad Edmond Dantes, alias Conte di Montecristo e a tutti i personaggi. Mi mancher\u00e0 molto andare a dormire solo dopo aver letto qualche capitolo di questo meraviglioso libro.Non ho mai voluto leggerlo prima, perch\u00e8 ho sempre avuto il timore che mi potesse annoiare e lasciare libri in sospeso proprio non piace. Invece con mia grande sopresa mi sono ritrovata a leggere senza mai alzare la testa dal libro, senza voler mai smettere di leggere se non arrivata all'ultima pagina.La storia si sa. Il povero Edmond Dantes, viene accusato e imprigionato ingiustamente.Non dico nient'altro, anche perch\u00e8 dovete leggerlo come ho fatto io. Vi assicuro che non ve ne pentirete.Lettura fluida, divertente, angosicante, piena di soprese, di intrighi che non annoiano mai. Io ho adorato tutto. La trasformazione di Edmond nel Conte e alla fine questo suo tornare in pace con se stesso davvero sono senza parole. Mi si \u00e8 stretto il cuore..ed ero l\u00ec l\u00ec per versare una lacrimuccia...Meraviglioso. Non trovo le parole per esprimere quanto mi sia piaciuto questo capolavoro. In realt\u00e0 vrei tante cosa da dire, ma spoilerei troppo. E il bello di questo libro e il non sapere che cosa succede.Ecco forse qualche parte l'avrei un p\u00f2 assottigiliata, ma \u00e8 stato tutto necessario. Infatti non sono proprio 5 stelle. Dumas (padre) \u00e8 proprio bravo a catturare il lettore. L'ho visto nei \"tre moschettieri\" ma qui si supera.Grazie ragazze per evermi incoraggiato e avermi fatto leggere questo capolavoro."}, {"userName": "Jayanth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6388515-jayanth", "userReview": "One of the best books I have ever read! I am speechless after reading this novel. This is one of those books, which after you finish the last page, you just stare into the wall for hours on end, contemplating all the things you have read in the book, all the things it has taught you, all the things you promised yourself to remember. Oh, this book has a soul and it has taken mine on an unforgettable journey. Literature such as in this book moves me to tears, both while I read and when I have finished reading. This is some ~1300 page book, quite a long read. I have put away reading this classic due to its length but now that I read it completely, I feel I could read this book a million times more and never feel bored on even one page, for the story that is narrated in these thousand pages is one which has made my heart feel a million emotions in a gazillion new ways leaving my mind with a glaring crack through which seeped in an innumerable amount of thoughts and ideas.Dear Alexandre Dumas,I take a bow, for no words of mine suffice or are worthy enough to praise your work enough. PS: I completed this book by reading an ebook and simultaneously listening to a free Librovox audiobook narrated by the incredible David Clarke(please listen to his audiobook, he brings life to each and every character with his incredible voice acting). The fear or off-putting feeling the length of this book induces before one intends to take on such a book doesn't do justice to the treasures one finds and possesses after reading this novel."}, {"userName": "Gi\u00f2", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4613789-gi", "userReview": "Sull'isola con MontecristoAvevo sette anni quando la RAI trasmetteva in TV lo storico sceneggiato tratto dal capolavoro di Dumas. Ne ho pochissimi ricordi, giusto qualche vaga immagine in bianco e nero. In compenso ricordo perfettamente i commenti di mia sorella maggiore e delle sue amiche sulle qualit\u00e0 \u201cfisicamente intelligenti\u201d di quel bonazzo di Andrea Giordana nelle molteplici vesti di Edmond Dant\u00e8s.Cos\u00ec conoscevo la trama de\u2019 Il Conte di Montecristo solo approssimativamente, non avendolo mai letto, nemmeno in versione ridotta, fino ad ora. Ai tempi della scuola, ma anche dopo, tra amici e parenti, si tendeva a snobbarlo: un libro per ragazzi troppo lungo; scritto con una prosa mediocre da un artigiano pagato a cottimo; pubblicato a puntate su un giornale francese di met\u00e0 Ottocento, per di pi\u00f9 conservatore; una trama inverosimile, intricatissima, con zero introspezione, con zero \u201cproblematiche\u201d e con un incrocio tra un superuomo e un angelo vendicatore per protagonista. Insomma, leggere il tomone pareva una gran perdita di tempo e piuttosto disdicevole tra i lettori veramente impegnati.Eh s\u00ec, perch\u00e9 come dice bene Procyon nel suo brillante commento (che vi consiglio vivamente): noi della nostra generazione, in buona parte, siamo cresciuti catechizzati per benino, col comandamento \u201cricordati di rifuggire il feuilleton, che \u00e8 robetta\u201d.Ora che l\u2019ho letto, posso tranquillamente dire che questo romanzo figura in cima alla personale lista dei libri che porterei con me su un isola sperduta e, dato l\u2019argomento, l\u2019isola, qui, casca a fagiolo. Dumas \u00e8 un genio e un mago delle alchimie non solo perch\u00e9 sa combinare abilmente nel suo romanzo d\u2019appendice molti generi e sottogeneri letterari \u2013 il romanzo popolare, lo storico, quello di avventura, il picaresco, quello di ambiente - con incursioni nel giallo, nel mistero e nel fantastico, ma anche perch\u00e9, cos\u00ec come il Conte riesce a ubriacare a suo piacimento con i suoi intrugli e le sue erbe i vari personaggi che incontra, Dumas, con la sua spettacolare capacit\u00e0 narrativa, procura una sbornia al lettore che dura dalla prima all\u2019ultima pagina. Lo fa con le sue iperboliche esagerazioni, con i suoi mille colpi di scena, con i suoi personaggi cos\u00ec tipici, con le sue invenzioni, con il saper non dimenticare nemmeno il pi\u00f9 piccolo dettaglio perch\u00e9 la cosa potrebbe inficiare una trama intricatissima che si dipana in una narrazione infinita, nel saper stupire ed emozionare anche quando le mosse dei personaggi e gli eventi sono esattamente ci\u00f2 che il lettore si aspetta, con il saper dosare e, quando serve, saper sovradosare la tensione il dramma il pathos, nel saper scegliere con precisione il momento giusto in cui sciogliere misteri ed enigmi, in cui far tirare un sospiro di sollievo. Un artigiano che lavorava a cottimo, che allungava il brodo esageratamente perch\u00e9 ogni riga in pi\u00f9 erano quattrini in pi\u00f9...Ma cara grazia!"}], "description": "The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the great thrillers of all time. In 1853 William Thackeray wrote to a friend: 'began to read Monte Cristo at six one morning and never stopped till eleven at night.'. Falsely accused of treason, the young sailor Edmund Dantes is arrested on his wedding day and imprisoned in the island fortress of the Chateau d'If. After staging a dramatic escape, he sets out to discover the fabulous treasure of Monte Cristo and catch up with his enemies. A novel of enormous tension and excitement, Monte Cristo is also a tale of obsession and revenge. Believing himself to be an 'Angel of Providence', Dantes pursues his vengeance to the bitter end, only then realizing that he himself is a victim of fate.", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1088140.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "average": 4.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330242790l/1088140.jpg", "reviews": 17077, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4785.Alexandre_Dumas", "name": "Alexandre Dumas"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/224319.Robin_Buss", "name": "Robin Buss"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Historical", "Adventure", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1088140.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16148750-the-count-of-monte-cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17665173", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7131.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34516586-the-count-of-monte-cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11560116-the-count-of-monte-cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8127528-the-count-of-monte-cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522110.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783756._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23915281", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25168135-il-conte-di-montecristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3400712-il-conte-di-montecristo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7190.The_Three_Musketeers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54499.The_Man_in_the_Iron_Mask", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/388223.The_Prince_of_Thieves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7184.Twenty_Years_After", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153875.Queen_Margot_or_Marguerite_de_Valois"]}
