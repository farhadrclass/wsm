Back before you went to college and found out that Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen weren't funny after all, but Samuel Beckett and Charles Dickens were hilarious? Remember when the words on the page didn't just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity, but actually made you laugh out loud? Well, that's the kind of humor that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's 1990 release Good Omens brims with, and it is so damn good.The two British authors were both relatively unknown at the time of their partnership, having met when Gaiman (working as a journalist at the time) interviewed Pratchett on the success of his first major novel, The Colour of Magic. The two became quick friends and proceeded to write the 398 pages of the now cult classic novel by sending floppy disks through the mail and calling each other on the phone. Of course, that story is all explained in the appendix, provided you don't pick up an original printing of the book (if you do do that, however, you can probably sell it for quite a bit of change, so don't be discouraged by your lack of author interviews).But the real story at hand is, of course, the narrative of Good Omens itself--the tale of two friends, a demon named Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale who have spent all of human existence on earth and have rather come to like it, so when it comes time for the Apocalypse, they try to do whatever is in their powers to stop it. The cast of co-stars can only described as \"vast,\" with some characters only popping in long enough for Aziraphale to take over their body or to go on a shooting rampage. The main other characters though, include: the Antichrist himself, a young boy named Adam, and his gang of friends; a witchfinder named Newton Pulsifer and his love interest, Anathema Device, who just happens to be a witch (and one whose ancestor, Agnes Nutter was burned at the stake by Newton's great-great-etc. grandfather, Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer.Perhaps you're beginning to pick up on that sense of humor I mentioned?That's what makes this book so great. I'm sort of a sucker for religious humor (and religious horror movies), and I've read a lot of books about the End Days. This one has to rank near the top, maybe even as the downright finest. It's humor ranges from simple little comedic bits to social commentary on religion and the human race--but no matter how big or small the joke is, every one of them is attended to equally, and they are all funny because of that. Though some of the British jokes and references flew by me (a problem the authors usually account for in their humorous footnotes), I really did enjoy this book, all the way from the plot down to how it was written. It really is an impressive feat for a co-authored book to feel so seemless (this honestly almost puts shame to the excellent Stephen King/Peter Straub double-ups, The Talisman and Black House).So let down your guard, pack away that condescension that your professors poured into you Lit class after Lit class, and resist the urge to turn up your nose at any novel you can buy in trade paperback form in airports for $7.99 (but higher in Canada--oh wait, not anymore!). I actually laughed out loud as I read Good Omens. A few times, to be completely honest. And that's pretty impressive for a cynical, jaded old bastard like me."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "I somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously. So I couldn't help wonderingWhat Madam Bovary Might Have Thought Of Good OmensThree days later, a package arrived; there was no return address, but she immediately recognised Rodolphe's hand. It contained a paperback novel, whose title was Good Omens. Feverishly, she cast herself over it. Her English was poor, but, with the aid of a dictionary, she persevered and soon made great progress.The more she read, the greater her bewilderment became. The book at first reminded her of Candide, which she had surreptitiously read at the convent, but M. Voltaire's \u00e9sprit had been replaced by another ingredient she was unable to name; she suspected that it must be the strange English invention they called humour. All the personages were well-meaning and agreeable; the witches, the torturers of witches, the prostitutes, even the Demons of Hell; they were filled with kindness and compassion, and their worst faults amounted to an occasional mild irritability. Where were the indifference and thoughtless cruelty that surrounded her, and which had now become the very air she breathed? She did not know whether Rodolphe had sent her the book to comfort her or to mock her in her despair, and her futile attempts to resolve this question gradually resulted in an agonising headache. Her husband prescribed an infusion of valerian, and persuaded her to retire for the night; she lay sleepless in her bed a long time, until the drug finally took effect just as the sky was beginning to lighten. She dreamed of apocalyptic prophecies, red-headed women wielding swords, endless circles of horseless carriages, young boys with dogs.In the morning, she remembered that she should purchase some arsenic.__________________________________It seemed unfair for this to be one-way. So, in the spirit of granting a right of reply, here's What Good Omens Might Have Thought Of Madam Bovary\"I saw this smashin' film yesterday on TV,\" said Adam, as the Them listened attentively. \"It was called Madam Bovver-Boy -\"\"She was a lady skinhead?\" interrupted Brian.\"No, stupid,\" said Adam. \"It's a French name. Bovver-Boy. By Flow-Bear.\"\"You mean Madame Bovary, by Flaubert,\" said Wensleydale. \"I read about it in The Encyclopaedia of World Literature.\"Adam gave him a withering glance. \"That's what I said,\" he continued. \"Madam Bovver-Boy, by Flow-Bear. She's married to this doctor, and he's dead borin', so she starts hangin' around with these two lovers, and then she maxes out her credit card, so she eats arsernick and poisons herself. The bit where she's dyin' of the arsernick is dead good. Her tongue's hanging out and she's screamin' -\"\"Why did she max out her credit card?\" asked Pepper.\"She was buying presents for her lovers,\" said Adam. \"Roses an' boxes of chocolates an' stuff like that -\"\"I thought the lovers were supposed to give her presents?\" said Brian dubiously. \"My sister's boyfriend gave her this huge bunch of roses on Valentine's Day, and a box of Quality Street, and a balloon with -\"\"She gave them presents instead because it was a proto-feminist novel,\" explained Wensleydale authoritatively. \"That's what The Encyclopaedia of World Literature says.\"Adam felt that his control of the situation was slipping, and decided to up the stakes. \"It's all true,\" he said, in an exegetical move that would have had Flaubert scholars around the world clutching their foreheads. \"Based on a true story,\" he added prudently, in case the The Encyclopaedia of World Literature happened to have opinions on the subject. Behind the bushes, Aziraphale raised an eyebrow. Crowley looked defensive. \"Very loosely based,\" he whispered hastily. \"I mean, I tempted her, it's my job you know, but Gustave changed the ending for dramatic purposes. Said it didn't work to have Rodolphe sort out her debts and then settle down in a cozy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 quatre with her, L\u00e9on and her husband. I told him that's what actually happened, but he insisted the arsenic worked better...\""}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/786347-derek", "userReview": "Overall, this book was a huge disappointment for me. I\u2019d heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years. When I finally started it, I was about 20 pages into it and thought, \u201cYes! This is going to be one of the most entertaining books I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d It was like reading The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide for the first time again. It was witty and fast-paced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion. And then about halfway through, I realized that I just wasn't really laughing as much anymore. The story seemed to get bogged down with characters that weren\u2019t that interesting for me to read about and who I often found a bit annoying. Most notably, the 11-year-old Antichrist and his friends seemed really out of place in the book. They felt like they would have been at home in a Norman Rockwell painting (or British equivalent)\u2014a ragtag bunch of kids with slingshots and backyard adventures. I think that I was supposed to find them and their inane conversations entertaining, maybe even a little bit cute, but every time they came around, which felt like quite a bit, I thought that the book just screeched to a halt.Most of the other characters in the book were great fun to read\u2014the demon and the angel and their strange sort of friendship was easily the best part of the book for me. The four horsemen of the apocalypse were also a lot of fun, at least most of the time. Overall, the premise was brilliant. What a disappointment for me that it just couldn\u2019t keep it together throughout. The ending seemed contrived and the resolution was just unsatisfying for me. I know that so many people loved this book. I wish that I could have enjoyed it as much as they did."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "In my personal hierarchy of books, this one comes a close second after Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita. What can I say - like (diabolical) father, like (infernal) son. \"It may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people.\"In a way, I can view this book as my own personal therapy session\u00b9 - that is, in addition to it being a hilarious dry-humor take on Armageddon and the ever-dual nature of humanity, its highs and lows and our ability to be both, frequently almost at the same time.\u00b9 As a kid, I had a habit of getting into the books clearly not meant for my age - like, for instance, The Omen, featuring the world's most infamous tricycle. My eight-year-old self was petrified. For months, I had nightmares, was scared of dogs, mistrustful of tricycles and had an irrational dislike of the number \"666\". Eight-year-olds with overactive imaginations were really NOT the intended audience of *that* book, after all.WARNING: THERE WILL BE MILD SPOILERS. BECAUSE I CAN.As predicted by the titular 17th century witch Agnes Nutter in her extremely nice accurate book of prophecies, handed down through centuries to her last living \"professional descendant\" Anathema Device, Armageddon is quickly approaching. The four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse have set out on their way, and that must mean things are getting serious.\n- You're Hells Angels, then? What chapter are you from?\"[...]- REVELATIONS, CHAPTER SIX.-----------\u201cDeath and Famine and War and Pollution continued biking towards Tadfield. And Grievous Bodily Harm, Cruelty To Animals, Things Not Working Properly Even After You've Given Them A Good Thumping but secretly No Alcohol Lager, and Really Cool People travelled with them.\u201d \n And this upcoming major event is a source of some serious worry for eternal-enemies-turned-reluctant-friends Aziraphale (An angel, and a part-time rare book dealer) and Crowley (An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards), the duo who, after six thousand years, have \"gone native\" and would infinitely prefer this world to the future where either side wins - the future (oh the horror!) without good music or bookshops or sushi restaurants. And so the unlikely allies decide to band together to prevent the end of the world.\"That's how it goes, you think you're on top of the world, and suddenly they spring Armageddon on you.\" Except things do not go as planned....(The lovely images above can be seen here and here).You see, the young 'Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness', due to an unforeseen turn of circumstances, happens to grow up outside of the influence of either celestial/underworld force. Aptly named Adam, he grows up - as his name suggests - perfectly human, in a little corner of paradise - the English village of Lower Tadfield. But Agnes Nutter is never wrong, and as her prophesies suggest, shortly after Adam's eleventh birthday (on which he DOES get a much wanted Hellhound Dog) the events of the end of the world are set in their inevitable, ineffable motion. But Adam's essential humanity puts a new spin on this old story:\"Something was happening inside his head.It was aching. Thoughts were arriving there without him having to think them. Something was saying, You can do something, Adam Young. You can make it all better. You can do anything you want. And what was saying this to him was ... him. Part of him, deep down. Part of him that had been attached to him all these years and not really noticed, like a shadow. It was saying: yes, it's a rotten world. It could have been great. But now it's rotten, and it's time to do something about it. That's what you're here for. To make it all better.\"The problem with the Antichrist Adam is that he, a human eleven-year-old boy, is fueled - unexpectedly - by Love and righteous indignation. He loves this world, and he, coming into his power, wants a very human thing - he wants to make it better. Don't we all? But do (and can?) his good intentions make any difference in the way things have been prophesied to go?\n\"It's like you said the other day,\" said Adam. \"You grow up readin' about pirates and cowboys and spacemen and stuff, and jus' when you think the world's all full of amazin' things, they tell you it's really all dead whales and chopped-down forests and nucular waste hangin' about for millions of years. 'Snot worth growin' up for, if you ask my opinion.\"If there is one thing this book gets through it's the belief in humanity. Not in its wickedness or goodness or anything like that. Just humanity, in all the multifaceted nature of it, in its righteousness and wretchedness, love and cruelty, strengths and weaknesses, stupidity and wisdom. \"And just when you'd think they were more malignant than ever Hell could be, they could occasionally show more grace than Heaven ever dreamed of. Often the same individual was involved. It was this free-will thing, of course. It was a bugger.\"Sometimes, maybe, when left to our own devices, when not preached to in one way or another, we can perhaps develop into flawed but hopefully decent beings - like Adam, named after the first human in the prophetic fashion, after all. Because what makes life interesting, as a particular angel and demon would loudly attest to, is precisely the combination of good and evil, nice and nasty, mean and kind that we all possess, in the precarious and miraculous balance that is the true treasure of humanity. Because it makes us act like people.\"I don't see what's so triflic about creating people as people and then gettin' upset 'cos they act like people,\u201d said Adam severely. \u201cAnyway, if you stopped tellin' people it's all sorted out after they're dead, they might try sorting it all out while they're alive.\"And maybe, just maybe, due to our always-balancing nature on the borderline between two conflicting universes that we, humans, inhabit, we will be able to eventually figure it out - without anyone messing with our heads, filling them with the Good or the Evil, endlessly preaching what they believe to be true - but simple letting us be ourselves. Maybe we will figure things out on our own.\"Adam stood smiling at the two of them, a small figure perfectly poised exactly between Heaven and Hell.Crowley grabbed Aziraphale's arm. \"You know what happened?\" he hissed excitedly. \"He was left alone! He grew up human! He's not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate, he's just ... a human incarnate.\"==============================........The brilliant Pratchett/Gaiman duo provides everything these two authors are famous for - easy readability, dry intelligent sarcasm-infused humor, seamless plot that pushes the limits of imagination while staying perfectly grounded in (albeit fantastical) reality, and first and foremost, very apt observations about human nature, as well as (in a true Pratchett-like way) a complete irreverence for the set-in-stone beliefs and ideas. At times it's easy for those familiar with their respective styles to tell which one of them penned which part, at times it's impossible - but it doesn't matter as their writing styles blend together so well, so seamlessly, so seemingly effortlessly.This is an excellent book - both funny and serious, at times utterly unpredictable, at times baffling, at times logical. It's a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to seriously reflect upon after having a good laugh. And for all of that it gets the ineffable five stars.\nHe stared down at the golden curls of the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.\"You know,\" he concluded, after a while, \"I think he actually looks like an Adam.\"\n--------June 2013: I just listened to this one on audiobook - AGAIN. I love it more and more with each time I do. I have to advise - if you plan to listen to this one, please get the British version with Stephen Briggs as the narrator (Isis Publishing) - it is lightyears better than Harper Audio.

This is actually a profound philosophical and theological treatise, exploring good and evil, nature versus nurture, free will, war, pollution, and organised religion. But it\u2019s cleverly disguised as a madcap caper featuring angels, demons, the M25 motorway, Manchester, raining fish, dolphins, Atlantis, aliens, the Apocalypse, the young Antichrist, Americans, footnotes for Americans, tunnelling Tibetans, witches, witch-finders, whales, Hell's Angels, Queen and Freddie Mercury, junk food made of junk, nuclear power, a flaming car, satanic nuns, an inadvertent baby-swap, a book of prophecy, and more besides. Lots of ineffability, too.The writing is so like Douglas Adams that it could be mistaken for a missing volume of Hitchhiker's, except for the pages of Just William slipped in, Calvino style.The Heavy StuffInscription from Terry: \u201cWe made the Devil do it\u2026\u201dIt echoes a line in the book: \u201cThe Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything. He didn\u2019t have to.\u201d The weight is smuggled into a plot that is simultaneously simple, complicated, and counter-intuitive. The Antichrist is born, but accidentally goes to a boringly normal, rural couple, rather than the intended satanists. With the Apocalypse due around his 11th birthday, opposing forces try to ensure they\u2019ll win, which requires first realising there\u2019s been a mix up - and then fixing it. On that simple trunk, a plethora of sub-plots and an even larger number of larger-than-life characters twist, and climb, and intertwine.Amidst the chaos and the warring factions, the fundamental question is whether Adam, the young Antichrist, will fulfil his destiny, whether \u201cBirth is just the start.. Upbringing is everything\u201d. After all, the Devil started off as an angel.The Odd CoupleAziraphale (angel) and Crowley (demon) have been on Earth a long time, developed a grudging fondness for it, its inhabitants, and even each other. Their tetchily co-operative, affectionately teasing relationship is central to the plot, the philosophy, and the humour.They\u2019ve reached an \u201cArrangement\u201d after realising \u201cthey have more in common with their immediate opponent than their remote allies\u2026 tacit non-interference\u2026 made certain that while neither really won, also neither really lost.\u201d Heaven wants to win the war; humanised Aziraphale comes to realise that he would prefer to avoid it.Bibliophilia\u201cAziraphale was an angel, but he also worshiped books.\u201d \u201cAziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours - he was incredibly good at it.\u201dNear where where Pratchett spent much of his life, is a cottage given over to second hand books. There are no unpleasant smells, but opening hours are limited, as are payment methods. Books are piled high and deep (double/triple) and vaguely sorted by category, but not by author... except for Pratchett. Here it is: There\u2019s a larger version in my GR photos HERE. Quotes - Religion* \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.\u201dI particularly like the fact the last phrase is emphasised with italics, even though, in a pitch-dark room, it\u2019s barely relevant. * \u201cWhen it came to avoiding going to church, the church he solidly avoided going to was\u2026 no-nonsense Church of England.\u201d* \u201cBeing brought up as a Satanist tended to take the edge off it. A Saturday thing.\u201d* Crowley is embarrassed by the enthusiasm of satanists, just as a \u201cVietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to Neighbourhood Watch meetings\u201d. * \u201cVoodoun is a very interesting religion for the whole family, even those members of it who are dead.\u201d* \u201cMarvin got religion. Not the quiet, personal kind, that involves doing good deeds and living a better life; not even the kind that involves putting on a suit and ringing people\u2019s door bells; but the kind that involves having your own TV network and getting people to send you money.\u201dQuotes - Good and Evil* \u201cMost demons weren\u2019t deep down evil\u201d but like \u201ctax inspectors - doing an unpopular job, maybe, but essential to the overall operation\u201d.* Often, the difference between good and evil isn\u2019t obvious: some of the world leaders Aziraphale thinks good are assumed to be evil by Crowley.* \u201cIf we beat them we\u2019d have to be our own deadly enemies\u2026 it\u2019s no good anyone winning\u201d. So, \u201cYou just had to decide who your friends really were.\u201d Quotes - Destiny versus Free WillSlightly spoilery.* \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to be who you are\u2026 Your birth and destiny are part of the Great Plan.\u201d...\u201cI don\u2019t see why it matters what is written\u2026 It can always be crossed out.\u201d* \u201cHe was left alone! He grew up human! He\u2019s not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate, he\u2019s just\u2026 a human incarnate.\u201d* \u201cNo one around Adam was ever in full control of their own mind\u201d.Quotes - Time* \u201cThe future came and went in the mildly discouraging way that futures do.\u201d* \u201cMemory\u2026 works backwards as well as forwards\u2026 Agnes didn\u2019t see the future. That\u2019s just a metaphor. She remembered it.\u201d* \u201cOn the cusp of recollection, a memory of things that hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d* Accurate predictions are little use if they\u2019re too narrow and specific. For example, \u201cDo notte buye Betamacks\u201d was only meaningful for a few short years.* \u201cDON\u2019T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.\u201dQuotes - People and Relationships* \u201cMany people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide.\u201d* \u201cCourting is always difficult when\u2026 an elderly female relative in the house\u2026 It\u2019s much worse when the relative has been dead for three hundred years.\u201d* \u201cNewt had indeed been harbouring certain thoughts about Anathema; not just harbouring them, in fact, but dry-docking them, refitting them, giving them a good coat of paint and scraping the barnacles off their bottom.\u201d* \u201cPollution [one of the Apocalyptic Horsepersons], while still walking, nevertheless gave the impression of oozing.\u201dQuotes - Other* \u201cA rain-swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins.\u201d* \u201cLeaping gratefully onto this new ice floe in the bewildering stream of consciousness.\u201d* \u201cHer spelling\u2026 was not so much appalling as three hundred years too late.\u201d Similarly, if anyone questions something my father says or writes, he claims it\u2019s just archaic; impossible to disprove!* \u201cEvery dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf.\u201dQuote - Best One-LinerA Hell\u2019s Angel asks one of the biking Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse what chapter they belong to: \u201cREVELATIONS, he said.

For ten years, Aziraphale (an Angel) and Crowley educate the child on the finer points of good and evil.  \n\u201cPeople couldn't become truly holy,\" he said, \"unless they also had the opportunity to be definitively wicked.\"\nThen, when the Anti-Christ was supposed to come into his full powers, Crowley and Aziraphale realize that they didn't have the right child.Furthermore, they simultaneously realize that they rather like Earth.

Also, here was one that I very much liked: \u201cMost books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft were written by men.\u201d Isn\u2019t that right, Madam Tracey?Madam Tracey: Um, er, ah \u2026Ron: What was so special about Good Omens that could create a spiritual gateway to open up and visit us here?Terry: Good Omens was about the end of the world, about a spiritual conflict, but mainly about being human, and how even angels and demons, yes even the Anti-Christ can find happiness here on earth and so we should too, or some such balderdash, I recall it selling rather well.Neville: The end of the world?

Even though I adore almost every word he puts to paper, I am still aware of the fact that he is not everyone's cup of tea.

Unfortunately, I'm just not one of them. I usually like Pratchett's work, and there are a few comic touches that I liked here, but overall the unbelievably slow pace of the latter half of this story nearly drove me bonkers. It skips over about 10 years in a few chapters, and then camps out at 6 hours 'til doomsday for hundreds of pages. The dialogue of the children was tiresome, and the only character remotely 3-dimensional was the demon Crowley. I began skimming pages before giving up altogether on it a few chapters from the end.

I suppose the closest comparison I could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to Dogma, but filtered through a distinctly British lense. That description doesn't really do the story justice, but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book. The whole premise, and I'm not giving much away here, begins with the accidental \"mis-placement\" of the infant Antichrist during a complex baby-swapping procedure intended to kick off the Apocalypse. It's all down hill from there.  This book is funny, irreverent, and at times surprisingly insightful. While some parts of the book may seem cliched or even kitschy, the book never puts up the pretense of being revolutionary or edgy. The characters, like any melodrama, are intended to be archetypal, so even the relatively predictable changes that occur seem appropriate in the context of the story. The surprises are really in the details, and in that regard the execution is brilliant. To give you an example, the devil Crowly drives a car in which the tape-deck will transform any tape placed in it into a copy of \"Queen's Greatest Hits\" within a very short period of time after one hits the play button. Now I love \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as much as the next guy, but an eternity of nothing but THAT particular album?! That's the kind of devilry that works on many levels."}, {"userName": "J.G.

The book is enjoyable, but may suffer from the fact that it represents its two authors at what seems to be their most basic states.There is no question as to the recognizability of both Gaiman's and Pratchett's respective styles here, but neither seems to add anything to the other. One of Gaiman's weaknesses is surely his general lack of humor. Anything that makes you laugh in his books isn't likely to qualify as a joke. While this could have been remedied by Pratchett's collaboration, his humor tends to be more groan-worthy than profound.It seemed to me that, by collaborating, both authors felt a need to simplify and de-personalize their respective styles, which for Gaiman meant an unfortunate loss of much of his dark charm, and for Pratchett that he was even more watered down than usual.I know a lot of people, especially fantasy fans, love this book, and I will admit that it is romp-y, easily digestible, and certainly doesn't betray the inclinations of either author. Unfortunately, it also doesn't surpass them or create anything new or interesting. The whole is less than the sum of its respective parts. However, certainly worth a read; if only to get a fix of Gaiman while waiting for him to actually finish his next book.UPDATE: After reading Gaiman's Anansi Boys, I have come to find that he can be quite uproariously and side-splittingly funny.

Warning: If you are one of those people who wear a \"What Would Jesus Do?\" bracelet and believe that the purple teletubby really is gay, this is not the book for you. Just put it down and grab something by C.S. Lewis.The story centers around an angel and a demon who have spent thousands of years on earth together, and have quite a good working relationship. Everything is running along smoothly until Crowley (the demon) is charged with delivering the antichrist to his new family. In other words, handing over the Spawn of Hell to a bunch of (satanic) nuns who will switch him out with a human baby who has just been born.

A great story that moves along very nicely, as Good and Evil (as represented by the angel Aziraphale & the demon Crowley) join forces to try & avert the apocalypse. Definitely held my interest. The interplay between these two was what really made the story, liked it when they put their differences aside & just hung out.

Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read. Consider a novel's presence on my Goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement.

Heaven and Hell have basically been in a cold war for well forever it seems. Ever since Lucifer \n\u201cAn Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards.\u201d\n became the bad guy the final show down has been in the works. But now, finally Satan\u2019s son has been born and the prophecies all say that when he is Eleven the end of the world will finally come about. The humor in this is really incredibly fun and I loved Aziraphale, the Angel who wasn\u2019t necessarily all good, and Crowley the demon who really wasn\u2019t that bad of a guy. Even more I enjoyed the friendship between them and how they worked both together and against each other. \n\u201cHell wasn't a major reservoir of evil, any more then Heaven, in Crowley's opinion, was a fountain of goodness; they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game. Where you found the real McCoy, the real grace and the real heart-stopping evil, was right inside the human mind.\u201d\nThis had an extensive cast that included the four horsemen (one was a woman) of the apocalypse, a witch or two, some Satanists (they weren\u2019t really bad people), a gang of kids, a witchhunter and a dog.There are a ton of funny little snippets here and there and I really enjoyed the cut and paste together style that had the reader jumping from group of characters to groups of characters as we go through the countdown to the final days.This is supposed to be a tv series soon and it will be interesting to see how that goes. I think it will be a good time and lets face it at the end of the world you might as well have a good time.Perfect for when you just want a good laugh and some ridiculousness in your life."}, {"userName": "C.G.

(That was exhausting though. Please, lead me back to the children's aisle. That's where I belong.)  I totally enjoyed it though because it's HILARIOUS.  Yeah maybe the story is a bit waffly in places and there are some useless tangents it runs off on, but it is downright funny. Why? Oh, oh keep calm. I'll show you.  First of all, it is SO like the Supernatural TV series.  What can I say? I'm a huge fan. I'm such a huge fan that I picked up this book because I recognised THE DEMON'S NAMES. Come on. That's probably a little on the weird side. I also wanted to read more Neil Gaiman (I'd only read Coraline before now) and start for the first time something by Terry Pratchett. I'm completely sold to both of them.  But I really think that the Supernatural TV series borrowed stuff from this.  Or else the coincidences are pretty dang astounding. For once that doesn't make me angry though. This was first published in 1990, so I know they're not copying. So that's okay.So we have the stars: Crowley and Aziraphale. I love them so much.They're totally Cas and Crowley from Supernatural. Down to AZIRAPHALE WEARS A FREAKING TRENCH COAT. Aziraphale looked down at his new body which was, unfortunately, very much like his old body, although the overcoat was cleaner. (pg. 364)Plus Aziraphale is unfortunately devoid of a lot of pop references and is very serious. And also fantastically awesome. Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a treeful of monkeys on nitrous oxide.Crowley isn't the king of hell though, like in the TV series. He's kind of just...a demon who was told to do a job (plant the antichrist baby in the correct family) and who messed that up and therefore LOST THE ANTICHRIST. I mean, come on! He lost the antichrist. Can we take a moment to just laugh, okay?! The ridiculousness. Also there's plenty of banter like this: \"But it might be written diffferently somewhere else,\" said Crowley. \"Where you can't read it.\"\"In bigger letters,\" said Aziraphale.\"Underlined,\" Crowley added. \"Twice,\" suggested Aziraphale.  And this:  Aziraphale: \"I was going to ask you the same thing -- WATCH OUT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN!\"Crowley: \"It's on the street, it knows the risks it's taking!\" img src=\"http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m77...\" width=\"400\" height=\"209\" alt=\"description\"/> Besides being funny and having epic characters, I also enjoyed the hilarity of the plot and the genius of the twists.  It loosely used facts and lore and turned it into an epic and warped English version of having an apocalypse before dinner. It's not too ridiculous though. Although I thought the antichrist would be older. He's 11. And named Adam.Okay! Okay! Sorry about all the comparisons. BUT I'M KIND OF OBSESSED WITH THE TV SERIES. What I didn't like?Well, it got a bit boring when it dived into Anathema and Newt's story line. I honestly couldn't care less about them. The middle-ish of the book isn't so much about Crowley, so I was disappointed. But it had more Adam and he had an interesting story. I loved his hellhound that turned into a little tiny dog because it's master unknowingly requested it. A hellhound...as a tiny dog. BAH AHAHA. The writing was also thick. It's not YA writing, which is what I'm used to. I'm not saying it was bad, but I am a \"get to the point already\" kind of reader, so it was a struggle to stay motivated at times. It's definitely inspired me to read some Terry Pratchett though and maybe dig out more Neil Gaiman. I love these guys. They have the best senses of humour the world could ask for and this book is genius."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "Not very amusing attempt at biblical humor.

My. God.This was one of the funniest books I have ever read. The writing was phenomenal and I could see myself and others I know in many of the quirky characters.Good and Evil's earthly representatives discover that the time for the Apocalyse has arrived and they're not too happy about it. You see, they've grown to like life on Earth. And besides, Evil (with a capital 'E') itself couldn't possibly do worse things to mankind than what mankind does to itself.And the antichrist's name is Adam, for cryin' out loud! (Not to mention that his trusty sidekick, aptly named \"Dog\", rather likes being a real dog and doesn't want to go back to being a hellhound; he'd miss the smells!)My favorite line (and it was a tough decision, believe me!):\"This is how Newton Pulsifer looked as a man: if he went into a phone booth and changed, he might manage to come out looking like Clark Kent.\" And don't forget the other Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - especially Treading in Dogshit (formerly All Foreigners Especially the French, formerly Things Not Working Properly Even When You've Given Them a Good Thumping, never actually No Alcohol Lager, briefly Embarrassing Personal Problems, formerly known as Skuzz). By the way, he ended up, after an unfortunate accident, calling himself People Covered in Fish.I was a little disappointed with the ending, though. It seemed a little too neat and easy. So that's why it didn't get that fifth star from me.Great book! The friend who suggested Clan of the Cave Bear to me (you know who you are!) has totally redeemed herself with this one."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL":

severely. \"Anyway, if you stopped tellin' people it's all sorted out after they're dead, they might try sorting it all out while they're alive.\u201d Neil Gaiman + Terry Pratchett = PerfectionLet me start this review with saying that if you're not so open minded hardcore religious person. do yourself a favor and don't read this book 'cause you might end up really, really hating it.Now off to the real review.I can positively say that (at least in my opinion) this is one of the best books ever written (okay, maybe I'm being a little subjective).I feel like when reading Gaiman's books, there is always a positive and a negative thing (at least in my case). The positive is: The book you are reading might just be one of the best book you've ever read. And a negative is: That book has to finish, and when it does, you don't have a clue what to do with your life. And I feel that the humor Pratchett brought to the story, just made it that much harder to finish the book and say goodbye to this brilliant story.Like I already said, this book was brilliant. I can easily say that a book never made me laugh as hard as this one did (I physically laughed my ass off multiple times while reading). But apart from that, this book was also very dark (and I didn't realize that until the very end). There are quotes in this book that just make you stop reading and think for a second. I feel like that through humor, they made some really good points about religion.And also, this book had one of the best characters ever created. Crowley: A demon who always wear glasses, drives a Bentley and listens to Queen. I mean, whats not to love?! I also loved chemistry between Crowley and Aziraphale. Actually, Aziraphale was my second favorite character.This was my first Pratchett's book (now I feel ashamed to say that), but it certainly won't be my last. I can already say that Pratchett was as big of a genius as Gaiman is. I don't think that there's anything else to say, except that if you haven't read this book but you like either Gaiman or Pratchett, do yourself a favor and go read it. I can guarantee that you won't regret it."}, {"userName": "E.H.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118723-e-h", "userReview": "So, funny story. I was reading this book (re-reading, really) during a recent training session for my job (a fairly tedious process - the training, that is - which involves sitting in front of a computer for long hours listening to boring presentations about the software). The guy who was sitting next to me was reasonably attractive and rather chatty, and he looked over and said, \"What are you reading?\"\"Good Omens,\" I said, and seeing that he obviously had no idea what it was, I added, \"It's about the end of the world. It's really funny.\"\"Cool,\" he said.A bit later I was busy making myself motion sick by spinning in my chair (because I am totally a grownup) and when I got bored, I asked him, \"So how'd you wind up here?\"\"Oh, [company we work for] recruits heavily from my school.\"\"Where's that?\"\"Brigham Young University.\"I had a sudden revelation re my chances of getting a date burst across the inside of my frontal lobes, but I still needed to come up with something intelligent to say to this. \"I heard the CIA recruits from there a lot.\" (This is my version of intelligent, I guess.)\"Yeah. But you have to travel all over the world for the CIA and I just got married, so I couldn't.\"I nodded like this all totally made sense and went back to my book, which is much funnier and yet somehow less surreal than my day-to-day life."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752259-ken", "userReview": "It is really hard to write good literary satire. Simple fact is that often satire goes too far over to the side of parody. When it crosses that line, it becomes bad mimicry rather than true satire. Think what This Is Spinal Tap would have been like if Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer just did an impression of the guys from Saxon \u2013 it would be funny for five minutes (if you actually knew who Saxon was) but ultimately the joke would get old. Over-parody leads to a stale joke and then you have an author who is just winking at his readers. After all, is Rich Little really that funny?\nGood Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch\n could\u2019ve descended into a really bad parody, especially considering that co-authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett originally intended it as a send-up of Richard Crompton\u2019s William books (ask your friends from the UK). The initial title they had conceived was William the Antichrist. But Gaiman and Pratchett took the joke farther out -- much farther out -- satirizing everything from the Bible to The Omen to modern English society. The cast of characters includes a sect of extremely loquacious nuns secretly in the employ of hell (The Chattering Order of Saint Beryl), Pollution as the replacement for a now retired Pestilence (thanks to the invention of Penicillin), a bibliophile Angel (known as Aziraphale) who is not so sure he wants heaven to win, a Demon who is more concerned with his antique Bentley than stealing souls, the slacker descendents of Matthew Hopkins, Witchfinder, and even Agnes Nutter who lives up to her name. This makes for a concoction that is rife with sharp, pinpointed jokes that still hold up and still retain their bite.Simply put, it is amazing satire. It the equivalent to reading a Monty Python film and comes as close to matching the sheer genius The Life of Brian as one could get in a novel. In an opening sequence, we\u2019re introduced to Crowley, a demon who has come to enjoy his life on earth and is not particularly enthralled with the idea of Armageddon. The only thing that irks him more is having to show up for the daily counting of the deeds with two other demons at a dreary cemetery at midnight. Never mind the traffic getting out of London, the real frustration for Crowley arises when he cannot explain to his fellow hellspawn that blocking all portable phone systems in central London will do more good for Satan than tempting a politician or a priest.\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t tell that to demons like Hastur and Ligur. Fourteenth-century minds, the lot of them. Spending years picking away at one soul. Admittedly it was craftsmanship, but you had to think differently these days. Not big, but wide. With five billion people in the world you couldn\u2019t pick the buggers off one by one any more; you had to spread your effort. But demons like Ligur and Hastur wouldn\u2019t understand. They\u2019d never thought up Welsh-language television for example. Or value-added tax. Or Manchester.\u201dManchester is of course Crowley\u2019s proudest achievement as a demon. Or there is the slight episode where the mighty Kraken rises from the sea once more, directly under a whaling ship. \t\u201cThere is a tiny metal thing above it. The kraken stirs. And ten billion sushi dinners cry out for vengeance.\u201dChapters such as that keep Good Omens chugging along at great pace. What is most obvious is that Pratchett and Gaiman had an absolute hoot writing the book. The interplay is fantastic, a grand piling on of ideas, where ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter who originally conceived of which bits (much like the Pythons). If you could level any criticism at the book it is that the ending is so bloody nice. The writers literally pull the final punch and leave the reader with a very saccharine outcome after pages and pages of skewering most of modern society (from the 17th century onward). You come to this very perfectly resolved, somewhat hopeful ending, feeling as the writers feared appearing a little too cynical. Picture The Empire Strikes Back if Luke just suddenly strikes down Darth Vader rather than losing his hand (and discovering the true identity of his father).This is mostly due to the original concept of William the Antichrist -- or rather the character of Adam. While the character is an interesting parody of Damian from The Omen, he tends to drag the action down, giving the book a YA bent that it doesn\u2019t need. After all, the cast of memorable characters is overloaded as it is and the book is simply much funnier when Adam is not around to slow up the pace. One could argue this was a necessary device, a way to cut the more biting parts of the book in order to have some contrast. But in the end, you can\u2019t help but feel that the character could\u2019ve been reduced to a minor one with the emphasis kept on Crowley and Aziraphale\u2019s attempts to thwart their respective sides during the ensuing Armageddon.It is however somewhat of a nitpick because that flaw is greatly diminished by the overall wit and surgical skewering of all things the Apocalypse in Good Omens. About the only thing funnier is The Left Behind series, but those books are not intentionally humorous."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "I read Good Omens shortly after joining GR but never bothered to write a review for it.
