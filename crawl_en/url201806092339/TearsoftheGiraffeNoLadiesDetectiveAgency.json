Actually I chose the second in the series by mistake. In the end it didn't really make any difference.The book is fairly short and an easy read. The cover is colourful and striking. The style of writing is quite unique. It is simple and straightforward with a gentle feel, almost old fashioned in a way and somehow it reflects the atmosphere of Africa. The book is set in Botswana. I did find the names of the characters initially confusing and had to keep checking as to who was who. The main character is a lady detective and is an intriguing personality. The pace is slow in an unhurried fashion and the crime seems to take a back step in that the book is much more about the characters. Madam Precious Ramotswe is a quiet personality on the surface. She is warm and kind. Her intuitive nature is a great aid in that it helps her solve her cases with little fuss and she misses nothing. The man she is engaged too...Mr J. L B Matekoni is also a kindly and gentle personality. I wasn't blown away by the book but it was often touching. There is an absence of the violence often found in the thrillers/crime/ mystery genre. I liked the main characters and it did hold my interest throughout. I will be reading Book One."}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "I think a lot of the reviews appear to ignore this is a series written as a tea cozy mystery genre type. Genres follow commonly accepted rules of plotting and characterization depending on the type of genre. Every once in awhile critics get excited over a \"genre bending\" book because a book didn't follow the rules. This series is NOT genre bending. What it is is an extremely well written, warm, amusing, tea cozy that lightly touchs on many aspects of African life, VERY lightly. A light touch is at the heart of being a tea cozy mystery and this series does not break any of the conventions of genre writing rules. What sets it apart is the location. The characters are REALLY charming and that is all about the talent of the author. The only quibble I have is the underlying moral tone is a bit louder than it should be even if it's appropriate."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads friend Laura being persistent about getting me to try this series again, I FINALLY read this book. I\u2019d read the first book in the series many years ago and liked it, but didn\u2019t like it enough to read on. I think I\u2019d even tried this one and put it down. I\u2019d really struggled with this author\u2019s writing style. I was encouraged to read the audio edition with Lisette Lacat as narrator, and I\u2019m so glad. I\u2019m also glad that I decided to keep a copy of the paperback edition because it turns out I read this best by simultaneously listening to the audio book while reading the paper edition. A particular pleasure since, as is not always the case with audio books, the text was read almost precisely word for word. Only one word was wrong and contractions were used in the audio and not the paper book, but otherwise they were identical. So I read the Audible edition along with this edition: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7...How very weird at times though. One audiobook part ended when there were just five pages left to a chapter in the paperback. It took me a while but I learned that it was better for me to measure my reading progress using the paperback chapters and to simply stop the audio play when I was at a good point in the paperback. I could get spoiled with the pairing of paper/audio editions. Reading this way would definitely help me read when I have difficulty concentrating, especially when due to neighbors\u2019 noise, but also for when there are other reasons. For this book the audio helped me tremendously with pronunciations and dialect! And I could see the humor via the audio that I missed when I tried to read the paper book by itself. Also, the paper book helped me concentrate on the audio, though I did have to rewind at times, rarely though. Reading the audio and the paper editions at the same time was a real pleasure and like magic for me. And this narrator couldn't be better. She is perfect. I plan to all this series\u2019 books but I will definitely read the audiobooks, preferably with the paper editions too. I can\u2019t afford to buy books but I\u2019ll be looking for a CD player. I can borrow CDs and paper books from the library. I think there might be some audio files too but not many, and right now I have no devices that would work with them.I ended up liking many things about this story. I thoroughly enjoyed the humor. It\u2019s subtle but very amusing and most of it was based on observations of human behavior. Brilliantly done!I loved so many of the characters and the relationships. They were a delight. I appreciated how the various issues and sub-plots were resolved. Very satisfying!I was so engrossed in what was going on that at some point I\u2019d forgotten to be curious about the book\u2019s title. The reader doesn\u2019t learn the meaning of the title until the last two pages of the novel. I liked it!I recently saw the 2016 movie A United Kingdom, twice!, because I loved it so much, and it was fortuitous to then start reading this book. They\u2019re a wonderful pairing.ETA: The \"mysteries\" in these books seem to be the side stories. The main stories in the books are simple stories about interesting people who live in Botswana. The mysteries are not the main attraction for me."}, {"userName": "Dusty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/655483-dusty", "userReview": "I don't seek out Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books, and yet when I run across them in a clearance rack I can't help but pick them up. Tears Of The Giraffe is the second in the series, and it is just as charming, just as gently comic, as the first installment. My only problem with the book -- and it's little more than a nagging feeling in the back of my head -- is that the author's depiction of his protagonist, the exceedingly down-to-earth, compassionate and somewhat bumbling detective Mma Precious Ramotswe, borders on caricature and smells just a bit of cultural superiority (\"Hey, readers, let's laugh at this overweight African lady who spends her days drinking bush tea and solving trifling mysteries.\"). I forgive McCall Smith for this, however, as it's clearly not his intent: His love for the country of Botswana, perhaps for the entire African continent, is genuine and infectious -- I can see why the country's leaders see these books (and the HBO series they inspired) as good advertisements to potential tourists."}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1760824-graham", "userReview": "I absolutely adored the first in Smith\u2019s Botswanan stories, so after a while I set about tackling the sequel. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE is the better book purely because Smith doesn\u2019t have to carefully set up the situation and characters; we already know all about them, so he can just get on with it. The best thing about this novel is all of the different ingredients thrown into the mix. We have another missing child, with a much more complex story this time around; we have a heart-breaking story of a couple of orphans, and we have further character development on the part of Precious\u2019 love interest, Mr Matekoni, as well as her secretary. As a whole the book seems a little deeper, a little more vivid, a little more in touch with the spirit of Africa, and it\u2019s a delightful read."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42315986-hilary", "userReview": "[ Mr J.L.B.

This may be my favorite of them all, or at least in the top three. It's the feeling I get when I read or listen to these books that I love to return to: a feeling of satisfaction, as though all is right with the world (even when all is not right in the present moment). In this series, though, good triumphs over evil, and you pretty much know that going in. And then, at the end, it's the way I feel at the end of a beautiful symphony. Everything comes back to tone. And that's just the way I feel every time I close one of these books. This series has become a place I turn to when I want to feel like everything is right with the world again. It's reliably wonderful. A joy to reread this series, and I'll be picking up the third one this week. Six stars, once again, for the audio performance by Lisette Lecat, and for all of the audiobooks in this series.

I remember it being fun and fresh and quirky, but it didn't grab me and I wasn't desperate to carry on with the series. Having now read \"Tears of the Giraffe\", I am eager to find out what happens next. This is, simply put, an exceptionally good book. Every person in the western, \"civilised\" world should read it and be humbled.This time around, Alexander McCall Smith delivers a simple and heart-warming story, which is concerned far more with the characters and community than with the little mysteries therein. I'll admit that I was counting the pages and wondering when he would get back to the cases (what little there is of them), but not at all because I was bored - if anything, I wanted the novel to be a hundred pages longer. Nevertheless, this tiny book packs a punch - and I, for one, could almost imagine jumping on the next available plane and visiting Botswana, just to experience the people and the environment for myself.The writing style is deceptively simple, but it's easy to read between the lines. The author manages to find a balance where he can introduce you to a different way of life without causing you to feel like an outsider. The setting is both worlds-apart and surprisingly familiar, and the characters come right off the page. There are also some cute moments where things are lost in translation; a little discussion about Dr Freud springs to mind and after all, why shouldn't a little boy love his mother?What stands out the most, and in stark contrast to the majority of western crime and mystery writing, is the all-encompassing sense of hope that Mma Ramotswe brings to the fore. Far from a jaded, cynical, troubled protagonist - this is a large woman with a large heart, who somehow always manages to come across as brave and insightful, where a weaker character might have been painfully naive. She bounds into all sorts of adventure and mischief, taking it all in her stride and never letting the badness rub off on her or wear her down.I am very much looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and will be recommending this book to everyone I know. It strikes me as a wonderful place to start - and I would probably advise people to give the first book a miss, at least until they've really gotten into the series."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james", "userReview": "A delightfully gentle series of books by Alexander McCall Smith - set in and around Botswana's capital city of Gaborone and stories of the 'No.1 Ladies Detective Agency'.McCall Smith has created a lovely world of mainly (very) amateurish sleuthing - which whilst ostensibly the theme which is central to these books, is ultimately almost incidental. The main draw here is the cast of well drawn, well written, very memorable and on the whole very endearing (if occasionally frustrating) characters - Precious Ramostwe, Grace Makutsi, J.L.B. Matekoni et al and the interplay of their lives - the detective work and cases here become increasingly an incidental backdrop.The 'No.1 Ladies Detective Agency' stories and characters certainly have an air of authenticity and believability (although obviously contrived and significantly exaggerated for comic effect) and interestingly McCall Smith did spend some time living and working in Botswana.The first few books in the series are undoubtedly the strongest, funniest, most entertaining and compelling. Whilst later installments are all good - they do feel like somewhat of retread of ideas that McCall has spun out perhaps beyond their natural course. Whilst serious themes are alluded to - feminism, AIDS and domestic violence; there is little here that is particularly thought provoking or challenging - but then that's not the point here. For anyone wanting a series of light, likeable, entertaining, funny, absorbing, well written and compelling amateur detective books - with a difference, then the 'No.1 Ladies Detective Agency' books are a must. Good stories, simple truths - people doing the right thing. Ultimately these stories are all about kindness, forgiveness, restitution and resolution. Which in itself is surely a good enough reason to read at least some of this lovely series of books?"}, {"userName": "Nicola ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2461560-nicola", "userReview": "I liked this one so much more than I liked The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Probably because there was a lot less character introduction and much more actual plot and events. Precious is so very likeable and I think she's highly amusing with some of her thoughts on women, men and the world in general. I love the setting and think it's very unusual and captivating. I really enjoy all the little stories that run through these books and the pearls of wisdom that everyone seems to have on offer.

The main characters, Mma Ramotswe, owner of the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency and her fiance Mr J. L. B.

The mysteries that Mma Ramotswe solves are pretty straightforward to the reader; there are no twists in the solving of the crimes, but this is what is so charming about the book. Life in Mma Ramotswe's world is straightforward and full of moral fiber. Her story of what happens in the day to day in Botswana is so different from life in the west, but has its strengths and I can see how much Mma Ramostwe loves her country.

The first book was far more character-driven, while this one has already established the characters and continues on without skipping any time between books (it practically picks up the day after the first book left off), thus all the weight is put upon plot. And since this book is a mystery novel involving several cases to be solved by Mma Ramotswe, well...I felt that Mma Ramotswe, as a character, is put on the back-burner for this book, and more attention is paid to other character who may or may not warrent it. There's more about JLB Matekoni, Precious' fiance, and two orphans who join the family - warrented; but there's a lot of backstory for Matekoni's maid, whose plan to frame Ramotswe is built up heavily and then deflated before it really jumps. The cases were not as interesting to me in this book - the formula has already been established and there wasn't anything special that was done - Ramotswe, level-headed and fair, uses her intuition and detective-book learning to smooth out misunderstandings/mysteries. There were a few times that I wanted to see her get fired up about something - really bring home the thunder on someone, but although she had plenty of opportunities, she doesn't rise to take anyone's bait. The main mystery in this book was the case of a missing American man/boy whose mother has returned to Africa to try and get closure. Well, the boy wasn't murdered, so no one is really to blame, and the South African tart that is the mother of his son (although she was also screwing around with the \"evil\" guy who \"kind of\" caused his death) (oh, and yes, McCall-Smith's agenda of disliking South Africa/Africans is quite evident here, in case you didn't pick up on it in the first book), is forgiven by the mother who enjoys an afternoon of catching up with her and the grandchild. So.... if you understood anything in that last sentence, pat yourself on the back.I finished this book in a day. But despite the things that I didn't like about it, it was a pleasant read that was vaguely satisfying and not at all taxing. Also, there was a nice cliffhanger at the end of the book, when the grandchild notices that Mma Ramotswe's engagement ring is cubic zirconium."}, {"userName": "Tiara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426502-tiara", "userReview": "2nd book in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. I was trudging my way through Twilight (still only half done with that book after two weeks--a shame) when I decided to shift my focus to this instead. I breezed through this book. The story picks up right where the last one left off and is just as personable and easy to read. Along with a fiance, Precious has picked up an adopted son and daughter. Some may think she went along with that too readily, but it seemed in character for her to me. Firstly, she'd lost her own child and is unable to have anymore, and it's obvious that she wants children. Secondly, from the way she talks about how traditional and familial that the people of Africa are (or used to be as she thinks this younger generation is going down), would it have been in character for her to cause a stink because of the children? I love how much pride the characters have in their country and how life is just a different experience for them. I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first for a couple of reasons. I thought the angle with the maid fizzled before it even got started. There's a bit too much of Mma Ramotswe KNOWING things without any explanation why she might know these things aside from intuition, which can be very strong but not plausible in every hunch. Parts of the book were rambly, and I think this was to give the book a more personable tone. However, it really just makes you want to skip right over it and get to the point at times. Another great book in the series will continue with it."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "This is Smith\u2019s follow up to the The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and is another delight.

The Detective agency grows when Precious takes on her secretary as an assistant detective and gives her a case of her own. Ramotswe\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is visiting a local orphanage where he provides mechanic services for free when, after she learns that he is to be married, the madam in charge badgers him to take home two of her charges.

As is the case in so much detective fiction, it is place that is central to the story, whether the Fort Lauderdale of John McDonald, the San Franciso of Dashiell Hammet, the Los Angeles of Raymond Chandler or the Botswana of A.M.

Being the lovely lady she is, she of course goes along and moves the children into her own home.She also promotes Grace Makutsi, her secretary, to assistant detective. Grace solves a mystery, but is then caught in a moral dilemma about what to do with her findings. Meanwhile, Precious is tracking down what happened to a young American man who disappeared there in Botswana many years ago.

In the first, she's called on to find out the truth about a young man's disappearance and probable death ten years previously, and in the second, her fianc\u00e9 Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (who must surely be one of the sweetest and most decent men in modern fiction) adopts two orphans without consulting Mma Ramotswe first.

I really liked the first one (read my review\u00a0here). Even though the genre mentioned is mystery, this series is not one of those tipsy-turvy thrillers that would have you on the edge of your seat. It's more like one which you cozily enjoy with a cup of tea. No wonder this genre has found its name as a tea cozy mystery. It aptly fits the book of this series.Having known the characters in the first book, this one settles you down with more happening in the personal life of Mma Ramotswe rather than a whole lot of cases to solve. But that is good because we need some action to happen in the life of our favorite detective when so much is happening on the outside.If you happen to have cake and tea (even better bush tea!) around, they would go well this book and even the entire series because the characters would make you hungry and thirsty with their constant rounds of bush tea. I always find myself having atleast one cup of green tea while reading the series! Temptations, ah. Good that green tea is considered healthy. ;)Anyhow, the book is heavy on Mma Ramotswe with a lot happening in her life but as always she manages to work out everything. The book is a tad bit sad with not all coming to a happy end but well that's how life goes, right?Pick this one up for a lazy sunday afternoon.

This seems to be a series you can pick up at any time and slip right over to Botswana and join in all the fun, family and cases of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1827094-kimberly", "userReview": "This story took me deeper into the traditions of Botswana and their many gentle people, and gave some insight into the broader African conflicts - but mostly it was a wonderful story of Mma Ramotswe and her Detective Agency. The result of the cases that Mma Ramotswe takes on very often end up helping others in a very sensible way, and in the midst of her investigations we are also pulled in to her lovely life, where she is engaged to a very kind man who has surprisingly taken in two orphan children. The cases are interesting, the family life is interesting, and the escapades are fun as well \u2013 with a tiny suspicion of possible danger thrown in for some more spice.A very fun fast read."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1196270-amy", "userReview": "While I thought the book was just OK, it has some interesting topics for discussion. Why do Americans always think their way is the best way? And aren't we right most of the time?How is it that everything works out so well for Precious? I find it too implausible. She is able to track down a lost man after 10 years by using just the right blackmail material that she learned from just the right disgruntled student. Seriously? I found her reaction to the adopted children a bit out of character. Not that she wouldn't do the \"right\" thing, but an independent woman would want more of a say in such a monumental decision, right?"}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10684626-lynn", "userReview": "I began this series about 5 years ago (2007 or so) and absolutely love it! McCall Smith was born in Zimbabwe and returned to southern Africa in 1981 to co-found and teach law at the University of Botswana. The characters in this series, set in Botswana, feel genuine to me; their personalities reflective of people I have known from Africa. I finally started the series due to all the people who kept recommending it to me, and I'm glad I did! I've read them all!I loved the addition of the two children and Mma Makutsi! This series just gets better!"}], "description": "THE NO. 1 LADIES\u2019 DETECTIVE AGENCY - Book 2Fans around the world adore the best-selling No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency series and its proprietor, Precious Ramotswe, Botswana\u2019s premier lady detective.
