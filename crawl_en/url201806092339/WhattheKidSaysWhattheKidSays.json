What I found in this short collection is probably the source of some of that humor.This is a collection of conversations and musings that Park has with her young son. Doesn\u2019t sound particularly spectacular on the surface (doesn\u2019t sound boring either, don\u2019t get my wrong). Though, once I read the first one, I couldn\u2019t put the book down. I found myself laughing out loud many times (that\u2019s something I almost NEVER do for any book). I found myself going \u201cawww\u201d in many spots. And on the whole, I was left with a great feeling because this book shows a great relationship between a mother and son."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7719605-holly", "userReview": "I really loved this, it was as funny as it suggested it would be but also very touching, especially when Jessica Park reflects on thoughts of the kid growing up and having to deal with him outgrowing certain toys etc at what seems to be alarming speed (well, at least to a mother) and also, the talk about acceptance.Laughed so hard at the Santa talk - whoops!! Really good short read, especially if you're a parent and can relate and at 77p on amazon.co.uk, you really can't go wrong"}, {"userName": "L.L.

It's short, and the price reflects it, but worth reading a couple of times.
