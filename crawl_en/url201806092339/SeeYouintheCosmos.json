Something original.I don\u2019t know about you, but I haven\u2019t read a thousand books that make space for rockets in their plot, let alone mention them. I\u2019m not what you would call a science geek, but I welcome variety. Alex, however, adores rockets. He\u2019s only eleven years old, yet he already built his own rocket he strongly hopes will make him win the Southwest High-Altitude Rocket Festival or SHARF. Sadly, he has to go alone, because his mother won\u2019t take him and his older brother is mostly absent. I wasn\u2019t too keen on the idea of Alex traveling with strangers, especially adult strangers, but he did it anyway. Kids don\u2019t listen to me. I\u2019m not adamant enough in my speeches, I guess. I was surprised to see him take such reckless decisions, because to me he seemed like an intelligent eleven-year-old boy who understands more than the average eleven-year-old boy would. And I thought it was imbedded in everyone\u2019s minds that strangers should not be trusted so easily. But okay.Though despite the every-parent\u2019s-nightmare situation, I enjoyed most of this novel. I probably would have enjoyed it more had I cared even a little about rockets, but unfortunately I do not. There\u2019s a lovely atmosphere in the story. I may not be one for looking at miniature space ships fly in the air, but I am one for animals, so I loved dear Carl Sagan (not the scientist, ha-ha!).I also thought Alex\u2019s recordings were interesting. Instead of chapters, we have \u2018\u2018recordings.\u2019\u2019 By that I mean Alex is recording himself talking about his love of science and his adventures. He very much likes to record sounds, too \u2013 and not the voice type! For instance, he wishes to record the heartbeat of a man in love. How adorable is that? Quite random, but sweet.Not a perfect book, but Alex is a kid worth meeting with a quest as strange as it is admirable.

And we didn't delve into Seth's vow of silence early on either. But the 'diary' format suited the audiobook perfectly. Each chapter was recorded with background sound and everything.

So it is with this middle-grade book like no other, one that children and adults alike will adore.Science geek Alex Petroski would be the first to point out that his real age may be 11, but his \u201cresponsibility age\u201d would be much, much older. And, readers, you will agree with him. His father died when Alex was 3, his older brother \u2014 24-year-old Ronnie, a college sports star turned sports agent \u2014 has moved West, and Alex\u2019s mother becomes so incapacitated (probably due to severe depression) that it\u2019s Alex who cooks, shops, and cleans. Here\u2019s a scene when Alex adopts a stray, naming the dog after his hero, the late Carl Sagan:Then I took him back to my house and my mom was lying on the sofa watching her shows like she usually does, and I told her I got the groceries but I got a pup also and I\u2019ll take good care of him I promise, I\u2019ll play with him and feed him and give him a bath and all the stuff you\u2019re supposed to say.And she said, You\u2019re in the way! So I got out of the way. My best friend Benji\u2019s mom would freak if he brought home a pup, but my mom, she doesn\u2019t care as long as I make us dinner and don\u2019t bother her when she\u2019s watching her shows. She\u2019s a pretty cool mom.So you see how it is. Brother Ronnie moved to Los Angeles and, while he pays the bills for his mother and little brother, Ronnie hasn\u2019t visited in more than a year; Alex has pretty much been on his own. Alex wants to emulate Dr. Sagan and the Golden Record he launched into space in 1977 in the hopes of announcing our human presence to any alien life. Alex gets a donated iPod, spray-paints it gold, transfers the information from Sagan\u2019s Golden Record onto it and adds additional entries in which he makes observations on the human condition for the aliens\u2019 edification. When Alex decides to make the journey from Rockview, Colorado, to the Southwest High-Altitude Rocket Festival (SHARF) in Albuquerque so as to launch his Golden iPod into space aboard Voyager 3, there\u2019s no adult who\u2019s going to dissuade him. Along the way to Albuquerque (and beyond), Alex fortuitously for him finds himself relying on the kindness of quite a few strangers \u2014 and, fortuitously for us, he captures his adventures in a series of daily recordings along the way. Author Jack Cheng hooked me from the very first transmission chapter with this heart-warming tale of a boy who reaches for the stars and finds more than he ever imagined. Highly, highly, highly recommended.In the interest of full disclosure, I received this book from NetGalley, Penguin Young Readers Group and Dial Books in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "I received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to he author, Jack Cheng, and the publisher, Dial Books, for this opportunity.This follows the journey of 11-year-old space-obsessed Alex Petroski, and his dog Carl Sagan, as they travel to a space camp to launch their home-made rocket. There Alex attempts to emulate his hero, the real-life astronomer Carl Sagan, and launch his golden IPod, containing all his recorded musings about life on Earth, into space.The journey he undertakes proves a far more complicated one than just his geographical travel. Along the way the reader learns more about Alex and the world he inhabits. This understanding is broadened by the meeting of other lost souls, who prove that age and happiness are not synonymous and that love can take many forms.I enjoyed seeing the world through the eyes of one so young. In some instances this reminded me somewhat of To Kill a Mockingbird, where the emphasis was on reading between the gaps of this young understanding. Alex did not always tell all the reader ended up learning from this story.This is dually also what caused my discontent, whilst reading this. I found Alex quite a difficult character to penetrate. I felt such sadness for him and yet, also, found him to be quite annoying. I felt so horrible for feeling this way for one so young and so lost in the world! I could not help but feel too old to properly appreciate his perspective on the world. His constant questioning and running monologue was true to his age but sometimes ended up boring me and, thus, ended in a loss of affinity towards his character.Alex's inner-musings was what made up much of the story, and as I could not enjoy them, I could not enjoy this read. There is a beautiful message buried in here, but this just wasn't the book for me."}, {"userName": "Emer ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer", "userReview": "This was a very sweet story aimed at the middle grade market. The main character Alex is an eleven year old boy (but with a responsibility age of 13!) who is passionate about all things space and rocket related. His hero is the astronomer Carl Sagan after whom he names his pet dog. The inspiration for the format of this book comes from the Voyager Golden Records. These were recordings chosen by Carl Sagan and an expert panel to be representative of life on Earth and sent into space on board the Voyager spacecraft in 1977 as an introduction to human civilisation to any extraterrestrial sapient life forms. In this book, Alex creates his own recordings using a golden iPod with the intention of sending them into space onboard a homemade rocket and each chapter is a transcript of these recordings. Alex is a brilliant main character. He is so full of wise questions and amazing knowledge and yet is still so beautifully innocent and na\u00efve. It is this innocence and na\u00efvety that leads him to take off on the adventure of a lifetime with his trusted canine companion alongside without regard for consequence or safety. This adventure leads him to among other things an amateur rocket launch; it leads him to discovering more about his deceased father, and brings his quiet home life into the spotlight and reveals just how much this young boy has been dealing with at home with a mentally ill mother. The cast of characters Alex meets along the way are also incredibly beautifully written with how we really only see them through the eyes of this special eleven year old boy. This is a story that is tinged with bittersweetness but ultimately is a triumph of Alex's indomitable hope and optimism. He truly is a very special main character who at times can feel wise beyond his years and others, perfectly unmarred by the harshness of life. I am very sure that I would have loved this book as a 10 year old because of how it views the world and in particular the curious behaviour of adults through the eyes of a wonderful young boy. The adult version of me fell head over heels in love with the canine Carl Sagan and I can 100% guarantee that my younger self would have been equally bonkers! The book is also filled with a wonderful sense of humour that would endear itself to any child and indeed any adult who is still a child at heart. A charming story for children three and a half stars rounded up to four *A copy of this book was kindly provided to me by the publisher, Penguin Random House UK: Children's, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38672507-caroline", "userReview": "VIDEO REVIEW HERE FOR Y'ALL - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sKH9... *SIGH* File this one under 'disappointing reads of 2017'. I first heard about this book at a Penguin Teen event I went to in January and thought it sounded super cute so when it came out I picked it up. The story follows our eleven year-old main character who is space obsessed and wants to launch a golden ipod into space (Carl Sagan and Nasa once sent a Golden record). He ends up going on this BIIIGG journey and meeting a bunch of people and 'discovering himself' and stuff but I just didn't particularly enjoy this.So here's a rundown of things I didn't like:- THE FORMATTING EUGH. Okay so the entire book is told in the 'voice recordings' on his ipod so that when he sends it into space the aliens can know about his life. It's a cute concept but reading it is really frustrating and by about the 50 page mark it was driving me crazy. It read like this \"so I said let's go to the shops because then we can get ice cream and Joe said that's not a good idea because it's only an hour before dinner and I said that's no fun do you guys have ice cream on your planet if you don't it's this really cold stuff that comes in all different flavours and my favourite flavour is rainbow which Mikey from school says is for girls but I don't agree.\" It just keeps going like that!! There's no quotation marks to indicate speech and it's just this running commentary from a young character which got really annoying especially because he repeats himself so much. I'm sure a lot of people would find it charming but I did not!- This book used a trope that I hate... the absent family trope! Normally this is only seen in YA books so teens can go out partying and their parents never protest. In this book and 11 year old kid goes on a road trip and his mum doesn't object and his brother (who lives interstate) doesn't call to check how things are going or anything! It really bothered me especially when it turned into a longer trip I was like ??? why aren't people concerned about you? The family thing does kind of get explained near the end but it was still not great in my opinion.- Also all the adults he met on his trip were completely cool with the fact that an UNESCORTED CHILD was wandering around. No one called the police or anything! People even helped him. I WAS SO CONFUSED! Like yeah he's mature for his age but HE IS STILL ONLY 11!!- Mental illness (specifically schizophrenia) is introduced to the story pretty late and I felt like it was kind of just thrown in there randomly as an excuse for a character being absent in the story which I didn't like. I don't think it was handled particularly well but others might not agree so I don't know.- The supporting characters were all pretty meh. I found them to be a little flat. I also found it to be SUPER WEIRD that these adults dropped their lives to help some random child on his quest. Like... isn't that kind of weird? Shouldn't you be more concerned about why he isn't with his family? Am I the only one that thinks this haha?- The dog that is on the cover is missing for half of the story so THIS BOOK IS FALSE ADVERTISING!- Finally I think Alex (the child main character) is written as WAY older than 11. There were some moments where he would say annoyingly profound things and adults would be all 'wow ur so smrt' but I'm over here like no child would ever say that so I don't know it just felt very obvious that this was an adult trying to write as a child ya feel?As a positive though I liked that the story was about space and that the main character was so passionate about it. I enjoy characters who love being educated. Despite all my complaints about this, I was still compelled enough by the story to keep reading! I wanted to know how things would wrap-up. Although I didn't enjoy this book, a lot of people probably would so if you're interested then definitely check it out."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9373633-melody", "userReview": "This was a cute book, although some of the events were a little unbelievable.

What a beautiful and heartbreaking story. I listened to this one as an audiobook which I think was a fantastic decision considering this story is told through audio recordings that our young protagonist Alex is creating on his iPod so that he can send it into space for aliens to find and learn more about planet Earth. I didn't read the synopsis before starting this one so I was unaware of the format, but it just worked so perfectly as an audiobook. There were multiple voice actors as well as sound effects which made these recordings feel super realistic and believable. While this book started out quite light, it quickly started to turn into something more complicated and heartbreaking. We start to learn more about Alex's home life and how it may not be what it seems. This is very much an adventure story from the perspective of a young boy, but with a contemporary feel.

There are a lot of things that happen in this book, but they fit together so well. From Alex going to New Mexico for the rocket launch to meeting Terra to going to LA to find his brother to going back home and finding his mom is missing.

Denger cerita kamu, masih 11 taun tapi udah ditinggal ayah, ditinggal kakak kerja di luar kota mana kakak kamu cuek bat ih pengen noyor deh kadang, sendirian ngurus ibu yang punya gangguan kejiwaan, hati Tante langsung remek. Hancur lebur berdebu-debu.Tapi kamu bercerita seakan itu biasa aja. Lempeng banget. Polos banget. Lugu banget. Inosen banget. It's not a big deal. I am eleven but my responsibilty age is 13. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AGE IS MORE THAN 13, SWEETHEART!!! Kamu menanggung tanggung jawab orang dewasa padahal kamu masih anak-anak. Tapi kamu biasa aja. Karena itu kehidupan yang kamu tahu sejak kamu kecil. Kamu ga seharusnya menanggung beban sebesar itu. Kamu harusnya jadi anak-anak yang pinter nan manis aja. Gimana hati tante ngga tercabik-cabik denger kamu cerita, Aleeeeexxx~~But, Alex, besides everything, you are still kids. Punya mimpi luar biasa yang kadang buat kami orang dewasa cenderung halu, berusaha sekuat tenaga dengan optimisme dan keyakinan pasti akan berhasil yang mana kami orang dewasa udah ga banyak yang punya. Lebih-lebih lagi kamu anak pinter! Kamu tau Star Wars (you know what? I always give more credit to people who loves Star Wars!), kamu tau banyak astonomy jokes yang banyak orang ga paham, kamu tau gimana harus ngurus ibu kamu dan Carl Sagan sekaligus, dan imajinasi kamu luar biasa sekali. Segalanya, ditambah kepolosan dan keluguan khas anak-anak kamu, bikin tante pengen adopsi kamu, bahkan sejak bab pertama buku ini. I love you soooooooooo much, Alex Petroski.My dear Alex,Mengikuti rekaman kamu, gimana kamu berusaha nyari kebenaran, bagimana kebenaran kemudian menghantam kamu karena ternyata tidak seindah harapan, gimana kamu menghadapi kebenaran itu dengan sikap sepolos, selugu, dan sepintar biasanya, semuanya bikin tante baca buku ini sambil ngusap-ngusap mata (karena nangis haru) dan perut sambil sesekali bilang 'aamiin'. Tante emang seimajinatif kamu kadang-kadang.Pada akhirnya, Alex, Zed bener. Tante rasa kamu udah dapetin semua yang mau kamu rekam di iPod kamu. One day, if your iPod is going to space, the Others, the Aliens, will hear so many things from your recordings.

Normally I prefer Nonfiction over Fiction with an exception when it is science based or inspired. And this book is my first YA kind, at first the cover impressed me and after reading the description, i felt confident enough to try it and I'm glad i did it. It's very different from the conventional varieties of it. I could feel some pretty inspirations as well as pretty much enthusiasm from Carl Sagan, Antoine de saint Exupery, Elon Musk and many oblivious people.The story went real nice that i felt confident enough about the well-being of the characters right from the beginning even though some odds are thrown by the author for the suspense. The background of the characters and events are so rich in experience and provided so much easiness in reading.However I felt the experience was richer in the first half of the book. The kid, Alex Petrovski \"recording the events in his ipod\" style narration is very very nice to read and considerably affected by the kid's perspective of Innocent wisdom. The philosophical - inferential part deserves much appreciation referring the contexts of science as a sheer source of spirituality. Not much science in the plot, only the philosophical understandings from sentient perspective. So people with diverse interests can find it comfortable to read especially people who don't give a thing about science.Few of my favorite lines,\"Do you think there are intelligent beings out there in the cosmos who don\u2019t have sadness?\"\"I looked out the window again and we were even higher, and I couldn\u2019t tell where the roads and buildings were anymore and it was just like my hero said, that from a certain height you can\u2019t even tell there\u2019s intelligent life on our own planet. So if you guys come to Earth, make sure you look closely enough.\" Overall it's the kind of book which you can gift to your middle grade kids and shall also be read by yourselves for pretty much soothing and relaxing break time read presuming you've already come through a lot of science stuffs; If not, it could be revelational for you as well. The book's available from February 27, 2017. The Author Jack Cheng is most likely to become my second favorite Cheng after Ronnie Cheing and of course i left the 'i' but I feel more or less the same. He has experiences working in advertisement marketing firms and nothing much about books but I do expect a lot from the author in the upcoming adventures. And a HUGE thanks to Netgalley and Penguin Random House Children's Publications for the opportunity."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089617-lucy", "userReview": "Alex Petroski loves space and rockets. All he wants is to launch his golden iPod into space the way Carl Sagan launched his Golden Record on the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. From Colorado to New Mexico, Las Vegas to L.A., Alex records a journey on his iPod to show other lifeforms what life on earth, his earth, is like. As soon as I heard about this book, I was intrigued. I loved the concept of a middle-grade novel introducing child readers to the wonders of the universe, and the idea of life beyond Earth. Unfortunately, while Cheng does do an excellent job of instilling that sense of awe in his readers, I was disappointed by the little details of Alex\u2019s story.See You in the Cosmos wasn\u2019t badly written, but as someone who works with children of all ages Alex\u2019s voice didn\u2019t feel authentic to me for several reasons. Firstly, Alex seemed much, much younger than eleven. Secondly, he didn\u2019t even sound like a real child - instead, he sounded like an adult attempting to write from the perspective of a child. I think adults who read kidlit will enjoy reading Alex\u2019s endless monologue, but I doubt many child readers will be able to identify with him.Cheng\u2019s portrayal of a child suffering from neglect also didn\u2019t ring true. Neglected children often take on the role of caretaker for their parents, and feel compelled to protect them by lying about the lack of care they receive at home. But although Alex acts as his mother\u2019s caretaker, he is seemingly oblivious of the fact that his home situation isn\u2019t normal, and immediately reveals the extent of his mother\u2019s abuse to all the adults he meets. To me, this came across as a very simplistic and misinformed portrayal of neglect. I\u2019m also tired of the abusive-character-is-secretly-mentally-ill trope. It\u2019s overused and usually distasteful.Nevertheless, a few things kept me reading See You in the Cosmos. Alex\u2019s enthusiasm for science was wonderful, as was his obsession with the late great Carl Sagan. I also liked that the book was written in the style of voice recordings - and not just any voice recording, but a recording intended to be listened to be alien life forms.Ultimately, I don\u2019t recommend See You in the Cosmos, but I liked many of the ideas behind this book and I\u2019m open to reading more from Cheng in the future.Many thanks to Puffin Books for providing a copy of See You in the Cosmos. The opinions expressed in this review are my own. See You in the Cosmos will be released on February 28th in the U.S. and March 2nd in the U.K.Publisher: Puffin BooksRating: 2 stars | \u2605\u2605\u2730\u2730\u2730Review cross-posted to Paperback'd Reviews"}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339892-brina", "userReview": "Auf \"Hallo Leben, h\u00f6rst du mich?\" bin ich gesto\u00dfen, weil das Buch laut Verlag besonders Leser von John Green ansprechen soll. Da ich ein gro\u00dfer Fan von John Green bin, hatte ich deshalb enorm hohe Erwartungen an die Geschichte und muss sagen, dass ich letztendlich doch entt\u00e4uscht wurde. Zwar ist die Geschichte an sich nicht schlecht, mir allerdings viel zu einfach gehalten. Laut Verlag ist das Buch f\u00fcr Leser ab 12 Jahren geeignet, hier hatte ich jedoch vermehrt das Gef\u00fchl, als w\u00e4re es eher ein Kinder- statt ein Jugendbuch, denn der Autor besitzt einen sehr einfach gehaltenen Schreibstil, der doch insgesamt sehr anspruchslos ist. Die Geschichte liest sich zwar an sich leicht und fl\u00fcssig, aber dennoch habe ich mir hier auch aufgrund der Thematik mehr Anspruch gew\u00fcnscht.Die Geschichte ist dabei schnell erz\u00e4hlt: Der 11-j\u00e4hrige Alex ist oftmals sehr allein, da seine Mutter krank ist und sich nicht um ihn k\u00fcmmern kann. Dabei kommt ihm die Idee, dass er seinen iPod ins Weltall schie\u00dfen m\u00f6chte, um Aliens die Erde zu erkl\u00e4ren. Zusammen mit seinem Hund Carl begibt er sich auf eine Reise, um an einer Convention teilzunehmen, bei denen Menschen zusammentreffen, die ebenfalls gro\u00dfes Interesse an dem Weltall haben. Dass er dabei auf die verschiedensten Menschen trifft und die ein oder andere Freundschaft schlie\u00dft, bleibt dabei auch nicht aus.An sich ist die Grundidee des Autors nicht schlecht, allerdings konnte mich die Umsetzung nur wenig begeistern, da mir oftmals der Anspruch und die Tiefe gefehlt hat, die das Buch bitter n\u00f6tig gehabt h\u00e4tte. Alex wirkt mit seinen elf Jahren oftmals sehr unreif und ich hatte stellenweise das Gef\u00fchl, als w\u00e4re er deutlich j\u00fcnger, was die Geschichte f\u00fcr mich unglaubw\u00fcrdig machte. Selbiges gilt leider auch f\u00fcr alle anderen Figuren, die f\u00fcr mich bis zum Schluss unnahbar blieben. Das Cover ist dagegen wundersch\u00f6n und hat mich direkt angesprochen, sodass ich neugierig wurde und mehr erfahren wollte. Gleiches gilt auch f\u00fcr die Kurzbeschreibung, die sehr gelungen ist und aus der man das Beste herausgeholt hat. Sehr schade, dass das Buch letztendlich nicht mithalten konnte.Kurz gesagt: \"Hallo Leben, h\u00f6rst du mich?\" h\u00e4tte so gut sein k\u00f6nnen, allerdings hat mir der oftmals viel zu anspruchslose Schreibstil und die unnahbar, stellenweise unreifen Figuren, die Geschichte kaputt gemacht, sodass ich leider nicht begeistert bin und somit auch keine Leseempfehlung aussprechen kann."}, {"userName": "Lara (Bookish_turtle)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64318901-lara-bookish-turtle", "userReview": "Woah! Just... woah! What an incredie book! I really want everybody to read this mesmerising story!I picked it up when I saw it was nominated for the Goodreads Choice Awards this year, and I am so glad that I did.This book is told in a series of recordings 11-year-old Alex has made on his iPod, which he plans to send into outer space on a rocket he's building. He's making the recordings so that the aliens can get an idea of what it's like being a human on Earth. Normally I immensely dislike unusual formats, and I was skeptical when I saw it was a series of recording transcripts, but this was absolutely perfect!Alex is such a brilliant protagonist! He has a huge personality, a dog called Carl Sagan, and a love of all things to do with rockets and outer space. And even though he's only eleven, he's at least thirteen in responsibility years!Seeing the events through his eyes was fantastic! He is innocent in that he doesn't understand some of what's going on around him, but not in the sense that he's clueless. A lot of the time it's because people won't tell him anything rather than the fact that he can't understand. It was enlightening, fresh and fantastic to read from the perspective of a younger child.His story is also great. He has his share of struggles, but he always pulls through. The story was so heartfelt, and Alex is always so brave, even when everything around him is crumbling.The entire cast of characters was also perfect! Zed was awesome. I don't even know what to say about him. He was just awesome. And Terra was also brilliant, I loved seeing her character unfold as the story progressed.Be warned though, it is quite sad in many places. But it was a brilliant journey and I absolutely loved this book! It was funny, cute, sad, real, and just all-round incredible! Definitely recommend!

Let's be honest: Middle-grade fiction is REALLY GOOD. This book was exceptional. As in, really really really exceptional. In the best way. Ever. Because it was about an 11-year-old, I was kinda like, \"This should be interesting in an uninteresting way.\" Idek why I got it from the library. Maybe the title convinced me? I do like the title. ANYWAYS. I was shocked at how much I loved this book! I was completely taken unaware and just out of nowhere I was like SO EMOTIONAL at the end. I didn't want it to end. Ever.

For me, it's pretty difficult to jumble a short review on this beautifully and innocently written novel. Most of the time I laughed, smiled and got intrigued even when no one was around me but still I felt so much around this cute little kid. It made my day, although as now the book is completed I am very much feeling lonely and missing his all the recordings. I wish that I could have a little brother like him. An eleven-year-old boy who works as thirteen years older in maturity. He is on the mission to Stars and Space. Also, he thinks that there is somewhere life on other planets and he wants to do all the recordings in his Golden iPod of the different sound and conversation, a man in the love, animal voices, fights and every possible thing on the earth. And he wants to send it into Space. His idol and Hero Carl Sagan made his interest in the field of Space and astronomy and that is how he named his dog Carl Sagon. His mom always have their quiet days and mostly she is sleeping and not doing any homely work but goes on the walk also his dad died when Alex was only three, his elder brother Ronnie lives away from home and works as a sports agent.Alex decides to go to rocket festival in New Mexico with his dog Carl Sagan as he wants to send all the recording into space. He meets so many people on the journey to the rocket festival(S.H.A.F.T) i.e South-West High Altitude Rocket Festival, Zed and Steve and that\u2019s when the tragedies and series of events take place which makes everything so different for him. He meets his half-sister terra and their bonding starts growing.Also, he made so many friends at rocket festivals and everyone at the festival cannot believe that he came all the way by himself and all alone.Unfortunately, his rocket doesn\u2019t do well at the festival but he doesn\u2019t lose his hope and decide to return next year with Voyage 3 or maybe 4. Carl Sagan gets lost in the LA, and that\u2019s when everything changes as he meets his half-sister Terra and they try to find his dog together but gets failed every time after they go back to the home he finds his mum is suffering from schizophrenia but sooner everything gets on the right track. His relations with his elder brother becomes stronger and he always had terra by his side.See you in the cosmos is more about the importance of relations, there bonding and it will affect the importance of people around your life. Few things are not like real life situation but still, you can learn a lot from the Story of Alex, his dog Carl Sagan.I will give 5*****.I would recommend this to everyone, at least read it once in the lifetime."}, {"userName": "C\u00e9lia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1152675-c-lia", "userReview": "Desde a primeira p\u00e1gina de Vemo-nos no Cosmos, percebemos que Alex, de 11 anos, \u00e9 uma crian\u00e7a especial. Os cap\u00edtulos deste livro s\u00e3o transcri\u00e7\u00f5es das grava\u00e7\u00f5es que Alex est\u00e1 a acumular no seu iPod dourado, objeto que pretende enviar para o espa\u00e7o quando o foguet\u00e3o que est\u00e1 a construir l\u00e1 chegar. Alex tem uma admira\u00e7\u00e3o enorme por Carl Sagan (nome que deu, ali\u00e1s, ao seu c\u00e3o), e pretende, com esta ideia, emular os famosos Discos Dourados que Carl Sagan incluiu nas miss\u00f5es Voyager, em 1977.\u00c0 medida que o livro vai avan\u00e7ando, \u00e9 dif\u00edcil n\u00e3o sentir uma enorme empatia pela ingenuidade de Alex face \u00e0s vicissitudes do dia-a-dia e \u00e0 sua vida familiar, mesmo que esta esteja longe de ser a ideal. Alex tem o cond\u00e3o de ver a bondade nas pessoas, parecendo muitas vezes muito mais adulto do que a sua idade deixaria adivinhar (tem 11 anos, mas a responsabilidade de um mi\u00fado de 13, como sublinha ami\u00fade). Ali\u00e1s, penso que o maior desafio para o autor ter\u00e1 sido precisamente encontrar um equil\u00edbrio entre a distinta intelig\u00eancia de Alex e as atitudes pr\u00f3prias de qualquer mi\u00fado de 11 anos, fazendo-o parecer real. Quanto a mim, foi bastante bem conseguido. Para al\u00e9m disso, a forma como Jack Cheng consegue fazer com que o leitor perceba o que se passa no \u201cmundo dos adultos\u201d atrav\u00e9s da voz de Alex, sem que o pr\u00f3prio tenha no\u00e7\u00e3o do que o rodeia, \u00e9 um dos pontos altos do livro.N\u00e3o gostei tanto de algumas op\u00e7\u00f5es do enredo. A viagem ao concurso de foguet\u00f5es d\u00e1 o pontap\u00e9 de sa\u00edda \u00e0s aventuras de Alex e \u00e9 muito interessante, mas acaba depressa. As viagens que se seguem pareceram-me um pouco aleat\u00f3rias e tive alguma dificuldade em discernir o prop\u00f3sito de alguns desenvolvimentos. A parte final do livro acaba por deixar algumas pontas soltas relativamente ao final \u2013 um risco que me pareceu assumido pelo autor quando escolheu narrar esta hist\u00f3ria atrav\u00e9s das grava\u00e7\u00f5es de Alex. Esta particularidade apenas d\u00e1 ao leitor acesso aos pensamentos da crian\u00e7a e, naturalmente, o fim das grava\u00e7\u00f5es implica o final da hist\u00f3ria.Vemo-nos no Cosmos acabou por ser uma leitura que me aqueceu o cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Fico contente por ter escolhido l\u00ea-lo nesta altura do ano, quando eventualmente \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil acreditar na bondade do ser humano e quando a import\u00e2ncia da fam\u00edlia \u2013 um tema fulcral do livro \u2013 mais se faz sentir."}], "description": "11-year-old Alex Petroski loves space and rockets, his mom, his brother, and his dog Carl Sagan\u2014named for his hero, the real-life astronomer.
