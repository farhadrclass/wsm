Vibrant colors. Lavish Grilles. Two-tone styling. Gold-plated emblems. Fins \u2013 Fins \u2013 and more Fins. \u201cCars of the Fantastic \u201850s\u201d is an eye-candy cruise down nostalgia\u2019s highway. I could almost feel the wind in my hair and hear the \u2018American Graffiti\u2019 soundtrack playing in the background. In chronological order, every car - whether the lesser known Hudson Hawk or the luxuriously popular Cadillac Eldorado - was photographed inside and out by Dan Lyons with generous permission from private owners across the United States. And each photo spread includes a brief historical overview of that particular car\u2019s inception and engine statistics, along with its visionary features, perks, and quirks. Additionally, interesting culture trends, fascinating side notes, and original advertising promotions are also included. Truly, a fantastic book for classic car lovers, history buffs, photography fans, and those who simply wish to reminisce a bygone car-art-culture era."}], "description": "It was a time when Americans who has grown up in the Great Depression and has won World War II dreamed big dreams.
