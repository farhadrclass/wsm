When he writes about literature, his words flow quickly through the pages. But when he attempts to use them support to his ill-defined political views, the comparisons become awkward and nonsensical and his criticism of Critical Theory fails for a lack of critical thinking.Perhaps part of the problem with his analysis is in the odd and changing bag of beliefs that comprise the two political extremes of \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" (e.g., the way that gun rights and fundamental Christianity currently coexist in many minds.) He never defines in any comprehensible way exactly what he means by liberalism and conservatism. He certainly doesn't like whatever the thing is that he calls liberalism (\"Lying is the centerpiece of both the satanic and the leftist projects...\", p. 40) He hints that liberalism is totalitarianism, and then spends a hundred pages fighting that straw man, but he never addresses the disturbing trend to authoritarianism which has become, in the last few decades, much more a component of so-called \"conservative\" thought. In fact, his pulsing hatred for \"Critical Theory\" seems more typical for a world-view of authoritarianism and totalitarianism. On page 90 he asks \"Why not question authority? Why not overturn your moral code? Why not do it if it feels good?\" and then immediately relies on a page-long exposition on Goethe's Faust to answer this. I don't get the connection.He says \"Critical Theory, applied to the law, is little more than mob rule and anarchy; like everything else it touches, it is the negation of what it purports to examine,\" and then then in the next paragraph, cites that as the reason that \"Byron chose to perish, quixotically, fighting the Ottoman Turks in Greece\" (which ignores both the real cause of Byron's death, inept medical care while recovering from a fever as well as the absurdity of that comparison)He enumerates Wagner's heroines and invokes a Beethoven opera in a single paragraph (p.87) and then uses that (it's not clear how) as a weapon to attack feminism in any form. If he were only condemning the excesses of modern \"social justice warriors,\" perhaps we could take him more seriously, but when he talks about anything short of Leave It to Beaver, with the mom who stays at home and wears pearls as \"if women could be convinced to fear and hate men, to see them as unnecessary for their happiness or survival...\" then his lack of nuance becomes apparent.I would be more kindly disposed to this book if I didn't have a sinking suspicion that his copious references to literature and film were calculated more to impress the reader into submission than to win him over with reasoned arguments. After reading a little over half-way through, I reasoned that it didn't matter and I put the book down, without argument."}, {"userName": "Vagabond of Letters", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7531999-vagabond-of-letters", "userReview": "Pick up some MacDonald ('The Culture of Critique') and Roger Scruton ('Fools, Frauds, and Firebrands') instead, and pick up some primary sources like Adorno and Horkheimer ('Authoritarian Personality', devastatingly critiqued by MacDonald), Marcuse ('The One-dimensional Man', which actually has some good insights), and Gramsci to go with it. This book is a work of art criticism with no relevance to the discussion of the philosophy of the Frankfurt School of Social Research or cultural Marxism whatsoever. This book is about Faust, music, and the biblical book of Genesis, and rambles forever without making a non-art related point.The author is okay when he talks about the sexual revolt if you can get past the excurses in to art criticism, but there are far better books on that: the two Devlins (F Roger and Lord), Levin, Benatar, Domestic Tranquility, and even Gabrielle Kuby (to be read with discernment because she's a dysgenist).I don't know art criticism and thoroughly despise nonliterary art in general (and can't stand to read even literary criticism), so I can't speak to that, but, as a trained theologian (who never uses the knowledge, alas) the author is dead wrong on theology many times over, and is invariably off the mark when he attempts to interpret the Bible.The author believes that 'art is God's only medium of truth' and is an ardent proponent of libertarian free will, stating 'there is only free will, no predestination'.One star for effort and for the author's view of cultural Marxism as satanic."}, {"userName": "Patrice", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2348745-patrice", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book!

But it generally fails at explanation and analysis, instead being mostly a rambling diatribe preaching to the converted.The core of Walsh\u2019s book is an attack upon the Frankfurt School and its \u201cCritical Theory.\u201d The Frankfurt School was a group of Marxist German scholars, many from Goethe University\u2019s Institute For Social Research in Frankfurt, who fled to the US before and after World War II, and then proceeded to repay this country\u2019s generosity by deliberately destroying its culture. These men included Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse. They also include, in Walsh\u2019s telling, indirectly, men like the Communist Antonio Gramsci (famous for calling for a \u201clong march through the institutions,\u201d though he did not use those exact words, to combat bourgeois \u201ccultural hegemony\u201d) and Georg Luk\u00e1cs, the Hungarian Communist (not to be confused with the writer John Luk\u00e1cs). The key principal of the Frankfurt School was that the existing culture of the West must be destroyed and replaced, because it is irrational and oppressive, originating in and containing nothing good.Walsh\u2019s premise is that the philosophy collectively promulgated by these men, Critical Theory, was a departure from earlier American liberalism, and a pernicious departure, that has since infected all America with its poison. This infection was accomplished through the adoption and application of the Frankfurt School\u2019s social theories by legions of American-born radicals embedded throughout the key institutions of the West. To Walsh, Critical Theory is merely \u201ccultural Marxism.\u201d And, like economic Marxism, its goal is the destruction of the current society and its replacement by something new, better, and totally different. But instead of the workers being the driving engine, the educated classes would be. \u201cThey had been let down by the grubby, unwashed workers of the world, who largely rejected the great gift they had been offered; now they would approach their equals in the intelligentsia, a far more receptive and persuadable audience.\u201dAmong other core ideas of the Frankfurt School much in evidence today, for example in the frenzied demands for political correctness on campus and in the workplace, and in reactions to Donald Trump, is Marcuse\u2019s \u201crepressive tolerance\u201d\u2014the idea that real tolerance consists of intolerance of incorrect views. Or, as Wikipedia summarizes the idea, \u201cRevolutionary minorities hold the truth and the majority has to be liberated from error by being re-educated in the truth by this minority. The revolutionary minority are entitled to suppress rival and harmful opinions.\u201d But Marcuse\u2019s idea is only one of many dubious gifts bestowed on modern America by the Frankfurt School\u2014nearly any organized modern attack on American traditions is at least in part a result of the machinations of the Frankfurt School and its acolytes.While the degree and emphasis of Critical Theory was new in America, and its impact heightened by other cultural changes, the idea that the existing culture must continuously justify itself to reason and be replaced if rationally determined to be deficient, is as old as America, as seen in the debates between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. Attempts to undermine and destroy a society\u2019s culture are nothing new in the post-Enlightenment world, though the Frankfurt School has been uniquely successful in having their corrosive ideas adopted through internal corruption rather than imposed by external force or actual revolution. True, what distinguishes adherents of the Frankfurt School is their nihilism, in that they are less interested in what the new society will be than in destroying the old. This is well covered by Walsh, but he does not tie his discussion to longer-term currents of American political thought, which would have made his analysis stronger.But linear discussion about the Frankfurt School is actually a small part of the book, and not particularly well developed. My summary above is pieced together. The rest of the book is a rambling series of asides relating political points to classical music, H.P. Lovecraft, Milton, movies from Chinatown to \u201cThe Wild One,\u201d and numerous operas (the name of the book is from a Schubert opera). Many of these asides are mildly interesting, and what Walsh is trying to do is, through an artistic lens, tie the evils of Critical Theory to its opposition to the traditional \u201cheroic narrative\u201d of the West. However, the net result feels like a fairly confused mishmash\u2014neither political analysis nor clear social commentary. There is certainly no clear exposition and refutation of the Frankfurt School, which is why I read the book to begin with. And, while most of the book is heavily pessimistic, oddly, Walsh concludes his book on an optimistic note. \u201cNo political victory is ever permanent,\u201d and Walsh apparently believes that by returning to the heroic narrative and the explication of virtues, American conservatives can ultimately defeat the poison of Critical Theory. He doesn\u2019t really say how, or develop this throwaway optimism, though. It\u2019s just a jarring conclusion to an ambitious, but ultimately largely incoherent, book."}, {"userName": "Jason Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076604-jason-williams", "userReview": "Never heard of this guy until a couple days ago, suddenly I almost half done with this ridiculous book. Firstly, all I ever learned from Critical Theory was how to analyze ideology, to understand why ideology matters within a totality of base and superstructure. Like my earlier forays into cultural anthropology, Theory made the foreign feel more common and made my boring history seem more interesting. In other words, Theory celebrates-by-studying We Humans and encourages us to take agency for ourselves. Never did I associate this with \"political correctness,\" and I still don't get the association.Now, I'm glad Walsh found a way to combine his degree in music from the 1970s with the suddenly popular anti-PC movement in its recent manifestations: Pat Buchanan, Anders Breivik, Kevin MacDonald's campaign against \"white genocide,\" InfoWars, Breitbart and Donald Trump. But The_Devil's_Pleasure_Palace routinely straddles the line between synthesis and bullshit, making bizarre and baseless connections from one text and context to another. Walsh is a generalist, and the context of any given work that he analyzes means nothing to him. Everything seems to remind him of a movie he's seen, and then suddenly you're reading a few paragraph's from an old college paper that he copied/pasted into this new book, then you're learning more about Milton and Faust and Wagner than you ever wanted, and then suddenly he sneaks in a random jab at Barack Obama or the Democratic Party. Walsh covers so many different fields, turning all the world into a text, turning all history into etymology and logomachy, it's like The Fall just happened yesterday. I have no doubt that, with any given field that Walsh delves into, there are numerous scholars on said subject (secular or theological) who would seriously beg to differ with his interpretation of the issue. The most obvious component of Walsh's bullshitting is in the text's form, not it's content. Through all of his intellectual stunts and maneuvers (or, again, bullshitting), Walsh is attempting to demonize and discredit the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory all the while deploying the very analytical tools granted us by the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory. His whole argument and mode of analysis hinges on hegemony, semiotics, form-and-content stuff. He might dispute a thing or two that the Theorists say on the surface, but his approach to literature and music (and his view of world history as a singular epic) is right out of the Theorists' playbook. (The one exception is his preference for Jung, a mystic Lamarckian, over Freud.) In that regard, I find the book entertaining, despite the fear and disgust I feel knowing the audience that he's targeting. Nor can Walsh make up his mind about his stance on science/reason vs. beliefs/romanticism. When it suits him, he eschews science's presumptuous epistemic claims in preference for his own convictions. But then suddenly the Frankfurt School is a bunch of Romantic monster-makers out to destroy his precious Greco-Roman West.Also, Walsh pretends to be Catholic. But he's clearly an atheist, or perhaps agnostic. I personally don't care one way or the other. But he's openly trying to side with the angels here as Catholic, while his entire analysis of the \"ur-Narrative\" is not from the position of a believer at all. I'm sure Walsh believes in good vs evil, but I have little doubt that he also sees this as an essentially earthly and man-made struggle with no actual supernatural qualities or ramifications. In other words, Walsh clearly identifies these as social constructs, and he clearly is trying to convince less educated and more devout readers of evils that don't actually exist. Essentially, this book provides a rational structure through which a lot of today's fake news would make sense. Like, if I read this book and then heard that Hillary was running a sex trafficking ring out of a pizza joint, I might actually believe that shit.But mind you, it is all, in fact, shit. The only reason I'm continuing with the book is because I truly want to understand why nearly 50% of Americans were scared enough to vote for Trump.The only thing missing from Walsh's Metanalysis of The World at this point is Star Wars references. But I'm only half done with the book. I've got a couple hundred pages of digitally reproduced intellectual bricolage, melange, pastiche on my hands! Like it or not, Walsh, you're wearing postmodernism on your sleeve!"}, {"userName": "Jack Durish", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133325-jack-durish", "userReview": "Do you enjoy living in The Devil's Pleasure Palace?Is there any question that we're living in The Devil's Pleasure Palace? Political correctness runs amok on American campuses as students demand freedom from offense and free everything else. Sex loses all its pleasure as it becomes easier to obtain. The practice of abortion destroys human life in numbers that would make a Nazi blush. Pseudo-science is used to control behavior. Atheists have gained the legal right to demand tolerance of their belief system only. The purveyors of progressive leftism, like Rousseau, Marx, Brecht, Sartre, and Lillian Hellman, beasts in their private lives who profess to love humanity most but despise people, have come to dominate American philosophical and political thought. So, what else would you call this place other than The Devil's Pleasure Palace?Explaining this phenomenon is the goal of The Devil's Pleasure Palace by Michael Walsh.\u201cIn the aftermath of World War II, America stood alone as the world\u2019s premier military power. Yet its martial confidence contrasted vividly with its sense of cultural inferiority. Still looking to a defeated and dispirited Europe for intellectual and artistic guidance, burgeoning trans-national elite in New York and Washington embraced not only the war\u2019s refugees, but many of their ideas as well, and nothing has proven more pernicious than those of the Frankfurt School and its reactionary philosophy of \u201ccritical theory.\u201d At once overly intellectualized and emotionally juvenile, Critical Theory \u2013 like Pandora\u2019s Box \u2013 released a horde of demons into the American psyche. When everything could be questioned, nothing could be real, and the muscular, confident empiricism that had just won the war gave way, in less than a generation, to a central-European nihilism celebrated on college campuses across the United States. Seizing the high ground of academe and the arts, the New Nihilists set about dissolving the bedrock of the country, from patriotism to marriage to the family to military service; they have sown (as Cardinal Bergoglio \u2013 now Pope Francis \u2013 once wrote of the Devil) \u201cdestruction, division, hatred, and calumny\u201d \u2013 and all disguised as the search for truth.\u201d\u2013 Amazon product descriptionWe needn't despair. There is a way to combat this insidious movement. We can laugh at it. As the author explains...\u201cScorn drives the Unholy Left insane. They cannot bear to have their theories questioned, or the failed results of those theories laughed at. Dignity is one of the imaginary virtues \u2013 one of the last virtues, period \u2013 they possess, and to have that attacked along with their 'entire' belief system' (the jeering term they use for organized religion) is too much to bear. Mockery is the thing that brings them quickest to frothing, garment-rending rage, so wedded are they to the notion of their own goodness and infallibility when it comes to matters of impiety and immorals.\u201dReading this last has once again reminded me of my own shortcoming, my oft bemoaned failure as a humorist. Why can't I write more like Twain who reminded us that \u201cNone can stand in a gale of laughter.\u201d Sadly, ranting against the Left only provides them succor. They suckle on our self-righteous anger as though it were mother's own milk to them.We all need to take a deep breath.Count to ten.Then laugh at their nonsense.Reading The Devil's Pleasure Palace won't make it any better but, at least, after reading it you may be able to get the punch line."}, {"userName": "Jacob Aitken", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5958504-jacob-aitken", "userReview": "What is the Christian Response to Cultural marxism? While everyone is morally obligated to fight a war to the death against the Frankfurt School, that doesn\u2019t mean every effort is equally good. Most, in fact, are not. Walsh\u2019s book is a mixed bag. He is a professional music critic and when he sticks to that topic, his analyses are always erudite and occasionally insightful. When he gets into biblical and philosophical issues, he is in trouble. I will say it another way: he has no clue what he is talking about. Thesis: the West faces a war against the morality of the epic of Genesis vs. the neo-Marxist cult of critical theory.Throughout the narrative Walsh will interweave Genesis (which he doesn\u2019t necessarily think is real; he might, but his language is ambiguous), Goethe\u2019s Faust, and Milton to illustrate the satanic seduction. I guess there is a way that can work, but the reader often loses sight of the thesis in the minute discussions of Faust.

I have tried reading the original writings of Debord, Foucault, etc. and I've decided that it's probably not worth it. Their writing is impossibly tedious and convoluted. I would like to find somewhere an outsider's history or analysis of the field. Often I find that criticism of a philosophy sheds more light on what it is than endorsement of it, so I thought this book was worth a shot.Anyway, this book wasn't that at all. The Frankfurt School that Walsh criticizes is barely directly engaged with in the text, other than to occasionally set up a crude strawman. I came away from this book with no more knowledge of the Frankfurt School or associated intellectuals than the tiny amount I had coming in. Despite that, I kind of enjoyed this book in some ways, though it was an entirely guilty pleasure. Ironic given the title, huh?I enjoyed it in a similar way to how I enjoy watching the YouTube conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. If you haven't heard of him, he's sort of like a Rush Limbaugh on DMT. Everything he says is a gross ideological distortion of the truth, but there's something very narratively satisfying about it to me. He has an unparalleled zeal in fighting a crusade against an enemy that he calls \"the globalists\", who he characterizes as a rotten elite who have hijacked our culture and are firmly against truth, beauty, and life. They don't want you to go to church, they don't want you to love your family, they don't want you to hunt and fish and appreciate nature, etc. Alex is almost always in top form as a performer. He rants and he roars as he manages to tie the daily political news into a narrative of biblical proportion, going off on free-associative dreamlike sermons filled with lurid sci-fi and fantasy imagery. Recently Alex Jones got some media attention after a segment in which he declared that Hillary Clinton is literally a demon. Obama gave a speech referring to this video denouncing how polarized our media has become - we are literally demonizing our political opponents. This is basically the thesis of the Devil's Pleasure Palace: \"the left is satanic\". Michael Walsh is something worse than an ideologue - he's a complete partisan. All of our contemporary political battles - war, feminism, gun rights, global warming, universal health care, etc. - are mentioned in the text somewhere, and on all of them the leftist stance is not only a spiteful, wicked act of cowardly cultural subversion, it is something that defies the order of nature and reason itself. Walsh doesn't even try to see where the left is coming from. On abortion, for example, he rants about how the satanic leftists \"glorify death\" or something along those lines, without pausing to consider why some might not see it that way. In the simplistic narrative of the book, blame for everything the Democratic party has done in the last fifty years is laid at the feet of the subversive, wicked Frankfurt School, who if Walsh can be believed were perhaps the most successful set of intellectuals in all of history in propagating their ideas (despite one strange part where he talks about how Adorno was a loser because no one reads him anymore, or something like that). Throughout all of this, Walsh is constantly making references and allusions to classical works like Paradise Lost, or the operas of Goethe and Wagner. He brings in films in his discussions as well. To be honest I found some of this stuff somewhat interesting - the book is well-paced so that he never lingers on one subject for too long. Part of the reason this book kind of pissed me off is that in some ways I'm predisposed to agree with the sort of critique he makes and think it could have been much better. I liked his defense of heroism, and belief in awareness of good and evil. He has a sort of interesting view of the universe - though he claims to be a Christian, the writing makes it seem like he's really a Jungian, or perhaps a combination of the two. His career is as a music critic - I can totally understand why perhaps just being a Republican-leaning person in that field would over time transform someone into the most rabid enemy of the \"totalitarian amoral left\".But the way he ends up doing all this is horrendous and sheds almost no light on the subject, instead going for pure rage.

It shows how these classics have, embedded within them illustrations of the battle that raged then and rages today between darkness and light, between Political Correctness and Liberty.Many conservative books that dissect and analyze modern times are downright depressing, Theodore Dalrymple's \"Life at the Bottom\" for example or Allan Bloom's classic \"The Closing of the American Mind.\" But this book ends on a high note. And, cannot disagree with the conclusion.If you are a Liberal considering an ideological change, read this book. If you are a Conservative trying to understand the roots our nations decline, read this book. If you don't know what the heck you are ideologically? READ THIS BOOK!A note of caution - about 1/3 into the book Walsh goes really deep into classical music. Honestly, I got a little bored, not because it was not well-written, but because I'm nowhere near an expert on classical music. Thus, I was kinda lost. But the rest of the book was incredible. Makes me wish someone (me maybe) would right a conservative book on contemporary music's influence on the modern mind."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13010014-andrew", "userReview": "One of those rarities that every reader is in constant search of: a life-altering book. The Devil's Pleasure Palace is the most succinct, concise and devastating history of and rebuttal to The Frankfurt School that I have had the pleasure of reading. Walsh lays out why \"we have, intellectually, come to the dead end of Critical Theory,\" political correctness, moral cowardice masquerading as morality and the other attendant dogmas of the Left that were unleashed to hollow out, corrode, corrupt and muzzle Western Civilization after the Second World War. An incredibly timely book in the Age of Obama and in the face of Islamic terror, it is beautifully and floridly written and contains so many quotes that I will be referring to for years to come. Cannot recommend highly enough and I will be giving it as a gift."}, {"userName": "Jason Carter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2257430-jason-carter", "userReview": "This was really an excellent book. Walsh uses several literary themes (the Bible, Faust, Paradise Lost, Wagner) to critique the German Critical Theory proponents and their idiotic, destructive leftist ideology.I would have given it five stars, except it was a little academic in parts and somewhat slow in the middle section. It is very much worth reading, though, especially for its optimistic outlook for humanity. Liberalism is self-destructive and worthy of ridicule. \"Scorn drives the Unholy Left insane. They cannot bear to have their theories questioned, or the failed results of those theories laughed at... Mockery is the thing that brings them quickest to frothing, garment-rending rage, so wedded are they to the notion of their own goodness and infallibility when it comes to matters of impiety and immorals.\""}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20605222-daniel", "userReview": "When I first happened upon the title of this book, I assumed the author was referring to a resentful, malicious and nihilistically critical approach found in academic departments and university \"cultural studies\" programs. Alas, no, he really means it when he says \"devil.\" It seems to me that the cultural accomplishments of the West can be more convincingly defended on positivistic grounds.

However the approach and tone is reminiscent of a snarky, trolling rant that would be entirely at home on a blog and made the reading rather plodding at times. While I admit it\u2019s hard to reign in the snark when addressing the topic, I\u2019d say Roger Scruton covered much of the same ground and was far more cogently in  Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left."}, {"userName": "Robert J.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7201113-robert-j", "userReview": "Walsh's expose of the New Left's corrosive impact on the West is just astounding. Speaking from his areas of expertise, music, literature and art, Walsh frames the story in a way that is compelling and practically irrefutable. The problem with the new Left, or modern liberals, is they offer nothing in place of what they're destroying, and when you see how their march through the institutions destroys not only political debate, family and faith, but art - beautiful expressions of our common understanding - understanding their impact becomes essential. For anyone who loves western civilization, this book is a must read.

The book is readable, and there is much interesting content, but it does not hold together very well. Most importantly, it does not deliver much on what is purportedly the principal subject matter: the Frankfurt School and how it introduced critical theory into our culture. I learned much about Wagner, Mozart, Goethe, and Milton, but not much about the Frankfurt School."}, {"userName": "Don Incognito", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526509-don-incognito", "userReview": "The most disappointing book I've read in years.

A tremdously bright red flag tossed up in front of one segment of society. I highly recommend the Goodreads reviews for this book, not to be too obvious but \"on the left one star, on the right five.\" This is, as one negative review puts it, an erudite rant but still a rant. Perhaps that's one reason why some people enjoyed it so much; it's not an exhaustive academic treatment, it's a sophisticated opinion piece from a guy with a different point of view. Author Walsh is a longtime music critic, author of both spy thrillers and an interesting book on opera and he works a number of operatic themes into his analysis. It is also a book deeply informed by faith, another contributor to a division of opinion. Walsh begins with what he calls the \"ur-Narrative,\" the Garden of Eden and the appearance of Satan. From there the discussion moves to Milton's Paradise Lost and Lucifer's rebellion against God. The book will continue with examinations of both Goethe and Thomas Mann's Faust novels, the Faust operas and on to Richard Wagner.How Walsh moves from this to a critique of the Frankfurt School (Adorno, Marcuse, Horkheimer, Reich et al) and on to the effect of Critical Theory on American culture is magical. I mean, really magical, like sawing a women in half magic, escaping from a locked box magic. How this affects you, the reader, depends on your beliefs going in. For most on the left, the argument will be rejected and for most on the right it will be reinforcement on what they already know. For a smaller group I think it might stimulate some reflection as to how we got to this point where, for example, freedom of speech is an endangered act. What is also true is that Walsh has provided a very entertaining, indeed, often hilarious look at our new modern pieties."}], "description": "In the aftermath of World War II, America stood alone as the world\u2019s premier military power. Yet its martial confidence contrasted vividly with its sense of cultural inferiority. Still looking to a defeated and dispirited Europe for intellectual and artistic guidance, burgeoning trans-national elite in New York and Washington embraced not only the war\u2019s refugees, but many of their ideas as well, and nothing has proven more pernicious than those of the Frankfurt School and its reactionary philosophy of \u201ccritical theory.\u201d At once overly intellectualized and emotionally juvenile, Critical Theory \u2013 like Pandora\u2019s Box \u2013 released a horde of demons into the American psyche. When everything could be questioned, nothing could be real, and the muscular, confident empiricism that had just won the war gave way, in less than a generation, to a central-European nihilism celebrated on college campuses across the United States. Seizing the high ground of academe and the arts, the New Nihilists set about dissolving the bedrock of the country, from patriotism to marriage to the family to military service; they have sown (as Cardinal Bergoglio \u2013 now Pope Francis \u2013 once wrote of the Devil) \u201cdestruction, division, hatred, and calumny\u201d \u2013 and all disguised as the search for truth.In The Devil's Pleasure Palace we will look at the ways Critical Theory took root in America and, once established and gestated, has affected nearly every aspect of American life and society \u2013 and what can be done to stop it.", "title": "The Devil's Pleasure Palace: The Cult of Critical Theory and the Subversion of the West", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25967860-the-devil-s-pleasure-palace", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440428476l/25967860.jpg", "reviews": 50, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14440855.Michael_Walsh", "name": "Michael   Walsh"}], "type": ["Philosophy", "Politics", "History", "Nonfiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25967860-the-devil-s-pleasure-palace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23258883-the-devil-s-pleasure-palace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6751388-hostile-intent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351092.As_Time_Goes_By", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8365211-early-warning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11649274-shock-warning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908490.Who_s_Afraid_of_Classical_Music_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
