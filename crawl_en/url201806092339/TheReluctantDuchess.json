Ross had been engaged to Sara's cousin Meredith before she was brutally murdered. The murderer was never caught and Ross still feels guilt 2 years after her death. Sara starts receiving threatening letters and approaches Ross to help her find the culprit. With the help of Montgomery, Ross's friend and an officer for Scotland yard, they attempt to find the culprit who might also be the murderer.I liked the main characters and was intrigued with the way the characters were portrayed. Ross is gruff and a bit of a jerk but you soon realise there is a lot more beneath the surface. Sara is shy and tongue tied around strangers, but manages to find strength when dealing with Ross. Their relationship was slow to ignite, but burned bright by the end.It was a little drawn out in parts and I guessed the identity of the murderer pretty early. The couple have a few steamy clinches, but the \"deed\" is never done.This is a nice and safe read with a little mystery thrown in for good measure.I received a complimentary copy of this story via Netgalley for an honest review.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Gabriel has just returned from India where he escaped to mourn in peace his murdered fianc\u00e9e. They were the \"it\" couple and though he was cleared of any wrong doing, he is sick of being under the microscope. When he returns, he finds his fianc\u00e9e's cousin has called on him for the last five days in a row. Sara is the exact opposite of her cousin, preferring the corners of a ballroom to the center of it. Sara always felt extremely intimidated by Gabriel but for the most part he ignored her as he jet-set around with her cousin Meredith. When Sara starts receiving creepy letters alluding to Meredith's death, she remembers Gabriel telling her family if they ever needed anything to come to him. Sara has social anxiety but she desperately needs the Duke's help and when he reads the letters, he agrees. Gabriel and Sara are thrown together as they search the clues for who is threatening Sara and the possible connection it has to Meredith's death. The more time they spend together, the more they learn about one another and it starts to become clear that a Duke and a wallflower may be the best match of all.\u00a0The Reluctant Duchess is a standalone but there was an appearance from the couple who starred in \"His Saving Grace\", if you didn't read that book you won't be lost here and if you did, you will probably enjoy revisiting the characters. This was my second book by this author and I feel like I can see improvement in her writing as the structure of this story was much tighter; this had a very calm, smooth waters flow. Characters and situations are delved into enough to give the reader a sense of things but not quite deeply enough to really grab a hold of you. The murder mystery is what brings our two leads together but even though the letters sound threatening, I never felt a sense of danger. In fact, until the latter part of the book, it is almost pushed to the side as the story focuses more on our leads budding romance. I was ok with this as the murder mystery didn't have the stoutest of legs to stand on and our couple was pleasant to read together.\u00a0\n\"You don't know your own worth, Sara.\"\n\u00a0Gabriel bursts into the scene as a grumpy, dark, and autocratic duke and even though he retains some of his bossiness throughout most of the story, I found he mellowed fairly quickly. His time in India is said to have changed him from the party boy he was but the reader only gets told this through vague references to the atrocities happening over there. Sara was the more flushed out character as we get more of her back story and inner dialogue. She was an orphan raised by her uncle and aunt, who started off as a naturally quiet and shy child and was only pushed to the sidelines more by her naturally vibrant and beautiful cousin. Gabriel's bossiness brings out her more assertive side and we see their connection through his ability to strengthen her and her ability to calm him. They aren't a flashy sexy couple (there are no full bedroom scenes) but they do have their sweet moments and will be amiable to any reader.\u00a0As I mentioned, the murder mystery and subsequent villain fell a bit short as it was pushed to the sidelines and then rushed a bit at the end with some flimsiness to the villain and motive. The investigator, Sir Montgomery, was the best part of this story thread and the strongest of the secondary characters; I hope we will eventually get his story. Gabriel's mother, Sara's aunt and uncle, the bodyguard James, and any other secondary characters were fairly thinly sketched out or felt forced in ways to provide angst for our couple. \u00a0This is set in regency times but stayed away from most of the sub-genres overused scenes; ballrooms, spies, etc. If looking for something set in the time period but a smidge different, an afternoon read, and a gentle couple, The Reluctant Duchess is a pleasant read you wouldn't go wrong with."}, {"userName": "Daniella", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43278962-daniella", "userReview": "*An ARC was given in exchange for an honest review.

I have a big problem with the overall writing, and this, I believe, is the main reason why I could not appreciate the story. The writing was just bland and uninspiring at best, and painfully simplistic at worst. I don't know about you, but I put such high importance in the quality of the prose, especially having read the works of Monica McCarty, Grace Draven, Elizabeth Hoyt and Lisa Kleypas. I just can't find myself investing my time and my feelings in a book that has no soul.The characters were flat. The overall plot was cliche and poorly executed. The mystery was significantly overshadowed by the writer's futile attempt to make the romance natural. Everything just seemed contrived to put Sara and Ross together.

The crime was never solved. Two years later, Sara is jolted out of her dull life when she receives letters dredging up Meredith\u2019s death. \u00a0Now, the killer seems to be targeting her. Determined to bring her cousin\u2019s murderer to justice, Sara seeks help from the man who was once her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2014Gabriel Ferguson, the Duke of Rossmoyne. However, living under his protection has its own hazards. Drawn to his fiery personality, Sara feels a delicious urge to take their relationship in \"new, exquisitely inappropriate directions.\" My feelings for The Reluctant Duchess are like mixed greens in a salad bowl; there is a little bit of everything. The characters, for instance, have me pulling petals from a flower say, \u201cI love you. I love you not.\u201d Sara\u2019s character is too eager to help those in need, much like a mother hen. Her kindness and stubborn determination to take care of her father at the expense of her own happiness was, again, too altruistic. I couldn\u2019t connect with Sara because I believe you cannot set your ENTIRE life aside to take care of others who have already had the chance at living their life fully. But, I have a soft spot for sweet characters, and I like her anyways for her shyness, quiet confidence and placid beauty.Gabriel\u2019s character had me truly on the fence. While he did have a strong, yet vulnerable personality, and is arguably swoon-worthy, he allows his mother to dictate whom he should love. Oh no, no, no\u2026And speaking of mothers, I think Ms. Cullen has a wickedly good sense of humor playing up the meddling mom card. Though I think the greatest joke was actually played on me\u2014the reader. There were many scenes in which I was welcoming the satisfaction that comes with a deeply emotional and honest conversation between Sara and Gabriel, or anticipating a sensual late night tryst, when I am jolted out of my reverie at the (un)timely appearances of the moms. Such an unexpected and unpleasant mental cold shower. Ha ha. I hope my next book by Ms. Cullen will leave me just a touch less high and dry.DISCUSSION: Who's your all time favorite swoon-worthy historical male/female lead?{I received this title from NetGalley in exchange for my honest and humble opinion.}"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Reluctant Duchess by Sharon Cullen is a 2015 Loveswept publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Simply delicious! This story is a combination of mystery, suspense and historical romance which made it doubly appealing to me. Lady Sara\u2019s outgoing and popular cousin Meredith was murdered two years ago and the case was never solved. Now Sara is receiving weird and frightening notes which allude to her cousin\u2019s death, suggesting the notes may be from the killer. The one person Sara feels can help her is Meredith\u2019s fianc\u00e9 at the time of her death\u2026 The Duke of Rossmoyne, Gabriel Ferguson. Gabriel has just returned from his assignment in India and is still recovering from all that he encountered there. When he is informed of Lady Sara\u2019s reasons for intruding upon his life, he is once more confronted with his painful past, but this could be a chance to finally solve the case, remove all whispers of his involvement, and most importantly, keep Lady Sara safe. But, with each day he spends with Sara, he falls more deeply in love with her, which is the very last thing he expected to happen. However, Sara is convinced she would never make a proper Duchess for him, due to her lack of social skills. Can Gabriel solve the murder case and win Sara\u2019 heart, or will the murderer ruin their chance at happiness? I love, love, love mystery mingled in with romance. Most of the time I equate romantic suspense with a contemporary setting, but this story could fit into that mold quite nicely, although the romance becomes the dominant thread. The mystery was compelling and suspenseful as the killer\u2019s boldness begins to escalate and it becomes obvious that Sara is his new obsession. This plot could just as easily fit into a contemporary setting, but I think the historical setting made it a bit more challenging. As with most romantic suspense novels, it can be difficult to balance the mystery and romance, and since this story is firmly rooted in the regency period, with many readers of this genre expecting strong romantic elements, there were a few times when the mystery got pushed to the sidelines, which of course threw a wet towel on the suspense build up. In the end, this storyline does manage to steal the spotlight away and becomes a little tense for a while. One thing that struck a chord with me personally, was that I can understand Sara and relate to her quite well. I am not a social butterfly and have absolutely no desire to become one. I can feel her discomfort at the social events she attended, and understood exactly how she felt. The funny thing, of course, was that Gabriel wasn\u2019t all that keen on social gatherings either, making the couple more compatible than they realized.Gabriel is a true gentleman, and I loved his respect for Sara and his mother, even when I disagreed with what was being said. Although he did have that slight arrogance any duke would, he was reasonable and smart, and that made him attractive and really sexy.  The author did a great job sticking with the language, dress, and social mores of the day, and for once, I didn\u2019t get irritated by the use of words or phrases that didn\u2019t not belong in polite society in those days. Although, it was a sad way for this couple to come together, perhaps a little bittersweet, I do believe these two are Soulmates and are a perfect love match!  I really enjoyed this one a lot! 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "John Hennessy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981944-john-hennessy", "userReview": "This was a tricky book to review as I think it had already set up a high standard by saying it was for fans of Mary Balogh. I'm not one for being swayed by such things, no more than I would read a horror if it was for fans of Stephen King.The Reluctant Duchess is a reasonably good yarn, though it never quite becomes the story it could have been. The heroine is a rather naive girl who almost turns in a demanding sexual temptress overnight. The hero....it has to be said is rather loosely defined. He never seems to take control of the situation he finds himself in.If you can put these aside, there's a greater story to be had here. The suspense is well done, the killer on the loose is very interesting and works as a great hook to reel you in. The characters are just a little one dimensional for me, but this is a small gripe in an otherwise very readable historical romance.I was leaning towards 4 stars for this one, but I've gone for 3. No doubt some of you will agree with this review, others will totally love it. I really appreciate what this author has tried to do with the story, but her peers set almost too high a standard. Still, if you write HR, there is nothing wrong with being compared to Mary Balogh. And a lot of reviews gave this five stars. In many ways this book deserves it. The final thought is that it was ambitious in its aim, just falling slightly short for me."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36817401-carrie", "userReview": "After receiving several suspicious letters Lady Sara Emerson travels to London to see if Gabriel Ferguson, Duke of Rossmoyne would help her.

It did have some really good moments, just not enough of them.Sara is a bit of a recluse who is trying to come out of her shell. Ross is a former \"party animal\" who wants everyone to know that he has changed. One of the things that make this Regency story different is the lack of the typical balls and gatherings that are held so the couple can \"fall in love\". What propels this couple together is the threatening letters that Sara is receiving and the protection that Ross is giving her.Unfortunately, the threats are pretty mild and once the \"killer\" is introduced, you figure he's the one.

I really liked this one. It has mystery, scandal, and romance. It's an exciting story with an unsolved murder, threatening letters with a love story between two unexpecting people. Sara Emerson is a shy and reserved Lady, who let her cousin's vivacious attitude outshine Sara's own beauty. Gabriel Ferguson, the Duke of Rossmoyne, was once engaged to Meredith Emerson but she was murdered in a horrible fashion two years ago. Gabriel and Meredith's engagement was the talk of the town and her murder was shocking, there were no clues to who could do this.Two years after the death after her cousin, Meredith, Sara started to receive letters, strange letters from an unknown person claiming he knew Meredith and claims that he was there when she died. The only person Sara can think of to help is Meredith's fiancee, Gabriel Ferguson. Gabriel didn't recognize Sara when he first saw her and when he saw her he felt something he has never felt before. Gabriel never really saw Sara when Meredith was around he just thought her as plain. Now that she is out of the shadows of her cousin, Sara has her chance to shine and Gabriel wants her to shine; for him. Sarah however hates to be the center of attention.Sara has convinced Gabriel to keep her in the loop and to let her help and in return Sara agrees to stay at his residence, with his mother as a chaperone. Gabriel's mother makes it very obvious to Gabriel that he isn't good enough for Sara, and vise versa to Sara which is fine because Sara doesn't think she could be a good Duchess with her dislike of anything social. But the more time Sara and Gabriel spend together the more they realize they are perfect for each other. Sara keeps getting letter that are escalating to the point of threatening and with the help of a young boy and the original investigator they help track down the man behind the letters and the murder of Meredith, but not before he kidnaps Sara.Overall, this was a fun read."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2428607-amanda", "userReview": "I received The Reluctant Duchess for free in exchange for an honest review.3.5It's hard for me to pass up a murder mystery wrapped up in a romance. Bonus points for it being a historical romance. Which is why I requested it when I saw it on NetGalley. (As I am wont to do, apparently.)That said, it was a little difficult to get into The Reluctant Duchess, mostly because of how often we're told about Sara's social anxiety and Ross being overbearing and duke-ish. I caught glimpses of it with Sara's inner reactions and how Ross acted, but the excess explanation overshadowed really seeing it for myself.That said, once I got past the awkwardness of the narrative (including the occasional random backstory dumps in between dialogue), the story sucked me in. Sara, for the most part, was easy to relate to, because she had trouble seeing herself for the awesome person she is. It did get old, especially toward the end, but that's kind of normal in books.As for Ross, he spent a lot of time comparing Sara to his dead fiance, Meredith. Which was rather annoying at first, but I think maybe it was necessary for his character, as least in terms of showing how HE'S changed since Meredith's death.I enjoyed all the secondary characters, including Ross's mom and his friend Montgomery (although it was annoying how often we were told they were friends and how they'd come to be friends after Meredith's death -- I would have preferred to see it in action). Even so, it was easy to suspect who was behind Meredith's murder and the letters to Sara. Likely because once Ross and Sara were forced into attending a few balls, only one man kept coming around afterward, so there was never much mystery for me on that end. Who else would it have been?I was glad to see Ross and Sara finally come together at the end, and it was rather sweet how Ross took care of Sara after all that happened. I'm intrigued by Sara's friend Grace, who I assume had her own book previously. I might be willing to pick that one up to try more Sharon Cullen."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4079729-rosemary", "userReview": "A copy was provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love a well written regency romance and this book did not disappoint me.

Having just returned from India, his once wild ways, had changed where he had grown and was at once drawn to Lady Sara\u2019s lovely intelligent eyes and very calm demeanor. However, he had no intention of staying in London and wished to return to India as soon as he could, but the guilt he had felt over Meredith\u2019s still unsolved murder, required him to do his best to find the murderer. There were many things that I enjoyed in THE RELUCTANT DUCHESS. One of course was the lovely characterization of Lady Sara, and the bonhomie she was able to bring out of the dour Duke of Rossmoyne. I loved the relationship that evolved from friendship to love between these two. Both of these protagonists were so very well fleshed out that one couldn\u2019t help but feel compassion and love for them both. The pace itself was also a boon and the pages just flew by filled with a small amount of lovely secondary characters to add depth and interest to the story. Personally I loved the little urchin Thomas who played a small pivotal role that led to the ultimate revelation of the villain in this plot. Also the angst of Sara\u2019s unwillingness to believe she was worthy of becoming a duchess was well done as Ross attempted to profess his love and assurance that he was not the same person he was years back. All in all, I can highly recommend THE RELUCTANT DUCHESS as one very enjoyable read most will find highly entertaining.Marilyn Rondeau"}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5555146-eva", "userReview": "\u201cThe Reluctant Duchess\u201d is a novel by Sharon Cullen and honestly said I loved it, inhaled it. One day Lady Sara Emerson seeks help but not from somebody but her cousin\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 Gabriel Ferguson, the Duke of Rossmoyne. He\u2019s a rake nonetheless and she\u2019s still sad because of her cousin\u2019s sudden and unexpected death two years ago. Meredith had snuck out of her family\u2019s townhouse and was brutally murdered. Now, years later, Sara is receiving letters from somebody who witnessed her death or eventually even helped. She\u2019s afraid, anxious but also wants to solve the mystery behind this letters. She cannot go to her parents, who only kind of adopted her after her own parents\u2019 death and are originally her aunt and uncle, Meredith\u2019s parents. So she seeks help in London visiting Rossmoyne \u2013 a handsome rake, who is willing to help after he read the letters. Sara even stays at his townhouse together with his mother. She trusts him and because of so many different reasons they start to get closer \u2026 Oh this was a lovely read. When they are on the hunt after this mysterious man they drive into the poor parts of London and I really had the feeling I can smell I (my wild imagination!), feel and taste these parts. I love the city nowadays but don\u2019t want to imagine how it was back than. And Cullen has this way to create a character and play with it. Sara was self confident in the beginning and only had one goal, find her cousin\u2019s murder and that only because of the letters. In the end she is passionate about so many other things (and not only Rossmonyne). I also loved the way Ferguson\u2019s mom was involved in this arch because she wasn\u2019t playing an easy role. She wants the best for both but knows her son and the way he is and was around woman \u2013 a rake. And she knew Sara\u2019s real parents and called them dear friends that\u2019s why she wants the best for this girl who already lost her cousin. I really enjoyed reading it.

When it was discovered that their seemingly perfect relationship did, in fact, have flaws, he became the number one suspect. Although his name was cleared, he still wants to know who\u2019s responsible. For two years, he\u2019s come up empty, until her shy cousin approaches him and demands his help.Gabe never noticed how beautiful the shyer \u2013 and better \u2013 version of his fiance is, nor did he have any clue that underneath that docile demeanor is a sexy little spitfire he can\u2019t refuse, or ignore. When the two join forces to uncover the identity of the killer, Ross realizes he wants more from Sara than just her safety.I was pulled in from the start. I wanted to know who was behind the letters, and the reason for Sara\u2019s cousin\u2019s murder. Sara was a handful, and Gabe wasn\u2019t used to being defied. Her delicate way with others complimented his brusque manner, and I enjoyed the back-and forth between them. Thomas made me smile and I couldn\u2019t help but take the little guy and tuck him in my heart.The letters were an intriguing way to unfold the mystery, however, I didn\u2019t feel the shock when the killer was unveiled; not because I had it figured out, but because he was insufficiently developed.All in all it was a good read.

Since the murderer was never discovered, Sara decides to seek aid from Meredith\u2019s former betrothed, the Duke of Rossmoyne, hoping he will help solve the riddle of the mystery writer. In the two years since Meredith\u2019s death, Rossmoyne has been stationed in India, keeping his mind off of Meredith and her family. But now he has been summoned home to London by the queen and must adjust to Sara\u2019s determination when she refuses to allow him to investigate alone. Working together, Sara and Ross come to see each other in a new light. Ross understands that Sara, the quiet country wallflower, is actually a woman with a steely resolve and a debilitating shyness in social situations. Sara realizes Ross is no longer a gregarious, party-loving duke but rather a passionate, serious man. They find themselves falling in love, but the unnerving letters continue, and the threat to Sara\u2019s life escalates.Verdict Cullen (Sebastian\u2019s Lady Spy) allows the suspense to ebb and flow naturally between finding clues and hitting dead ends. She wisely uses the downtime to develop two strong main characters. Ross\u2019s ability to see past Sara\u2019s shy reserve and his admiration for her courage and strength will have readers rooting for the couple\u2019s success.

Her cousin Meredith had been fiendishly murdered two years ago and now someone was sending Sara scary letters that could be from the murderer.Recently returned from a two year stint in India, Rossqmoyne agrees to help her on condition that she stay in his home with his mother as chaperone. Of course that also opens up its own set of problems. Sara is totally different from Meredith--a fact Ross comes to appreciate the more he sees her.With him she is refreshing and challenging. At social events she fades into the background. Puzzling behaviour indeed!The pace is fast, one scenario tumbles after another gathering momentum. Sara's confrontation with Ross and her brave insistence on his help, the scenes with the child Thomas and their conversation, their visit to the rookeries, their midnight talks in the library.
