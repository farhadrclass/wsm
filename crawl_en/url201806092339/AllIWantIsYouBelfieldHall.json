I like TTV and DA. All I Want is You had a certain sort of appeal which kept me glued to the pages. I love stories where a young girl meets an older man and we have to wait years for the man to notice that she's finally grown up.However, I don't think I have it in me to champion for another \"author's got balls\" moment twice in one week. My patience is wearing a little thin. I blame Allegiant.The good news : This is the ending that I'd wished for The Luxe series to have.The bad news : I got to erase the bad news for this step! (see edit below)The good news : This was a sensual, captivating read.The bad news : The characters carried out the back-and-forth indecision about three misunderstandings too long.The good news : The writing was flawless.The bad news : I was somewhat confused by the mash-up of literary fiction, historical romance, childlike innocence, and dark erotic themes. If I'd known going into the read that the story would have ups and downs similar to Tipping the Velvet, I might have enjoyed it in a more thorough manner, instead of trying to analyze the constant mood shifts.Who would enjoy this book?Fans of stories with scarred heroes who need a woman to break through their walls. The chemistry was gorgeous, and the prose was lush. I will say that the nod to a Downton Abbey setting was not so much the draw, since Sophie was all over the place throughout the story. I liked that the hero had his alpha moments when it came to his sexual desires, but still had sort of the quiet and mysterious recluse thing going on. Ash was extremely protective and kind, then he'd break out with these \"you're mine\" moments which gave me the delicious type of chills. He was a great balance of honorable and devious. The draw truly is in the sensuality and chemistry between Ash and Sophie. My complaints are few, but they are not minor.As mentioned earlier, I didn't know what I was getting into and something about the cohesiveness between style shifts didn't always work for me. While I have no issues reading f/f stories (and have enjoyed several in the past, including the aforementioned TTV), the part of the story featuring the f/f interlude felt clunky and awkward. I would have preferred this part of the story to have been used a vehicle to explore Sophie's sexuality, instead used of as a strange way to show how Sophie was being used by the upper class. Actually, I probably would have preferred in this instance for the \"outside\" conflict between Ash and Sophie to have come from some other idea entirely. There was enough to draw from in the conflict department from Ash's past. *edit* Complaint number 2 is no longer valid after finding out that there is a second book coming soon!Final thoughts :I think All I Want is You was worth the read, even if just for the sake of getting to watch Sophie write to Ash over the years and dream of a day when she would see him again. When we got to see these two together, it was very rewarding indeed.This book provided from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mary - Buried Under Romance ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12492581-mary---buried-under-romance", "userReview": "This is the first romance I have ever read that is continuous with the next in the series, Breathless For You.

The history is amazing. It did feel quite a bit like Downton Abbey in a way most books that compare themselves to Downton fail. I felt Sophie is very comparable to Daisy or Ivy and I could make comparisons to other staff as well. The rest of the book kind of fell apart for me. The sex in the beginning was lesbian but not in a loving way. One woman was using poor Sophie to entrap a man so she needed to keep her a virgin while she taught her the art of the sexytimes. Then there was the real love interest. A man with a dark past (oooh) and he kept her hands tied and blindfolded her for the act. She loved him dearly but hated that bit. The rest is going to be spoilery.Of course she cures Ash of his need to blindfold and handcuff her. Of course he only uses BDSM because he was sexually assaulted over and over again as a way of gaining information by a German female officer in the war. Of course she loves him dearly but she is lowborn so she leaves him (repeatedly) (and by repeatedly I mean over, and over, and over). The climax and conclusion of the book was worst than the awkward sex in the book. I've never thrown a book at a wall until today. This book was the one that broke me.Oh and the author used the word moist (MOIST!

Nonostante (anzi forse proprio per quello) il romance parta col narrare, in modo molto particolareggiato, la storia dell\u2019infanzia della piccola Sophie, la sua vita dura, la sofferenza della morte della madre, il suo lavoro presso la dimora del duca di Belfield ad una tenerissima et\u00e0 e di conseguenza la routine quotidiana del lavoro di sguattera, mettendo apparentemente in secondo piano la storia d\u2019amore, l\u2019ho trovato a dir poco perfetto. Mi sono piaciute anche le scene di vita quotidiana dei domestici e mi ha fatto vedere uno spaccato piuttosto realistico della societ\u00e0 del tempo.

Ho adorato la sua forza, la tenacia dei suoi sentimenti e la costanza nel seguire le sue scelte, la determinazione nel perseguire il suo obbiettivo cercando di non scendere a compromessi e mantenendo una purezza di fondo nonostante tutto. E poi c\u2019\u00e8 lui, Mr. Maldon, figura misteriosa e defilata nella prima parte del libro, idealizzata e amata dalla giovane ragazza che aveva aiutato e salvato dalla rovina anni prima e che dopo un breve scambio epistolare, fa perdere le sue tracce nonostante la piccola Sophie continui a scrivergli e a ricordarlo nei suoi pensieri e nel suo cuore.

I'm a bigger fan of the former than the latter, and the sample chapter was well-written enough to capture my interest (despite being written in first person POV, of which I am not a fan). I had a gift certificate to purchase, otherwise I would not have bought it. 8.89 for an ebook, especially by a relatively unknown author, is way too much. After reading this book, I wouldn't pay more than 2.99 for it.The book starts off well. You get a good sense of time and place, a young girl (Sophie) in pre-World War I England, forced by circumstances to work as a scullery maid at a Duke's estate. A handsome stranger helps her get the job. He asks her to write to him. The reader knows before Sophie does that they will meet again. The exchange of letters is sweet, the tension builds towards their meeting again when she is a few years older. But then the story takes a path I wasn't expecting, and enters into territories that I, frankly, am just not interested in reading about. And after the h and H do meet again, everything just fizzles from that point. It's almost as if the first and second half of the book were written by two different people. The ending was very disappointing. I was left thinking, \"I just spent three hours reading this for THAT?\" It isn't clear if this is the first in a series, or a stand-alone. Doesn't matter. I just didn't feel a strong enough connection with either the h or the H to want to read anything more about them in the future.I won't reveal any spoilers, but I DO feel that the blurb should have come with the following warning: This book contains f/f sex and non-consensual sex (a woman forced to have sexual relations in public with several men). Also, if you're a FSOG fan, you will be extremely disappointed. This isn't a BDSM book (not that FSOG was a genuine BDSM book either), and you won't find spanking, handcuffs, floggers or canes here. Just a few scenes where the h is tied to the bed and blindfolded.Thank me for saving you a few dollars. If you're still interested in reading this, wait until the price gets below 3.00. Unlikely it will ever be offered for free.

Di solito non lo sono mai, quando leggo. Certo, ci sono libri che non mi appassionano e che non mi piacciono, ma arrivo sempre alla fine, anche se la narrazione \u00e8 pessima e i personaggi non hanno n\u00e9 arte e n\u00e9 parte.Questo \u00e8 stato il primo libro letto dopo la maturit\u00e0, e fatemelo dire senza troppi giri di parole: Elizabeth Anthony non ci ha capito un cazzo.Mi sono arrabbiata come una iena, leggendolo. La trama non era cos\u00ec promettente, ma ho voluto dargli una speranza: quanti libri sembrano brutti, e poi si rivelano fantastici?Credevo fosse cos\u00ec anche per Tu sei mia, ma mi sbagliavo di grosso.Ci troviamo nel 1920, vicino a Londra. Mi piacciono da morire i libri storici, meglio ancora se romanzati. La protagonista \u00e8 Sophie, e infatti parte tutto proprio da lei: conosciamo bene o male i suoi genitori, sua madre che lavora Belfied Hall come domestica, che poi si rivela essere l\u2019amante del Conte. Sophie \u00e8 solo una ragazzina, eppure suo padre decide di partire per la guerra, e non tornare mai pi\u00f9.

Sophie chiede aiuto, ma nessuno si avvicina, finch\u00e9 non ferma un uomo. Un ragazzo mai visto e conosciuto prima, dovrebbe soltanto aiutarti, no? Nel giro di tre righe questo sconosciuto si occupa della madre di Sophie, pagandole anche il funerale. Dopo, spedisce con non so quali credenziali la piccola a lavorare a Belfied Hall come sguattera, e le dice di scrivergli. Sempre. Sophie per tre anni scrive a questo uomo mai visto e conosciuto, che sinceramente non le ha nemmeno mai dato un indirizzo. Ma lasciamo stare.Insomma, Sophie lavora per anni a Belfied Hall. Intanto vede il Conte morire durante la guerra, il suo successore di soli dieci morire avvelenato, e cos\u00ec via. A Belfield Hall arriva la vedova del Conte, che in quattro e quattr\u2019otto organizza dei rapporti lesbo con la sedicenne Sophie. Non parliamo di violenza, tranquilli. Lei \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che consenziente.La nostra protagonista \u00e8 in preda agli ormoni, crede quasi di amare Lady Beatrice, finch\u00e9 non le rivela le serve soltanto per uno scopo: cederla al nuovo conto di Belfied Hall come regalo ed amante, cos\u00ec che lui in preda al piacere decida di sposare Lady Beatrice.E indovinate chi \u00e8 questo fantomatico nuovo Conte? Quel poveretto di Mr. Maldon, l\u2019uomo che aveva aiutato Sophie anni prima e che si rivela essere in realt\u00e0 il Duca Ashley, cio\u00e8 successore ed erede di Belfield Hall.Lui non \u00e8 per niente d\u2019accordo con Lady Beatrice, ma Sophie con estrema facilit\u00e0 gli concede la sua innocenza, per poi scappare a Londra.Passa qualche anno, lei diventa ballerina e il Duca la segue. La vede per caso in una compagnia di ballo, la attacca ad un muro per fare voi immaginate cosa, e poi la lascia l\u00ec dicendole che \u00e8 una puttana. Tutto regolare, direi.Sophie torna da lui in preda alle lacrime a alla sua migliore amica che nel 1920 si fa di cocaina come se non ci fosse un domani, chiedendogli piet\u00e0. Lui la prende sotto la sua protezione, la coccola, fanno sesso sfrenato e\u2026 Mi sono rifiutata di continuare a leggere.

But, then again, I was also weary \u2013 historical romance novels which tend to take 'modern liberties' have a track record of getting on my nerves (see my review of Julia Quinn's The Duke and I). How would I end up feeling about this one?Well, All I Want is You starts like a normal historical novel. In the beginning, Sophie describes her life as a young girl and the lead-up to becoming a maid at a big house. It seems to show more of an accurate portrayal of a servant's life than even Downton Abbey (it's fair to say that the staff at Downton are perhaps a little too spoilt to be believed!). However, these accuracies fade as soon as the expected sexual side of the plot begins to develop.At first, I found it really hard to accept that all these people could be that forward and blas\u00e9 about sexuality. Surely they would have been a little more careful about discussing sex it in those days, and would have chosen their partners with greater care? This certainly wasn't so in Sophie's version of 1920s England.And that's the point. All I Want is You isn't supposed to be an accurate historical representation of love, sex and hierarchies in the 1920s \u2013 it's supposed to be enjoyed for what it is, and that is a powerful story of forbidden romance. So when I finally managed to wrap my brain around this realisation, I really started to enjoy the novel.In the end, I managed to finish All I Want is You in about three days, all because I could barely put it down! I became addicted to Sophie and Lord Ashley's love story, and I couldn't wait to find out how they would resolve the many complications getting in the way of their relationship. One of these complications is the seductive and relentless Lady Beatrice, who will do anything to exploit those who get in the way of her plans.There are plenty of sex scenes in the book and they can be quite graphic, though they are tastefully written. But, be warned, many are not for the squeamish!In summary, All I Want is You is a wonderful, addictive tale of romance in an alternative 1920s England. If you enjoy an intense love story and don't mind some modern touches blended within a historical period, I'd highly recommend it. My only complaint now is having to wait for book two to find out what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Marta Fern\u00e1ndez", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074033-marta-fern-ndez", "userReview": "No ten\u00eda grandes expectativas en esta novela porque antes de empezar a leerla, curiose\u00e9 por Goodreads y ten\u00eda puntuaciones bastante bajas, pens\u00e9 que se me iba a hacer cuesta arriba, aunque para mi sorpresa me enganch\u00f3 desde la primera p\u00e1gina.La autora tiene un estilo muy fluido, sin grandes descripciones y con frases cortas, s\u00ed que contextualiza m\u00e1s o menos bien la \u00e9poca aunque ech\u00e9 en falta m\u00e1s referencias a la misma.

Oh, my love. My only love.\u201dI wanted to read Elizabeth Anthony\u2019s All I Want Is You not only because of the beautiful cover that caught my attention on-spot but also because I\u2019m crazy about this song. Then I read some negative reviews as the book being was compared to a popular contemporary BDSM romance and any comparison to that, good or bad, makes me want to stay away. But because I requested for the ARC, in spite of it I went right ahead.TBH, I would\u2019ve missed if I hadn\u2019t read this book. It didn\u2019t feel like one of those clich\u00e9d BDSM stories with headache inducing drama. Whatever drama this story had, it was done very well. The storytelling was gorgeous, the prose flowing and lush. Elizabeth Anthony has a way to keep you turning pages. Although at first, I believed she\u2019s a debut author - which she\u2019s not \u2013 I\u2019ve found that her writing is simply divine. The setting was also very different. Let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t read many romances, erotica or traditional, set in the 1920s. I just LOVED the whole environment because this book had a glossy, cinematic touch to it.Set against the backdrop of a looming WWI, All I Want Is You spans over 4+ years, the later part taking place in the \u201820s. It talks about a young star-crossed pair and class-distinction, as our heroine, Sophie, had a working class background. Ash, our hero, becomes the heir to the Duke of Ashley. Now, I\u2019ll try to walk you through it.Sophie was the only daughter of her parents. Her mother Florence, a beautiful blonde, always caught attentions everywhere she went. And she was taken advantage of no doubt because of her lower class status. When Florence started working as a maid at the Belfield Hall, she caught the eyes of the debauched heir to the Dukedom, Lord Charlwood. I tried my best not to judge her cause she, indeed, starts an affair with the man and everyone knew of it. After a while, sure enough, Charlwood grew tired of her and kicked her out. Already she was a colored woman throughout the town, and after this incident, Sophie\u2019s family became outcasts. Gradually, Florence became ill, possibly with consumption. Then her husband up and left them, never to return again. One day, as Florence lay dying, the 12 yrs. old had no other option but to beg for help. Unsurprisingly, no one came forward and Sophie could do little else. They are very poor and she would be left entirely alone. That day, a Mr. Maldon saves it for Sophie and forever remains in her memory as her Knight in Shining Armor.Mr. Maldon not only helps taking Florence to the hospital, but also arranges for her burial when she passes away right afterwards. Rumor has it that he came to visit the Bellfield Hall but Sophie didn\u2019t know anything beyond that. She could only see kindness and a handsome young face with beautiful blue eyes. He tells Sophie that he has to leave soon, but before that, he can help her securing a job at the Belfield Hall as a maid. She only has to refer to him to the housekeeper. Mr. Maldon also gives Sophie his London address, asking her to write to him regularly.Sophie gets the job, thanks to the housekeeper who apparently was fond of the young man. It also became apparent that the majority of the servants hate the snooty Duke and the Duchess because of their meanness, especially to the servants. Lord Charlwood has already married another spoiled heiress but they don\u2019t live here. Sophie begins her working hours as a scullery maid, learning not only housework but also how to fend off eager young bucks amongst the servants. It must be mentioned that Sophie inherited Florence\u2019s blonde beauty, so her youthful body gradually begins catching the roving eyes. I thoroughly enjoyed the \u2018downstairs\u2019 talks; gossips of the servants, as it gave me an idea of the cycle of their lives. The Romance novels I generally read don\u2019t deal with such stuff. It gave Sophie the idea of a rather unknown world, opening up her eyes to the \u2018reality\u2019. She\u2019d also hear of \u2018that disgraceful man\u2019, someone called Lord Ashley who the Duke and Duchess hate with a passion. He\u2019s, apparently, sullying the \u2018noble name\u2019 of the family by doing things no noble should be doing. Ashley is rumored to be wild, without any inhibition or remorse. The Duke and Duchess can\u2019t seem to pass one moment without saying something nasty about him.Sophie also keeps writing to Mr. Maldon. He replies to couple of her early letters, most very short to her long ones, detailed with her life at the Belfield Hall. But after a time, his replies stop coming. Sophie is at first surprised, then saddened. She\u2019s even hurt thinking he has probably forgotten about her. After a year of waiting for his replies, Sophie stops expecting them. Really, why would he care or bother about a lowly servant girl, right? But Sophie keeps writing to him for a year or two more, regularly, unfailingly. Whenever she\u2019s happy or sad, or just wants to talk to someone, she\u2019d write a letter to her Mr. Maldon. This book is worth a read to read Sophie\u2019s innocent, honest letters, speaking of her happiness, sadness, anger... and vulnerabilities.In the midst of it the war breaks out. Things are gloomy, sad... plain miserable everywhere. I could feel the misery off the pages as I read through; it seems everyone is waiting for a bad news to drop. Every single day. Lord Charlwood also joins the army, and though he\u2019s not physically involved in the battle, somehow, fate\u2019s intervenes and he dies. The Duke and Duchess are inconsolable at the death of their precious heir. Charlwood didn\u2019t have children so there\u2019s no direct line. The next in the line was a young, ill boy who dies soon after he inherits. Now, the Dukedom will transfer Lord Ashley. Talk about the nightmare coming alive for the current Duke! And so we learn that this was one of the major reasons why they despised Ashley so much.What happen next are some rapid incidents. The duke dies. Sophie\u2019s only best friend there, a plain and physically challenged girl, falls prey to a local man and becomes pregnant. This guy is a shark, a disgusting piece of sh!t. He took advantage of the girl. It was also very apparent that he doesn\u2019t hold women in high regard. To him, they\u2019re just something to use and discard. The poor girl trusted him, thought in love and paid the price. He denies any responsibility of her pregnancy. The girl probably dies later while trying to get an abortion. When a sad and enraged Sophie, now 15 yrs. old, confronts the man, he even threatens her and makes dirty insinuations. Sophie is angry but she\u2019s also alone in this fight.At that time, rumor starts flying that the widow of Lord Charlwood is coming to visit soon. This woman, who is not used to the \u2018backward, unsophisticated\u2019 country life, has never set foot here. Rumor also has it that she\u2019s popular with the \u2018fast\u2019 bunch in London. Even when her husband was alive, she lived her life as she saw fit. But now, she has a whim to check out her \u2018dearly departed\u2019 husband\u2019s ancestral home. Belfield Hall becomes alive with the servants preparing for her arrival. Lady Beatrice, as she\u2019s called, arrives soon enough, bringing with her Sophie\u2019s happiness and downfall, both.Beatrice brings with her the so-called sophistication of London living, and more than a few of her \u2018male friends\u2019 come visit her during the stay. Needless to say, Beatrice cares zero about what her MIL thinks. But it was not even her who was responsible of Sophie\u2019s sexual awakening. Beatrice\u2019s lady\u2019s maid, whom I think was more than a lady\u2019s maid, first targets Sophie because of her youthful beauty. This woman was definitely taking advantage of her. There was some F/F stuff here that I skipped because I\u2019m never turned on by these scenes. Yet I also knew how much gullible yet curious Sophie was. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was the right way for a na\u00efve girl to have her first sexual encounter. Sophie wanted to know more about the \u2018forbidden\u2019 and was unable the proverbial siren\u2019s call. Beatrice, of course, knew about it as the whole thing was the part of a bigger, more nefarious plan.Soon enough, Sophie is snared into Beatrice\u2019s \u2018black-hole\u2019 (pun intended, I hate this b!tch with the same passion the Duke hated Ashley or Ash). Her glamorous looks, dresses and sophisticated ways, along with her lies, convinces Sophie that she\u2019s her salvation, the way out of Bellfield Hall. I wouldn\u2019t call this greed on Sophie\u2019s part cause if you read, you\u2019ll know how tough her life was with very little pay. And Sophie was beautiful. She was made to believe that she can be one of those dancing girls and live better if she has the right kind of \u2018training and polish\u2019 to go with it. I was mad, knowing all of these were a lies that Beatrice told her, yet Sophie was ensnared. Beatrice starts \u2018training\u2019 Sophie on pleasuring men. Sophie has previously, merely by chance, spied on Beatrice in action and was intrigued. I skimmed through this part as well, fuming at what was to come next...Soon enough, Beatrice starts making demands of Sophie. By now, Belfield Hall was abuzz with the news of Lord Ashley\u2019s arrival. It happened that he was detained somewhere and couldn\u2019t visit to take over his newly acquired responsibilities as the Duke of Belfield. Beatrice tells Sophie that she has a plan, and for that she needs Sophie\u2019s help. You see, Beatrice wants to marry the Duke. But before that, she wants to \u2018gift\u2019 Sophie\u2019s virginity to Ash (as Beatrice calls him)... well, you can say, it would be a way to improve Ash\u2019s interest in the matter. In return, she\u2019ll help Sophie with a job in London. Sophie, at first, isn\u2019t sure of it but it doesn\u2019t take Beatrice long to convince her that it\u2019s the best for everyone concerned. Sophie will do it for the woman she has unintentionally begun to worship, or so it seemed to me. Sophie thought she\u2019s helping out a good \u2018friend\u2019. Well, far from it girl!I would always remember the first time Sophie set eyes on Lord Ashley at his arrival and had the shock of her life. No wonder he never replied to her letters! No wonder he doesn\u2019t remember her! The shock begins setting in as Sophie stares ather Mr. Maldon! At first, Sophie spies on him from afar, not knowing what he\u2019s reaction might be. Then, he sees her too, and remembers the little girl he helped couple of years ago.After this, Sophie is entirely unsure of her \u2018role\u2019 as a seductress. Before, she didn\u2019t know who it was. Whoring herself didn\u2019t seem all that bad in exchange of her freedom. But now, she just can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s Mr. Maldon; the man she\u2019s idolized, craved for so many years. The man she\u2019s fallen in love with while writing those letters. The man she thought she wants to be with when the time comes. I believed in her longing for Ash because Sophie was loyal if not anything else, and Ash had her unfailing loyalty since the day he helped her when no one else did.Beatrice, of course, won\u2019t hear of it. Her real face begins emerging right away when Sophie declines to help. The b!tch, this time, resorts to blackmailing, forcing Sophie to get on with their \u2018plan\u2019. She also drugs Sophie so that she doesn\u2019t back off. But the plan itself backfires. It seems Ash held Beatrice in contempt. He\u2019s mad when he finds Sophie in this state, but her innocent yet seductive charms doesn\u2019t escape his notice. I believed in what Sophie was feeling at that time- that she wanted to be in his bed, no matter what he thought of her. But Ash would never take advantage of her. I loved Ash\u2019s venomous reply to Beatrice\u2019s revolting plan, where she very nonchalantly brushed off any wrongdoing in the whole thing. She wants to marry the new Duke to continue with her luxurious and debauched lifestyle. So what if she was using some nobody to get to her target? No harm done!At this point, I begin to believe that Ash remembered more about Sophie than he let on. There was some darker element in him that he had closeted away. It was also very apparent that he was attracted to Sophie, especially seeing her half-naked and so ready for him. I was never really sure of Sophie and Ash\u2019s age difference but I believe it was around 8 years, Sophie being 17 at the time. Ash becomes protective of Sophie, sending Beatrice right off to the rat-hole she emerged from. But Beatrice promises vengeance. Because she couldn\u2019t convince Ash to marry her, she won\u2019t let them be in peace. And it\u2019s all Sophie\u2019s fault!Knowing how she was used by a viper, Sophie is overcome with shame. She also can\u2019t deny that she wants Ash. So after a while, because of Sophie\u2019s willingness, Ash gives into her. Yet, it was plain that she gave him the kind of solace that Ash never ever had. The first sex scene was... different and Ash\u2019s preference to bondage came into light. Sophie, of course, had no idea about it but she instinctively trusted him to guide her through her first experience. She\u2019s curious as to why he won\u2019t let her touch or kiss him but she\u2019s happy to be with him finally. Ash gradually begins opening up about his plans for the Belfield Hall and his other business ventures but he never confides to her about his past.Sophie secretly begins living as Ash\u2019s mistress, knowing she\u2019d never really be anything else. Their match is too uneven and the society gossip will be cruel. Ash wants to keep her with him as long as he can, yet Sophie wants her freedom. She still wants to go to London but her wishes never meet his approval. Because of this, one day, she runs to London in search of her dream.Her life as a dancing girl wasn\u2019t quite what Sophie hoped for. For one, she really didn\u2019t have any security whatsoever, every male around thinking she\u2019s fair game. Still, she liked the freedom of living on her own. Once she sees Ash, who was mad to find her showing herself off to the world. Sophie runs from him again. She changes job too. Later, she meets this girl, who becomes her friend. But this girl was in trouble already as her a$$hole of a boyfriend was abusive and a petty criminal. Soon the girl gets caught up in her own mire. She becomes, what seems like, a drug addict and was ruthlessly used by that creep. One day, she begs for help from Sophie but it was too late. She ran and her \u2018loving boyfriend\u2019 was searching for her. The girls had no option but to escape. I felt that Ash has always kept tab on Sophie, so it was no wonder he finds them and takes them to his home.At Ash\u2019s residence, Sophie tries to find some balance. Even though she fails to help her friend in the end, who disappears finally, God knows where, Sophie is reunited with Ash, who is ever more determined to keep her. He opens up about his time in Germany, and some nightmare-ish memories of being abused. The reason why he needs to be in control, both in and out of bed. It seemed somehow he\u2019s also addicted to bondage and can\u2019t do without it. I didn\u2019t like knowing it all but it was apparent that Ash wanted to forget his nightmares and ONLY Sophie can help him. It has always been her, once as the form of letters, now in flesh and bone. Sophie feels his pain as if her own and begins considering becoming his mistress again. She loves him, she\u2019d do anything to help. When they become lovers again Ash promises to take care of her, but Sophie knows nothing is going to make their situation better. She\u2019ll always want what she can\u2019t have; to become an integral part of Ash\u2019s life. No matter how private Ash tries to keep it, as a Duke, his association with a former dancing girl catches the media attention. Then one day, Beatrice comes knocking at the door, spewing more filth. She blackmails Sophie, who, again, walks into her trap. Beatrice tempts her to an orgy but Sophie declines. When her attempt to corrupt Sophie beyond hope fails, Beatrice strikes with the ultimate jibe... The fact that once Ash and she were lovers.Nothing could\u2019ve prepared Sophie for this. She couldn\u2019t endure this, neither could I. Sophie felt horribly betrayed, that Ash never told her about Beatrice. When she confronts Ash about it, hoping against hope that it was another of Beatrice\u2019s lies, her world crashes down on her again. Ash doesn\u2019t deny it, though he emphasizes it was a mistake. But Sophie couldn\u2019t deal with it. She runs once again, from all the hurt and misery, from Ash and maybe, from herself.With her prior experience as a dancing girl, Sophie finds another job. After her training as a singer, she also begins to garner attention from people with her performance. Her status improves from a mere dancing girl to a performing artist, who is invited to sing in much bigger, better events. She hasn\u2019t heard from Ash but from the newspaper she knew that he\u2019s engaged to be married to some heiress. Sophie\u2019s heart is broken but such is her life now. One day, while performing at a posh club, Sophie finds Ash present with his fianc\u00e9e and her family. Out of sheer despair, Sophie starts singing \u2018All I Want is You\u2019, her rapt attention all the while on him. People begin whispering and the song ends, Sophie runs at the dressing room. But Ash follows her there. It was very much apparent that Ash was still keeping tab on Sophie\u2019s life, and came to see her performance. The hot and intense sex scene that followed in the dressing room... wow! I think that was the hottest sex scene in the whole story! The intensity was just about perfect, even though the ending of this story wasn\u2019t.When both are inevitably found out, Ash\u2019s fianc\u00e9e leaves in a huff. I should\u2019ve felt bad for her but I could see that they had nothing in common. It was a match made for business purposes between Ash and the girl\u2019s rich American father. Knowing Ash and Sophie\u2019s history, I knew that the girl didn\u2019t even have a chance against that explosive chemistry and a love that created a bond, making these two returning to each-other over and over again. But Sophie still knew that if Ash has to survive in this world, he needs to marry someone of his own stature. She can\u2019t be his downfall as media once again goes frenzy with gossip.In the end, Sophie returns to the place where her and Ash\u2019s story started, to visit her mother\u2019s grave. Sophie has seen to it that her mother has an identity in the form of a nice headstone, now that she has the means. I think Ash also had a hand behind the care of the grave site. When she and Ash meet again, Sophie declines Ash\u2019s offer to reunite with him. She wants to have her own adventure and see the world! This time, Ash bids her goodbye. Personally, I was quite flabbergasted at that cause I, myself, wasn\u2019t prepared to say goodbye yet.No, this story doesn\u2019t have an HEA but I know I cried the last half of it even when I didn\u2019t want to. It emotionally exhausted me. I wanted Sophie and Ash to be together so badly hat if I didn\u2019t know about a sequel, I\u2019d be really very mad. I\u2019ll be looking forward to the sequel, Breathless for You, in hopes to see them finally together. 4.25 stars but easily could\u2019ve been a 5 stars read.

Stai con me.\u00bb\nSophie Davis \u00e8 rimasta sola al mondo... la madre \u00e8 morta improvvisamente e il padre non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 tornato dalla guerra. Quello che la tiene in vita e al sicuro \u00e8 la promessa di Mr. Maldon. Un uomo che durante gli ultimi istanti di vita di sua madre si \u00e8 comportato con lei in maniera protettiva e affettuosa, promettendole un posto sicuro e un lavoro dignitoso che la aiuti a vivere. Inizia cos\u00ec la nuova vita di Sophie, cameriera a Belfield Hall, una tenuta di propriet\u00e0 di un duca. La vita alla tenuta si rivela abbastanza ardua, Sophie non viene tenuta molto in considerazione dal resto della servit\u00f9 ma nonostante ci\u00f2 stringe una sincera amicizia con la giovane Nell. L'unica cosa che la spinge a stringere i denti e ad andare avanti \u00e8 la relazione epistolare che intrattiene con Mr Maldon, mantenendo cos\u00ec la promessa fatta anni prima. Le sue lettere sono sempre affettuose e raccontano la vita alla tenuta, le sue nuove manzioni e i suoi pensieri. Ma la giovane Sophie ha anche una vera e propria passione: il ballo. Durante le feste organizzate dalla duchessa si ritrova a guardare sognante la vita di quelle persone ricche e facoltose e mentre il giradischi suona le canzoni pi\u00f9 famose, si ritrova a ballare i passi ispirati dalla musica e a cantarne i motivetti. Ma un giorno dal fronte arriva la notizia della morte di lord Charwoold e l'intera Belfield Hall si veste a lutto, il duca e la moglie sono inconsolabili, anche perch\u00e8 il loro figlio era l'unico erede del ducato e la sua morte rimette tutto in gioco. Ben presto si scopre che il fratello del duca ha avuto un figlio: il giovane lord Edwin, un ragazzino totalmente inconsapevole del ruolo che ha ereditato, ruolo che ahim\u00e8 lo porta ad una morte precoce. Passato il periodo di lutto, Belfield Hall, riapre i suoi salotti alle feste e al divertimento. Tra i nuovi arrivi c'\u00e8 Lady Beatrice, la vedova del defunto Lord Charwoold, che contro ogni buon senso non sembra essere minimamente toccata dal lutto, anzi intrattiene incontri sessuali nelle sue stanze private. Ed \u00e8 proprio ad uno di questi incontri che Sophie si ritrova inconsapevolmente spettatrice furtiva. La ragazza, nuova a questo genere di vita, si ritrova ammaliata da Lady Beatrice: adora i suoi vestiti, il suo stile di vita e vede in lei l'occasione perfetta per fuggire dalla vita a Belfield Hall e far avverare il suo sogno di diventare una ballerina di fila. Ma i piani di Lady Beatrice non sono del tutto onesti e caritatevoli, perch\u00e8 da quando \u00e8 rimasta vedova, l'unica cosa che desidera \u00e8 accalappiare il nuovo duca in un matrimonio. In tutto questo Sophie ha un ruolo quasi chiave, istruita a dovere da Lady Beatrice, l'innocente Sophie viene catapultata in un mondo fatto di lussuria ed erotismo solo con lo scopo di diventare un regalo prezioso per il nuovo duca. Col passare dei giorni anche la salute del vecchio duca di Belfield si aggrava e in pochi giorni muore, affrettando cos\u00ec la nomina del successore, che in poche settimane arriva alla tenuta. L'arrivo del nuovo duca si riveler\u00e0 parecchio interessante soprattutto per Sophie... che si ritrover\u00e0 davanti proprio l'ultima persona da lei immaginata. Come si metteranno le cosa da quel momento in avanti? Riuscir\u00e0 Sophie a lasciare la strettissima Belfields Hall e diventare la ballerina che ha sempre sognato d'essere?\n\u00abAsh \u00e8 una follia, \u00e8 sempre stata una follia. Io non vado bene per te, non vado bene affatto... tu hai tutto quello che desideri, hai la tua ereditiera. Vuoi deciderti a lasciarmi in pace, per l\u2019amor del cielo?\u00bbLui mi baciava sempre pi\u00f9 forte. Senza gentilezza, senza tenerezza, era un bacio di possesso. \u00abT u sei mia\u00bb, disse con lo sguardo stralunato.\nE' la prima volta che sono davvero contenta di aver fatto un errore di lettura... aver letto prima il 2\u00b0 volume e poi il 1\u00b0 mi ha risparmiato settimane e settimane di anatemi alla scrittrice... come si pu\u00f2 concludere un libro in questo modo? Un finale apertissimo che ti fa pensare a qualsiasi cosa... dalla pi\u00f9 assurda alla pi\u00f9 catastrofica... ok c'\u00e8 stato una specie di riscatto morale e sociale per la protagonista, anche se inconcludente ai fini della storia ma avrei preferito diversamente... magari qualcosa che lasciasse un po' meno quel retrogusto amaro che i finali aperti irrimediabilmente lasciano. Ho trovato l'intera lettura abbastanza inconcludente e a tratti noiosetta e scontata... ho apprezzato di pi\u00f9 il 2\u00b0 volume, pi\u00f9 completo e dettagliato a mio parere. Anche nelle scene erotiche ho trovato una differenza sostanziale, alcune mi sono sembrate quasi forzate. Il suo legarla e bendarla mi riporta al moderno Christian Grey che come Ash non voleva essere toccato per via del suo passato tormentato, solo che qui abbiamo pure il lato visivo a rincarare la dose, si pu\u00f2 trattare il tema della sottomessa e del dominatore anche discostandosi da alcuni clich\u00e8... mi meraviglio come quelle poche recensioni che ho letto non abbiano accennato a questo piccolo ma significante requesito, visto che ormai quello di paragonare le sfumature della James \u00e8 diventato un vero e proprio must.Altra cosa che ho trovato un po' paradossale \u00e8 la totale incoerenza di Sophie... ama Mr Maldon... sogna una vita con lui... per\u00f2 appena scopre chi \u00e8 scappa... ma ovviamente dopo essersi concessa... se non ti reputi all'altezza di un duca dovresti mantenere la coerenza di non averci niente a che fare a priori... invece lei parla di amore... gli si riconcede e alla prima turbolenza lo riabbandona... per non parlare delle cavolate che combina nel frattempo... Se avessi letto questo per prima non avrei nemmeno pensato di aprire il 2 volume... perch\u00e8 \u00e8 come se fosse stato scritto da 2 persone diverse... di solito con i seguiti ti ritrovi a dire eeeh il rpimo amore non si scorda mai... forse si faceva prima a lasciare tutto come stava, ma con \"Tu sei mia\" posso dire benedetto sia il seguito... e conoscendo l'epilogo della storia tra Ash e Sophie viene da chiedersi... non poteva fare un epilogo e chiudere li la storia? Tanto a conti fatti il loro epilogo \u00e8 stato inserito sempre in un epilogo.I vari personaggi visti singolarmente lasciano un po' a desiderare... e ci si ritrova a trovare il villain, e cio\u00e8 Lady Beatrice, quasi pi\u00f9 strutturato del personaggio principale, per lo meno a carattere \u00e8 pi\u00f9 decisa e coerente con quello che fa e dimostra d'essere. Sophie invece vuole essere una donna emancipata e di carattere fiero, ma sono pi\u00f9 le volte che cede all'incoerenza che quelle in cui sostiene le battaglie che vuole combattere... dice una cosa e nel rigo dopo fa l'esatto opposto... portando chi legge a chiudere e a fare qualcos'altro... Ash cerca di apparire come il principe azzurro della favola, salva la madre della ragazzina le promette una vita decente ma alla fine si rivela una copia mal riuscita. Altra enorme delusione!Vado a concludere, anche se ci sarebbe dell'altro da aggiungere... ma lascio a voi il giudizio finale... che fortunatamente non sempre coincide con quello personale. A mio modesto parere 2 stelline e 1/2 \u00e8 quanto di pi\u00f9 coerente io possa assegnare per questo romanzo che tanto promette e poco mantiene."}, {"userName": "Miraphora", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7108760-miraphora", "userReview": "Sono molto indecisa su che giudizio dare a questo romanzo.Prima, durante, dopo la lettura continuo ad oscillare tra il bello e il brutto, tra il mi piace e il non ne sono convinta. E' un continuo cambiare idea, un continuo leggere pareri opposti.Iniziamo subito dalla pubblicit\u00e0 fatta dall'editore. Si pu\u00f2 paragonare un romanzo alle 50 Sfumature e a Downton Abbey assieme? Si pu\u00f2 dare un titolo cos\u00ec in linea con il filone erotico come Tu sei mia anche se il titolo originale \u00e8 All I want is you, titolo della canzone che gioca un ruolo importante nella storia e che regala un romanticismo struggente, platonico e per niente scontato al romanzo? Si pu\u00f2 sfornare un libro con una copertina cos\u00ec bella, un titolo cos\u00ec pacchiano e una fascetta cos\u00ec contrastante?E' un miscuglio di generi, di richiami, di aspettative troppo diverse che difficilmente posso convivere pacificamente in un solo libro. Pubblicit\u00e0 a parte, un romanzo lo si sceglie per ci\u00f2 che ci attira, per quello che vorremmo leggere, cos\u00ec mi sono lasciata incuriosire dal periodo storico e dalla trama, dimenticando il titolo e tutto il gran parlare che i siti di romance ne hanno fatto (con conseguenti pareri negativi dalle lettrici del genere). Ci vuole un palato meno selettivo per apprezzare questo romanzo, ci vuole una mente aperta alla narrativa che strizza l'occhio ai grandi amori letterari, quelli difficili, impossibili, struggenti. Bisogna essere lettori, non lettrici di romance.Quindi chiunque decida di avvicinarsi a Tu sei mia deve cancellare dalla mente il richiamo Fifty Shades altrimenti non c'\u00e8 speranza. Ma proprio nessuna.E' chiaro che ho avuto la sfortuna di leggere alcuni commenti non proprio felici che mi hanno un po' frenata e che mi hanno fatto lasciare il libro nel mobile, restia a sorbirmi una delusione e delusa in partenza per lo scarso entusiasmo dei lettori. Per\u00f2 preso un impegno lo porto sempre a termine e devo dire che chi la dura la vince, sul serio.La Anthony \u00e8 una scrittrice che si prende il suo tempo e che ha concentrato la maggior parte dei suoi sforzi sul personaggio di Sophie, protagonista unica, e tanti saluti all'idea di avere un eroe che travolga Sophie, storia e lettrice. Il lavoro fatto dall'autrice \u00e8 di fino perch\u00e9 prende il suo personaggio in tenera et\u00e0 e ci racconta senza fretta alcuni episodi della sua vita, cruciali o meno, che formano la base della storia, del personaggio e del romanzo stesso. Sophie prende vita con tutta calma, bimbetta felice prima, sguattera sola e ingenua, ragazzina facilmente influenzabile, e infine giovane donna libera e forte, resistente e innamorata della vita. Con tutti i suoi difetti, con tutti i suoi limiti, Sophie \u00e8 un personaggio che riesce a suscitare tenerezza perch\u00e9 mantiene una visione idealizzata dell'amore, infantile, totalizzante, che la obbliga a compiere scelte estreme e che le fa subire situazioni difficili, malumori, cattiverie, malignit\u00e0, come se riuscisse a vedere la luce oltre il buio. E' un amore dell'altro mondo quello che prova per il suo Mr. Maldon, salvatore e confidente, tentatore e amante, un uomo che riesce a rimanere sulle sue in ogni occasione, cedendo poco di s\u00e9 e ottenendo tutto (o quasi) da Sophie.Ash non ha niente dei personaggi simili a Mr.Grey, \u00e8 troppo fine, troppo beneducato anche nei suoi momenti pi\u00f9 rudi e non ha mai la tentazione di usare le sue debolezze e il suo passato come giustificazione per il suo comportamento. Ash \u00e8 riservato, ma non si nasconde, non gioca al tira e molla e mette subito in chiaro cosa vuole e come lo vuole. Sophie \u00e8 costretta ogni volta a fare una scelta estrema: stare con lui e alle sue regole, o lasciarlo e cambiare vita.La breve quanto tormentata storia d'amore si svolge in poco tempo ma non si fa mancare veramente nulla: dall'intrigo della nobile e corrotta duchessa alla prima fuga di Sophie, poi si passa ad un periodo di lontananza con la riconciliazione burrascosa, seguita da un breve periodo felice per concludere il romanzo con la separazione finale ma mai - in tutta onest\u00e0 - ho pensato che mancasse qualcosa tanto brava \u00e8 stata l'autrice a ricreare un periodo storico oscuro e difficile come quello dei primi anni del '900.E' curioso, comunque, che buona parte del libro non sia per nulla dedicata alla contorta storia d'amore tra i due personaggi, e che sia la crescita di Sophie a farla da padrone - tanto che ad un certo punto ci si chiede cosa stia succedendo. Di erotico, di morboso e dominante, di frustini, regole e bavagli non c'\u00e8 traccia, come non c'\u00e8 traccia di una sessualit\u00e0 fine a se stessa perch\u00e9 tutto ha come scopo quello di raccontare una storia d'amore difficile, lunga, con alti e bassi e con un finale che \u00e8 tutto tranne che romantico.Personalmente ho apprezzato in parte la scelta della Anthony di chiudere la storia in questo modo ma solo perch\u00e9 sono una seguace del finale felice anche se non necessariamente happy. Per\u00f2 rispetto la chiusura - difficile - di una storia difficile, non poteva finire diversamente.Il mio voto finale \u00e8 piuttosto alto a dispetto dei pareri contrastanti che ho letto online e devo dire che preso con la dovuta calma e con il giusto stato mentale Tu sei mia/All I want is you \u00e8 un romanzo capace di dare molto e di ricreare lo sfarzo della nobilt\u00e0 nelle bellissime campagne inglesi, la passione travolgente di un amore quasi impossibile e la lotta di Sophie verso la libert\u00e0 di vivere, di amare, di sperare.A volte un romanzo va capito, va ascoltato e non preso brutalmente di petto. L'effetto non sar\u00e0 lo stesso."}, {"userName": "Lynne M", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68421111-lynne-m", "userReview": "I'm not sure how I feel about this book, so I went back and forth with what number of stars to give it.

Reconozco que la historia de amor resulta demasiado t\u00edpica y, adem\u00e1s, la pareja protagonista me ha crispado los nervios m\u00e1s de lo que me gustar\u00eda. Pese a todo, Elizabeth Anthony sigue siendo una de mis autoras favoritas.Sophie apenas ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os cuando empez\u00f3 a trabajar en Belfield Hall. Un misterioso arist\u00f3crata, la socorri\u00f3 cuando el resto del mundo ignoraba su existencia. Tras la muerte de su madre, el se\u00f1or Maldon consigui\u00f3 que la contrataran como criada en la misma mansi\u00f3n en la que hab\u00edan arruinado la reputaci\u00f3n de su madre. Desde entonces, Sophie le escribe cartas que \u00e9l solo contesta al principio. En cierto modo, la historia de Sophie y el se\u00f1or Maldon parece una especie de versi\u00f3n er\u00f3tica de la novela Pap\u00e1 Piernaslargas. Con el paso de los a\u00f1os, Sophie descubrir\u00e1 que est\u00e1 enamorada de su querido benefactor, lo que har\u00e1 que se sienta dichosa y miserable a la vez. Durante casi el primer tercio de la novela, Sophie narrar\u00e1 en primera persona c\u00f3mo fue su infancia y adolescencia, trabajando como criada para los odiosos y anticuados duques de Belfield Hall. Su situaci\u00f3n resulta cada vez m\u00e1s lamentable y desesperada, puesto que el resto del servicio la menosprecia continuamente. Todos menos la se\u00f1ora Burdett, que siempre ha cuidado de ella tal y como le prometi\u00f3 el se\u00f1or Maldon. Y con el paso de los a\u00f1os, Sophie recibir\u00e1 con los brazos abiertos su propio despertar sexual, a pesar de la distancia que la separa del hombre al que ama.No obstante, su suerte cambiar\u00e1 tras la llegada de Lady Beatrice, viuda de lord Charlwood. Sin saber que esa decisi\u00f3n pondr\u00e1 su vida patas arriba, Sophie se convertir\u00e1 en su camarera. En un principio, Sophie idolatra a Beatrice de un modo casi vomitivo, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que la viuda es una persona detestable. Pero Sophie parece no darse cuenta de que su nueva se\u00f1ora es la maldad hecha carne. De hecho, Beatrice planea usar a su camarera para cazar al soltero m\u00e1s codiciado, el heredero del t\u00edtulo y de todas las propiedades de los Belfield. A cambio, le promete ayudarla a cumplir su sue\u00f1o de convertirse en bailarina en Londres.Sinceramente, Sophie me ha parecido una protagonista bien construida que evoluciona a lo largo de toda la historia. Pero durante esta etapa de servilismo interesado, reconozco que me ha sacado de mis casillas en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n. Sophie est\u00e1 dispuesta a todo, incluso a vender su cuerpo, para convertirse en bailarina y dejar atr\u00e1s su vida como criada. Y aunque es incapaz de olvidar sus ra\u00edces, en ocasiones se comporta de un modo despreciable que no he llegado a comprender. De vez en cuando, me he sentido inc\u00f3moda con ella, porque da la impresi\u00f3n de que mira por encima del hombro al servicio.Finalmente, Lord Ashley aparece en la mansi\u00f3n. Y cu\u00e1l no ser\u00e1 la sorpresa de Sophie al darse cuenta de que ella y Ash ya se conoc\u00edan. O al menos, eso cre\u00eda ella. Sophie pensaba que Ash era un caballero de buen coraz\u00f3n, pero el resto del mundo se empe\u00f1a en recordarle que el futuro duque posee un lado oscuro. Todo el mundo le considera un advenedizo fr\u00edo, rico y despiadado. Sin embargo, los sentimientos de Sophie se han ido cocinando a fuego lento, lent\u00edsimo. (No olvidemos que Ash tarda pr\u00e1cticamente media novela en hacer acto de presencia). De modo que no har\u00e1 caso de las habladur\u00edas y se entregar\u00e1 sin reservas a un amor apasionado.Pronto descubrir\u00e1 que lord Ash es, en realidad, un hombre atormentado por el pasado. Un amante insaciable que no soporta perder el control bajo ninguna circunstancia. Siempre que se acuesta con una mujer, Ash la ata de manos y le venda los ojos. Pero eso es todo, no esper\u00e9is una dosis de juegos perversos de alcoba, por mucho que a Sophie le asuste el \u00edmpetu de su caballero. Lord Ash resulta bastante m\u00e1s tradicional de lo que cabr\u00eda esperar, quiz\u00e1 demasiado. Por otro lado, es un protagonista que se odia a s\u00ed mismo. Por esa raz\u00f3n, el motivo por el que Ash necesita a Sophie me ha parecido muy dulce y emotivo. Totalmente humano. En general, me ha parecido una novela er\u00f3tica muy cl\u00e1sica y sobrecargada de viejos clich\u00e9s. Las circunstancias que unen a esta pareja resultan demasiado forzadas la mayor parte del tiempo, hasta el punto de que el propio Ash esp\u00eda a la mujer para saber d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 en todo momento y as\u00ed poder protegerla. Un detalle que no me ha gustado nada, y no es el \u00fanico de mi lista. Como era de esperar, Ash se comporta muchas veces como un aut\u00e9ntico capullo.Del mismo modo, la devoci\u00f3n casi enfermiza que Sophie siente por Ash los separa continuamente. Algo que no acabo de comprender, porque \u00bfc\u00f3mo puedes perjudicar la reputaci\u00f3n de un hombre que ya es odiado por todo el mundo? Realmente, tampoco tienen motivos para desconfiar el uno del otro, pero se pasan toda la novela enfadados solo para poder reconciliarse. Por lo que alguna de sus conversaciones resultan aburridas y ligeramente ofensivas.A su favor, dir\u00e9 que por m\u00e1s predecibles que sean los momentos rom\u00e1nticos, me han emocionado en la misma medida que si fueran totalmente espont\u00e1neos. Y que el erotismo de esta mujer es tan elegante que me ha enamorado sin remedio, una vez m\u00e1s. Por cierto, no se trata de una novela autoconclusiva, ya que la historia de Sophie y Ash contin\u00faa en la siguiente novela: Sin aliento por ti."}, {"userName": "Elisa Vangelisti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53690840-elisa-vangelisti", "userReview": "Non ce la posso fare: 34 pagine di pura noia.

No remuneration was exchanged and all opinion presented herein is my own except as noted.One thing I liked about this book was how the Sophie\u2019s (the main female character) voice changes as she matures. I also like how the relationship between the \u201chero.\u201d Ash and Sophie develops right before the end.Even so, Sophie, a poor, 13 year-old sent to the big house to go into service when she is left alone in the world. She picks up too much sophistication in a short time. And, the drawing of Sophie\u2019s character doesn\u2019t really fit the character as far as social status and education. The characters are just sketches \u2014 like a black and white drawing you might see from the period World War I and immediately after without a stylized facial feature but nothing really substantial that says \u201cThis is what Sophie\u2019s about.\u201d The story is full of stereotypical characters pulled directly from Downton Abbey, Gosford Park, and Upstairs/Downstairs. Downton Abbey called they want their creepy footman back. There\u2019s even a sadistic German female prison guard whose placement is as a \u201cdominatrix ex machina\u201d for explaining away part of Ash\u2019s character. And, some aspects of the characters just aren\u2019t explained at all. But my point is, if you\u2019s watched much Masterpiece theater or Agatha Christie style murder mysteries you\u2019ve seen everyone in this book.Just about every plot device that\u2019s been paraded out the past couple of years is found in this book. Some are combined with different characters than the Downton Abbey plots of the past few years but they\u2019re all there: dead heirs, marrying for money, creepy footmen, philandering counts humping the help, rich men corrupting naive women.It is true that all the themes used: sweeping change, new freedoms, horrible losses in the first modern war, modernizations, the rise of the middle class, jazz: all those things were happening. There\u2019s a lot going on on which to hang a plot. But, wait there\u2019s more \u2014 there\u2019s a reason they say it\u2019s great for fans of Downton AND Fifty Shades. It involves lengths of cloth and learning to tie knots. There is one thing I had not personally read lately: corruption of the simple, innocent maid by the naughty young widow \u2014 a little f/f experimentation.It\u2019s full of highs and lows \u2014 very dramatic highs and lows. Well, at the time, there was no social welfare so falling through the cracks was more likely than not. Therefore the lows would be extreme. And, no one reads a book where happiness lasts, right?I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s about the girl\u2019s job in service, her coming of age, her sacrifices, or even about what she reads in the books she \u201cborrows\u201d from the Duke\u2019s library. They must be brilliant because she goes from a country scullery maid to a sophisticated jazz baby in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail. But it\u2019s not about those things. Granted she does make a sacrifice, but what I really felt the story detailed was the seamy, seedy nature of all but a couple characters. And, that bugged me and made the read unpleasant for me. Even the main character, essentially good, is without enough moral fortitude and ultimately falls. About the only nice female is the housekeeper. Every where Sophie turns is like a pit of snakes. And, of course, no one likes her because first she\u2019s innocent, then she\u2019s too good at her job, then she\u2019s not good enough. Boo Hoo.There\u2019s a lot of intimacy, but while it\u2019s hot and dirty stuff it doesn\u2019t get too detailed -- there\u2019s a lot of \u201csecret place\u201d references and spilling seed. In the end it just gets sort of boring. There is one rather nice, loving scene.But in the end, I had to force myself to read the book. Just not my cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2555689-laura", "userReview": "I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.I won\u2019t lie; seeing a Downton Abbey named-dropped in the blurb is what made me pick this up, even if I was a little wary of the Fifty Shades of Grey comparison. Still, I do enjoy erotica, and I thought something set in early 20th century would be intriguing. I thought, after reading the description, that this sounded like it would be a nice mix of historical romance and what I\u2019ve deemed \u201csmart smut\u201d or \u201cliterary erotica\u201d (e.g. Tiffany Riesz). To say that I was disappointed is a bit of an understatement.The major issue with this book is that I was actually enjoying it in the beginning. I read an eARC, so I\u2019m not really sure how far into it I got when it went downhill; my guess is near the halfway point. I liked Sophie in the beginning, even if she was hopelessly naive. She was sweet and genuine. Ash, on the other hand, was incredibly underdeveloped. I think it was near halfway before he appeared in any capacity that gave clues to his personality. Most of the book he remained an enigma, and not in a pleasant way. I think this is probably what makes the book comparable to Fifty Shades. Ash has some serious emotional issues, similar to those of Christian Grey. Luckily, he\u2019s more rational and less demanding, which makes him more likable.All in all, my disappointment wasn\u2019t really with the characters. I wanted more from Ash\u2019s character, and I felt Sophie did things that were downright out of character later in the book. The biggest problem, however, was the fact that it felt like reading two completely different books. I get why this was compared to Downton. It\u2019s set in the same time period, it has a little of the Upstairs, Downstairs feel that Downton has. I think one of the failings is that Anthony tries make too much happen in one novel. This easily could have been crafted and turned into a series that, no doubt, would have been eaten up. She didn\u2019t do that though. She wrote it all in one novel, and it comes off unbalanced. The Sophie at the beginning of the book doesn\u2019t match the one at the end. It might be argued this is due to her relationship with Lord Ashley, but I just don\u2019t buy that. I don\u2019t buy that he changed her that much. What turned me from disappointed to angry was the ending. View Spoiler \u00bb It made the whole experience feel like a huge waste of time, and that\u2019s never a good feeling upon finishing a book.The thing is, negative reviews are pretty rare from me. If I don\u2019t like something, I don\u2019t waste my time trying to drag through it. There are too many good books for me to waste my time reading something I\u2019m not enjoying. That\u2019s what makes reading a book like this so awful and hard. I may not have enjoyed it as much as I hoped, but there were good moments. There were good plot points and great elements. They just didn\u2019t add up correctly. Still, I held on. Because of the good things, I held on in hopes of a good conclusion. That\u2019s probably why the ending felt like a slap in the face. Even if it was realistic, it wasn\u2019t delivered correctly. I wasn\u2019t ready for it, and that made me mad."}, {"userName": "Floriana Amoruso", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19449336-floriana-amoruso", "userReview": "http://labibliotecadellibraio.blogspo...\"Ho imparato che quando l'amore arriva - l'amore fisico, il desiderio fisico - le regola normali dell'esistenza si devono arrendere.
