It pains me to give this work only 2 stars as I know the value it truly brings to highlighting apartheid in South Africa when it needed more attention. Perhaps because I read this when I was still fairly young, I couldn't connect with it. As a younger reader, I often struggled with themes around depression, war, slavery and human rights. I couldn't fathom not treating people equally and fairly, and struggled to read the stories. Might be that I didn't want to feel those emotions or I didn't know how to at the time. With this work, the language, the theme and the overall setting was so unfamiliar to me, I thought it wasn't doing justice to the story and the cause. It was meant for an older audience, and probably if I went back to read it now, I'd like it more. It's interesting to think about how you'd change ratings for books and plays as you age, hence why on my blog, I've created the \"what age to read which book by genre\" series... to help ensure books receive the best possible attention when being read. That said, I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this as it wasn't bad; it just fell too flat for me. I suppose the characters were meant to feel like templates... archetypes as opposed to real people suffering... in order to show how this was happening all over in many respects, shapes and forms. In the end, it was work to read it, and when that happens, which is rare, I have to give a lower rating.Anyone read this who felt differently? What did I miss?\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

There is no \"action\" per se, all the dialogue takes place in one setting, the St. George's Park Tea Room, and is spoken by only three characters - two adult black men (Sam and Willie) who work at the tea room and the white seventeen-year-old son of the owner (Hally/Master Harold). It's 1950, and the relationship between the boy and the two men is impressively complicated. They, especially Sam, are the fathers he grew up with but also the \"boys\" of the play. Hally's own father is a cripple and a drunk, but Hally ends up directing all his anger onto Sam by the end of the play, changing forever the nature of their bond. He is an awful boy, lacking in compassion but deserving ours because we understand what has perverted his heart. What a sorrowful drama."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4752297-kirsten", "userReview": "The impact of this play on me was so much more than expected. I was assigned to read this for English class, so of course I assumed this play would be just another unimportant, mandatory reading assignment. It was so much more than that. This play, set in South Africa during 1950, shows the raw, ugly truth of racism. That it is not just a word which means discrimination against a particular race, it is a thing that breaks friends, families, and societies apart. Hally, a young white man who struggles with a failing relationship with his family, forms friendships with two black servants, Sam and Willie, who are employed by his mother. As the play progresses one starts to question how anyone, could say such horrible things to another human being, and feel they have justification in saying it. This play portrays a harsh reality of how things were, and I would recommend it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Camryn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27165254-camryn", "userReview": "I feel like this is another one of those books that teaches white people about racism. It wasn\u2019t bad and it made its point.

You would be wrong. Everything great about this play stems from its supposed \"littleness\". Unlike, say Tony Kushner's epics, Master Harold is least bothered with the spectacle. It's less about the horrible, shocking tales of slavery and segregation, and more about the ways hatred manifests in the small, daily things. Everything about this play is a microcosm, a masterclass in minimalist writing. That tea room in 1950's South Africa and those three men are all you'll need -not just to understand the basic problem- but to understand the origin of hate itself. And here's Fugard's piece de resistance: Hally, the person doling out the hate, is likable, intelligent and charming from the start. And once you're bound to the character like that, Fugard forces you to bear witness to his racism and still continue empathizing with him. It's a ride - with snappy, light language that flows so easy. This will take you literally an hour to read, tops. Read. P.S: there's also a metaphor in here -comparing ballroom dancing to wars and global conflicts - which is totally going down in the list of my favorite metaphors."}, {"userName": "Kieran", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1971850-kieran", "userReview": "Fugard manages to not only create a convincng domestic drama, but situates it incredibly well into the political milieu of the period in which he wrote.His symbolism though understated is nevertheless powerful, and compelling events such as the kite flying scene are rightfully well known, not only for their metaphysical importance but also for the simplicity of the human drama that they convey.The play is oblique at times, but all the more powerful as a result, as it focuses the audience or readers perception onto the tiny matters and affairs of the characters that create a comprehensive whole.The dialogue is fast moving and natural, and is lenient with interpretation whilst still retaining its essential meaning. Though there have been a variety of preformances, the characters (despite differing interpretations) remain ostensibly the same due to the meanings being conveyed.This is definitely one of the iconic plays of South Africa, and deservedly so. It was made into a movie starring Freddie Highmore, so even if you're not lucky enough to be able to attend a performance it is still available to be watched."}, {"userName": "Edward Cheer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38484402-edward-cheer", "userReview": "I honestly first thought that this was some sort of parody or modernization of Mother Courage and her Children, purely from the similarity of the titles. Never have I been so wrong. This play focuses far more on aspects of philosophy, race, and politics- all between three characters and withing a relatively small amount of pages. I've really grown to like these plays with very small casts, showing how focused it can be on those characters. And the dialogue is really good. Some highlights for me were in the parts where Hally would talk to his mother and father on the phone. In the right hands, these could be some really emotionally-charged segments. This is one play you definitely shouldn't miss out on reading."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1295449-liz", "userReview": "This is very interesting and satisfying play about a privileged white teen and two black servants in South Africa having an extended conversation, and set during apartheid. There are some high points, beautiful imagery in a monologue about ballroom dancing and also ugly pugilistic behavior which is fitting considering the setting. However, I dislike it when themes and morality are heavy handed.

It's short but powerful as it tugs at the reader's humanity. Despite it's broad themes of racism, coming of age, and family dysfunction, the play manages to be personal and affect the reader in the issue most important to them. For me, it was the coming of age aspect. It's bittersweet ending remains hopeful for a better tomorrow.

As you can see from my five-star rating, it wasn't amazing. It wasn't life-changing. But I can admit that it was very excellent, and enjoyable. Even though it seemed rather simplistic from the fact that it literally featured three present characters in one boring setting (a room in the midst of a rainy day in South Africa, it was meaningful and special. More books (or plays) need to address the issues highlighted by Fugard's writing. It's also SUPER important to have high school-aged teens read this so that they can use the lessons and topics addressed in the real world. That's one of the reasons why I personally love reading: it teaches us things without us even knowing. It just becomes second-nature to spread the loving messages that authors attempt to showcase.THIS PLAY WAS ALSO REALLY SAD AND MEANINGFUL. Especially in the way that if you read the background story of the author, you can tell that the story is based on the author's life, in a way. Athol Fugard lived a similar life to the play's main character, Hally. Hally's family is fortunate to be white and wealthy, allowing them to receive some extra help from two black men who are forced to see that even the connections and relationship they established with Hally did not change anything about the way society works. It's heartbreaking. This is a tiny, QUICK read so I highly recommend picking it up at any time. You'll understand the message immediately and it'll come so easily. It's important to realize the themes and use them in modern literature.Master Harold and... the boys is a read everyone should pick up. You know those lists that state, \"30 Books to Read Before You Die\"? Yeah, this should be on all of those lists. Help me make that happen by reading this meaningful, deep story."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6896-peter", "userReview": "\u201dMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the boys is a short play, but there\u2019s a lot of humanity crammed into it.Set in a tea room in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, it shows us the relationship between three characters: Hallie, the seventeen year old white son of the tea room\u2019s owners, and Sam and Willie, the two black employees who work there. All three are richly fleshed out; they are real in their faults and aspirations, and at different times we appreciate, sympathize with, and shake our heads at each of them. \u201dMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the boys works so well because of this; we see all of them at their best and worst.At the heart of the play is a laser-like focus on racial dynamics. Harold (Hallie) and the boys (Sam and Willie) wrestle with tensions between race, class, social habits and the personal relationships that sometimes do and sometimes don\u2019t transcend them. Without characters we feel for, the play would be trite, but with them, we are forced to ask how we would behave in the same situations.Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Short and full of stuff.Would I teach it? Yes. It\u2019s a marvelous tool for character analysis and reading behind and between the lines of plays.Lasting impression: South African white boy grows up with the help of two black men that the boy takes for granted.

Taking place in Apartheid South Africa, the story revolves around two black men, Sam and Willie, and a seventeen year old boy named Hally A.K.A Master Harold. One of the story's major themes is racism.Sam and Willie work for Hally's mother at her Tea Room (similar to a Cafe). One of the play's more powerful quotes is \"He's a white man and that's good enough for you.\" When Sam and Hally argue, Hally mentions his father being Sam's boss, and Sam says that Hally's mother is his boss, not his father. Then Hally replies with the racist quote above implying that every white man is a black man's superior. Hally had known Sam and Willie since he was very young, and they had taken care of him all of his life. Now the argument between them causes unchangeable damage to their relationship and from friends, they become \"White Master\" and \"Black Servant\". Hally's disgusting behavior derives from pressure from his unjust society and really puts an emphasis on apartheid, and how horrible it was.I thought that the story is very well written, I enjoyed the fact that it was a play, it was straightforward and easy to understand.
