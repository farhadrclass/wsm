Had a very Harry Potter-esque feel to it. The characters were well-built out. You will fall in love with the main character, Andrew, while watching him change from a boy to a man on his journey. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to escape for a bit, because this book will wrap you up and leave you wanting more."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12356832-erica", "userReview": "I couldn't put it down.

There are two story lines being told simultaneously 30 years apart in alternating chapters--odd numbered chapters when Elliot is 50 and even numbered chapters being memoirs of Elliot at 20. There is a considerable amount of confusing description (for me) of where the action takes place. I found myself frequently wishing a map of Castle Hill and surrounding areas of the Divided Isle was provided. At the age of 20 Elliot has been a squire in training for 10 years and is anxiously anticipating his knighting. A cloaked person is responsible for his career change and sadly is never revealed to the reader. The older mystery is centered around the king's treasured silver goblets. The current mystery begins as a search for a missing woman. Cullath, \"The Old Bastard\", becomes Elliot's reluctant partner at age 35 and remains so 30 years later. The names of some of the characters appear in both mysteries and can become daunting, especially since some are very similar. The common thread throughout is the bonding and fellowship that grows between Elliot and \"The Old Bastard\". Eliott's life takes a course of peaks and valleys with \"The Old Bastard\" always at his back. I found his relationship with Keldara and Lathier to be vague giving the impression it all occurred during the missing 30 years.Did I like this book? Mostly, yes. Would I read this author again? Probably give him another tryI feel I would honestly rate it a 3-1/2 star, but then again maybe it deserves 4 stars. I found this book very difficult to review."}, {"userName": "Booklover", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53577500-booklover", "userReview": "Premise was good...carry through not so much. Characters were not as developed as I like. There are grammatical errors throughout. Andrew's swordplay was inconsistent. He quickly defeats an experienced swordsman and then can't keep from having his sword knocked out of his hand later on. The story dragged in some places and had many coincidental rescues. Mr. McGuire does like to give his characters lots of exercise as he takes you up the steps, down the steps, through the tunnels, up and down the streets, in and out of buildings, running through the forest...you get the idea. You have a society that does not tolerate supernatural abilities and pretty much very little else. Everyone has a set program they must adhere to or be punished by The Provider. There are many different \"colors\" of army soldiers which mostly don't work together. There are monsters everywhere in the Harrowing, some you are allowed to see in the story and some you just hear about. The story revolves around Andrew and his guide, Garrin and his Medusa-like stare. This is book 1 and it does reach a conclusion with a logical starting point for the next novel. But I must say I really did not like the ending. Did I mention I really did not like the ending!"}, {"userName": "Viviana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47135-viviana", "userReview": "Great book! It's packed with story and characters that we get a taste of, and sets the stage for the next stories to come. It's Hunger Games meets Harry Potter, with elaborate worlds within worlds that had me in the book, Inception-style. I can't wait to see what Andrew finds in the next books!!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33823284-melanie", "userReview": "Excellent read!"}, {"userName": "Sheryl Mcguire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23183529-sheryl-mcguire", "userReview": "Fantastic.
