The remains of these victims were never found because there were no remains to find\u2026\u201d-\tJohn U. Bacon, The Great Halifax ExplosionOne hundred years ago, in the midst of one of the bloodiest and calamitous wars in human history, some 2,000 people in Halifax, Nova Scotia, were obliterated by one of the largest manmade explosions ever created. On December 6, 1917, a cargo ship called the Mont Blanc collided with a second ship, the Imo, in the Narrows of Halifax Harbor. The Mont Blanc was packed to the gills with explosive material: 62 tons of gun cotton, similar to dynamite; 246 tons of a new and particularly combustible airplane fuel called benzol, packed in 494 thin steel drums and stacked three and four barrels high; 250 tons of TNT; and 2,366 tons of picric acid, a notoriously unstable and poisonous chemical more powerful than its cousin, TNT, which was used to make shells, the Great War\u2019s principle weapon. When the Mont Blanc went off, it leveled a hugh swath of town. Along with the fatalities, around 9,000 people were injured. The mushroom cloud that rose over Halifax would be recognizable in a later day as something akin to a nuclear blast. The Halifax Explosion was a massive disaster, striking in terms of loss of life, injuries, property damage, and human error. Yet, today, it is mostly forgotten, or at least unknown, possibly a result of it occurring at a time when millions had been killed in the trenches, and millions more were about to be killed by the flu. John Bacon\u2019s The Great Halifax Explosion sets out to memorialize the event in authoritative fashion, giving you just about everything you need to know (and some things you don\u2019t) about what was then \u2013 and should be again \u2013 an unforgettable day. For the most part, Bacon does a very good job with this material. The central portions of The Great Halifax Explosion, which details the collision course, the explosion itself, and the immediate aftermath, are handled extremely well. By utilizing a wide array of voices, by giving us the names and lives of everyday Haligonians (that is, a people from Halifax), Bacon is able to give scale to an unimaginably enormous (and fast) detonation. The lead-up to the crash is especially good. Bacon creates a tense, minute-by-minute account of how the Mont Blanc and the Imo managed to collide on calm waters on a clear day. He pieces together the likely strains of thought of all the important participants, even though many did not survive the consequences of their actions. The Great Halifax Explosion has all the makings of an intense, real-life thriller, a ticking time-bomb scenario in which the bomb actually goes off. That, however, is not the book that Bacon wrote. At 374 pages, this is not a super long read. Still, it is a lot of pages for a climatic moment that lasted one-fifteenth of a second. In order to give some context \u2013 or padding, if you prefer \u2013 Bacon provides a lot of extraneous information. He starts things off right, with a crackerjack chapter that sets both ships in motion on their rendezvous with an atomized destiny. Just before the two ships hit, though, Bacon pulls away in classic tease fashion. He then ladles on chapter after chapter of minutiae. Now, don\u2019t give me wrong. I\u2019m a minutiae lover. And some of the stuff Bacon covers is interesting, if only tangentially related to his main focus. For instance, he provides a brief history of Halifax starting in 1497 and going all the way up to 1917. Included in this overview is a detailed description of Halifax\u2019s role in recovering the bodies from the wreck of the Titanic. As a card-carrying Titanic buff, this was neat. But it has only the barest of connection (related to the tagging of bodies) to the blast five years later. Similarly, Bacon provides an exhaustive biography of Joseph Ernest Barss, a young Haligonian who went off to serve in World War I and later helped in recovery operations in the explosion\u2019s aftermath. We are treated to a rather thorough recounting of Barss\u2019 wartime experiences as filtered through his surviving letters. This is not uninteresting, but it doesn\u2019t really belong here. I think it\u2019s a matter of an author finding a subject he really likes, and writing about it, even though it is not strictly relevant. (It\u2019s worth nothing that Bacon has written extensively about the University of Michigan, and that Barss later started the U of M\u2019s celebrated hockey program). Your mileage on this filler (I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better word) may vary. You may love it all, and gobble it up. I did not. At times, it tested my patience, as the fast pace that Bacon promises in the early going gives way to stalling. My issue with The Great Halifax Explosion is not simply that it had too much info poured into it, but that other important aspects of the tale are diminished or neglected entirely. For example, the inquiries following the disaster are only hastily related. I wanted much more details about the investigations and the laying of blame. (I recognize, of course, that this is a popular history, and that my burning desire to be inundated with trial transcripts is not generally shared). When it comes to the fate of the Mont Blanc\u2019s crew \u2013 who escaped before it blew up \u2013 Bacon is almost completely silent. Bacon informs us that Captain Le M\u00e9dec was charged with manslaughter for abandoning his vessel without warning anyone it was going to blow up in a major way. The outcome of this charge (which was ultimately dismissed) is never really explained. I think more focus here, rather than on Joseph Barss\u2019 time in combat overseas, is warranted. Ultimately, the positives far outweigh the negatives. The high points were really high, even if you have to wade through some superfluity to get there. I appreciated the scope of Bacon\u2019s ambition in scope and sweep. This stands as a full story, if not the full story, of a tragic day in which people proved to be both the cause of, and solution to, a terrible accident."}, {"userName": "Truman32", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22271857-truman32", "userReview": "This past November, a 53-foot-tall white spruce Christmas tree was chopped down in Nova Scotia by burly Canadian lumberjacks, their beards thick, curly and smelling vaguely of maple syrup, and then shipped down to Boston for their annual holiday lighting ceremony on Boston Common. This gifting of a coniferous evergreen has occurred every year since 1971. Why? Surely Boston should be able to afford their own Christmas trees. And if the expense is too great, shouldn\u2019t the smarty-pants at Harvard, MIT or Tufts be able to genetically create a super New England Spruce?John U. Bacon\u2019s historical telling, The Great Halifax Explosion, shines a light on this explaining that this needle-covered gift is a thanks for the Boston response to one of the most awful and damaging man-made disasters ever. In 1917 World War 1 was in full swing, and the freighter Mont-Blanc loaded down with six million pounds of American-made high explosives was slowly pulling into the harbor town of Halifax, Nova Scotia. They would meet up with a convoy of other ships and then head off to the bloodstained trenches of Europe to drop off these much-needed munitions. Unfortunately while in the harbor, the Mont-Blanc smashed into another ship. The crew had moments to decide what to do: turning their flaming float-bomb around back out to sea, effectively sacrificing their lives to save the thousands of Halifax civilians (many women and children), or jump into their escape boats and row like they were in the Olympics going for the gold in the quad sculls event. They choose the lifeboats and as a result this burning and quickly deserted freighter floated gently into the Halifax docks where it eventually exploded. The force from this detonation was unlike anything ever experienced\u2014second only to the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in World War Two. Needless to say, Halifax was demolished. The devastation was on the level of thousands of inebriated Philadelphia Eagles football fans celebrating a Super bowl win. But in Halifax not only were there charred ruins of smoldering Wawa convenience stores, but almost all houses and buildings were leveled. Over 2,000 were killed. 9,000 injured. 25,000 homeless. A mushroom cloud hung over the city before dropping black oil and pieces of glass, metal and other shrapnel on the survivors. A 35-foot tsunami flooded in. But Bacon\u2019s The Great Halifax Explosion is not so much about the grisly and heartbreaking results from this catastrophe\u2014though with many facial and eye injuries from flying glass it is plenty gruesome, but the generosity and valor of the survivors and the people across Canada and the United States that stepped up and offered compassionate assistance. Almost without fail, folks\u2014including the New Englanders in Boston nobly jumped to help.Bacon writes a moving and inspiring book. He gets us to invest in and care about a cast of Halifax citizens before the explosion. We already know what is going to happen and we wonder who is going to make it. At one moment I had to moan to my wife, \u201coh no, there\u2019s an orphanage right by the dock! Run young orphans, for the love of all that is holy run! RUN!!\u201d After the explosion Bacon let\u2019s us know the ordeals and the heroism of the folks who escape with their lives. It all reads like a fictional adventure tale. And despite some extraneous facts (Bacon wants to really shove it all in. He even spends time talking about Babe Ruth and Yankee stadium for some unknown reason) and a little trouble keeping his rather large cast straight, this was an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Arnis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257859-arnis", "userReview": "https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Steven Z.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z", "userReview": "John U. Bacon\u2019s thoughtful and detailed approach in his new book THE GREAT HALIFAX EXPLOSION: A WORLD WAR I STORY OF TREACHERY, TRAGEDY, AND EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM results in one of the best \u201cdisaster\u201d monographs in recent memory. The author\u2019s approach is based on empathy and what appears to be a personal commitment to write a clear, concise narrative that is meaningful as it covers all aspects of the catastrophe. Bacon begins by laying out the crisis that came at 9:04 am on December 6, 1917, then retreats and provides a history of Halifax. Once you acquire a sense of the city and its geography, Bacon describes how two ships, the Mont Blanc, and the Imo seemed to come together to play a dangerous \u201cgame of chicken\u201d in the Bedford Basin outside Halifax Harbor, a game that resulted in the deadliest man made explosion up until the bombing of Hiroshima. The explosion must be seen in the context of World War I. By the time of the collision the war had been ongoing for three years but it had reached a stalemate in the trenches. Once Russia left the war, the Germans would turn their attention to the western front which created an increasing need for explosives to prevent any breakthrough. The Mont Blanc was captained by Aime Joseph Marie Medec who had little time to familiarize himself with his vessel which would carry the largest cache of explosives ever loaded on to a ship \u2013 62 tons of gun cotton, 246 tons of benzol, packed in 494 thin steel drums and stacked three and four barrels high, 250 tons of TNT, and 2366 tons of picric acid, a very unstable and poisonous chemical. The cargo weighed almost 3000 tons, or 6 million pounds. The plan was for the ship to be loaded in Gravesend Bay, Brooklyn, NY and travel up the east coast to Halifax where it would meet a convey for the voyage across the Atlantic. This plan was chosen to offset the threat of German U-boats as convoys of allied ships was deemed the safest way to reach Europe.Bacon presents an accurate portrayal of events leading up to the war in Europe and how the war was fought. Further, he describes the importance of Halifax Harbor to the overall war effort and the contributions made by Canadian soldiers from Halifax who fought in overseas. Bacon choses a number of Haligonians (Halifax residents) who volunteered for the military and fought in the trenches. Through the eyes of Ernest Barrs who fought and was wounded in Belgium at the battles of Ypres the reader gets a true portrait of what life was like for soldiers. Barrs story is an amazing one in that after surviving for two years he is severely wounded. The day of the explosion found him rehabbing outside of Halifax and because of his own medical issues and familiarization with medical techniques he joined a Dr. Elliott to help administer to Haligonian survivors in December, 1917. Bacon introduces the reader to other families whose stories are traced from before the explosion, what happened during the explosion, and after. You become familiar with the Orr, Driscoll, and Pattison families who lived in the Richmond neighborhood in the North End of the city which would be almost destroyed on December 6th. Bacon describes family life, occupations, schooling and the interests of the children to the point where one feels that they know them personally.The tragedy that took place was completely avoidable. Bacon explores the leadership and strategies employed by the captains and harbor pilots for both ships and concludes it was the fault of Captain Haakon From of the Imo. The most fascinating chapter is called \u201cA Game of Chicken\u201d where Bacon describes the path of both ships, the Mont Blanc heading north to meet a convoy in Halifax, and the Imo traveling south toward New York to load supplies for a return to Europe. The Imo was supposed to stay on western side of the Narrows and the Mont Blanc on the east. The Imo would move to the center and refused to accommodate the Mont Blanc which was following the correct navigational protocol. The Imo finally decided, too late, to move to the side it was assigned as Capt. Medec moved to the east to avoid a collision, but it hit the Imo. With the cargo on the Mont Blanc, devastation could only result. Bacon provides a blow by blow account up until 8:46 am when the Mont Blanc\u2019s cargo ruptured. The result was the total destruction of the north end of the city, the death of almost 2000 people, 9000 wounded, and the loss of almost half the homes in Halifax.Bacon takes the reader through the mobilization of resources, the bravery of first responders, and the generosity and selflessness of the survivors who tried to help the victims and each other. At the outset many believed it was a German attack. However, soon reality would set in allowing Bacon to compare the experience of trench warfare and the catastrophe that befell Halifax. The shock and emotions today would be called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, but at that time people did not know what they were dealing with. The \u201cinstant refugees\u201d wandered looking for parents, children, and other family members, for many to no avail. Bacon returns to the families that he introduced earlier in the book and explains what they went through. Bacon goes on to describe the tsunami that resulted from the blast as well as the blizzard that arrived the next day in Halifax, furthering the suffering and hindering rescue and recovery attempts in a city that had 900 hospital beds remaining, with 9000 injured needing medical treatment.A major theme of the narrative involves the historical relationship between Canada and the United States. For 141 years it seemed the United States worked to annex Canada provoking anger and fear on the part of our northern neighbors. The Halifax explosion altered feelings between the two countries due to American support and generosity. Many Haligonians were stunned by the massive relief effort that arrived from the United States, particularly the large number of doctors and nurses that resulted in setting up their own hospital to treat the victims. A major result of this crisis was the cementing of Canadian-American relations, and an alliance that has stood the test of time up to the present.Bacon\u2019s account is extremely thorough based on letters, diaries, oral histories, and other archival material he consulted. He describes how word of the disaster spread and how surrounding towns and communities provided doctors, nurses, soldiers, first responders, businessmen and others to assist as much as they could. The people behaved in an amazing fashion, so much so that looting was not a problem. Boston is singled out for their aid and assistance in a wonderful chapter describing the work of Massachusetts Governor Samuel W. McCall and Abraham C. Ratshesky (known as A.C.) who led Boston\u2019s substantial relief effort.The author follows the aftermath of the explosion taking the reader through the investigation and the long drawn out court proceeding over a period of years. He concludes the narrative by bringing up to date information about the survivors and their families. The book is a heart rendering account that is hard to put down, and highly recommended."}, {"userName": "SoManyBooks SoLittleTime (Aven Shore)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-somanybooks-solittletime-aven-shore", "userReview": "Nearly perfect; an excellent study of the Hfax explosion, with emphasis on the way it changed international relations between the US and Canada.

I guess it was in part because the story is about a horrible, life-altering situation - and we have plenty of those to go around these days - but I'd like to believe folks, especially in North America, will still rise to the occasion.Non-fiction 'novels' are a favorite genre of mine, usually those related to true crime (In Cold Blood) or disasters (Isaac's Storm). A good author can set the scene, describe the personalities involved, and with any luck the reader will feel like they're right in the middle of the whatever drama unfolds - a visceral reaction.While The Great Halifax Explosion incident in 1917 was a tragedy - approximately 2,000 people killed in a Canadian harbor town from a shock-wave / tsunami caused by a damaged munitions freighter - it was the good-natured, well-meaning average guy/girl heroism that brought tears to my eyes. (The last time I choked up reading a book was Doug Stanton's excellent In Harm's Way, about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the eventual rescue of its surviving crew, back in 2015.) There was just something very reassuring and touching about the many types of concerned people who responded to provide assistance in the town's darkest hours."}, {"userName": "Grumpus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus", "userReview": "I first learned of this disaster in 2014 while stopping at the port as part of a cruise and it has interested me ever since. I finally came across this book and spent some time on my library\u2019s waiting list. I\u2019d say 99% of what was in the book was new to me\u2014just how I like it. I want to learn new things and this was ideal for my reading objectives.It starts out with a history of the relationship between Canada and America with a chapter entitled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t We Americans?\u201d. It was interesting to learn about the distrust Canadians, or more specifically Haligonians felt toward Americans. I never really thought about it, but I can now understand their point of view during the early 1900\u2019s. Then to see the friendship build between these two friends in the face of disaster.This was toward the end of WWI. German U-boats were sinking ships in the Atlantic at an alarming rate. The US was neutral at the time, but was sending munitions to France to them in the trench wars. A ship called the Mont-Blanc was loaded with munitions in NY and then heading up to Halifax to be part of a convoy to France. And when I say loaded, I mean loaded. The ship was stuffed with TNT, benzine, and picric acid--there was literally no space left in the cargo hold. Crew members were not allowed to bring matches on board for obvious reasons and were very uneasy about any spark or static that might ignite the entire thing.December 6, 1917 was the day of the explosion. When this ship collided with another in Halifax harbor, you would have thought instant KABOOM, but no. The crew of the ship did what they could before jumping overboard and swimming to shore expecting the ship to detonate at any moment. Because they abandon ship with that expectation, they did not have the ability to notify everyone else what their cargo was. As a result, as the ship burned and drifted toward the pier, other ships came to the rescue along with the fire department. School children came from their homes to the docks to watch these heroic efforts unaware of the imminent danger. Where was the crew of the ship? They swam to the other side of the harbor and were still unable to warn any one. The detonation itself took one-fifteen of a second, five times faster than the blink of an eye. The epicenter of the explosion instantaneously shot up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit, about six times hotter than molten lava.\u201d All those people looking on. . .This was the largest man-made explosion in human history up to that point in time\u2014sending a mushroom cloud into the air, raining down blistering hot coal, oil, tar, and cargo across the city. The human toll was horrifying with 1,600 people killed instantly and 400-800 dying afterward, 9,000 were wounded and 25,000 left homeless. That\u2019s four times more San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and eight times more than the Chicago fire of 1871. To top it all off, that night temperatures plunged and the city received 16 inches of snow. During the search for survivors over the following days, bodies did not decompose and were found frozen solid.There are details of the families trying to find each other and the heroic efforts of the doctors. The people of Boston played a significant role in providing rescue teams, medical personnel, and supplies as did the neighboring small communities in the area. The book wraps up with recovery of the city, the outcome of the lives of those who survived, and identification of those who died as well as court trials to determine fault.There are so many more details that I could mention, but these are the things that stuck out as I was reading. I wanted to give you a flavor of the story and recommend that you read it for yourself. It\u2019s always a shame that it takes a disaster to bring humans together."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6199930-ann", "userReview": "Resident of Halifax for 7 years during the 1950's while attending school, heard much about the 'Great Explosion' as well as still seeing some evidence of the damage done.

Captured both my wishes to be informed, learn new things, while still enjoying.Interesting to see how nature works, we're all vulnerable to comedies of errors - exactly what happened in this case. Too many mistakes made by too many to assess any blame where it rightly belonged. Instead the crew members of the ship that blew up were easy to blame, as they made the assessment (being aware of their cargo) that there was nothing they could do, and they abandoned ship.

I thought the first part of the book read too much like a textbook account of historic events. It covered not only the history of Halifax, but history of American/Canadian relations and Canadian history as these connected to Halifax. There was much about Canadians\u2019 involvement in WW1 and descriptions of Halifax during wartime with sailors leaving there for Europe, and also the supply ships and convoys in the harbor. There was also a history of development of explosives which were to be used in wartime.  Then we get the details leading up to the massive explosion, but the ships do not collide until about page 140 in the book. From that point on we get vivid descriptions of a city in ruins, the horrible loss of life and terrible injuries. An entire section of Halifax was destroyed:homes, churches, schools, businesses collapsed. Immediately following the explosion a 35 foot tsunami swept away some who were still alive. Those who survived, many with injuries including blindness, burns, loss of limbs had no idea if any family members were still alive or their whereabouts. To add to the misery, the next day there was a blizzard which made the homeless survivors in danger of freezing and hindered rescue efforts. We get a lot of human interest stories and how this unprecedented disaster brought out the best in people. Relief efforts were quickly on the way. Boston immediately sent in 100 doctors, 300 nurses bearing medical supplies and immediately set up new hospitals in vacant buildings before anyone knew the extent of the destruction. Help also rushed in from all over Canada, and some of the people were moved to other Nova Scotian towns. Clothing, stoves, building supplies,along with workers to rebuild the shattered homes managed to get through to Halifax despite the snowstorm. The army helped to keep order and surprisingly there was no looting. Volunteers worked tirelessly in hospitals helping the injured and looking for living and the dead in the collapsed buildings. This is one of several books just published to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the disaster on December 6th. Over 2000 people were killed immediately and 9000 wounded. 6000 buildings were completely destroyed leaving 25,000 homeless (almost half the population of Halifax) and exposed to the snow storms which followed. There would have been much more loss of life if it weren\u2019t for the effort of so many outside medical professionals, volunteers, builders and charities which helped in the recovery and the kindness of people in Halifax and nearby towns towards the victims.

There was a short blurb on the news regarding the arrival of the Boston Common Christmas Tree from Nova Scotia, and that it was a gift from Canada in thanks for help after an explosion in Halifax. That was the extent of the report. I moved to Denver this year, but still follow the Boston news sites, and was surprised that there wasn't more of a fanfare this year for the 100th anniversary. On December 6, 1917 a French ship named the Mont-Blanc was entering Halifax harbor, hoping to join a convoy across the Atlantic to France. As the Mont-Blanc was entering the Imo was leaving in a rush, as it was a day behind. The ships collided, causing a fire on the Mont-Blanc. What few in the harbor knew was that the Mont-Blanc was loaded with three thousand tons of high explosives and airplane fuel. Twenty minutes letter, in a quarter of the time it takes to blink your eye, the Mont-Blanc exploded. The explosion was the largest man made explosion until 1945, and the Manhattan Project scientists would study the Halifax explosion while building the atomic bomb. Mr. Bacon goes in depth in to the events that led to this fateful explosion, as well as dipping in to the history of Halifax and Canadian-American relations at the time. He also follows many individual stories around the explosion, including survivors and their families, and Ernest Barrs, a Canadian who fought in the trenches and helped with the relief effort. I quite enjoyed the personal stories, and felt that they gave personal impact to such a massive tragedy. What was lacking though was a more in depth discussion of the consequences and legal ramifications for the owners of the Imo and Mont-Blanc and the surviving crew. The inquiry, trials, and appeals would make plenty of material for a book on their own. Also the title is not right. There is no treachery in this story. There is stupidity and stubbornness, a touch of cowardice, and animosity towards the French, but no treachery.

Excellent retelling of this tragic, human-caused disaster. John U. Bacon gives us a history of Halifax as a great port city, highlights the lives of the residents in the areas that were wiped out instantaniosly (following certain individuals who survived throughout the book), and details the events leading up to and after two steamships had collided in Halifax harbor, one heavily over-loaded with explosives. Halifax was the greatest most powerful explosion on earth before Hiroshima--Oppenheimer studied Halifax while designing the bomb. In the end _The Great Halifax Explosion_ is about the resilience of the people of Halifax to comeback from the tragedy and the help they received from around the world, particularly from the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who set aside national antipathies to bring our nations together during WWI and restore the lives and community of Halifax.

Bacon has done extensive research and includes material from eye-witness accounts to compile this account, rich in detail as well as human interest with profiles of Haligonians. The first part moves more slowly as it recounts Canada's involvement in WWI with profiles of soldiers and the history and importance of Halifax harbor. The actual explosion is then minutely and grippingly described. The aftermath--with 2.5 sq. miles of Halifax destroyed, 2000 killed, and 9000 injured--includes personal stories of Haligonians as well as details of the outpouring of aid, particularly from Boston. A compelling, compassionate, earnest chapter in WWI history.

While the large scale events provide the context, the how and why, of the explosion it's the the stories of the people lost, the heroism, and the perseverance of survivors and rescuers that bring the most meaning to the tale.The outpouring of kindness in the aftermath of the explosion would change relations between America and Canada forever.

Further, he shows how in dealing with the aftermath, the US and Canada went from near enemies to friendly neighbors. He also includes sixteen pages of historical photos.The explosion on December 6, 1917 was an accident between two ships that was \"the most destructive man-made explosion until Hiroshima [August 6, 1945], one that blew out windows 50 miles away, rendered 25,000 people homeless in an instant [1/15 of a second], wounded 9,000 more, often horrifically, and killed 2,000, most of them in a flash.\" It virtually leveled two square blocks, some 6,000 buildings. The ship that exploded was carrying 6,000,000 pounds of high explosives -- gun cotton, TNT, TNP (picric acid) and barrels of benzol, a sort of \" 'super gasoline' \" for aviation fuel. However, they put the benzol in thin steel barrels on deck and below deck, filling in odd spots they found available, stacking them up to four high, restrained only by some ropes. Wartime shortcuts had disabled effective harbor communications and naval customs that might have averted the disaster, and at the critical moments, the two ship captains played what amounted to \"A Game of Chicken.\" They both blinked too late.When the collision occurred, and the ships separated, sparks from the mangled steel set off spilled benzol like a fuse, with the burning fuel running down below deck where the other explosives were very carefully stored in hermetically sealed bunkers. In effect, they had built what would become a floating oven. When one or more of those high explosives reached their flash point, they ignited in an inferno of 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Only two small pieces of the ship were found -- three to four miles away. Onlookers, firefighters, sailors, and thousands of other people were plunged into an instant hell of untold destruction. The ensuing black mushroom cloud turned white as it dropped a \"black rain\" of oil and debris all over town. Also, there was a tsunami that struck the nearby shores. Worse, fear of the possibility of a secondary explosion at an armory led to an attempt to evacuate rescuers and survivors to a safer distance out of town, interrupting rescue attempts. And to make matters still worse, the next day Halifax suffered its worst blizzard in years. As word of the disaster spread, Canadians did all they could as fast as they could to aid Halifax. Additionally and fortunately, because of wartime precautions, Massachusetts had a disaster preparedness plan, a rarity in those days. When the Yanks became aware of the disaster, they tried to contact Halifax, but of course many telephone and telegraph lines there had been destroyed. To their credit, they didn't wait long for a reply, but sent help on speeding trains -- which then got bogged down in the drifts from the snowstorm.This is not a book only of horror. Instead, it is a story of how human kindness overcame it, in individual lives and in international historic firsts."}, {"userName": "A Reader's Heaven", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4791172-a-reader-s-heaven", "userReview": "A gripping narrative history of the largest manmade detonation prior to Hiroshima: in 1917 a ship laden with the most explosives ever packed on a vessel sailed out of Brooklyn\u2019s harbor for the battlegrounds of World War I; when it stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia, an extraordinary disaster awaited. . . .In this definitive account, Bacon combines research and eyewitness accounts to re-create the tragedy and its aftermath, including the international effort to rebuild the devastated port city.

And I was rewarded quite sufficiently.The highlights? Definitely the first part of the book, before the explosion. For me, getting the background of Halifax was important - it gave me an idea of why it was such an important shipping ports and the history of the people who lived there was very interesting. I was also quite happy with the sense of place - I could imagine Halifax Harbour in my head from the excellent descriptions.Also, the detailed account of the treacherous journey from Brooklyn to Halifax on the Mont Blanc had me intrigued and there was a real sense of tension reading that trip.Finally, the Boston story - and the Canadian-American relations leading up to the event. And how those relationships changed after. There is an excellent chapter regarding the bravery and aid throughout this tragedy - and that recognition is very well deserved. However for me, there was one pretty big downside. The story of Joseph Barss. For the first third of the book or so, I was wondering when it would end. He was obviously going to be an important character in the narrative but, from the start, it was boring for me to read his letters to mummy and daddy. Really could have done with less about him and his war letters, and more about the actual tragedy. I don't think the explosion happened until about 40% of the way through...Would I recommend it? Well, of course, I gave it 4 stars!

It is the third largest man-made explosion ever, after the two nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. It killed and wounded thousands of people and brought the city of Halifax to its knees. I read this book for the Reading Without Walls challenge, for the category \"read a book on a topic you don't know much about.\" Like most people I didn't know anything about Halifax, Nova Scotia, or the explosion that happened there on December 6, 1917, but I sure do now. I liked this book because geography is critical to understanding the story, both the geography of the Halifax harbor and the geographical relationship between Halifax and the rest of the U.S., particularly Boston and New York. I feel like I know Halifax now, thanks to the map in the book and others I looked at online and in print. I thought the book read smoothly for nonfiction. There were so many details to keep straight at the beginning , but I wasn't overwhelmed by them. And each individual's story eventually fit together. Because of all the detail, I learned a lot. I learned about U.S./Canada relations (and how, up until World War I, we were talking about annexing our neighbor to the north!). I learned more about World War I and the battles of Ypres. (The more I learn about World War I the more I believe it's a miracle that anyone survived). And I learned that people can be quite decent and compassionate in the face of great disaster.

In December 1917, a freighter carrying 3,000 tons of explosives sailed from Brooklyn bound for the trenches of World War I\u2014en route, a cataclysmic disaster awaited . . .Entering World War I\u2019s fourth demoralizing year, the Allies hoped to break the grueling stalemate by sending thousands of fresh American troops and more munitions than ever to the trenches of France. Before the French freighter Mont-Blanc set sail from Brooklyn on December 1, 1917, with a staggering 3,000 tons of explosives, the captain banned his crew from lighting a single match, and secured the volatile cargo with copper nails because they don\u2019t spark when struck. For four harrowing days, the floating powder keg bobbed up the Eastern seaboard, plowing through a wicked snowstorm and waters infested with German U-Boats, which had already torpedoed a thousand Allied ships that year alone. On December 6, the exhausted crew finally slipped into Halifax Harbour\u2014just as the relief ship Imo was rushing to leave. At 8:45 a.m., the Imo struck the Mont-Blanc\u2019s bow, knocking over barrels of airplane fuel. Fire swept across the decks, sending the Mont-Blanc\u2019s crew scurrying to their lifeboats, while Halifax longshoremen, office workers, and schoolchildren walked down to watch it burn.At 9:04:35 a.m., the Mont-Blanc erupted, leveling 2.5 square miles of Halifax, killing 2,000 people, and wounding 9,000 more\u2014all in one-fifteenth of a second.In this definitive account, bestselling author John U. Bacon recreates the recklessness that caused the tragedy, the selfless rescue efforts that saved thousands, and the inspiring resilience that rebuilt the town. Just hours after the explosion, Boston alone sent 100 doctors, 300 nurses, and a million dollars. The explosion would revolutionize ophthalmology and pediatrics; transform Canada and the U.S. from adversaries to allies; and show J. Robert Oppenheimer, who studied Halifax closely, how much destruction an atomic bomb could inflict on a city. Bacon brings to light one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century, exploring the long shadow the world\u2019s first \u201cweapon of mass destruction\u201d still casts on our world today.The Great Halifax Explosion includes 25 black-and-white photos.", "title": "The Great Halifax Explosion: A World War I Story of Treachery, Tragedy, and Extraordinary Heroism", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217580-the-great-halifax-explosion", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1507670200l/34217580.jpg", "reviews": 148, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2348.John_U_Bacon", "name": "John U.
