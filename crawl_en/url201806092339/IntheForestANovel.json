Rob Zombie tried to justify the killer's motive in the 2007 version of that film, and pretty much messed the story up. Edna O'Brien, on the other hand, an amazing voice very particular about understating things and giving veneer to objects both alive and not, merges motive and magic. (The woods themselves are a character, perhaps the very main one.)A man goes berserk, killing to satiate the voices in his head, and this account was based on true life. O'Brien, true to the tradition of modern Irish psychopaths (like McCabe's \"Butcher Boy\") sounds a little like Joyce Carol Oates, a tad like Toni Morrison. Her tale is hair-raising and while the climax occurs halfway through, damn does she know how to keep the reader interested! Her woods are phantasmagorical, the fairy tale constructed here is a tragedy. I really must read her other books... & so should you."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "I started into this novel with the wrong idea, thinking it would be a murder mystery\u2014instead, I found a kind of murder documentary and it took me a while to get my mindset altered to properly appreciate it. I\u2019m not sure I actually achieved that switch in outlook.Based on an actual person and the murders he committed, In the Forest charts a life that has run off the rails. O\u2019Kane starts life with mental illness, losing his mother, being brutalized by his father, and ending up in custody where things continue just as cruelly. When he is finally released, he returns to his home territory, hearing voices and determined to bring the same kind of horror to those who didn\u2019t help him when he was a child.We watch as he takes up residence in the forest (perhaps being wilderness as opposed to civilization) and takes the ultimate revenge on people who represent the things that he has desperately wanted: a little boy with a mother who loves him, a woman who would love him as an adult, and a male authority figure who is kind to him. The writing is excellent, very evocative. I appreciated that the author did not describe the ultimate violence\u2014however, I found that my imagination provided the details only too well. I will definitely be reading more of Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s fiction in the future."}, {"userName": "TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2634423-thegirlbytheseaofcortez", "userReview": "Several years ago, when I was first introduced to the work of the great Irish writer, Edna O\u2019Brien, I immediately fell in love with the savage and poetic \"word pictures\" she paints. Her writing never fails to draw me in, emotionally and intellectually, on the very first page, and it really never lets me go. Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s writing is writing that stays with me - resonating, enchanting, mesmerizing - long after I\u2019ve read the final page.O\u2019Brien\u2019s novel, In the Forest, is based on a true story that took place in County Clare, Ireland in 1994, during which a deranged local boy killed a young mother, her son and a local priest who had befriended him. O\u2019Brien sets the tone of her book with the very first words of her lush, incandescent, almost indescribably Joycean prose:Woodland straddling two counties and several townlands, a drowsy corpus of green, broken only where the odd pine has struck up on its own, spindly, freakish, the stray twigs on either side branched, cruciform-wise. In the interior the trapped wind gives off the rustle of a distant sea and the tall slender trunks of the spruces are so close together that the barks are a sable-brown, the light becoming darker and darker into the chamber of non-light. At the farthest entrance under the sweep of a brooding mountain there is a wooden hut choked with briars and brambles where a dead goat decomposed and stank during those frantic, suspended, and sorrowing days. It was then the wood lost its old name and its old innocence in the hearts of the people.This is Cloosh Wood, a place of horror and sorrow, of death and decay, for O\u2019Brien lets us know the body of \"a dead woman\" lies in Cloosh Wood, undiscovered, decomposing. This woman is Eily Ryan, a wild, beautiful, vagabond. A woman whose very innocence may have contributed to her own murder, for Eily sees no evil in Cloosh Wood:I would come here for the mornings alone. Everything fresh, sparkling, the fields washed after rain, the whole world washed. Daisies and clover and blue borrage springing up, and the young cattle on the other side of the fence, frisking, kicking their hind legs and their tails, as if they have taken leave of their senses. The apple and crab-apple trees are coming into flower, apparitions of white, cloaked in green.O\u2019Brien has chosen to tell her story in one long flashback, broken up into named chapters, so even though we know from page one that Eily, her child and Father John Fitzgerald are going to be murdered (this is not a spoiler!), we don\u2019t yet know the circumstances under which these murders will occur, and this \"need to know\" suffuses O\u2019Brien\u2019s narrative with urgency and suspense and not least of all, horror.Just as O\u2019Brien introduces us to Eily in the book\u2019s opening pages, she also wastes no time introducing us to Eily\u2019s killer (again, not a spoiler), a youth she fittingly calls, with more than a nod to the Book of Genesis, Michen O\u2019Kane, dubbed \"the Kinderschreck\" by a German man from whom he stole a gun at the tender age of ten.In the Forest achieves even greater intensity as it follows Michen O\u2019Kane from his genesis as the apple of his mother\u2019s eye to his horrifying, though not surprising, descent into madness. And threaded through O\u2019Brien\u2019s remarkable and seamless narrative are the voices of the townspeople, the villagers, people who passively refuse to help Eily recognize the danger she\u2019s courting during her exchanges with Michen O\u2019Kane. Michen, monster though he\u2019s become is, after all, \"one of them,\" while Eily, though filled-to-overflowing with a sweetness born only of lack of familiarity with the evil of the world, is a stranger, a gypsy, a \"Johnny-come-lately\" who now occupies Michen\u2019s former home in this closed and clannish community. O\u2019Kane, the townspeople rationalize, is \"...one of their own sons come out of the their soil, their own flesh and blood, gone amok.\" Eily Ryan has made the terrible mistake of venturing into \"O'Kane country.\" It might be O\u2019Kane country, but Cloosh Wood, at least, after the murders, had changed:The same woods, that filtered green, the constant leafy murmur, and yet not the same, no longer the harmless place it once was, marked now as a human can be marked by its violation, its wood memory, the habitation of their frightful pilgrimage, their hapless cries; three bodies soon to be wrapped in plastic and brought down to the waiting hearses.O\u2019Brien is truly a literary daughter of Joyce and of Faulkner, a descendant of whom both Joyce and Faulkner would be most proud. Her pure stream-of-consciousness prose is lyrical, tragic, bleak, soaring, poetic, seamless, transcendent. She transports her reader from the printed page to Cloosh Wood, itself. This is a book I loved to read for the language alone, as much as for O\u2019Brien\u2019s insight into what might have actually taken place in County Clare. Although In the Forest is breathtakingly and gracefully told, it is a book that is unremittingly bleak and never flinches from its look straight into the face of evil.Although Edna O\u2019Brien hasn\u2019t lived in Ireland for years, her soul, like that of her self-exiled countryman, William Trevor, remains Irish to its core. Living in self-imposed exile in London, O\u2019Brien, herself, has said, Irish? In truth I would not want to be anything else. Despite this, O\u2019Brien refuses to sugar-coat her country\u2019s sins, though she does understand why her countrymen may seem to turn a blind eye. The murders in Cloosh Wood, says O\u2019Brien \"...had opened wounds that were too deep, too shocking, too hurtful; it had been a human hemorrhaging and the country was depleted from it.\"As for Eily Ryan and her child, and Father John, as well as Michen O\u2019Kane, \"Magic,\" writes Edna O\u2019Brien, at the end of In the Forest \"follows only the few.\"A beautiful, heartbreaking book that should be far more widely read.Read my book reviews and tips for writers at literarycornercafe.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "I found this to be a strange novel because while I wasn\u2019t grabbed by the plot, I was engrossed by the style. O\u2019Brien\u2019s prose is, in fact, lush, and she quite easily moves between points of view without confusing the reader. Her voice changes as she adopts different characters. The use of multi-view narrative to tell a tragic story of a mentally ill person who does not really elicit sympathy because of his language and actions combined with the people surrounding him who live in a combination of fear and pity. It ends, as most things do, badly. In this complex narrative, O\u2019Brien nudges the reader to think about the society and the responsible the society has to each member. One does one deal with a person who transcends society not because of will but because of illness or disability. It\u2019s a strange story and worth reading."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "Set in western Ireland, this novel is based a story of terror that took place in Ireland in 1994. It is a disturbing and devastating story of a mass murderer- from his tragic childhood to the height of his murder spree- and the community that seems helpless to stop him, or worse- that unwittingly aids him in his crime spree. It shows a society in denial of the abuse of children in detention and in school, easily abandoning its own, and unwilling to believe that they have unleashed a monster. Paradoxically, O'Brien's writing is so lovely, so gentle and intimate- as much as you want to turn away from the horrific acts of violence, you are cradled in the beauty of her prose."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john", "userReview": "Based very loosely on a true story, this follows paranoid schizophrenic Michen O'Kane as he murders a mother and child, then the priest that he summoned to give them the last rites, before finally the guarda (cops) close in. The book falls into three very (very) roughly equal parts: (1) the back stories of both Michen and his first two victims, Eily and her toddler son Maddie; (2) the crimes and the manhunt; (3) the aftermath, as Michen goes on trial and descends ever deeper into his alienation and madness.This is, I think, the first of O'Brien's novels that I've read, and for the most part I was very impressed. Her use of language can be, at its best, quite astounding, full of wonderful lyrical flourishes and brightly realized images. On the other hand, there's only a thin line between gloriously idiosyncratic prose and Pseuds' Corner, and every now and then -- not so very often but nonetheless too often -- O'Brien stumbles over this boundary: \"He is crying then, his teeth eating his tears\" (p248), for example.Sometimes, too, the text lapses into incoherence, and there are some idiotic continuity errors -- idiotic in that there's no aesthetic reason for them, just sloppiness. On pp139-40, for example, we're told that \"It was the first sound of [Fiona's] voice since he had come in,\" and yet, oops, at the top of page 139 Fiona has shouted to him, as he entered the shop, \"We're not open, we're not open!\"Allied to this are willful changes of tense from present to past or vice versa mid-paragraph, and sometimes (if memory serves) even mid-sentence. O'Brien doesn't seem to be using this tense-related chaos for any particular narrative purpose, just, I think, in an effort to look artsy.Much of the narrative is done from inside Michen's head, in what I assume is an attempt to depict paranoid schizophrenia, and I had problems with this aspect too. Like most of us, I haven't known too many paranoid schizophrenics, but I've known quite well a couple of friends who've suffered, at the very least, related diseases. O'Brien gets some parts of her portrayal of Michen's mindset right; it may be that she has the whole of it right, but often and again I was looking askance at the page at something that didn't seem to ring true. Michen's view of the world, in other words, seemed less like a paranoid schizophrenic's, more like an author's idea of what a paranoid schizophrenic's mind should be like.So much for my reasons for unease with the test. What about the good things?Well, as implied above, when O'Brien is getting her prose right, which is by far the most of the time, it's enough to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. This she manages while making her text quite infernally readable. If some of her characters are straight out of Central Casting, enough of the main ones are so excellently drawn that it's hard to believe they're not real: Eily, Kitty (the girl whom Michen abducts as a sort of replacement Eily), O'Mara (the retired cop brought in to help in the interrogation of Michen), and others; and it's superb that O'Brien chose to dodge the cheap trick of painting the toddler Maddie as a cute, angelic little sweetie-pops and instead made him a bit of a self-centered brat -- a real child, in other words. Overall, the book has the pace of a thriller even if, at the end, there's no satisfying conclusion, no closure, of the kind a thriller might have.In short, a book that's very well worth reading even if you might find you come away from it with reservations.=====As an aside, Goodreads (unless it's just moi) seems to have done away with the Preview function. Elderly geezers like me rely on the Preview function to help them get at least most of the typos and idiocies out of their texts. Let's hope the function is returned Real Soon Now."}, {"userName": "Vivian Valvano", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765915-vivian-valvano", "userReview": "This is the novel that gave O'Brien so much trouble b/c she was prompted to write it by a real and gruesome murder case in the 1990s. She was accosted by legions of people for using a painful tragedy to create a novel. On that topic: I have always believed that no one has the right to tell an author what to write, and if O'Brien wished to build a fictional narrative, having known of and researched a real crime, she had every right to do so. And, of course, she's never been one to run away from controversy. I thought the novel was excellent. As I've mentioned before, I am able to read about anything in terms of violence and gruesomeness, which is not to say that renderings do not disturb me and cause me pain; my barometer is whether or not it is well-written. O'Brien acquits herself admirably. The criminal is horrid, the victims are innocent, the portrayals of each of the characters (murderer, victims, an extensive, complicated cast of others, all of whom seem necessary) are totally believable and finely wrought, and the descriptions of all the rural settings are magnificent. The criminal has definitely been mismanaged and has sometimes been ill-handled during his troubled youth, but this does not lead O'Brien's narrative voice to exempt or excuse him in any way. While absorbing the horror of this man's actions and while absorbing the mad rantings of his thoughts, we are exposed to such tremendous flaws in the Irish social services' system, Church institutions, educational system, the Garda (they were probably disturbed mostly b/c they came across as complete idiots and/or unconcerned layabouts for such a long time before getting down to some police work) - in short, there was almost complete incompetence and inability to deal with serious situations, on many levels. By building these realities into the story and by not being didactic, O'Brien succeeds briliantly in this most troublesome, unhappy novel."}, {"userName": "Maryann", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7400290-maryann", "userReview": "This story really happened. Maybe not quite the way O'Brien relays it, but it's true. A woman and her child were abducted and murdered, and then a priest was taken and killed soon after, all by a young man who heard voices and exhibited lots of signs of mental illness. He had been placed in institutions early in his life and suffered horrific abuse at the hands of authorities. Does this make him less responsible for his crimes? Is he a victim as well? I found this book compelling. I'm a mental health professional and perhaps that's one of the reasons why, but I ended the book feeling so sad for all involved. The murderer, the victims, the psychiatrist who tried to treat him, the towns that were terrorized... what devastation. O'Brien's novelization is so well written. This is my first book of hers and I look forward to reading more. I understand why she was so controversial in Ireland- she writes about what no one wants to admit. Food: unevenly cooked steak. Chewy in some parts, too bloody in others, but not a piece of meat you regret eating."}, {"userName": "Scarlett Helena", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15773940-scarlett-helena", "userReview": "Although Edna O'Brien got a lot of negative feedback in regard to this novel from the loved ones of the murder victims, (who the story is based around) as well as from the public, something about this book is always going to stay with me. O'Brien manages to hold the reader's attention effortlessly with the way she tackled the many different perspectives of those portrayed in this work. This is the first time I have read a book that alternates between the mindsets of each personality so candidly and with such conviction. While reading this, you never know what new character you will meet, or what part of the grisly story they have to tell; the details conveyed from each person being integral.Her narrative spins its web in a way that does not touch or reveal the emotions of the author; rather it is a story that serves its purpose and feeds the curiosity of the reader in all ways.

Trigger warnings: violence, animal abuse, a child dies. Not terribly grisly, mostly psychological thriller.The families of the real life murder victims were reportedly not happy with O'Brien's fictional account of their loved ones' lives and deaths. She never said she was reporting, but instead basing her story on a very tragic real-life event. Still, in their place, I would probably not be happy either."}, {"userName": "Larraine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6092728-larraine", "userReview": "Moody, even \"Gothic\" (as at least one reviewer suggested), this novel tells the story of three horrific murders in West Ireland countryside.

He is obviously mentally ill. There is no sympathy for him and a lot of fear. The local constabulary is afraid of him. Soon he sets his sights on a young mother and her child....This is literary fiction at its best. It's not a fast read. I had to go back a few times to check things that I had read. O'Brien is an amazing writer. She lives in London. One article I read said that she is not welcome in Ireland. I can see why. She as no patience for the Irish adherence to Roman Catholicism. The abuse that children have suffered there at the hands of the clergy is well known. I loved this book. It challenged me.

His uncaring and rough father didn\u2019t have much use for the boy and young Mich soon finds himself getting into mischief. It wasn\u2019t long before he was sent off to St. Malachi\u2019s, a \u2018detention center\u2019 for juveniles. It was there Michen suffered abuse and torture at the hands of both older boys and the guards, who were supposed to protect him. He couldn\u2019t even turn to the priests, since some of them were more than happy to use a na\u00efve boy for their own desires. You can hardly blame Michen for becoming a \u2018monster\u2019 in later life.Mich hears voices and sees visions. The \u2018horned\u2019 man who walks beside him tells him to do things and sometimes he cannot resist. O\u2019Kane is tormented by the \u2018worms\u2019 that eat at his brain and cause him to laugh or cry hysterically. Gradually growing more and more out of control it is only a matter of time before he does something horrible. The \u2018horned\u2019 man wants blood and Mich will not deny him.O\u2019Brien has taken an actual crime (or rather a series of crimes) and created a haunting work. She has brought to life not only O\u2019Kane, but also the members of his family, those in the village who are terrified of him and the people whose lives he will eventually take. His victims are not faceless, since we come to know these people and are horrified when their paths cross O\u2019Kane\u2019s.The story takes place in the Irish countryside, which O\u2019Brien brings to life and almost turns it into a character. The woods and fields both tempt and threaten those who enter them. In the end it appears that there may indeed be something in the woods that talked to young Michen, as he slept amongst their branches as a child. Something that may not have gone with O\u2019Kane to meet his final fate but remains to touch others.I have to admit to initially being annoyed and sometimes confused by O\u2019Brien\u2019s style. A different character tells each chapter and the point of view rapidly changes from that of O\u2019Kane to that of his victims. We sometimes see the same incident from several perspectives, plus O\u2019Kane himself doesn\u2019t seem able, at times, to actually tell reality from the madness that gradually overcomes him.First, O\u2019Brien makes us feel sympathy for the young Michen and then shows us the evil of which he is capable. Even after we witness his madness and the horrors he inflicts we can\u2019t help but still feel sadness at what he has become.

In the Forest is the story of a boy destroyed by the system intending to help or \"correct\" him. Only after a few glimpses at this destruction, we meet him as an \"adult,\" when he returns from a recent stint in prison to his hometown, where he will murder a young mother and her child, along with a priest. There are many reasons why I am angry with this book. The first is that once O'Kane's fascination with the mother became clear, I was propelled to keep reading, quickly, as if the fact that I didn't put the book down would mean that the searchers would find her in time (whether or not the victims died is left in suspense for many chapters, until close til the end of the book), that she and her son would be tired, and dehydrated, maybe wounded, but alive. But all of that suspended hope was for nothing. There was no redemption for the victims, no redemption for the killer, I hated the villagers for not reporting the abduction... The book was about hell. Hell on earth. And I just didn't realize that was what I was signing up for when I started the book, somehow. Others may not find this book so upsetting. Indeed, most of the reviews I have seen for this book are overwhelmingly positive. But as the mother of a young child, this isn't the kind of experience I want to walk into unknowingly."}, {"userName": "Matt McCormick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43644694-matt-mccormick", "userReview": "I appreciate fiction written by writers outside of the United States. I believe that along with the story I get a small sense of their culture and their perspective on life. Set in rural Ireland, Edna O'Brien provides an emotionally complex tale that would fit in just about poor society. We know the outcome before the pages take us there and find few, if any real surprises, but the reader can't help feeling dread accumulate as O'Brien builds the tale to its awful conclusion.When I finished the book I thought how, as a culture, we are ready to spend billions to protect ourselves against various cancers or on surgical tools that might extend an already long life by a few more years yet spend relatively nothing to deal with mental illness.O'Brien was careful to make her principal character's crime so horrendous that the reader couldn't actual feel sorry for him or excuse him because of his mental state. Still, she allows us to see other culprits to can share some of the responsibility; institutions that prey on, rather than for, children and a society that too often believes acts of violence can cure the violent.I was impressed with how Ms O'Brien could develop a character in just a few sentences. I was also impressed that her female characters were especially strong and mature.In the Forest: A Novel was a good read during some cloudy, dreary and cold mid-west days."}, {"userName": "Stephanie \"Jedigal\"", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/548358-stephanie-jedigal", "userReview": "Well, I was a little leery (?sp.) of this book after reading a friend's comment. But I liked it. Okay, parts of it were hard. A lot of parts. Perhaps the most disturbing thing is to peer into the mind of a crazy person, not enough to really know what it would be like to be crazy, but enough to be scared, and to wish to change it. What I imagine, is an author who was aware of all the various and conflicting emotions and viewpoints in the community of the events that inspired the book. And her maybe wanting to tell the story of the community too, not just the story of the victims and the perpetrator. I thought it was very skillful and very sad. I like O'Brien's tightrope walk between empathy and \"just the facts\". I thought she did a great job of painting a picture, but not pushing her interpretation of the picture on the reader.Interesting in contrast to Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" which I read not that long ago. Capote definitely injected much of his personal views. And gave you ALL the details, instead of what O'Brien does, which is to look at the big picture and pick out parts that will illustrate the whole. Compared to \"In Cold Blood\", \"In the Forest\" is more like a poem, a few words manage to convey a lot. Anyway, I did enjoy, but b/c of the subject, I wouldn't go around recommending it to most of my friends, unless they asked."}, {"userName": "Ian Mapp", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1598886-ian-mapp", "userReview": "Don't know where I found this little beauty from but it was a contender for book of the year.Based on a true story (the fictionalisation of which caused uproar in West Ireland) it tells the story of the \"Kinderschrek\" a disturbed youth that goes on to murder an artistic mother, her child and a priest.The book excels in telling a truely rounded stroy. The boy, Mich O Kane, suffers in his youth after getting involved with a firearrm. His mother dies and he is institutionalised and abused physically and sexually in a care home.On his release (and after travels in England) he returns to the village, living like an animal on the fringes. He is cared for by the more concerned villagers but his bloodlust gets him into trouble.In the meantime, a young artist moves into the delappidated hourse that Mich Played in with her daughter. She is a free spirit avoiding the approach of men and like many things in the book, has a relationship with nature and is some sort of druid.She is kidnapped by Mich - who kills her, her child and then engages the services of a priest to serve the last rites. He also goes.This would all be standard fare, if it wasnt for the quality of the writing, the characterisation and the way that everything is tied back to nature.It really is a special book."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4914087-christie", "userReview": "Michael O\u2019Kane is one of those troubled kids who slips through the cracks.

His stint in reform school is brutal and not even the priests offer solace.O\u2019Kane is the central character of Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s riveting (and difficult) novel In the Forest. Reading this book reminded me a little bit of reading Joyce Carol Oates. I want to like Oates but I find her difficult to read. Still, I know that if I stick to it I\u2019ll often feel rewarded in the end. O\u2019Brien is an Irish writer and I was happier when I was able to read this book for longer stretches of time. After a half an hour or so I got used to the rhythm of the language and it became as musical as the Irish lilt is to the ear.Ultimately though In the Forest is a brutal story. O\u2019Kane returns home after his latest stint behind bars and wreaks havoc. Everyone in the village is afraid of him; he\u2019s clearly dangerous and crazy. O\u2019Brien\u2019s book is based on true events, but I won\u2019t tell you more than that. I will tell you that there is a moment at the end of the book that is deeply touching and unexpected.

En dan bedoel ik niet dat het een slecht boek is, in tegendeel, maar het verhaal is zo ijzingwekkend dat ik er niet van kon slapen. Het is overigens een whydunnit en geen whodunnit.Ik las het terwijl ik voor het eerst alleen met mijn kindertjes op vakantie was, een overwinning op zich, en dan moet je dus niet een boek lezen over de ontvoering van een alleenstaande moeder met kind. Ril, ril. Wat mij zo opviel was dat iedereen in het dorp zo gefixeerd was op zijn/haar eigen hachje dat ze daardoor dat wat ze zien of horen van hetgene er met Eily gebeurt, gewoonweg wegredeneren. Hier stelt Edna O'Brien voor mijn gevoel de lezer de vraag: hoe zou u reageren?Pas achteraf las ik de blurb waarop vermeld staat dat het gebaseerd is op feiten.

It's based off a true story that I want to look more into. I think O'Brien did a good job at creating this intense atmosphere, it kept you at the edge of your seat with each chapter.The characters were well developed, Eily & Maddie were likeable which made it tougher when Mich got hold of them. Mich was not a nice character, I knew I should have felt some small remorse for him because of the horrendous childhood he had, but he was just so evil through & through that I didn't feel anything but hatred for him. I will say that I felt the priest guy was under developed because when he was taken I didn't really know enough about him to feel what I felt when it was Eily & Maddie that was taken.Well written, upsetting scenes, interesting characters.

She does not sympathise with the murderer, although there is a strong suggestion that the institutions he grew up in could and should have treated a disturbed boy differently.
