I can just get lost in her stories and they always help me get out of reading slumps and are also the perfect choice whenever I don\u2019t know what I want to read. \u201cThe Longest Holiday\u201d was once again a great novel and I really liked it. The characters were great and the plot was interesting from start to finish. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that I felt like the ending was a little abrupt but overall, that didn\u2019t really spoil my reading experience. Now I have 4 more of her books to finish before her latest novel comes out in May and even though I\u2019m a little pressed for time, I\u2019m still looking forward to reading them and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be just as much fun as all her other books!"}, {"userName": "Rea Cobb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5530091-rea-cobb", "userReview": "I have always been a huge fan of Paige Toon, she is definitely one of my top ten authors and having read all of her books I can honestly say not a single one of them disappoint. When I was out shopping on Tuesday I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw a copy of The Longest Holiday sitting staring at me days before publication so I quickly snapped up my copy feeling like a criminal! ( I did pay!)The synopsis sounded intriguing and exciting so I couldn\u2019t wait to start reading. Laura is our protagonist and what a fabulous character she is. She is easy to warm to and she seemed so lifelike she is my favourite female character from Paige Toons books. After a revelation about Laura\u2019s husband Matthew comes to light she needs to get away to clear her head and have time to think about whether or not she can forgive her husband and save her marriage. Laura jets away to Florida\u2019s Key West with her friend Marty and her friend Bridget.It\u2019s not long before her thoughts are distracted by the gorgeously hot Leo. But are her feelings for Leo just confusing matters more, I mean the holiday has to come to an end at some point surely?The storyline was so captivating and fresh, I was hooked from the first chapter and so it soon became clear that this was going to be a book that you can\u2019t put down. I loved how unpredictable the book was there was no way of predicting what was going to happen next. The author also puts a pretty shocking twist towards the end which I never saw coming. The whole of the book was fantastically written the descriptive writing made you feel as though you were there holidaying with Laura and towards the end of the book the writing is very beautifully written and touching.Leo is a perfect male role, when we first meet him he feels a little mysterious but as we get to know more about his character and his background you can\u2019t help but get a little hot under the collar when he is around!This is an amazing read and I would even go as far as to say I think it is my favourite Paige Toon book. I was a little shocked by the ending I was still engrossed in the storyline and then suddenly it was the Epilogue! But we are not left on a cliff hanger the author ties things up nicely, although I would be more than happy if Paige Toon decides to bring these characters back in a sequel. The only problem now is I feel rather deflated now I have finished I think the characters and storyline will be in my mind for a while yet! Easily one of the best books I have read in a long time, a perfect holiday read,"}, {"userName": "loveandstolenkisses", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15400418-loveandstolenkisses", "userReview": "Okay, I need to say this. Poor Laura. Poor, poor Laura.One of the things I love in Paiges books is how she revisit earlier characters from her other books. In this case Laura, the maincharacter, is the same Laura from Chasing Daisy. To people who have not read Chasing Daisy, I will short tell her prestory, and beware it will be a spoiler. She was the girlfriend to racedriver Will Trust. They were friends and sweethearts from an early age. The perfect IT couple. After he dies in a car accident, she is left with dealing with her sorrow, guilt, and how sorry people she doesn't know feels for her. Some even write a song about her and Will. It is really sad. So it's no wonder that she doubts that she ever will be able to smile, and feel happy again. But then she meets Matthew, and he changes the world for her. She falls madly in love with him.Matthew will be an another character you already know too. He is mentioned in One Perfect Summer, and one of those things I loved about him, is how nice and gentle he is. I bet that was the excact same thing Laura fell for. He is one of those character that never will do anything to hurt an another person. But something do happen, and this is what The Longest Holiday is about.Matthew gets very drunk on his stag, and somehow he meets a girl. One thing leads to the other, and they end up having sex in the clubs toilet. After 7 months of more than happy marriage with Matthew, Laura one day suddenly see a message from this girl telling Matthew that she is pregnant with his child. The world fall crashing down at her feets. She is humiliated, angry, and can't deal with the fact that her husband is to be a father to an another womans child.By picking exact these characters out I feel you got a prestory, so you understand the hurt Laura must be feeling, when her perfect husband suddenly isn't so perfect anymore. And the confusion both he and Laura must feel onto how something like this could happen. I know I was confused and angry how Matthew could let things go that wild on his stag.NOTE: the story can easily be read if you haven't read Chasing Daisy, and One Perfect Summer. You will just learn the characters to know on a different way, but it is not a necessity.Matthew hates the situation. He is in danger of losing Laura. The girl he loves more than anything. But because of his good nature he of course wants to be a part of the childs life too. Something Laura find difficult to deal with - his mistake will be an eternal reminder to her in the shape of a child - so when some of her friends offer her to tag along on a vacation to the Keys Islands she follows them. She needs distance to think this through, and learn how to deal with how her life now will be.And this is what The Longest Holiday is about. Will Laura learn how to deal with it, and go back to Matthew? Will she be able to forgive him?But Leo, a scuba diver, Laura meets, will complicate the things a bit more. She is very attracted to him, and when she needs more time to think, he let her move into his house that he share with his family.Leo is all that she needs. Someone that understands, and reassures her. But Leo will come with his own past, and Laura changes his vision on life too. I like the metaphor with Leo's house that are almost falling apart, and that Laura repair it to get it back to what it once was. And like Laura, you will fall just as much in love with Leo as she does.But Laura learns that no matter how far away you go, the problems will always follow you. When Laura goes back to England she has to face Matthew, - her best friend and lover that fights for her though out the whole book. I love how Matthew is written in such a compassionate way - he isn't turned into a villian, and when she is with Matthew all the good they had together, and how easy it still is, when she doesn't think of his mistake, do plays a role, and why it is that you keep guessing through the whole book onto who she will chose. Leo might just have been a part of her escape, and nothing more.I really enjoyed reading The Longest Holiday. Paige understands to write a love story that captures you. One thing Paige is also great at doing is writing place descriptions and get the aura feeling into her story. I could hear the latin music in the background, smell the cigar smoke, and feel the sun on my skin while I was reading. I have never been to the Keys Island, but while I was reading, I traveled there.A great beach/summer read with a story that not will be easy all the time."}, {"userName": "Adele", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15942728-adele", "userReview": "Gushing over this book.

After reading a few chapters i had just finally realised that Laura was Will's Ex-Girlfriend this just made me love the book more. When I discovered that my name  CARMEN  was in it.. it just made me love the author more.Me throughout the book I was literally screaming \n CHOOSE LEO!!\nThen the last few pages .. (i'm sure if you've read the book you know what i'm talking about)THEN I realised there was an Epilogue so therefore..

Well, I just read Chasing Daisy and went on with this book, so I was really really happy to have her as the main character in this book. To be honest, I didn\u2019t really like her in Chasing Daisy, but that was just because I wanted Daisy and Will to be together. I love her now!!!Daisy moved on with Luis, Laura moved on with Matthew. Matthew, her gorgeous husband. Well, that\u2019s in the past! Seven months after the wedding Laura discovers something terrible. Matthew had sex with another girl and now that girl is pregnant!Marty, Laura\u2019s friend, takes her away from all the problems, to the beautiful Key West in Florida. Sun, fun and nothing to do!!!Her two friends want to party and meet guys, but Laura is not really in the mood. When she falls asleep the first evening, her friends go out. Laura wakes up and hears music in the neighbourhood. She decides to go for a walk and then she sees him... with his olive skin and his beautiful dark hair. What a coincidence when she sees him again on the boat, when the girls go snorkelling with the three American guys they met at their hotel. Afterwards Laura arranges diving lessons for her and her friends and is over the moon, when Jorge (the other diver) tells her, that Leo will help him during the lessons. So, LEO, that\u2019s his name. She can\u2019t wait for Monday to arrive and it\u2019s only Thursday L.The girls spend a lot of time with the American guys, there is one guy for each of them. Marty and Bridget really enjoy it, but Laura is not interested and flees. Practically into Leo\u2019s arm. Not on purpose, but it\u2019s nice and she is even happier when he invites her to his place, where she also meets Jorge. She tells them about the problem back at the hotel next door and spends the evening with them.Finally, it\u2019s Monday. When the diving course starts Leo isn\u2019t there and Laura is disappointed. But then he turns up and they become diving buddies. In the evening they all go for a drink and the two of them finally get to talk. When a storm stops the course, he shows her the Southern Most Point and more. Then she tells him about her marriage and what Matthew did, suddenly Leo is really cold and stops their day. Laura is disappointed. Even the next day, when the course continues the atmosphere is weird between them. The next day, is the day the girls leave for Miami and so she spends her last evening at Jorge\u2019s and Leo\u2019s house and finds out more about them, Jorge\u2019s sister Carmen and her boyfriend Eric, they all live there. She doesn\u2019t want to leave!Laura doesn\u2019t enjoy Miami at all and at the airport she gets a call from Matthew. The girl\u2019s had the baby and then it\u2019s clear for Laura. She doesn\u2019t want to return to Englang, no she wants to go back to Key West. She sees Jorge at the airport, because he is there to pick up his nephew and takes her back to Key West, he even offers her to stay at their place. Leo isn\u2019t there when they arrive. She bumps into him the next morning. He is surprised, but seems okay with it. On the contrary there are her parents, Marty and Matthew, but nothing changes her mind. She helps around the house and spends time with Leo, they go to the beach, night diving etc.Leo takes her to Miami, because she wants to buy a MacBook to work from there. They stay over night and Laura meets Leo\u2019s ex. The tension is huge between Leo and Laura, but nothing happens (yet). It\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ve got the hots for each other. She tells him, that her marriage is over and when their back at the house Laura can\u2019t wait and resist anymore. She kisses him and he first says no, but she convinces him and they become one (finally ;)). They enjoy every single minute with each other, mostly in his bedroom.Out of the blue Matthew turns up and Leo is angry. He gives them the time though. For Laura it is even clearer now, what she wants and she tells Leo. Matthew goes home and then her mum turns up. Also her mum tries to convince her to return to England and to Matthew, but Laura loves Leo and doesn\u2019t want to leave him. She tells him that, but he can\u2019t say it back, he\u2019s not the type for it (not yet hopefully).Laura and Leo enjoy their last few weeks together, before Laura has to return to England, because her Visa has expired. They also talk about the house and what could be the future of Leo\u2019s house. Then she leaves, Leo promises to call her.Matthew tries everything to get Laura back. He even takes her to see the baby, but enough is enough. It becomes clearer and clearer that she wants a divorce and return to Key West and to her Leo. Why is he not calling?When Leo finally calls and Laura has told Matthew about the divorce, she gets hit by a car...Leo left his mobile phone in Key West and goes back there, he even starts to renovate the house, so that it could be a guest house one day. He tries to call her all the time, but she doesn\u2019t pick up. Why?After weeks of nothing Leo has a bad dream about her and thinks something happened to her. Then his world comes crashing down, when Marty tells him that Laura\u2019s had an accident and is in coma. He immediately packs his bags and flies to England, where Bridget picks him up and helps him to see Laura. It is harder than you think though with Matthew and her parents there. When Leo doesn\u2019t want to sleep and stays at the hospital all the time, Laura\u2019s parents seem to realise how much Laura means to him. They invite him to stay at their place and start to be really nice to him. Matthew has left, so Leo can go see Laura whenever he wants. He finally knows what he wants. It\u2019s LAURA, just Laura and he tells her that he loves her.The next chapter is a few months ahead and Laura is back!!!! She is even back in Key West and she couldn\u2019t be happier. She\u2019s got the guest house and the love of her life.An amazing love story with so much chemistry and atmosphere. Laura and Leo are meant for each other and their story is so gripping and emotional. We see Laura from a total different side and you just gotta love her. Key West is the perfect setting for a story like that and the reader can feel the energy between Laura and Leo instantly. I couldn\u2019t wait to read what happens next and it was unbearable when Laura was in coma, you just want her to wake up, so that this loves tory can be complete.Romantic, gorgeous, wonderful, gripping, amazing\u2026 The perfect summer-read!!!! <3 <3 <3"}, {"userName": "Vi~Inkvotary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36290462-vi-inkvotary", "userReview": "Okay, in the end, I gave 3.5 stars - a bit more than average. And that only because during the last 100 pages happened things and the tone and style changed a bit the way I like it. For all those, who like/love a shallow story, some flippant characters, the clear but very discreet writing style of the author and a story that is nice to read but not very exciting: then this is your book. I was after a few pages already annoyed by the bitchy dialogues and that everyone wanted to tell Laura what to do, how to do it and where to do it. Christ, she is an almost thirty-year-old grown up, and can\u00b4t decide for herself what she will do with the rest of her life or if she can or will forgive her husband?? Can\u00b4t really recommend it.Honestly, if I wouldn\u00b4t have gotten this novel unintentional, I would not have put it on my reading schedule. Yes, I have one. When you review books and work together with a lot of publishers, you have to keep track on all the new releases and books you want to read. The publisher, who is responsible for the German edition of this one, was just sending me the book without any up-front notice for me. So I thought, well, okay, I got it, why don\u00b4t give it a try. But it turns out, the style of the author isn\u00b4t really for me. I read another book by her and the result was kind of the same.Laura is shocked. Her husband cheated on her right before their wedding and now he becomes a father! Together with her friend Marty she flees to Florida, to get a bit space between them and to get a chance to think about what to do next. But in Florida things change forever. She meets Leo and with him she starts to feel different and that she wants something in life, she won\u00b4t be able to get back home.The Longest Holiday is written from the personal point of view by Laura. During the story you discover bit by bit what had happened before her trip to Florida. So the reader spends part of the plot in the present and some in the past of Laura. That keeps going on until both come together and from there on the reader shares with Laura her present life. What annoyed me almost from the beginning of this novel was all the bitchy dialogues between Laura, Marty and Bridget and that everyone around Laura (except for Bridget) tried to tell her what to do, how to do and where to do. As if Laura, an almost thirty year old woman, wasn\u00b4t capable of deciding and thinking for herself. Her mother puts pressure on her, her husband and even her best friend Marty tells her how she has to feel and how to act. No wonder, that Laura starts to ignore her cell and finally turns it off for good. With such a mother and supposed to be good friend you don\u00b4t need enemies at all.A few pages before the end of the book the perspective changes into the first-person narrative of Leo and Bridget. The story becomes all of the sudden drive and a slight change in his tone. If that would have been the case from the beginning, this would have been a four or maybe five lashes book. So, it was barely a three and a half lashes.No doubt, Paige Toon has a wonderful and nice writing style. Alone how she describes the landscapes of Florida, the city of Miami or Key West itself - was bliss for the reading eye. But how she sees women, how she lets them feel, think or act, that is not really my thing.There is nothing to say when characters are not that profound and don\u00b4t have much to say. But in a modern novel about a young woman it is hard to believe or take, that she has nothing to say at all. Neither Laura\u00b4s mother nor her best friend Marty or her husband seem to be ok with the fact, that she needs time, that she can\u00b4t live with the knowledge of her husband becoming a father and that she doesn\u00b4t want to meet that baby. In fact, they try to make her feel guilty. And that made me angry. He was the one who cheated on her, he was the one who didn\u00b4t think and now they want to put that guilt on her? She has done nothing wrong. And in combination with all that bitchy behavior I soon was annoyed and finally kind of angry. No, I am not happy with the way how the author created her figures. If this is normal for Paige Toon, then I am really sorry, but such female characters are the worst to me.If you are a fan of shallow novels with some superficial characters and a soft writing style, then this is definitely your book. If not: keep your hands off. As sad as it is, but for me, Paige Toon novels don\u00b4t seem to be the right kind of book.Originally posted on Gone With The Books"}, {"userName": "Tabitha at lovenovel.co.uk", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18297568-tabitha-at-lovenovel-co-uk", "userReview": "WOWZERS\u2026get me on the first plane to Florida and take me straight to Leo please\u2026the man in this book is simply gorgeous!!! I\u2019m actually very ashamed to admit that I have not read any of Paige Toon\u2019s books before (WHY? I ask myself now!), but I can safely say that I entirely adored \u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019. It\u2019s a truly beautiful and special read that I glowingly recommend.For Laura, life couldn\u2019t be better. Seven months ago, she married Matthew, is madly in love and is living the dream. But then comes one fateful day! By accident, Laura happens to come across a facebook message to Matthew from an unfamiliar female. It seems that Matthew is not the perfect husband after all. On his stag, a week before their wedding, he did the unthinkable, and now there is a baby on the way\u2026So when her friends ask Laura to join them on a vacation to Keys Islands, Florida, she sees it as a perfect opportunity to escape the world that is crashing down around her, hoping that the distance will give her time to process her thoughts and come to terms with how her life has changed indefinitely. Will the time away from Matthew soften the betrayal that is sitting so heavily in her heart? Will she be able to learn to deal with what lies ahead? Can she even go back to Matthew at all?But Keys Island is about to throw a great deal more confusion her way in the form of captivating Cuban diver, Leo. Oh crikey\u2026I feel all swoony just writing about him! There is nothing better than a leading man that, as well as being completely gorgeous, also happens to be magnificently moody and mysterious! Blown away by how she is so instantly attracted to him, it doesn\u2019t take long before Laura has fallen quickly and completely head over heels. And although the holiday with her friends has come to an end, she is absolutely sure that she is not ready to return to the life that awaits her back in the UK. She decides to abandon her friends as they board the plane to go home, and returns to Leo\u2019s house in the hope that it will be the safe haven she still so desperately needs.A beautiful love affair between Laura and Leo unfolds. Leo becomes Laura\u2019s rock and in return, Leo starts to deal with some dark parts of his life as well. But Laura\u2019s visa is running out and it really is time to face the music at home. Will Leo simply be an incredible holiday romance and nothing more? Can she forgive Matthew and rebuild a life with him after all? You\u2019re going to have to read it to find out!!!\u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019 was positively addictive to read, as well as deeply touching and breathtakingly romantic. It was torturingly poignant at times as well, making it a very believable and emotive story. What I particularly liked about the book was how strong-minded Laura turned out to be. Once she had made her decision, she stuck by it and didn\u2019t waver under the pressures surrounding her, which was actually extremely refreshing to read when compared with many other books in this genre. And it was fabulous to experience an insight into Leo\u2019s point of view as well towards the end of the book. It\u2019s a totally splendid story, and particularly perfect as we head towards the summer season and holiday reads. I think we all just need to live in hope that there are some other Leo\u2019s out there for us all!!!

Every single one of her books have touched my heart in one way or another, and her characters are incredibly easy to relate to. Just going to put it out there and give the author a huge 5 stars, because this story deserves nothing less. A story about betrayal and heartache, but also love and dedication. Let's not forget the happy ending too, because I just love one of those! \nThe Longest Holiday is about a young woman called Laura, whose husband, Matthew, sleeps with another girl whilst on his stag-do and ends up with a baby on the way. Distraught and furious, Laura joins her two friends, Marty and Bridget, on a holiday to get away from the madness. Whilst here, Laura sets eyes on the enticing Cuban diver, Leonardo, and finds that he's bringing all of her senses back to life again since the slaughtering of her marriage with Matthew. As the days go by, and the holiday gets longer, Laura finds herself falling deeper and deeper under Leo's spell. Finally, the holiday draws to it's end, and the three girls head to the airport and are about to get on their plane home, when Laura decides that she wants to stay with Leo. The girls return without her, and the affair between the two lovers begins to blossom into something more. Matthew then flies out to try and convince Laura to return to England where she belongs. After Laura says no, Matthew goes home and then sends Laura's mother to try instead. Again, nothing tempts Laura to leave Leo's side. The only problem is, the visa that is allowing Laura to stay out there is soon to run out, and in the end she does return home, only with the promise that her and Leo will stay in touch until she can get back out there to him. Once back in England, Laura repeatedly tries to call Leo, but to no avail. The one time Leo does return her call, Laura doesn't have chance to answer as she is hit by a car, which sends her into a deep and unforgiving coma...As Leo crumbles under the depression of not hearing from Laura, he panics. Little does Laura know, Leo hasn't had his phone and hasn't been able to answer any of her calls. After receiving a message from Laura's friend, Marty, Leo flies out to England to be by Laura's side, hoping and praying that she comes out of the coma alive. The one thing Leo regrets, is that Laura said she loved him, but he never said it back. The truth is he does love her, more than she will ever know. \nThe Characters.\nLet's first just talk about Leonardo. Argh! Another fictional male crush! Why can't these guys be real, and live in the same street as you?! When Laura first meets Leo, he is moody, dark and very reserved. Until she gets to know him of course, and then he transform into this dreamy, muscular tanned man that dives and cooks and drinks beer and wants Laura all to himself. I hate this word... but he's just such a HUNK! ;) He has a dark history behind him, not to do with himself, but with his parents and siblings, and this explains the quietness. He seems to sit around pondering a lot, but this entices Laura to know what's going on in that beautiful head of his. The chemistry between Laura and Leo is electric, and there are so many moments in the book where you think, \"This is it! Something's going to happen between them! YES!\", and then it doesn't, and your heart slows down a bit and your grip loosens on your book or Kindle or whatever, and you're left there, in a bit of an emotional mess. The long looks between them, the slight touches, they are so into each other it could kill the reader, but the agony is prolonged! When IT does finally happen, it's romantic and lovely and damn, they're just so perfect for each other. I'd say I was very jealous of Laura having Leo though, because like I said, he's soooooo dreamy! Team Leo alllll the way, Matthew can jog right on!\nJust thought I'd add this in here, as I like to imagine that Leo kinda' looks like this ;)Laura, to me, did the right thing. I'm sure there's a lot of females out there that disagree, but honestly, look at what the hell Matthew did to her! Yes he apologises, he's sorry, blah blah blah, but fair play to the girl. Not only did he sleep with some girl in a toilet cubicle, but he ALSO has a child on the way. The thing is, if he had just slept with this woman, then maybe, just maybe, they could get past it and move on, but Laura will always be reminded of what happened every time she sees the child. Obviously that would just make her unhappy and I personally think that she deserves to be happy! I know, I know, she's just a made up person, but I loooove her! If I was her, I would tell Matthew bye bye, which she does in the end, so high five to Laura! WOOOP!Laura's two friend, Marty and Bridget, are pretty cool. They're against Laura staying on the holiday, but in the end, they realise that Leo does love her, and that he is the one that Laura wants to be with. I guess that's what all friends do in the end though, they support you no matter what decisions you choose to make, and that's exactly what these two do. They both kinda' fancy Leo when they first meet him but he makes it clear he's not interested in either of them. Matthew just winds me up all the way through the story. They way he's constantly whining to Laura, phoning her up all the time, asking her to go home!?! Like she's actually going to just come home to him like nothing at all has happened. Get a grip Matthew. She is on holiday, enjoying herself, not thinking about the mess that you have made of your marriage. So go away. Grrrrr! He's such a whiney, pathetic excuse for a man! I really don't like him, I really don't. The book was amazing, another piece of her imagination that I just want to live in!!!

The summer and beach atmosphere was captured really well as well.Throughout the book it started to drag for me and I couldn't connect with the story. I also had some troubles with the characters. Generally Laura was a sweet girl but I really had some problem with her decisions. I also hated how her family and friends were intervening with her relationshp. With Lo I just coudldn't warm up, he was way too distant for my taste.The book was a nice and partly sweet read which had me entertained but not emotionally involved."}, {"userName": "Lydia Bailey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45167722-lydia-bailey", "userReview": "The first book I\u2019ve read of Paige Toon\u2019s & I really enjoyed it.

But a week before the wedding, Matthew made a terrible mistake.Escaping the humiliation that is now her marriage, Laura is whisked off to Florida's Key West by her best friend Marty. A carefree holiday full of cocktails and fun, surrounded by gorgeous, tanned men, is exactly what the doctor ordered.Distraction comes in the form of sexy Cuban scuba diver Leo. Laura's instant attraction to him knocks her flying, and she falls hard.As the end of the holiday approaches, Laura doesn't want to go home. Is it time to face the music? Or is there more to Key West than a holiday romance? When I heard Paige Toon was publishing a new book this year I couldn't wait to grab my copy and Boy I wasn't disappointed. Firstly I love the cover, it was so colourful and very eye catching to anyone on a book shelve and is definitely worth buying hehe! So we meet Laura who has just got married to the man of her dreams Matthew Perry, but Laura's world all comes crashing down when she finds out her husband cheated on a week before their marriage...not the nicest thing to find out after you have got married, Laura just wanting to get away from everything is whisked away by her best friend Marty and Marty's friend Bridget to Key West where they have the times of their lives and manage to cheer Laura up, but when a handsome scuba diver distracts Laura, what is going to happen? and will she go back home after the holiday?I adored this book so much, It was superb all the way through, Paige just knows how to get her readers hooked on to her books and you feel very warm and close to the characters so easily. My favourite character would have to be Laura, you can easily warm to her and you do kind of feel sorry for her too, because she's not had the best times in life but she keeps on going, I did have a sense of deja-vu when I was reading about her ex childhood sweetheart Will trust..I was like Hold up? I've read about him in a book before now, and with the lovely help of my Facebook friends, they confirmed Laura and Will were both in Chasing Daisy. Leo a handsome scuba diver how could us readers not love him? He was very hard to warm up to at the beginning though but as you read on, you will be won over girlies, I promise! hehe.The book was never predictable, each chapter just kept leaving more surprised every time and the twist at the end Paige Toon, You clever girl, I never thought that was going to happen, You even had me in tears until the very last page. I loved and I am going to remember for months, maybe years to come, A very touching story towards the end. I have been such a big fan of Paige Toon's book for a good few years now and I just can never get enough of her books, they are always amazing and leave you feeling wanting more and more. I do urge all you big chick lit readers who are huge fans of Paige Toon, then you go grab your copies now! You will not be disappointed, It is the perfect Holiday read for this summer!"}, {"userName": "Yousra Serry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7173246-yousra-serry", "userReview": "I hate Laura.

Years ago her first love, Formula One champion Will Trust, died in a car racing accident. And then Laura met Matthew Perry; a journalist with beautiful blue eyes and she found love again. They were married shortly after meeting, and had been enjoying a blissful marriage of seven months when a Facebook message ruins it all. Turns out, Matthew drunkenly cheated on Laura at his stag do. He shagged a girl in the toilets and now this Tessa is contacting him (conveniently remembering his name-association with TV show \u2018Friends\u2019) to say that she\u2019s pregnant. Seven months pregnant, and he\u2019s the father. Laura suddenly finds herself a blushing new bride with a husband who is going to have a baby with another woman. And Matthew, being a good man, wants to be part of the baby\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t want to be an absentee dad.The only thing for Laura to do is run far, far away from London \u2013 to Key West, to be precise, with her best friend Marty and tag-along Bridget.Laura spends lazy days by the beach, drinking too much and trying not to fall apart at every text message Matthew sends, begging her to come home and sort things out with him. And then Laura meets Leo \u2013 a local diving instructor. He has movie-star good looks and secrets behind his piercing eyes. As Laura gets dangerously closer to him, she starts to wonder if he\u2019s a distraction from the destruction of her life \u2013 or something more? It doesn\u2019t help that all her friends and family are begging her to come home and choose Matthew, but what she feels for Leo can\u2019t be so easily dismissed \u2026\u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019 is the new novel from romance writer, Paige Toon. You\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t touch another Paige Toon novel with a ten-foot pole, after giving the laughably lacklustre \u2018Pictures of Lily\u2019 a 1.5/5 rating back in 2011. But, here I am, the Queen of wishful thinking.I glimpsed the premise of \u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019 and was intrigued because it reminded me, bizarrely, of Melina Marchetta\u2019s \u2018The Piper\u2019s Son.\u2019 My favourite character in that book is Georgie, a woman who is 42 and pregnant to Sam, the man who cheated on her seven years ago and got a child out of his indiscretion. I loved them, and despite their rocky road they are amongst the most romantic couplings I\u2019ve ever read. Their entire history intrigued me, and I loved the messy heartbreak they both had to overcome to be together. So, in reading this blurb it was less the Key West & Leo stuff that had me pushing past my last Paige Toon disappointment, and giving this book a chance \u2026 except (and I really shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this) Toon herself is more intrigued with the boring, easy, mushy Leo stuff and that\u2019s what the book focuses on. More\u2019s the pity. \u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019 starts from the moment Laura is on the plane, heading into Key West. She\u2019s clearly fragile and weepy, unable to escape her mind ticking over Matthew\u2019s cheating and the bundle of \u2018joy\u2019 that\u2019s to be a constant reminder of it. For the first few chapters Laura is understandably mopey while in Key West sunshine. But then she meets Leo and is dazzled by his movie-star good looks (Toon categorizes ad nauseum; his bulging arm muscles and Pavlov\u2019s Abs that trigger Laura\u2019s drool every time he gets shirtless\u2026). Leo is a local dive instructor with a Cuban background and a ramshackle house that sits beside Laura\u2019s hotel. He lives with his hodge-podge family: a half-brother, sister-in-law, nephew and a dog. Laura is intrigued, and when she opts for dive lessons she gets ever closer to him \u2026 until the time comes when she has to return to the UK. But just as she\u2019s about to get on board the plane, Matthew rings to say his baby son has been born. Laura cannot cope, and so decides to spend her entire summer in Key West, determinedly dodging her awaiting heartbreak in the UK. In deciding to stay, she also inadvertently decides to see if she and Leo have more than just chemistry between them\u2026Look, I\u2019m of the belief that readers quite like to poke at character\u2019s bruises. There\u2019s just something torturously delectable about reading someone else\u2019s heavily fractured life \u2013 and infidelity plots are the best types of fictional itches to scratch. And Laura\u2019s is particularly gruesome and intriguing. But Toon barely touches on it. Instead, Laura ignores texts from Matthew or plays a loop of the same conversation with him \u201cI need space. I need time. I\u2019m not coming home.\u201d Now, on the one hand I really wanted Laura to go home and yell at Matthew. I wanted to poke that bruise of hers and see her back in the UK as her life and love slowly unravels \u2026 But on the other hand, Toon doesn\u2019t really make Matthew that appealing a suitor. I think she tried to put Laura between a rock and a (rock hard abs) place, but Leo and Matthew are very unbalanced. Leo\u2019s all brooding secrets and movie-star good looks, while Matthew\u2019s just the drip who keeps interrupting sexy times with his text messages and is a broken record saying \u201cI love you, Laura. Come home, Laura.\u201d Gag. Toon tries to bring some appeal to Matthew through abysmal flashbacks of \u2018happier times\u2019 \u2013 but they left me cold and distant, too short to mean anything to me, and too vapid to mean anything to Laura. That being said, in relation to Laura I didn\u2019t find Matthew appealing. But by himself? Well, I\u2019d actually quite like to read his story and the complications of having a baby with your one-night-stand that contributed to the end of your marriage with the woman you love. Toon, I think, hints at a possible trajectory for Matthew in that he went to Uni with Tessa\u2019s sister (Argh! Wouldn\u2019t that be a tricky love triangle) \u2013 and even though I\u2019ve now had two misses with her, if she was to write a book about Matthew, I\u2019d probably read it. \u2018The Longest Holiday\u2019 failed big time for me on two HUGE counts. One is that Laura is quite vapid and useless. There\u2019s much made of the fact that loving Matthew helped her out of her depression over Will dying. Now we meet her when loving Leo helps her out of her depressive spiral over the end of her marriage to Matthew. She\u2019s portrayed as entirely dependent on men (and really, really ridiculously good looking ones, at that \u2013 shallow much?). The second thing was the ending \u2013 which is laughably soap opera dramatic and sudden. Never mind that the big twist isn\u2019t even properly concluded, but rather jumped to a clunky epilogue that sweeps everything Toon didn\u2019t seem able to cover under the rug. You\u2019d think I\u2019ve learned my lesson about Paige Toon \u2026 but as I said, if she has a novel for Matthew up her sleeve I\u2019ll probably read it, because his story was a million times more juicy and delicious than sad-sap, male-dependent Laura\u2019s could ever be. Props for setting up Matthew\u2019s twistingly complicated story, but that\u2019s about it."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21761462-lindsey", "userReview": "This really had some potential to be a great beach read.

I don't even know."}, {"userName": "Sclough1980", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17225447-sclough1980", "userReview": "It's worth mentioning that I have never read anything by Paige before but the lovely beachy colours of the whimsical cover drew me in immediately (note to readers - I'm fully aware that judging books by their covers is ill-advised and verboten for a bookaholic like myself - but sometimes needs must) and if this novel is anything to go by I plan to spend much more time with Ms Toon in the coming, vacationless months.The premise is an interesting one - what would you do if you were in the perfect relationship - married to a `beautiful' man who makes you happier than you've ever been, with no problems on the horizon whatsoever - and then you discover that the person you're in love with has done something so terrible before your wedding that you don't think you can ever look at them or your relationship in the same way again?This is where we find Laura Smythson at the start of the book. Her response has been to embark on a two week holiday with her best friend and a friend of her friend - both single women looking for fun and adventure in the Florida Keys. With Laura mulling over the rubble left in the wake of her marriage and the decision of whether to forgive and forget or move on with her life, there is a disconnect within the group, particularly when three attractive men, also on holiday, enter their circle. It is on an impromptu snorkelling trip that Laura meets Leo - a some-time boat captain and diving instructor. Between her immediate attraction to him and the swift change to the situation at home (revealed just before she is due to get on her flight), Laura makes an instinctive adjustment to her plans which changes the lives of all those around her.This book is incredibly engrossing and I just couldn't put it down. I felt sorry for Laura and the situation she found herself in through no fault of her own. She's a great heroine, vulnerable, yet strong and committed to the healing process, powerful enough to make difficult decisions that will allow her time and patience to work through her pain, but is no martyr to her circumstances. Leo, a fantastic romantic lead, is teeth-gnashingly sexy but flawed, scarred by family issues and at some points in the book, a virtual mute because of his desire for Laura and his confliction with her married status. You could cut the tension between them with a knife as they circle each other, neither wishing to be hurt again but unable to avoid the undeniable magnetic pull between them. It is a delight to read a romantic book where the leading male does not surrender their principles or characteristic flaws in order to be a `better man' and remains true to themselves - Leo is no submissive and fights hard to maintain his mystique - he never behaves in a traditionally romantic way (although he's incredibly brooding - phwoar!) as he's to afraid to show Laura the intensity of his true feelings for he fears that she will return to her husband following their liaison.Always in the background is Matthew, Laura's husband, a man who made a foolish, drunken mistake which is highly uncharacteristic of him and is trying to deal with the consequences. A particularly interesting piece of story-telling used in the book concerns Laura's parents (and eventually, her friends) who are supportive of the ensuing outcome of Matthew's mistake, which further alienates Laura and drives her deeper into her life in the Keys. The expectation that Laura should forgive and forget and accept her new life is key in the decisions she makes. Make no bones about it, Matthew wants Laura back - but a future for them requires significant compromise from Laura and this is one of the driving issues of the book - should Laura go back to her life and tattered marriage to try to fix a relationship she feels has been irrevocably broken or should she cut her losses and start fresh with Leo?The backdrop of the Key's is evocative and dream-like - I could visualise the colonial houses with their gingerbread trim and shutters, almost taste the cold beer that is consumed by the occupants of Leo's house in the garden every evening and the thought of spending each night with them sat on the soft furnishing used in lieu of patio furniture, surrounded by fairy lights, is extremely tempting.My only criticism of this book is that the ending is rather abrupt but I understand this. It flashes from a life-threatening situation, full of tears and tension, to an epilogue where most things have been resolved. I understand the authors desire to avoid a chocolate-boxy, tearful bedside conclusion but still I felt a tiny bit cheated that we, the loyal reader, weren't there to witness the pay-off moment.In summary, this book is delightful - a holiday in prose. I drank it down in great greedy gulps, like cold water on a hot day. You could do far worse things on a sunny day than submit yourself to reading this book - preferably outside with a daiquiri (there are nods to Ernest Hemmingway being a former resident of Key West so this would be most appropriate) and the sun shining down on you. I would prefer to be give it 4.5 stars as the ending is slightly disappointing (definitely not enough to spoil the book) but its definitely worth more than 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Lizzie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51044812-lizzie", "userReview": "This book had me laughing, crying and smiling throughout.

Second only to Sophie Kinsella. I adore her novels. They\u2019re amazing. However, I wasn\u2019t as enamoured with One Perfect Summer, her last novel, so I was a teensy bit worried about her new one The Longest Holiday. I was thrilled at the idea of Laura getting her own story \u2013 she was a background character in Chasing Daisy, and it was nice to get to know more about her. I was also thrilled Matthew from One Perfect Summer was also reappearing. Paige does that the best of all the Chick Lit authors out there \u2013 she manages to inhabit her characters all in the same world and to get updates on previous characters in newer books are awesome, because you feel like the characters are real people.The Longest Holiday sees Paige Toon back on form. This is the Paige Toon from Chasing Daisy, from Pictures of Lily, from pretty much all her novels except One Perfect Summer, and it took me a mere four or five hours to complete it, all in one sitting. Laura has been married for 7 months to Matthew, seemingly the perfect husband, until she finds out he made a horrific error in judgement, and in a bid to forget about her wrecked life, her best friend Marty drags her off on a holiday to Florida, to Key West. When Laura arrives in Key West, she loves it \u2013 nights filled with alcohol and her best friends, a distraction in the form a sexy scuba-diver intructor, Leo, and Laura realises she doesn\u2019t want to go home when there\u2019s nothing really waiting for her in rainy old England. So she decides to stay, but is Leo just a holiday fling or is it the real deal?I loved The Longest Holiday! I really did. I loved the Florida setting (if I won the lottery there\u2019s a 99% chance I\u2019d move to Florida for good, I LOVE Florida), I loved hearing about the Key West, a bit of Florida I\u2019ve never visited but am now desperate to. I really loved Laura. We never got to know much of her in Chasing Daisy, because the novel wasn\u2019t about her, she was Will\u2019s girlfriend but there weren\u2019t many scenes with her in, so it was really interesting for her to get her own novel and I very much enjoyed getting to know her. I felt so sad for her, having known previously what had happened with Will, and then learning what Matthew did, she was very much a character you could call unlucky-in-love. I always love novels where characters escape their normal lives, and seeing Laura escape \u2013 and stay \u2013 in the Key West was awesome. I loved Leo, Jorge, Carmen, and the house they stayed in (I\u2019ve never known a house be such an important aspect to a book but it was!). There were some really amazing characters in the novel, and it was a pleasure to get to know them all.My only complaint about The Longest Holiday and it didn\u2019t detract from the book, it\u2019s merely a personal observation, but I felt sad for Matthew. I loved Matthew in One Perfect Summer, and I felt he was underutilised in The Longest Holiday, being cast in the bad guy role. That\u2019s it. Like I said, personal observation. Apart from that I adored the book. As I said previously, this is Toon at her best. She\u2019s one of the finest, sharpest Chick Lit writers around and I wish she\u2019d write more books \u2013 something that\u2019s coming true next year when she\u2019ll be publishing two novels, her regular Chick Lit novel plus a new Young Adult series starring Johnny Jefferson\u2019s teenage daughter that he had no idea about! I\u2019m so excited. You have to read The Longest Holiday, it\u2019s the perfect summer read, and I\u2019m sad it\u2019s over. It was written so, so well \u2013 Toon is one of my favourite writers, and never disappoints. This was a brilliant, brilliant read, and as always with a Paige Toon book, I loved the romance, loved the love story.

Insgesamt finde ich die Charaktere jedoch etwas schwach gezeichnet, vor allem die Nebencharaktere wirken platt und ohne Tiefe.Dennoch ist die Handlung sehr angenehm, sie ist an sich sehr ruhig und kommt zumeist (bis auf eine Ausnahme) ohne gro\u00dfartige Wendungen und Spannungen aus. Der Spannungsbogen ist ausgeglichen und steigt im letzten Viertel des Buches nochmals an. Das Leseerlebnis ist entspannt und angenehm, ich hatte das Buch innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit ausgelesen. Insgesamt ist \u201aSommer f\u00fcr immer\u2018 von Paige Toon eine sch\u00f6ne, seichte und relativ anspruchslose Sommerlekt\u00fcre, deren Charaktere meiner Meinung nach ein bisschen mehr Detail nicht schaden k\u00f6nnte."}, {"userName": "Emma Star Crossed Reviews ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36188389-emma-star-crossed-reviews", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Star Crossed Reviews Sometimes secrets surface after the wedding date.'Don't wait for the storm to pass; learn to dance in the rain\u2026'Laura has been married to the man of her dreams for seven months. But a week before the wedding, Matthew made a terrible mistake.Escaping the humiliation that is now her marriage, Laura is whisked off to Florida's Key West by her best friend Marty. A carefree holiday full of cocktails and fun, surrounded by gorgeous, tanned men, is exactly what the doctor ordered.Distraction comes in the form of sexy Cuban scuba diver Leo. Laura's instant attraction to him knocks her flying, and she falls hard.As the end of the holiday approaches, Laura doesn't want to go home. Is it time to face the music? Or is there more to Key West than a holiday romance?Oh wow. What a great book. I love Paige's books and\u00a0I think that this just beat Lucy in the Sky as my favourite Paige Toon book. As with all of Paige's books I was hooked instantly. I don't know how she does that but, I love it.The location well, it's just heavenly. The sun, the sand and then the men. Oh the men and by men I really mean man.Leo. That man is hot, sexy and troubled. A chiselled jaw, dark eyes, dark eyebrows, olive skin and short black hair. Did I mention hot and sexy? Sorry I'm a little bit in love.Lets talk about Laura. Laura was first introduced in Chasing Daisy. Here she was portrayed as a perfect\u00a0socialite and quite honestly I\u00a0didn't\u00a0like her. At all. However after one or two pages of this book I completely changed my mind.This book had a little bit of everything; laughter, sadness, sun, sand, love and heartbreak. There was such a shocking twist in this book. I did not see it coming.I loved the ending of this book and I really, really hope Paige brings these characters back for a\u00a0sequel."}, {"userName": "Lianna", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10358403-lianna", "userReview": "When I heard that Paige Toon had released a new book, I was over the moon. I have followed her career since her Heat magazine days, and have enjoyed all of her previous books. So much in fact, that she is now one of my favourite authors. The Longest Holiday i'm sad to say, didn't live up to the success of the others. It started off well, with the major betrayal of Laura's husband and the escape plan with her friends, but then it didn't really go anywhere. She met Leo and his family, and found herself torn between two men; Leo and her husband Matthew. This was the main story. Something I found difficult to swallow was the lack of understanding that Laura's family and friends had regarding her predicament. Especially from her mum and best friend. It was frustrating to read. I think the problem was character development. None of the characters were fleshed out particularly well, unlike Toon's previous books. It continued along the path of Laura's struggle for nearly the entirety of the story, and then right at the end, there was a major plot change that didn't feel particularly needed or part of the story. My boyfriend said that Toon's dinner must've been ready so she rushed through the last chapter. That's exactly what it feels like; rushed and messy. It's a shame because if she'd have cut out a couple of the previous chapters, and used them at the end, it would have felt more complete. Saying all this though hasn't put me off Toon in the slightest. I love her attention to detail, and the places she chooses to write about always sound so exquisite. I also like the way that each book is connected somehow. There is always a character from another book that pops up. I think that I have an idea who her next character will be from reading this book. I'm choosing to see this as a little hiccup in Paige Toon's writing. Everyone's allowed at least one."}, {"userName": "Jasmin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10975883-jasmin", "userReview": "Ich bin ein gro\u00dfer Paige Toon Fan.Deswegen fand nat\u00fcrlich auch dieses Buch in meiner Sammlung einen Platz.Wie auch in den anderen B\u00fcchern kennt man die Hauptprotagonistin aus einem anderen Buch. Laura war die Freundin von Will Trust (dem Formal 1 Fahrer) aus \"Einmal rund um's Gl\u00fcck/Chasing Daisy\". In dem Buch erfahren wir einiges \u00fcber sie und Will. Aber das Hauptthema ist ihr Leben danach. Sie ist verheiratet mit Matthew. Einem Journalisten. Dieser betr\u00fcgt sie leider und sie versucht dem Alltag zu entfliehen und reist mit ihren Freundinnen Marty und Bridget nach Key West/Florida um wieder einen klaren Kopf zu bekommen und Entscheidungen zu treffen. Dort lernt sie Leo kennen der als Tauchlehrer arbeitet. Wie in allen Paige Toon B\u00fcchern entwickelt sich dann nat\u00fcrlich auch hier eine Liebesgeschichte zwischen Laura und Leo.Mehr kann ich leider nicht erz\u00e4hlen weil es sonst zuviel von der Geschichte wegnehmen w\u00fcrde.Ich war von der ersten Sekunden an wieder gefesselt von der Story. Ich liebe Paige Toon ihre B\u00fccher weil sie einfach so lebendig sind und man mit den Charakteren mitf\u00fchlen kann. Ich habe Laura total verstanden und habe mit ihr gef\u00fchlt. Sie hatte ein Gef\u00fchlskarussell vom Feinsten. Ich finde Paige hat das alles sehr gut gehandhabt. Auch Leo war mal wieder ein toller Mann in dem Buch.Ich kann dieses Buch jedem Empfehlen der Chick-Lit liebt aber auch andere B\u00fccher. Ich finde Paige Toon ist was f\u00fcr jeder Mann. Man mu\u00df nicht nur Chick-Lit lieben. Ihre B\u00fccher sind auch keinstenfalls zu kitschig. F\u00fcr jeden der noch kein Buch von ihr gelesen hat,gibt ihr auf jeden Fall eine Chance.Ihr werdet nicht entt\u00e4uscht sein!!!!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13223617-sara", "userReview": "The beginning of this book drew me in with its lush descriptions of beaches and sunshine, and made me want to pack a suitcase and hop on a plane. I quite liked the premise of the book (even though I'm not a huge fan of cheating used as a plot device) as I thought it would basically depict one big girly holiday that I'd want to be a part of.When I found out that Laura was actually the same as the one from 'Chasing Daisy' I almost put the book down as I really didn't like that book. I decided to stick with it and hoped that I wouldn't have a reason to give it up. We meet Leo and instantly its obvious that he will be the other love interest. While Leo seemed like a decent character and definitely a great contrast to Matthew, I just didn't really feel any chemistry between him and Laura despite how much the author tries to convince us otherwise. Maybe because the author seemed to rely on a 'tell not show' approach and their banter just seemed a little stilted to me.Have to say, Laura's parents really annoyed me - I can't believe how they took Matthew's side over their own daughter's! It's as if Laura was the one in the wrong rather than the one who was cheated on. But I liked the fact that I was able to get indignant on Laura's behalf as it meant I was connecting to some of the characters. I did finish this book (unlike the last Paige Toon book I read) because I wanted to see how it would end. This was a nice read but had nothing special. It's one of the blander chick-lit books I've read, but I'd recommend it purely for the amazing descriptions of Florida."}, {"userName": "Lou Freya", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50531419-lou-freya", "userReview": "This is a brilliant chick lit. I'd only read one Paige Toon before this and it stuck with me so I've been on the look out for another and I was delighted to come across this one. I was even more delighted when half way through I realised I recognised one of the characters as a secondary character from the previous story I read. I've since discovered that this is something the author does regularly, and I'll definitely be searching out more.\u00a0But back to this book, when I started reading I struggled to find time to read more than a few pages at a time, due to a toddler that wasn't sleeping/time/tiredness and so I struggled to get into it, and get behind any of the characters. That all changed when I hit about 40% in. And I'm glad that it did. Once I was able to read more than a few words before falling asleep with my kindle on my face I found myself unable to put it down. I loved this book. I wanted the characters to succeed. I wanted Laura to get her happy ended.\u00a0I found myself torn while reading as well, the 'baddie' who I wanted to hate, wasn't really a baddie, and I couldn't really hate him. He was just a guy. And because of this I was kept guessing until the last few pages. Either ending would have been believable, but one much more satisfying than the other.\u00a0This is a book that I'm going to keep, and one of the few that I want to read again, after reading more Paige Toon's first of course."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6456903-sophie", "userReview": "Paige Toon is one of my favourite authors and I always devour her books in a very short time. My favourite of hers is Chasing Daisy and I have yet to read one of hers that tops it, including this one. Although I really enjoyed it I didn't completely buy in to the relationship between Laura and Leo until towards the end - I think the problem was the lack of character development for Leo in the first half of the book. But the main thing that disapppointed me about this book was Paige's obvious lack of understanding for the American vernacular. Americans simply do not say things like 'Oi' or 'Do you reckon...'. It really irritated me as it would have been such a simple thing to fix - how did none of her proofreaders or editors pick this up? I noticed in the acknowledgements that Paige thanks someone for their help 'with Leo's Americanisms' - well she needs to recruit better help! Did this irritate anyone else or was it just me?!Criticisms aside, Paige is an excellent storyteller and I will continue to read her books as soon as they hit the shelves."}], "description": "He's smiling down at me with tears in his eyes as I say my solemn vow:'I, Laura, take thee, Matthew, to be my lawful wedded husband\u2026' I thought I would never feel like this about anyone ever again.
