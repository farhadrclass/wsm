I hadn't read any of her work until I read Prep, but once I finished it, I wanted to read everything she wrote. I was doubly intrigued when I found out that the protagonist of American Wife is a very thinly veiled Laura Bush.For the most part, I enjoyed American Wife. The first three sections were so engaging that I never wanted to put the book down. Alice Blackwell is the kind of character you wish were real. I found myself feeling like I were in her kitchen, listening to her stories over a cup of coffee. The Alice Blackwell in these sections is a woman that is wonderfully complex and interesting. The real magic is that all the hype about the character being modeled after Laura Bush completely disappeared. However, that complexity gets lost in the last section. If there was any doubt that Alice is Laura and that Charlie is George W, it gets thrown out the window immediately as Sittenfeld presents the Blackwells with the same history as the Bushes: the controversial 2000 election, the terrorist attacks, the failed war, even a grieving father that protests the war by camping outside the White House. At that point, I feel the book lost some of its magic for me. The prose got much more expository and the story turned heavy handed. I wish the story and its characters had maintained the same complexities it did in its earlier sections."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy", "userReview": "Rarely am I so repulsed by a book while still able to honestly say that it wasn't completely awful. I can't ignore the fact that Curtis Sittenfeld (a woman by the way. I didn't look at the picture in the book jacket and had a male author writing this in my head for well over half the book) creates one of the most interesting and well-developed characters, Alice Blackwell, for a novel that I have read in a while. The creepy part of that is she modeled Alice after Laura Bush, flagrantly so, and I'm left feeling it's all unfair somehow.I've always enjoyed historical fiction. I've given high praise to authors who seem able to \"resurrect\" actual historical figures and infuse life into them by placing them in dynamic relationships and creating a voice with conversations. Perhaps the historical figures need to be dead before writing about them, because when Sittenfeld takes the same liberties with Laura Bush, fictionalizing her actual history, I'm left with is disgust at Sittenfeld's disregard for her privacy, her public position not to mention the actual truth and have a very strong urge to dismiss this book as gossipy garbage.Sittenfeld must have expected reactions such as mine. From it's charged release during last year's Republican National Convention, the book has been criticized by many, mostly Republicans, as being salacious and untrue - two charges Sittenfeld herself agrees with. Well...maybe not the salacious part, but she certainly included enough sex to keep even the fluffiest of beach readers happy. Doing so didn't give the book an honest quality but it did manage to make it feel trashy. She tried hard enough to portray Charlie Blackwell as close to the general media's version of George W. Bush that the otherwise normal trash becomes a downright disturbing image. I wish I could scrub my brain.But not all of it is tawdry and in poor taste. Alice is so...real, in both her motivations and actions that if she were completely fictional my fingers would be tripping over themselves typing, \"just so real and complex. So full of depth.\" As a result, I feel like a hypocrite for being so turned off. After all, are any characters truly \"made up?\" It seems to me that most authors use real life subjects as inspiration for their characters, so if the author acknowledges this, and even leaves that inspiration exposed and traceable, should they get less or more credit for being authentic?When I finished reading, all I wanted to know was, \"How much of this is true?\" Enough of the events in Alice's fictional life are documented facts in Laura Bush's own that it seems more true than it is. In an interview Sittenfeld gave, she claims 85 % of it is fiction. That only the major events in each of the book's four sections (accidentally killing a classmate of hers in a car accident during high school, being a librarian and meeting her husband at a BBQ, having a husband who bought a major league baseball team, and being married to the President of the United States) are true and everything else is speculation and \"what if\"s.I guess that's fair but it still doesn't seem like it. For a book to be written about an actual First Lady, a human being entitled to the same dignity we all deserve and a woman who most of America holds in high regard (even the author herself admits that she's fascinated by her), and to speculate about private things like her sexuality, her commitment to her husband, an abortion and drug use, and dress it up as fiction to avoid being charged with slander and libel seems cowardly.The author claims her intention was not to expose Laura Bush but to write what life might be like if you happened to marry a guy who went on to become President of the United States. If she had managed to write that, and leave out her obvious bias for Laura Bush and against President Bush - she might have succeeded in writing something thought provoking and brave. While it may be thought-provoking, it certainly isn't brave...it's cheap and dangerous. Sittenfeld may have opened my eyes to the price and path of fame, but she did so at the cost of my own respect for her."}, {"userName": "TK", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/464037-tk", "userReview": "As I said in my comments when I posted this book to my \"Currently Reading\" list, I've \"never read Curtis before but an semi-obsessed with novels about First Ladies and First Daughters. Plus, I love wedding gowns.\"That's right, I was suckered in by the wedding gown! But come on -- it's a luscious dress, like a mound of whipped cream sprinkled with sugar. And truly, when I had a chance to read the ARE, I couldn't say no, since I have heard only good things about Curtis's stuff.There must be something wrong with me, because I did not enjoy this book, and the more I think about it, the less I like it. I started reading and I was excited, this Alice Cole character was promising, she seemed sincere and real. Even Charlie Blackwell was a likable enough meat-eater, despite his privledged background and carefree arrogance, because we got to know him through Alice's eyes., who loved him despite herself.I think I began to feel jipped when I realized there wasn't going to be an elaborate wedding scene in the novel, that Alice was never going to wear the wedding gown (or anything nearly like it) pictured on the book jacket. That isn't to say she doesn't get married.Ultimately, two things turned me off of this novel. First, I realized I was reading a highly fictionalized account of Laura and George W. Bush's relationship, and frankly, I don't care about them or their relationship. I would have liked this book more had it been about some completely faux, wholly invented presidential marriage. I read this book through to the end, because I had faith that Alice would do something dramatic, she'd do something to win back my respect, that would remind me why I liked her in the first place. But, ultimately, even her grandest gestures, and her most private, at a potentially pivotal point in her life, brought her right back to the status quo, to towing the line for her husband's administration and leadership. Her self-relfection and explanations were thin, and to me sounded more like justifications. Ultimately, I didn't like Alice Blackwell, the American Wife, and resented Curtis for having talked me into spending so much time with her (550 pages worth).I'm sorry. Clearly, I'm not the right reader for this book."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/388385-jeanne", "userReview": "The first 439 pages of this novel merit 5 stars. Alas! When our American wife makes it to the White House, the story falls flat on its face.Anyway, this is the engrossing (and somewhat trashy) tale of Alice Lindgren Blackwell, future first lady. Growing up in a small Wisconsin town, Alice has a good life. She is an only child who lives with her mother, father, and grandmother. Her father has a job at the bank, her mother is the perfect housewife, and her grandmother is an eccentric intellectual. Alice is beautiful and bookish, and as sweet as can be.But things change when Alice is in a car accident, an accident in which she is responsible for the death of a classmate. This is where her life takes a sordid turn!I won't give away the rest of the plot. Everyone knows that this story was loosely based on that of Laura Bush. It's fun to keep that in mind while reading, particularly when she meets her future husband, Charlie Blackwell.Alice is very likable, and you cannot help but to become involved in her story.

I certainly don't share enough fascination to have written a novel about her, but even from my own experience of meeting her VERY briefly, she is incredibly NICE. So the premise grabbed my attention.In the novel, this Laura-esque character is a bit of a contradiction -- a true free thinker and yet an obedient wife and first lady. At times it is hard to square, but I'll give Curtis Sittenfeld a break on this one, because I really love the character nonetheless. And she even does a quite generous job with the George-esque character, finding a narrative that makes him both a dufus and intensely charming -- to the point that we can almost understand how he might manage to win the presidency."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "I will have to go for two stars on this one. This 'biographical fictional' tale of Laura Bush started out five stars, but finally fell flat in the last third of the book. I struggled to finish.I also feel uncomfortable with the repulsive, salacious details provided, although the author claimed that 95% of the book is fiction. Huh?!...W.w.w.w.what?!... C.c.c.c.come again?! Building a story around a president of the USA and his wife, surely demands some respect for privacy, truth, facts, if it is so blatantly based on real people, right? Was this exploitation for sales? I think so. For this reason it deserves the lowest rating possible. Aren't we all a bit tired of media exploitation? The past election coverage in America is a text book example of it. One of millions. Why should facts interfere with a good story, yes. I am not even American, but even I felt terrorized and traumatized in the aftermath! This book is no exception.However, the first three hundred or so pages of the book, the detailed descriptions of Milwaukee and surroundings; the lives of Alice as a young teenager and young adult, the colorful social set-up, and the historical background was really well done. The information dumping to fill up too many pages, losing the tension, was not. There's moments of tragedy and brighter moments of happiness, good and less good people making up the adjectives. The realism so well used. I felt present, part of the families, a good, loyal friend of Alice's. Entrenched. Involved. Despite an effort to vilify Charles (George Bush) as a hard drinking, lazy misfit... truth or fiction?...never mind, I still liked the character, the people lover, the social animal. I don't know George Bush from Adam, but Charles was a gentle, tough, good man. Alice (Laura Bush) started out as a strong protagonist, but ended up a pathetic whiner claiming noble victim status, trying very hard to be a heroine, but alas, did not make it - my opinion. Remarkable, maybe.I should have stopped reading before they arrived in the White House, and just ignored the gory details of the 'fiction' surrounding them. How do we distinguish between facts and fiction? The ending... where is it?Two forced stars. Sorry. One of us in this experience was lying, and it's not going to be me.

One of the best books I've read this year.Just forget what you might have heard about this book being a mirror of the life of Laura Bush (it is, but ...), it's really about the life of one woman, and purely on its own merits as a novel, it\u2019s moving, thoughtful and wonderfully wrought. The author gives Alice (and Charlie) complexity, hopes and fears \u2014 and lives, even if their lives (in the White House and before and after) aren\u2019t like ours. She empathetically details the burdens and isolation of being famous, the doubts and regrets people carry with them through their lives, and the challenges that married couples face over the years. Sweeping and at the same time intensely personal, \u201cAmerican Wife\u201d explores the most intimate parts of Alice\u2019s life and marriage with a piercing realism that captures the height and depth of emotions without ever straying into melodrama.It\u2019s one of those rare books that when you have to put it down for a while, you wonder what the characters are doing while you\u2019re gone.

And while I wasn't thrilled when I discovered that the main character of this book was based upon Laura Bush, I remembered how brilliantly Ms. Sittenfeld crafted the coming of age story of her young protagonist in Prep. I suspected that her treatment of Laura Bush masquerading as Alice Lindgren Blackwell would be equally engaging. For the greater part of the book, I was not disappointed. An American Wife proved to be a refreshingly modern rendition of a classic American coming of age. However, the book's final chapter proved to be a bit of a let down. It seems that the author lost her focus after the main characters moved into the white house. I could barely endure the main character's laundry list of complaints and regrets about her role as first lady. It was distracting and it almost ruined a perfectly lovely book."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185638-liz", "userReview": "I'm surprised, but so far I *really* like this. The main character is very compelling and I love the grandmother. More soon.... 9/30: The first chapters are definitely the best, and my biggest problem with this novel is all the TELLING instead of SHOWING. There was so much rumination, explanation, summary, etc. that it started driving me crazy, and the last 150 pages were tough to get through. It needed more scenes, action, dialogue. Also, how did the fairly interesting young Alice become this country club Junior League person? Alice gets really dull, and we don't really see/understand her transformation b/c of the time shifts between sections.It was creepy to have to imagine George W. Bush having sex, too, for sure. That was another problem--I was always thinking about the real-life \"characters,\" and so it's hard for me to respond to _American Wife_ as a novel. I wonder if this would be a better book if it were completely fictional? The grandmother was still my favorite character.

It was like being brought up short: \"Oh yeah...she's the First Lady. Damn.\"Of course it's the parallel to that other First Lady that has people reading this book but it's in the first three sections that Sittenfeld creates this interesting and complex character (yeah, she's also pretty passive, but I understood why she was) that you can almost detach from that other First Lady.On reading some of the bad reviews (\"here\" as well as \"there\") I wonder whether people are allowing their antipathy for the Bush administration to color their opinions. I understand this (to an extent) but I also understand how Sittenfeld can take a premise (see 2004 Salon article) and turn it into something that's not a memoir or a biography but a mostly unique work of fiction that is loosely inspired by real people and events."}, {"userName": "Travis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/414772-travis", "userReview": "wow, my foray into new fiction turned ugly with the first of many sex scenes between a Laura Bush a clef and a George W. Bush a clef. Then it turned uglier with each further insight into GW's pretend sex life. Such as \"I held his penis. It had a nice weight\" or somehting like that. You have to be a sick fuck to want to think about GWs penis. Plus this is one of those books whose back covers calls it \"brave\" and that pisses me off. Usually it means it's some milquetoast bullshit that tries to use little words to great effect, little sound, little fury, little signifying. And that's what this is, a scurillous little romp with lame dialogue which adds up to 0 insight into how 2 private persons become intensely powerful, and how they inhabit their power or their poewr inhabits them. That's really why I read this book, because of my interest in the everyday of the great, in contrast to the past many decades of democratic fiction (you might call it) with its obsessive attention to the ephemera of little lives, down to the brands that occur in them and their faintest (especially their faintest) sensoria. So this is a peculiar hybrid, an entry that hustles itself into the slaughterhouse of fiction, as Moretti calls it, but which is so interesting for that reason: an effort to tell big stories as if they were the same as little stories, but with a different adress. A new entry in the venerable tradition of political pornography, in which the pornography, rather than discrediting \"a great one\" (un grand), burnishes his title to normalcy.Oh, plus I love how the word \"zaftig\" stands out like an SAT word in the pallid writing. That's what the SAT has done to us. Divided words into regular words and SAT words, and when you encounter SAT words in the middle of a book like this you say to yourself (or you are supposed to)--ooh, nice SAT word."}, {"userName": "Kate Merriman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/795054-kate-merriman", "userReview": "OK, so here\u2019s my gripe. Against no one in particular, just things not going exactly as I\u2019d thought they might.Being the recipient of ARCs (Advanced Reading Copies) of books does not automatically shield you from spoilers, does not give you back that Virgin Reader Experience. Especially if you cheat on yourself and troll around the Interwebs for feedback about the book before you\u2019ve finished reading. Doh, did it to myself again!!In this case, it\u2019s American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld. After a couple real duds from ARC programs, I was so excited to find the characters and plot entrancing and thoughtful in the first couple hundred pages. I was feeling very grateful to Random House for such a juicy, engaging, character-rich read.I was completely convinced when I started the book and saw the internal dialogue from the perspective of a First Lady that this was a completely postulated presidency in a parallel time. (How\u2019s that for alliteration?) And as the central character, Alice, began to grow into a hugely likeable and deeply flawed friend, I became even more sure that Alice could not possibly have anything to do with any living or former First Lady.Then I lost my good sense and wanted to see what the \u201cother kids are thinking.\u201dSo that\u2019s how I found out that the main character is a veiled version of Laura Bush. Now, when I pick this book back up, despite the roaringly good head start I had with it, every time the male central character has dialogue, I am tortured by hearing it as the weaselly George Bush would say it.OY. I may have wrecked this for myself. But I should keep plugging through and give my new friend Alice the benefit of the doubt.

The strength of this story comes from the first-person narration by Alice and the way the story is told. Each of the four sections of the story are defined by a place Alice lives and she tells the story of not only what's going on in her life at the time, but fills in certain details to help clue you in on the overall pattern of her life. It ends up making the story feel very conversational, like sitting down with an old friend and catching up a bit. The first hundred or so pages are all about establishing who Alice is, before we see her meet Charlie, the young Republican hot-shot whose star is on the rise. Despite being a Democrat, Alice finds herself falling for him and the two engaged in a whirlwind romance before getting engaged after just six weeks. The writing style of the book is well done and while it's not breaking any new ground, the voice of Alice still feels fresh, authentic and real. Watching Charlie's star rise until he achieves the ultimate in political success is fascinating. Even more fascinating is that the story here is loosely based on the story of former first lady Laura Bush. In the end, we get to see the private side of the political office and the toll it can take on any relationship.

I picked this book up from my local library in a moment of desperation when I had nothing else to read. I was about to pass on it when two of my \u201cholds\u201d came in, but I am so glad I cracked the front cover, because I was immediately and hopelessly hooked. American Wife offers an intimate fictional peek into the marriage of George W. and Laura Bush. Full disclosure: I am in the camp that considers George W. Bush to be among the worst presidents ever. I\u2014like many of the narrator's critics in the novel\u2014viewed Laura Bush as a \u201cStepford Wife\u201d whose background and life story held no interest for me whatsoever. I had misgivings about spending 555 pages reading a thinly-veiled account of the Bushs' rise to political prominence, and yet, I devoured this lengthy saga over the long Fourth of July weekend. The protagonist, Alice Lindgren, tells her story of unsought fame and marital compromise in such an eloquent, honest, down to earth voice, I could not help but \u201cget behind\u201d her. Likewise, the portrait Curtis Sittenfeld paints of Charlie Blackwell is \u201cW\u201d masterfully personified. He is a bawdy, self-aggrandizing F-up, and yet, like Alice, I found myself being drawn to his potency and charisma in spite of myself. Sittenfeld does an extraordinary job bringing Charlie and Alice to life in all their glory, warts and all. The prose is beautiful\u2014clear, plain and heartfelt\u2014and the story both moving and matter-of-fact. Whether you loved or hated the Bush's, or fell somewhere in between, this skillful work of modern-day historical fiction is a must-read. With the exception of a few well-established facts (e.g., Laura Bush\u2019s car accident when she was seventeen; W\u2019s DUI), the rest is all supposed to have been fabricated. The acknowledgments page lists a number of sources (primarily widely-available written works) that Ms. Sittenfeld used to craft this story, but she sure could have fooled me! I would have guessed she\u2019d spent extensive time in the White House with President and Mrs. Bush; so skillfully does she \u201cnail\u201d these characters while probing the tenuous pact Alice Lindgren\u2014and by implication Laura Bush\u2014forged to reconcile her private and public lives and preserve her personal political values without directly or publicly opposing her husband. N.B.: I\u2019m not typically one to comment on book covers, but I do take issue with this one: Alice by her own account states that she wore a simple suit on the day she wed Charlie Blackwell. So why the fancy white dress, white gloves, and two- (or is it three-?) carat diamond suggestive of a debutante? Is this supposed to appeal to the Harlequin set? Come on, Random House; I\u2019m sure you could have come up with a cover design that more accurately reflects the tone and theme of this superbly complex story."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Book on CD performed by Kimberly FarrFrom the book jacket On what might have been one of the most significant days in her husband\u2019s presidency, Alice Blackwell considers the strange and unlikely path that has led her to the White House \u2013 and the repercussions of a life lived, as she puts it, \u201calmost in opposition to itself.\u201dMy reactionsI was expecting a somewhat light look at a fictional first lady. What I got was every so much more \u2013 a nuanced, complex portrait of a woman who did not seek but nevertheless found herself in a very public position. I liked that Sittenfeld takes the reader back to Alice\u2019s childhood and introduces us to this young, quiet but inquisitive girl \u2013 an only child who lives in a small town with a loving family, including her grandmother who introduces her to the wonders of literature. We watch her grow to adolescence, make mistakes, grieve over losses and heartbreaks, struggle to achieve some independence, and find joy and fulfillment in her career as a librarian. While her life takes some unexpected turns, Alice remains true to herself, confident in her opinions, compassionate and thoughtful, but also willing to fight for the happiness she wants. She is no less strong because she is quiet. And when push comes to shove, she will stand up for what she believes is right and insist on her due. The author\u2019s note at the beginning tells the reader that while this is a work of fiction, the lead characters will be somewhat recognizable. And they are, but the reader should remember that this is a work of fiction \u2013 NOT historical fiction. One thing I found interesting is that I had looked at the cover of this book and assumed that this would be a story that paralleled the lives of Jack and Jackie Kennedy. I was wrong, but not at all disappointed. Kimberly Farr does a fine job performing the audio version. She has good pacing and really brought Alice to life for me."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/398968-sara", "userReview": "Well, This book was SUCH a disappointment. I loved Prep. I thought Sittenfeld was a master of nuance and capturing the excruciating sensitivity to every social nuance that is being a high school student. However, this book's main character, based on Laura Bush, is extremely uninteresting. I just never liked being inside her head, but I stubbornly kept reading. Also, the sex scenes were difficult to read because I kept having to imagine George W and Laura, and it was just too much for me. And all the Wisconsin details bugged me. I kept wanting to transport the book to Midland and Dallas, Texas. I think the novel is flawed because it is too close and then again, not close enough, to a true story."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301501-erin", "userReview": "To say that I'm not a GWB (and Laura) fan is an understatement, so I wasn't sure how I would feel about this book. I've never been one who could admire Laura while disliking her husband, and for many of the same reasons covered in the book. And after having read AMERICAN WIFE, if one can assume it has any accuracy as to Mrs. Bush, I still don't know that I LIKE her or admire her, but I found her story incredibly interesting. The novel itself is well-written, and quite a page turner. I'm anxious to discuss it."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I enjoyed \"American Wife\". Curtis Sittenfeld is a wonderful writer. I liked her first book \"Prep\" years back, too.When is this great author going to write another book??"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1788674-jill", "userReview": "Much like the protagonists of her novels American Wife and Prep, Curtis Sittenfeld, and her writing, are interesting, though interesting in a very quiet way. On the surface her work is unassuming: a charming combination of chick-lit and literary fiction. But after finishing American Wife I believe her work is more complicated than it initially appears. Sittenfeld doesn\u2019t commit to telling the most thrilling story but she does commit to respectfully recording the mundane events of a mundane person\u2019s mundane daily life\u2014and as a result, she shows that no one\u2019s life is truly mundane.I have so much love for this unshowy style. So often I feel deafened by how loud people are yelling to get their voices heard in today\u2019s world. But I can count on Sittenfeld for small but poignant renderings of unremarkable girls\u2019 daily lives. Unfortunately in American Wife, she loses the essence of her story. Instead of always magnifying on Alice, the unabashedly normal Midwestern girl who will remarkably become First Lady of the United States, the story focuses too much on Charlie, her husband and future Leader of the Free World. This broader scope weakens the novel because sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like Alice\u2019s story but merely a story in which she plays a large role. Alice\u2019s character is based on Laura Bush (indeed, my post-reading Wikipedia research shows that Ms. Bush inspired this novel a lot); thus her husband is modeled on the infamous George W. Bush. Unfortunately, it follows the Bush saga too closely. I would have preferred a simple fictional vivisection of First Lady life because the similarities to real life were eerie and distracting. It was impossible to view the characters as merely fictional creatures; I kept seeing Alice as Alice-cum-Laura Bush and Charlie as Charlie-cum-Mr. President-George W. Bush. Like her debut novel Prep, American Wife is a lesson in passivity. It\u2019s a very feminist book without proclaiming itself as such, suggesting that the people who might best lead a country\u2014in this case, women: whose inferior position has taught them compassion\u2014will never run a campaign for that very reason. We also see, again, how being white, rich and male in America can grant you your every wish. Conversely we see how fundamentally unfair it is to be a wife. A wife compromises herself for love; she repeatedly bends her wishes to accommodate her husband. The opposite is never true, however. But most of all, Sittenfeld teaches us to respect complexity. Contradictions\u2014within a country, within a family, within ourselves\u2014are inevitable. In her quiet way, she doesn\u2019t advocate a solution to these contradictions. She doesn\u2019t take a position. She simply points her finger towards mundanely complex things we see everyday and never notice. How wonderful it is to notice them."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "According to a brief interview at the end of the book, the author read some material about Laura Bush and got fascinated about why a seemingly compassionate and intelligent woman would marry someone like George W. This book with the characters of Alice and Charlie was her fictional response to that question, and like most good fiction, it probably has more truth to it than any non-fiction book written.Alice is a woman haunted by a tragic accident and who doesn't quite understand her own love for the rich, spoiled, smug frat boy she married. But they do love each other, and that's what makes this a book about a marriage in politics rather than a political book with a married couple.Sittenfeld reverses a typical biography (or fake biography) structure by focusing most on the early years of Alice and then her courtship and early marriage. A large chunk of their life together is skipped over or covered in some minor flashbacks, and this is the the time when Charlie runs for governor and then president. I loved the ending with Alice's ultimate conclusions about her relationship to Charlie and the level of responsibility she shares for his presidency as his wife. My only knocks on the book are that there's a sub-plot that came across as soap opera-ish compared to the low key narration of Alice telling her story."}, {"userName": "KatieMc", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc", "userReview": "[Laura Bush (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "Really 3.5 starsIt took a while to appreciate what this book accomplished. (And to read it. It\u2019s looong.) I once read something about how lonely an ex-president\u2019s life is. The only people who can relate are other ex-presidents. Being briefed daily about foreign affairs even after office is a really strange way to live in civilian life. But what is it truly like to be a First Lady? I think the answer to that differs quite a bit depending upon the woman. There have been some who have embraced the public eye more than others. But who was Laura Bush? Really. All I remember is how important literacy was to her. And of course I admired her for that. Also I often wondered what she saw in George W. I mean, Barack and Michelle, who could question their relationship? Or Jimmie and Rosalyn. And Ron and Nancy. Perhaps even Lady Bird and Lyndon. I can even understand Hilary and Bill. But I never did understand Laura. This book is loosely based on the Bushes, but the characters are Alice and Charlie Blackwell and they hail from Wisconsin, not Texas. Charlie buys the Brewers, not the Rangers. And Charlie and Alice\u2019s beginnings are one hot relationship. Alice is not a Republican, but a liberal who grows up in a humble middle-class home with her mother and grandmother. Her father passed a young age. She\u2019s reserved and socially tactful, and she thoroughly analyzes things she does and says and what other people do and say. Thus the long book. So if that puts you at unease, stay away. But, in Alice\u2019s being analytical, over the course of the book I developed an appreciation for what it must be like to be a first lady. And, in this case to marry into money and privilege. In the book Alice decided early on to put love first. There are so many negative things that could be said about this \u2013 giving up a career, losing friends, stifling one\u2019s opinions in public. And it isn\u2019t easy. But Alice has made her choice and she lives it to the best of her ability. (And, yes, I detested much about Charlie. He is as much like George as Alice is like Laura.) As for the quality of the book, I found it too long and there were lots of descriptions of clothing or rooms or car interiors that fell flat for me. There was unnecessary repetition. I\u2019m not a huge fan of fiction based on real lives. But here\u2019s why I\u2019m glad I read this. It realistically portrays a successful marriage - the hard work needed to make it work amidst the difficulties posed by a partner\u2019s faults. And I have a deeper understanding of what it\u2019s like to live in the oval office and be an object of the public eye. Sittenfeld doesn\u2019t make George and Laura something that they are not. She only, to the best of her ability, attempts to be objective in humanizing them. Like them or not."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133202-erin", "userReview": "I LOVED this book. Sittenfeld, a self-described \u201cstaunch liberal,\u201d read a biography on Laura Bush and found her to be absolutely fascinating and much more complex than most people realize. So in trying to understand her better, she wrote a fictional retelling of her life, and I thought she just nailed it on the head. I felt not only like i was walking in Laura Bush's shoes, but living in her skin. Told in first person, the story of Alice Lindgren Blackwell intimately follows the life of Laura Bush, including pivotal points as she grows up: her involvement in a deadly car accident at 17, meeting George W. at a friend's barbecue, encouraging him to stop drinking, and eventually becoming first lady. She plausibly fills in the gaps of Alice's life that seem like they fit the Laura Bush narrative, and Sittenfeld gets the little details right.Most surprisingly was her portrayal of Alice and Charlie Blackwell. Instead of treating Charlie like a caricature, she writes their relationship sympathetically. No, they don't agree on everything, but she loves him, understands him and knows who he is. And Charlie adores her and remains loyal until the end. I believed their relationship to be honest, complicated, and loving, despite their many differences. They are perfect complements to each other, just like I feel George and Laura are.I was debating between 4 and 5 stars but settled on 4, only because it goes off the rails slightly when Alice becomes First Lady in the last section of the book and she makes some questionable choices that I don't believe Laura Bush would EVER make. Sittenfeld wants to have her cake and eat it too--she wants to stay consistent with Alice's character and what she believes, but she wants to make liberal arguments about why the war is wrong, or why pro-life judges are scary. You can make these arguments, but I didn't think Alice would. It just jarred with the rest of the book and left me feeling a bit frustrated. But I guess that's the point--not everything she'll say and think is going to be consistent, especially with what Charlie believes.Besides that, I thought it was wonderful. The author knows how to write people, and I found it engrossing. Loved it!"}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "I got to a certain point with this and just realised I wasn't interested enough to bother picking it up again. While some aspects of Alice's character were appealing, she didn't feel like a fully rounded human being and came across as too reserved (I don't mean 'reserved' as in 'shy' - I mean it in the sense of restraining her own thoughts, feelings and reactions almost constantly) for me to empathise with her. Another problem was that I just wasn't interested in the roman \u00e0 clef element of the book. I know it's based on the life of Laura Bush, but I don't know very much about her and, as a result, the incidents based on real-life events (such as the car accident) may as well, for me, have been completely fictional. Looking over the critical responses the novel received, it seems like the biographical aspect was a major draw for both the media and a lot of readers, and I felt like I'd have got a lot more out of the story if I actually was American, had a wider knowledge of US politics or had a particular interest in Bush herself. I dare say I'd have found the later chapters more interesting simply because I'm sure they would have been more political, but this on its own wasn't enough to keep me reading. I really enjoyed Sittenfeld's Prep and although I found the tone and content quite similar, I think Prep was far easier for me to relate to because the experiences of teenagers at high school are much more universal, and Lee's flaws were easy to forgive simply because she was a teenager; not so with Alice. I think Sittenfeld is a good writer, and I'd still be interested in reading other books of hers, but American Wife, while not necessarily a BAD book, definitely wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193548-miriam", "userReview": "I only read through about page 400 of this book and I don't anticipate finishing it. I agree with the majority of other reviewers that the first part is much stronger than, well, than the portion of the rest of the book that I got through at least. I thought the opening scene was nearly perfect and there were other interesting descriptions or plot developments too, but I found the narrator as an adult unbearable. I'm pretty sure that we're supposed to find her interesting and intelligent and likeable, but I felt like, instead of demonstrating that she is any of these things Sittenfeld just constantly mentions that Alice is a librarian and drops a lot of titles of literary novels that she's reading. Perhaps, as a librarian, I should be flattered by this method of Sittenfeld's. Instead I was disappointed. I don't think telling us someone read Pale Fire - not even whether or what she thought of it - is good character description or development."}], "description": "A kind, bookish only child born in the 1940s, Alice Lindgren has no idea that she will one day end up in the White House, married to the president.
