It was published in 2003, just one year too soon to benefit from Strapless, the first book length biography of Madame Gautreau. The story begins on the family's plantation in Louisiana. Gioia Diliberto created a thrilling escape scene (the Union Army threatens their estate) worthy of Hollywood movie. In reality, their flight was probably quite dull. In Paris they did not settle into flea-bag apartment; they went to a property they owned, but Diliberto\u2019s imagination is much more fun.Where Diliberto may be spot on is in grafting a personality on to the portrait. Written in the first person, Gautreau shows herself to be adventuresome and daring particularly when it comes to making herself the center of attention. She is obsessed with her looks and who notices them. Her social climbing mother tries to get invites to parties with royalty (and former royalty \u2013 this is belle epoch Paris) and marry her daughter \u201cup\u201d. Diliberto shows how these were perfect conditions for someone to agree to this project, which was daring for its day (think: Janet Jackson, wardrobe malfunction).The author\u2019s ideas in creating Gautreau\u2019s life are excellent, but the text seems too detached to be the voice of her subject. For instance, descriptions of Gautreau\u2019s mother\u2019s reception and the brief text of the Salon unveiling are well thought out events as are how Gautreau\u2019s marriage was sprung on her and how the \u201cfolk\u201d expressed pride in their mistress\u2019s picture. These are excellent vignettes for conveying what may have happened but the narrator does not sound like the person who lived it. Similarly the situations depicting her conflicts with the mother, how her teenage heart was broken, the realities of a \u201cmarriage blanc\u201d an affair with a politician, the boredom of sitting for a portrait and the issues that arise when someone takes control of your image is are excellent creations. They are told like a reporter and not like a survivor. Purists will not like this book because it strays from the facts. I appreciated the creativity of the author and believe authors of historical fiction should have this sort of poetic license as long as they separate fact from fiction in the preface or the notes as Diliberto has done."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604014-carol", "userReview": "After reading this story about Virginia Gautreau's life and John Singer Sargent's scandalous portrait, I had to go to NYC to see it in person at the MET. It is stunning and if you look on an angle from the left side, you can see where Sargent painted over the other strap, but you can only see it by the light. I love all of Sargent's work, he was extremely talented. I did like the story of Virginia's life, born in New Orleans, raised by a prominent Creole family, later fled to Paris because of the Civil War. Virginia was quite promiscuous and a very bold woman living during the Belle \u00c9poque Paris."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383849-patrick", "userReview": "Although an entertaining read, this book's prose is average and there is no major lessons to be learned.In this historical fiction account, Virginie Gautreau is a 19th century equivalent of today's version of model/actress socialite who is thrown by her social climbing mother into French society.The few things I got out of this book are 1) Children need a stable environment to grow up properly 2) Exposing children to success at young age without having to work for it causes them to have a sense of entitlement and disaster stikes when you are on top at such a young age. 3)Any ones first sexual experience needs to be with someone they love in a LTR so they will understand and associate sex with love. 4)I do not consider marriage outside of love to be a marriage out all, I think marriage as an institution should institutionalize two people in love. I think the institution of marriage is cheapened if it is done for other causes such as saving face, solely resulting form an unwanted pregnancy, political/social alliance. In these cases, I definitley see a need for external dalliances like what happened in the past. But, I think it is very hypocritical to get married and say those vows and have external relations outside marriage."}, {"userName": "Tanya Daigle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/319897-tanya-daigle", "userReview": "This book had potential and fell short. I enjoyed the author's choice of genre but I don't think she took advantage of the available material surrounding the heroine's life and family. It was disappointing that Virginie, the woman whom the book is about, was portrayed as a woman who had the advantage of her famous beauty but never used it in a powerful way. Also, the book could have been alot more interesting if the author had delved more into the other characters dramatic lives."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "The story was good, the retelling of history was good, but I found the book oddly detached, almost passionless. It was interesting to read of the world that Mimi inhabited, and to learn the history behind the famous painting. Books such as this make me spend hours at my computer googling the paintings mentioned and I had a blast doing that. Seeing the picture of Dr Pozzi, I can see where Mimi was attracted to him!The other question I had, is regarding Aunt Julie and her friends. Did Aunt Julie join the impressionist movement and is she known? How about the other two women? Did they stick to classical painting or \"see the light\"?But Internet reseach is astonishing. It also changes the whole layout of this book!When doing a search on Julie, I found this link, which essentially says that Parlange Plantation was built in 1754 by Marquis Vincent de Ternant. The house is still owned by descedents of the Tenant family. It says that one the Ternant daughters, Julie, sister of our Marie Virginie fell in love with a man that Mama didn't like. This event finally drove Julie to her own death, as she ran upset from the house on the day of her wedding, throwing herself into the trunk of a tree, which caused massive head trauma and death. (Youch! Death by head bashing!) She supposedly haunts the place still.Ah for the joys of fiction!"}, {"userName": "Briansmom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2089495-briansmom", "userReview": "Unfortunately, this book just wasn't that good. This was the author's first novel; I think that she should stick to biographies. Her storytelling lacked something. I never felt that she ever got into the subject's (Virginie Gatreau) head: it seemed that each chapter was one long recitative of what happened (just the facts, ma'am) without any interjections of feeling or much insight, like: \"I went here. Then I went there. People weren't nice to me. I was really sad.\" etc. etc. The characters themselves are fairly flat and unlikeable. Do I know Madame X? Not really, but I don't want to, either. In the hands of this author, she is shallow, self-absorbed and boring."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19636-natasha", "userReview": "This book was a total two-face for me! I was in LOVE with it up until the actual painting was unveiled and the story hit a wall and sort of shattered.That said, I am really impressed the author was able to put this book together from so little historical documentation, and her style made the book immensely readable. I'll definitely pick up her other stuff.It was interesting to read about the hot and cold inclusion of Americans into Parisian society during Napoleon's time and after. For some reason, it wasn't until I read Desiree that I \"got\" how recently these events really transpired. This was another one of those books which makes the past seem not so distant.Definitely recommend!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28255179-susan", "userReview": "I enjoyed this historical fiction book, told from point of view of Virginie Gautreau, the subject of John Singer Sargent's famous portrait, Madame X.

I enjoyed it.I kept wondering, though, how much of this was fact, or based-on-fact. I knew not all of it was -- and this was a much better way of going about imparting sketchy-to-no information than Tilar Mazzeo did with The Widow Clicquot.But then I got to the end and found out that not only is 99% of this book fictionalized, but a surprisingly large amount of it is an outright lie. And lo, I was very angry for quite some time. I still feel disillusioned, although I now can admit that maybe I should have taken a clue from the fact that it was not in the nonfiction section.Then, too, the story was interesting to me (at least while I was reading it) because I am interested in Virginie Gautreau and I understood this as being a fictonalized biography. But if it didn't have the celebrity factor going for it -- if it were just a regular fiction novel without any noteworthy name attached -- would it have been that interesting? I'm leaning towards no."}, {"userName": "KJ Grow", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/329927-kj-grow", "userReview": "I don't know why I have this thing where I force myself to finish books I don't really like. While I found the timepiece aspect of this book enjoyable, the protagonist is so vain, shallow, and unlikeable that I actually found myself annoyed with the author for paying homage to this woman with no real depth or purpose or moral compass. John Singer Sargeant makes an entrance as a character only about 75% of the way through the book, and we actually learn very little about him."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840804-sarah", "userReview": "Liked it more than I expected to.

In the late 19th century John Singer Sargent painted his most famous portrait, that of the beautiful and scandalous Virginie Gautreau. Early in the American Civil War, Virginie and some of her family fled from their plantation near New Orleans and settled in Paris, France. Soon after, they relived the nightmare of war and loss in the Franco-Prussian War. These major events as well as personal slights from people Virginie naively trusts give shape to the remarkable woman she is by the story\u2019s end. Gioia Diliberto\u2019s story, a mix of historical accounts and use of artistic license, adds intrigue to the known narrative about this masterful painting. She inspires readers to focus on the painting's details with greater attention, understanding and curiosity."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41930809-lori", "userReview": "I have been in love with the portrait of Madame X ever since I came upon its photo on a huge , heavy art book when I was a child. The beauty and line of her body enthused me .I could sense a little daring, danger, delight which made me want to know more about the enigmatic woman.So, when this story landed in my hands I was ready to find out everything! Alas! I still don't know very much as so much of the story was invented and adjusted time-wise. Apparently, very few facts and letters etc remain to do much more than give a bare bones sketch of Madame Gautreau and a tease of the artist John Singer Sargent. Yet, this was a pleasent , entertaining read. The setting runs from New Orleans Civil war times to Paris during the Belle Epoque of Americans living abroad, strangers not truly accepted. The cool, removed narrative furthered the feeling of Madame Gautreau being separate from any belonging. The sense of flaunting tradition for the sake of being special is her signature left behind.That, and thankfully, her stunning portrait."}, {"userName": "Victoria Maghrak", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76373217-victoria-maghrak", "userReview": "I am a fan of John Singer Sargent's work and I appreciated this foray into Madame X.

In this remarkable novel, Gioia Diliberto tells Virginie's story, drawing on the sketchy historical facts to re-create Virginie's tempestuous personality and the captivating milieu of nineteenth-century Paris. Born in New Orleans and raised on a lush plantation, Virginie fled to France during the Civil War, where she was absorbed into the fascinating and wealthy world of grand ballrooms, dressmakers' salons, and artists' ateliers. Even before Sargent painted her portrait, Virginie's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of vicious Paris gossip.  Immersing the reader in Belle Epoque Paris, I Am Madame X is a compulsively readable and richly imagined novel illuminating the struggle between Virginie and Sargent over the outcome of a painting that changed their lives and affected the course of art history.", "title": "I Am Madame X", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113128.I_Am_Madame_X", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348589293l/113128.jpg", "reviews": 182, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65480.Gioia_Diliberto", "name": "Gioia Diliberto"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Art", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113128.I_Am_Madame_X", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113130.I_Am_Madame_X", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20118912-i-am-madame-x", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11356275-paris-without-end", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1029896.The_Collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23460875-diane-von-furstenberg", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1029895.A_Useful_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138255.Debutante"]}
