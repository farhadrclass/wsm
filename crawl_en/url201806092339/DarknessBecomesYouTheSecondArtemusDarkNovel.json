Thankfully it wasn\u2019t necessary as D\u2019Angelo insinuates the backstory with subtlety.Artemus Dark, AKA the Big AD, is a metaphysician extraordinaire. In his world the paranormal is an accepted part of life, existing side by side with everyday normality. The Big AD is a psychic investigator par excellence \u2013 a self-proclaimed occult scientist who investigates crimes perpetrated by the shade community.His latest case concerns two psychics being blasted with an identical blast of psychokinetic energy, resulting in mental meltdown. One of the psychics is his old pal Eddie de Winter, the other \u2013 Big AD himself. Turns out it\u2019s no coincidence but the result of a direful happening they experienced in the past.Add to the mix a dark-magic hit man hot on AD\u2019s trail, plus the visions of a spectral zero-Fahrenheit ice-woman haunting his dreams, whispering \u2018Come back to me...\u2019 and you have the ingredients for a real terror ride.Overall, Darkness Becomes You is a thrilling read, though in some places the pacing falters a tad, forcing a speed-read to catch up on the action. But despite this nit-pic D\u2019Angelo\u2019s novel spins the reader into a dark world-scape that both perturbs and fascinates. Darkness Becomes You is a gripping read and a supernatural TV hit in the making."}, {"userName": "Traci", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6901148-traci", "userReview": "I had the privilege of reading an advance copy of \"Darkness Becomes You\" after I told the author how much I enjoyed \"Dark Running.\" After the first few chapters, I knew I'd be adding future works from Mr D'Angelo to my library.This time around, AD finds himself embroiled in twin mysteries - who is trying (yet again) to kill him, and why magical power surges are affecting him and his former partner-in-crime Eddie. We also get an introduction to Griselda Soleil, a character I hope will continue to be part of AD's world. I only wish there was a way I could hang with AD (and Gris) and chat about metaphysical happenings over run smoothies. Highly recommended!"}], "description": "The restless undead prevail as ARTEMUS DARK is thrust into a terrifying case saturated with a guilt-ridden past and a mysterious, metaphysical assassin who will stop at nothing to kill him.When an old colleague suffers a catastrophic psychic meltdown on his TV show \u2013 resulting in the deaths of innocent people \u2013 Artemus finds that their past together literally comes back to haunt him.
