We learn of the nightmare of the secret police, nightly disappearances, famine gulags and torture that innocent people had to endure at the hands of a bizarre leader. I really felt the fear and the distrust of Russian citizens during this period of history throughout this book and while I have read quite a few books set around this time I had not realised so many American had been victims of Stalin's regime also.There is much about this book that I would praise. It is extremely well researched and deals with a part of history that will educate and inform the reader and you know the information while harrowing and depressing is correct and the story brilliantly told. I learned a lot from this book and am so glad I read it.A word of warning though the book reads like a history book as it is a very detailed piece of work and at times I did find it slow reading as there is a huge amount of information to digest but the book was a fantastic account of thousands of Americans who moved to the Soviet Union only to perish or be imprisoned in the harsh and cruel gulags. I had not been aware or read about this anywhere until I came across this book on Goodreads.I really felt the book could have benefited with photographs of 1930s Russia and also a map of areas mentioned would have been so helpful as I think it is important to give the reader a better idea of the setting.Overall a powerful historical read and a book that will stay with me for a long time."}, {"userName": "Anastasia Fitzgerald-Beaumont", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3044221-anastasia-fitzgerald-beaumont", "userReview": "The other Joads Many people will be familiar with the story of the Joad family from John Steinbeck\u2019s novel The Grapes of Wrath, the great epic of the Great Depression in America, or from the film of the same name directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. Tom and his family are dirt poor \u2018Okies\u2019, who escape from Oklahoma\u2019s ever expanding Dust Bowl, moving west to California in search of a better life. Instead they are met with hostility and exploitation. The Joads were lucky. There were other Joads, other poor Americans who tried to flee the Depression, going off in search of a better life, taking their families with them. But these people did not go west; they went east; they went all the way to Stalin\u2019s Russia. There they met something worse than hostility and exploitation; there they met slavery and death. This is no fiction; this is a real American tragedy, a tragedy in which the hapless and the helpless were betrayed not just by their hosts but by their own government. These are the forgotten Americans and this is a forgotten story. At least it was until the appearance of The Forsaken. From the Great Depression to the Gulags: Hope and Betrayal in Stalin\u2019s Russia by Tim Tzouliadis. I\u2019ve read several accounts of the impact of Stalin and Stalinism but this is possibly the most poignant. This is the story of people lured east in what the author describes as the least heralded migration in American history. They were lured away from their homes by lies and stupidity; the lies of Soviet propaganda and the stupidity of intellectuals like George Bernard Shaw, who swallowed the propaganda whole, seduced by the biggest Potemkin fa\u00e7ade ever devised. They were deceived also by their own countrymen, by the likes of Walter Duranty, Moscow Bureau Chief of the New York Times, who wrote articles urging Americans to come to Russia. For a man on the spot, Duranty\u2019s understanding of Russia was abysmal and his \u2018journalism\u2019 biased enough to border on deception and fraud. His reports earned him a Pulitzer Prize, which might give some insight into the true value of this benighted award.To begin with things for the Joads were not too bad. They found work in the new Ford factory on the banks of the Volga among other places. They brought their own pastimes with them, playing baseball in Moscow\u2019s Gorky Park. It was the early 1930s, a period of relative calm in Soviet history. People were generally welcoming. Still, there were worrying signs. The migrants were obliged to surrender their passports. Most of them never saw them again. Most of them were never to see America againHistory fell on Russia with the abruptness of an Arctic night. The murder of Sergey Kirov, the Leningrad party chief, in December 1934 was the beginning of an epic tragedy. As Russia moved by stages into the Great Terror, fear gripped the American community. There was no more baseball. All at once the American Embassy in Moscow was besieged to people wanting to go home. They were met not with sympathy but indifference. Those turned away were arrested in the street by the NKVD, the Soviet security police. Whole families were rounded up and sent into the night and fog of the gulags. Tzouliadis tells his story with insight and vigour, leavened by an undercurrent of incredulity and anger. It\u2019s difficult not to feel anger at the fate of so many people who were effectively abandoned. They were no more, as one American diplomat put it, merely flotsam and jetsam on the sea of life, adding that \u201cthey are born, live and die, and their existence has probably no individual effect on any governing or supervising authority.\u201dThey certainly had no effect on the despicable Joseph Davis, a multi-millionaire appointed as ambassador to Russia by President Roosevelt, on the basis of what qualification or talent is impossible to determine. While he ignored the plight of the Americans in Moscow he fawned over Stalin, even taking the infamous Moscow show trails at face value, contrary to the opinion among the rest of the embassy staff. While Americans were drawn in ever greater numbers into Soviet death camps, Davis descended into lugubrious lyricism over Stalin\u2019s \u201cexceedingly kind and gentle brown eyes\u201d.The blindness and betrayal goes on. There is Henry Wallace, vice-president during Roosevelt\u2019s third term in office, a Soviet stooge who but for fortune might have gone on to becomes President in his own right. During the war he visited Magadan in the remote Kolyma district, the very centre of the Soviet system of mass labour and mass death. In his blindness he saw nothing. Wallace was a fool. Worse still is the case of the black singer Paul Robeson, who became aware just how bad the oppression was while continuing to laud Stalin. Acutely aware of racial injustice in his own country, he was wilfully blind to murderous injustice in Soviet Russia. His speeches and actions, as Tzouliadis says, had justified, and therefore contributed to, the crimes of Stalinism, and for that at least he was morally culpable. After Davis he is the one character in the story that filled me with particular loathing. Thinking of the Joads, some lines from Boris Pasternak\u2019s novel Doctor Zhivago comes to mind. It\u2019s about Lara, the great love of Zhivago\u2019s life, whose fate sounds as an echo for all the martyred and brutalised children of the earth \u2013 \u201cOne day Lara went out and did not come back. She must have been arrested in the street, as so often happened in those days, and she died or vanished somewhere, forgotten as a nameless number on a list that was later mislaid, in one of the innumerable mixed or women\u2019s concentration camps in the north.\u201dThere are some stories of survival in The Forsaken, none more remarkable than that Thomas Sgovio from Buffalo, New York, but most have left no trace at all, unlike Lara not even a name. This important book does well to fill some of the silences of time"}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2420921-dan", "userReview": "My dad, when I was a kid, used to refer to Joseph Davies, America's 2nd Ambassador to the Soviet Union and native of our hometown, as a \"communist.\" As I got older, I used to chalk this up to a latent McCarthyism within him, but Tzouliadis has helped me understand better something I think my dad knew about: American complicity with the rise of Josef Stalin in the 1930s.Davies, among others, stands out in this book as the poster child for a quiet admiration held by many in the American government for the worker's paradise. It wasn't a love for communism per se, but it was a respect for it in light of American struggles in the Great Depression. FDR himself admired Stalin to the point of character flaw and may have done far more to set the table for the Cold War through his inattention to Stalin than the atom bomb.Sadly, as this book shows with graphic detail, even Americans were dying at the hands of Stalin in the purges. These Americans, admittedly, were no great patriots, but they had not become Soviet citizens by any legal means, either. The US had a responsibility for these people and either did not, or would not, believe the reports coming back regarding their treatment in the Gulags.Tzouliadis has done the world a favor, albeit a grim one, in giving us a picture of their experience. This book haunts. The most painful lesson is the lesson learned when the one you thought was the hero turns out to be a villain. This is true of Stalin, but it is also true of many American diplomats of the period as well...and people died due to this distortion of the truth. Tzouliadis tells a tale we should pray never repeats itself."}, {"userName": "Stefan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2167401-stefan", "userReview": "The full title of this excellent book is \"The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia\". It's a very readable non-fiction account of the lives of the many Americans who emigrated to the USSR during the Great Depression. In the 1930's the US was going through an enormous economic decline and rampant unemployment. The USSR seemed attractive to many Americans: the country was stabilizing after the October Revolution, in the middle of what was considered a grand social experiment - the first communist country. This was exciting at the time - a young country that had just overthrown Tsarist rule and was trying a new, radical form of government. Thousands of Americans emigrated, searching for work and prosperity, feeling like the original American pioneers looking for fortune in an unknown land. They found work, brought over their families, started a prosperous immigrant society. Russia in the 30's even had baseball leagues and English language newspapers. Henry Ford did good business with Stalin and helped him set up an automobile construction plant, manned by American engineers and workers.In the second half of the decade, the Stalin regime started becoming more paranoid, arresting and detaining some of the original revolutionaries in its drive to consolidate its power. This process would become completely unhinged as the years went by, leading to the arrest of hundreds of thousands of people --- including the American immigrants. Many of them ended up in the Gulag \"corrective labor camps\" - concentration camps in Northeast Russia, mainly there to mine gold and later uranium in the most horrible circumstances. The vast majority of the prisoners died within a few months of arrival, necessitating ever more new prisoners to keep the gold flowing. It's hard to wrap your mind around the amount of people who died in those camps. Meanwhile, the American embassy in Moscow was completely ineffectual in trying to protect US citizens or get them released from the Gulag system. One American ambassador actively misinformed Roosevelt to protect his own lavish lifestyle. The fact that most of the immigrant Americans were forced to release their passports and take on Russian nationality didn't help. The end result is that thousands upon thousands of Americans were basically abandoned to their fate. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that some of the prisoners who managed to survive the camps were released after the second World War, only to be re-arrested when the Cold War broke out in the years after WWII. \"The Forsaken\" details the entire period from the early 1930's through the post-Stalin years, and even deals with some of the problems researchers encountered in the post-Glasnost era when trying to access some of the historical records. This is an excellent book, well-researched and, despite the subject matter, very readable. The author deftly combines the personal stories of the American immigrants with the history of the era. The book is informative and touching at the same time.(One note: I had to find a second book to read because, after reading a few chapters of \"The Forsaken\" before bed, I had some really horrific nightmares - and this was even before I got to the more detailed descriptions of the Gulag camps. The book is very tasteful and never graphical, but it still affected me very strongly, so I read \"The Forsaken\" during the day only.)"}, {"userName": "Eugenia Vlasova", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655-eugenia-vlasova", "userReview": "One of my friends once asked me, \u201cWhy do Russians want Stalin back? He was a mass murderer and killed Russians by the millions. Why do Russian people think he was a good ruler?\u201d All I could say was, \u201cWell, if I knew the answer, I would still live in Russia\u2026 I moved to Canada, because I can't justify those sentiments.\u201d Then he continued: \u201cHave you heard about the thousands of Americans who immigrated to the Soviet Union to escape the Great Depression? And they vanished in the Gulag\u201d. Never heard of. To follow-up our discussion he sent me a gift \u2013 a book titled The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia by Tim Tzouliadis.I thought I knew quite a bit about Stalinism and the Gulag. I had read Solzhenitsyn and Shalamov. My teacher of literature encouraged us, future humanities students, to learn as much as possible about the darkest chapters of the Russian history. My family suffered from the repressions, after all. Yet, the book proved how little did I know.The Forsaken starts with the introduction of a few individuals who, among many others, left the USA for the Soviet Union lured by communist propaganda and driven by the desperation of the Great Depression. As one reviewer on Amazon said, \u201cmany saw the apparent failure of capitalism contrasted unfavorably with the apparent success of the 'Soviet experiment' and emigrated freely to join the new socialist state unaware of what the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' truly entailed.\u201d History is like a panoramic picture \u2013 you can't make out too many details there or individual faces. But the bigger picture that historians usually strive to provide makes each particular life seem unimportant. Sometimes to comprehend the lessons of history, we need portraits. Tim Tzouliadis portrayed history through life stories of a few American expats, which makes the narration more powerful and gives a reader a fiction-like experience.I read fast in both Russian and English, but it took me a few months to get through this book. I liked the writing style of Tim Tzouliadis, but what he wrote about was often overwhelmingly gloomy. I had to take a break after each dozen pages. Some episodes were particularly unbearable, so I took longer pauses. When I read about routine tortures or mass shootings \u201cby quotas\u201d, I literally felt the sour smell of blood.Yet, the book is not about ultimate suffering or the incomprehensible cruelty of the Stalin's regime. It is not even about the Soviet Union. Not solely about it. It is about little people and great powers playing a great game. And, most importantly, about the justice that was denied to millions of innocent victims, among which are thousands (probably, hundreds thousands) of Americans. \u201cAt the end of the war, allied investigators found it difficult to comprehend how one million people could have been killed in a few acres of the Nazi extermination camp at Treblinka. Only after the downfall of the regime, and the arrival of the victorious Allied armies, could the enormity of the crime be revealed\u2014and later, in Nuremberg, a measure of justice brought to bear. In the Soviet Union, there was never a victorious army to expose the consequences of Stalin\u2019s rule; nor would there ever be a Nuremberg. Instead, the victims of Kolyma, and every other terminal point of the Gulag, remained concealed even as the killings continued unabated. In Kolyma, the rhetorical question Joseph Goebbels had asked in his diary actually came true: \u201cFor when we win who will question us on our methods?\u201d, Tim Tzouliadis wrote.If I had a chance to talk to Tim Tzouliadis, I would like to ask him a few questions. How did he manage to get through those archival documents, memoirs and other evidences of the terror (the bibliography section of the book is really impressive)? I know that the people who investigated crimes of the nazi regime often suffered from the nervous breakdowns. How did he find the strength to carry on? Did he try to get access to the Russian archives? Russian authorities still keep documents about Stalin's crimes classified, but some papers were unearthed during 1990s and early 2000s, this is how I managed to find the information about my family. Did he receive any feedback from Russian readers, and, perhaps, from descendants of those who kept the repression machine running? How did American readers react to this book? Though the author realistically estimated the chances for a Nuremberg for Stalin as very slim, nearly non-existent, is there any hope for a thorough investigation of what happened in the Soviet Union and was persistently ignored by the rest of the world for decades?And, of course, I would like to thank the writer for his honest book. Your work is very important, Mr. Tzoudialis."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Scott", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1501042-elizabeth-scott", "userReview": "I knew I wanted to read this after all those books about Tatiana and Alexander by Paullina Simons, and although it took me a while to find it (someone's TBR pile is, um, a little large), I did! For some reason, probably because a Motel T is on the cover, I thought it was about Ford workers who moved to the USSR and disappeared during Stalin's decades-long Terror. But instead, Tzouliadias provides a comprehensive overview of the many Americans--some Communists committed to Stalin's cause, some simply seeking jobs during the Great Depression, and some who simply went with their families. There also were some Ford workers who went over when Henry Ford sold a factory that he was about to destroy to Stalin, and thus made is possible for the USSR to begin motor vehicle production.In a horrifying twist, most of these first cars ended up in the fleet of the NKVD, the secret police of the time--or those who arrested, tortured, and ran the prison camps in which so many died during Stalin's mass murder of close to twenty million people. (Yes, twenty million)Regardless as to why they went to the USSR, almost all of these Americans who went, even the die-hard Communists, soon found themselves rounded up and sent to one of the many camps where so many died--and although this book does focus on the Americans who moved to the USSR and died, Tzouliadis doesn't stint on discussing the effects of Stalin's brutal and mind-boggling cruelty on Russians as well as POWs in WW II, as well as the startlingly inept response those Americans who did try to get help from the US embassy or government received. (The descriptions of one of the US ambassadors at the time (along with most of his staff), made me feel sick to my stomach, as does the fact that so many documents about the Terror were classified for years by the US Government--I sure don't think as much of President Roosevelt as I used to after reading this book)Overall, this book serves as a good introduction to Stalin's ferociously efficient and brutal murder of millions, with a particular focus on those Americans who died. For an even more in-depth look at the Terror as witnessed by those who suffered most--Russians--please read The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia by Orlando Figes, which is truly outstanding, and for a ferocious rebuttal of those who supported Stalin and turned a blind eye to what he was doing---and how his purges still remain mostly unnoticed by history, read Martin Amis's blistering Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million."}, {"userName": "Margaret Sankey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861086-margaret-sankey", "userReview": "This is the overlooked story of Americans, particularly African-Americans, who left tinderbox cities like Detroit in the 1920s to work in a Soviet-Ford joint plant.

Hard as it might be to believe, thousands of American leftists moved to the Soviet Union in the Thirties, convinced it would be the vanguard of the future. Instead, they found a cruel, paranoid totalitarian state that would eventually arrest and kill them all. There are very few happy endings in this book. If you weren't shot, you were shipped off to the camps for re-education, but the camps were set up to be killing machines. You were simply worked to death, thousands of miles from anyone who could help. Tzouliadis thoroughly traces the crimes of the Soviets, and his descriptions of the elements of the Stalinist Terror - from the late night arrests by the NKVD to the torture sessions in Lubynaka prison to the show trials to the brutal transportation to Siberia and beyond to the harrowing life of a slave laborer in the land of \"social justice\" - are masterful, not to mention harrowing; but special mention should be made for the American progressives who encouraged people to emigrate to the Soviet Union and then turned a blind eye when everyone they knew in Moscow was being arrested and \"liquidated.\" There was Walter Duranty, the NY Times correspondent who never wrote a negative word during his years in Moscow. There was the US Ambassador Joseph Davies who wrote a memoir of his time in Moscow that was so obsequious the Soviet censors did not have to change a word. There was Paul Robeson, who literally sang songs to Stalin. And there was Henry Wallace - vice president in FDR's third term - who actually toured the Gulag (while in office!) and pronounced everything hunky-dory. All of these men would see their reputations destroyed during the McCarthy Era, which makes me think McCarthy may have been on to something. The connection between Stalinist Russia and certain elements of the American Left has never been presented more clearly or starkly.

Many of those Americans unjustly imprisoned freely moved to Russia for work during the Great Depression. Most of them never came back. Other Americans include military personnel from WWII. But the author also discusses the political situation between America and the Soviet Union, including the actions (or lack thereof) taken on America's behalf by our various ambassadors. In summary, they knew what was happening but did little, if anything, to stop it. It was pretty sad. The author also gives details about life in the camps for various Americans, from the few who survived to tell their tale. It's not much of anything new for gulag geeks like myself, but gripping just the same. But the American angle is new, or at least the story told in its entirety. It is another reminder of how Russia has never held itself responsible for it Communist crimes - and how other countries have not forced them to.

The research is there and the subject matter definitely has the potential to be turned into a fascinating book- this, unfortunately, is not that book. Tzouliadis writes in broad, general statements, instead of utilizing individual tales to tell the overall story of the men and women who left their lives behind in Depression-era America to begin anew in Soviet Russia. Very disappointing. I will; however, state, that I would not shy away from reading other works by Mr. Tzouliadis. Unfortunately, this book is simply poorly written and as I always say, 'life is too short to read bad books or drink cheap booze.'"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30032-james", "userReview": "This book will give you nightmares, and illustrate the great depths of the tragedy of the 20th century, the Soviet Union. The story of the Stalinist repressions is given from Americans who moved to the Soviet Union during the Depression seeking jobs or as part of socialist idealism, believing the propaganda of Stalin's regime. The depth of horrors cannot be understated, nor can the blindness that both the US government or other radicals took to the mass executions and imprisonment in the gulags of Americans. In fact, the mass murder over the course of 20 years and beyond largely discredits the Soviet Union, though it never really had to come to terms with that history since most of its actors who survived the terrors never faced repercussions."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355058-amanda", "userReview": "So, I'm one of the handful of people on Goodreads to review The Forsaken unfavorably. I'm obviously missing something, because the book received glowing acclaim and it covers one of my favorite topics, yet it was a chore to finish. Don't get me wrong \u2013 objectively, I understand the high praise. Tzouliadis has the gift of \"showing not telling\" and evinces many of the Soviet system's hypocrisies by retelling apparently insignificant anecdotes. But did it have to be so tedious?There's a lot of rich content here, but The Forsaken just seems to retell history without examining it. Many reasons are given for the events leading to American citizens' (or their descendents) imprisonment in the gulag system, but they're never really parsed. It's too bad, because it was all right there for Tzouliadis to dive into. For instance, I found so much about the immigrants' experience in the Soviet Union to be deeply rooted in American exceptionalism. The first immigrants wanted the best of both worlds; they wanted the Soviet dream of equality and economic security, but they also wanted American culture and jurisprudence. Arrested immigrants invoked the phrase \"but I'm an American\" as if it were some sort of magical protection spell. There are traces of the American tendency towards militant patriotism and forsaking those who don't buy into it wholesale. (See what I mean? It's the title of the fricken book!) I don't need my critical thinking spoon-fed to me, but I do like my historical writers to pull something thoughtful out of whatever moment in time they've chosen to research. The statement this book makes is essentially, \"A terrible thing happened, and you should care about it because it happened to Americans. Also, there's vintage torture porn.\""}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1846901-linda", "userReview": "Oh my gosh! This is a heavily documented book telling of the well-concealed history of the fate of thousands of American families who were lured Eastward, to Russia, during the Great Depression. Henry Ford set up shop there and that industry, along with many others, brought jobless Americans eagerly anticipating a good job at the least, and an Utopian Society at the most in this new order under the mighty Joseph Stalin. (Stalin actually ran adds in American newspapers enticing people to come to Russia.)I first learned of this mass migration years ago when our family read Victor Herman's horrific experience as an innocent American youth caged in Russia for 40 years in his \"Coming Out of the Ice\". \"Forsaken..\" gives more details, not only about Herman, but other Americans caught in the same Stalin nightmare. My stomach turns as I remember last spring, touring a small Stalin museum in the former Stalingrad, Russia (now named Volgograd). It was all I could do then to keep quiet as the middle-aged Russian curator gave glowing reports of the good Stalin did for Russia and how much she adored him. It's estimated 20 million of her fellow Russian citizens (including Americans whose passports were confiscated when they arrived) were murdered or worked and starved to death during Stalin's reign of terror.As I'd read this book, I'd pull up a map to see how close some of these slave labor camps were to where we presently live in Kyiv Ukraine. I would highly recommend this book to every American, no matter what your preferred genre. This is a history you never had a chance to learn about."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9854317-mary", "userReview": "I can't recommend this book highly enough. For as much as we think we may know or be aware of regaring the Stalinist period (which was so long and so deadly), lovers of freedom are going to feel the heartbreak of the fate that awaited the sincerely optimistic and forward-looking Americans who believed that the way forward for mankind was to build the \"workers' paradise\". What is tragic is that they and their ideals were betrayed by the very place that they believed would uphold freedom. The class society and descrimination in the Soviet Union was much more extreme than even what they were exposed to in the USA. In the Soviet Union, forced labour was the norm, with payment (food for subsistance) not being equal for all. The awakening of these idealists was even ruder when their own diplomats ignored them for other interests. There are many fascinating anecdotes in this book, but overall, the major theme is so well-presented, so tragic and touching, that the book may leave you in tears at times, as it did me."}, {"userName": "Linnaea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6913891-linnaea", "userReview": "This book was amazing. It is a history book about the thousands of Americans who immigrated to the USSR during the great depression and what happened to them along with the blind eyes of the American government. These people were viewed as \"flotsam and jetsam\" and were unimportant in WW2 or the beginnings of the cold war, not that many had survived the Terror of the late 1930's. Tzouliadis' book covers from the beginnings of the depression to the end of the USSR with a high focus on the area between 1934-1956. The book is very well written and does a good job of sharing the panic that men felt being unable to provide for the families in America and the hope they had in travels to the soviet republic which soon turned to terror and death as they and their loved ones were killed either by bullets or the gulag. I highly recommend this book that was written with help from the memoirs of two survivors, two men who had been taken to Russia by their father's, sent to a death camp, and through luck managed to make it back home."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983567-aaron", "userReview": "Anyone who tries to defend the policies and history of Trotsky, Lenin, or Stalin has no credibility and doesn't know what they are talking about. Trust me, I've done my homework on these things. Don't believe me--take a look at my reading list. Soviet Communism is just like the modern day Republican Party--it had principles that aren't practical, it was full of illusions and broken dreams, it was full of talking heads like Glen Beck, Rush Bimbaugh, and inevitably Soviet Communism led to a crisis in mismanagement and government. Where did all of this lead to? Oh, just the deaths of millions of people including to my surprise the deaths of many American's. This excellent book shows how many young American's bought into this false illusion, packed their bags, and were led astray into a jungle that eventually led to their deaths. Sad. True. But most of all, it's a lesson to all of us that we should be careful what ideals and leaders we put our stock into."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/756509-stephanie", "userReview": "4.5This should be required reading! I did not learn about this in any of my history classes, but most likely because it hasn't been known -- or rather accepted -- until recently. I knew Stalin was evil; I just didn't understand the depth and breadth of it until reading this book. It was difficult to read at times and very difficult to understand how this could have happened. Hitler and his concentration camps killed 6 million people. Stalin and his gulag \"labor camps\" killed nearly 3 times that amount. It is hard to even contemplate the numbers of people that were killed for no other reason, but one man's lust for power and his fear of losing control.

It is a story of thousands of Americans - misguided or driven to despair by the Depression - who went to Russia in the 1930s, most of them to perish in the Soviet prisons and concentration camps while American diplomats, journalists and government officials looked the other way.It's a heartbreaking story: these people had no Schindler, no Raoul Wallenberg. In fact, I didn't know, or had forgotten, that Wallenberg, after saving thousands of Jews from the Holocaust in Hungary, was arrested by the Russians in the last months of the war, and was rumored (we will probably never know for sure) to have perished in these same Russian concentration camps...The author does a great job showing these events in the context of overall history of both countries, the USSR as well as the US.

Thousands of Americans emigrated to the Soviet Union during the Depression in order to find work.

Basically, American officials who were aware of this stood by and did nothing to help their fellow countrymen.

I was hoping it would be more personal."}], "description": "A remarkable piece of forgotten history- the never-before-told story of Americans lured to Soviet Russia by the promise of jobs and better lives, only to meet tragic ends In 1934, a photograph was taken of a baseball team. These two rows of young men look like any group of American ballplayers, except perhaps for the Russian lettering on their jerseys. The players have left their homeland and the Great Depression in search of a better life in Stalinist Russia, but instead they will meet tragic and, until now, forgotten fates. Within four years, most of them will be arrested alongside untold numbers of other Americans. Some will be executed. Others will be sent to \"corrective labor\" camps where they will be worked to death. This book is the story of lives-the forsaken who died and those who survived.
