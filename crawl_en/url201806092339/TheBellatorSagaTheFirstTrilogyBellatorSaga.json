Check it out here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsNuw...~The Bellator Saga~ is a stunning series. Full of political intrigue, passion, romance, and mystery. It is unique and unforgettable! I simply cannot say enough about the intensity of this roller coaster ride! I enjoyed every single second! ~Dissident~Part 1~\n\n\"My Monty. I love you so.\"\n\nDissident is an action packed thriller with suspense, romance, and passion. It is the first book in the Bellator Saga. As the action shifts between flashbacks of the past and scenes in the present, Dissident is sure to hold you captive until the very end.Through the flashbacks, we experience Caroline and Jack coming together. Caroline Gerard is a passionate Democrat making a name for herself on the steps of the Capitol. As a widow, she has spent time pouring love into the lives of her two precious daughters. She has a great support system of friends, and her life seems to be complete. However, when Republican playboy Jack McIntyre makes his way into her life, everything changes. \n\n\"Would you consider yourself a sex fiend with a sentimental streak?\"\n\n Although the two sit on different sides of \"the house\", together they form a friendship that quickly develops into so much more. Jack and Caroline have an intense attraction to one another, and when they come together, Caroline finds that there is still time for her yet to experience passion and love with another man. However, the road isn't smooth sailing as Jack and Caroline have much to discover.\n\n\"Just hold on to me.\"\"Always.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the present Caroline is battling the aftermath of a government uprising. Will she have the strength to persevere?\n\n\"This is bad. This is really bad.\"\n\n\n\n\"I want you to be happy. Joyful. I want to give you everything you've ever wanted.\"\n\nTold in mostly Caroline's POV, Dissident has a perfect blend of action, suspense, and passion. The dialogue is witty, and the characters are complex. As the first book of the Saga, the main focus is to establish the conflict brewing in the government and to mark the beginning of the epic romance between Jack and Caroline. The tension from the present kept me on the edge of my seat. At every moment of horror, I thought I was going to break from the harshness of the present. And then, magically the story shifts to a flashback where love and tenderness are in full bloom. This twisted combination had me on a constant swing of emotions! ~Conscience~Part 2~\n\n\"You and me. You're my heart Caroline. Nothing else matters.\"\n\nConscience is the second book in the Bellator Saga. You must read Dissident to fully enjoy this read. Told again through flashbacks and the horrors of the present, Conscience turns up the passion, increases the pain, and the mystery of the corrupt government begins to unfold.\n\n\"One day you'll pay for everything you've done.\"\n\n As Conscience begins, Caroline wakes up in the Fed's Prison where the stakes are high. She is subjected to continuous interrogation and is forced to maintain control over her body and mind. As the physical pain increases, the emotional pain engulfs her like a virus.\n\n\"They were going to tear her apart, smash her and break her bit by bit, bone by bone and day by day until there was nothing left.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any harmless gnat can turn into a monster when granted access to power he doesn't need or deserve.\"\n\nIt is only the reprieve of her memories that bring her comfort and a sliver peace to grasp onto.\n\n\"I would do anything for you.\"\n\n The memories of Jack and Caroline together left me breathless. Their relationship has matured and strengthened into an unbreakable force. The intimacy shared between the two is explosive, and the tenderness of their love had me swooning at every turn. Jack is quite the dominant in the bedroom (my kinky reading friends need to experience JACK!), and Caroline is happy to submit to any and all of his demands.\n\n\"When we get back to our room I'm going to fuck you so hard you're going to feel me with every move you make tomorrow.\"\n\nTold in mostly Caroline's POV, Conscience most definitely brought more. More love for Caroline and Jack (and their sweet girls), more fear of the twisted government, more passion for exploring, and more intrigue. To state it plainly, this writing is smart! The plot is complex, and every piece of the puzzle is important. The relationship between the characters remains at the forefront as the backdrop of torture continues to develop. I simply could not put it down. ~Sojourn~Part 3~\n\n\"She wanted him inside her. Forever. She dreaded the thought of being without him. Without his touch, his voice, his smell.\"\n\nSojourn is the thrilling third book in the Bellator Saga. The action and terror have increased, and only one question remains, where is Jack?\n\n\"There were times when she was so blinded by pain that she'd almost forget the reasons behind it.\"\n\n Caroline is in trouble. The mounting pressure is pressing her down, and it is questionable if she will be able to survive. The Feds have put her through torture and the emotional combat warring in her mind is starting to take a toll. The memories of her past, which had previously brought her so much joy, now serve as a weapon of mass destruction. \n\n\"She'd never be okay. Not with the ghosts of the past dogging her every step.\"\n\n\n\n\"Her memories had no rhyme or reason. No order, no predictability. They'd engulf her, choke her, pull her under.\"\n\nAnd yet, hope still remains. Caroline's determination to remain true to herself and stand firm as a patriot of the United States is what keeps her grounded throughout the terror. As the story shifts from the present to the memories of the past, we grasp onto the love between Jack and Caroline. Their sexual desires are explored (and enjoyed) while the government is falling all around them. \n\n\"What do you say I suck your clit for a couple of hours while you practice calling me Mr. Governor?\"\n\n Sojourn is like a roller coaster ride. In one moment you are holding your breath from the pain Caroline is experiencing and then in the next Jack and Caroline are acting out their sexual desires that make even that \"shade of grey\" book pale in comparison. \n\n\"How about Fucking your Wife on the Dining Room Table?\"\n\n Yes! Yes, please! I think I would like that! And you will too!\n\n\"Whether he was angry or sad, joyful or indifferent. He was hers and always would be.\"\n\nTold in mostly Caroline's POV, Sojourn was a nail biting addition to the series. I was utterly terrified of what was to come (or more accurately stated, what might not come!). The complexity of the plot continues to amaze me. The characters are developed more thoroughly through each book in the series. As each layer is revealed, my love and devotion to Caroline and Jack increased. My heartbreak for the terror they experienced became my personal terror because of the close connection I felt to them both. Additionally, there are some secondary characters introduced in Sojourn which brought, even more, depth to the plot. I have no doubt they will play a pivotal role as the series continues to develop.Sojourn is by far my favorite in the series to date. It truly brought me to my knees. There were moments of tears, laughter, and heartbreak all mixed to create an unforgettable blend! Every character is critical. Every moment is unforgettable. Every choice matters. I am simply hooked on this series. My only complaint is that I have to wait a few more weeks to read the next installment. Thankfully, Phoenix will be released soon! I am on pins and needles waiting to see what happens next. I cannot recommend this series enough to my book buddies that enjoy a challenging read full of dark twists and turns and super sexy scenes! Bravo Ms. London! Bravo! The Bellator Saga was such a surprise! I had been looking forward to reading it and yet, I had no idea how much I would truly adore it! It is, by far, one of the most complex plots I have ever read. If Ms. London is writing, my Kindle will be ready! Phoenix, I am ready and waiting! To Ms. London, I say, bring it! ***The Bellator Saga****ARC graciously provided via author in exchange for an honest review!*For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Jx PinkLady Reviews \u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16496589-jx-pinklady-reviews", "userReview": "\u2605 THIS BOX SET IS CURRENTLY ON SALE FOR #99c! \u2605#oneclick here and meet Jack-->Amazon US * Amazon UK(Limited time sale. Check price before purchase.)This BELLATOR SAGA Box Set comprises of the first three books in series: Dissident, Conscience and Sojourn. It comfortably falls into a variety of genre types including contemporary romance, thriller, suspense and adventure. It\u2019s also steeped in political context and has beautiful scenes of erotic romance. Presented in the third person narrative the themes weave through the story transporting the reader to the fascinating, amazing, corrupt and frighteningly realistic world of Caroline and Jack. The world depicts a corrupt state that\u2019s fallen into disarray and illustrates the brutal far reaching consequences for all. The overriding aspect and the thing I absolutely adore about this story is the love and all consuming relationship between Jack and Caroline. Politics is not a subject I'd usually warm to in my reading matter but in THE BELLATOR SAGA it's perfectly tuned and a crucial, intrinsic part of the story, driving the action and suspenseful nature of the piece providing gravitas, grit, adventure and the most important aspect.... LOVE. Without the political theme Jack and Caroline\u2019s worlds would never have collided so please do NOT let the political aspect deter you from reading. I'm an avid romance fan of thought provoking writing and stories that develop and grow and this series ticks all my boxes! I highly recommend investing time in this series and becoming involved with Jack and Caroline's story."}, {"userName": "SueBee\u2605bring me an alpha!\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15735368-suebee-bring-me-an-alpha", "userReview": "Book 1-3 of 6.Blurb, book 1:\u201cI will always be with you\u2026\u201dRising Democratic star Caroline Gerard hasn\u2019t had an easy year.

The First Trilogy is comprised of Dissident, Conscience and Sojourn. This journey is one that is not easy but it is a journey that will completely move you like no other. It revolves around the political scene. The events taking place are events that could happen in this crazy world we are living in. It is intellectual, it is thrilling, it is a mental trip, and it is also a beautiful love story. The journey of Caroline Gerard and Jack McIntyre is one of epic proportions. While their journey is still ongoing, these 3 books will take your emotions on a roller coaster ride of mayhem and magnificence.

Do I do it as a whole? Where do I even start?!?This came highly recommended by a friend here, and now I know why. If I can give this book more than 5 stars, there is no doubt that I would! I haven\u2019t felt like this about a book in a while, honestly\u2026 And considering the amount of books I read, I sometimes feel certain stories are a dime a dozen, so for this book to leave me gobsmacked at the end is quite a feat. And to think this is just the first 3 trilogy!!Let\u2019s start with the series title, \u201cThe Bellator Saga\u201d. Bellator means \u201cwarrior\u201d, in Latin. In and of itself, it\u2019s got oomph, don\u2019t ya think? And within this trilogy are the books Dissident, Conscience, and Sojourn. These titles alone definitely give you an idea of what you will be in for. Very clever!This is the story of Caroline and Jack (Btw, very Kennedy-esque, eh? No? Just me?) This is their journey told in third-person and from Caroline\u2019s perspective. It moved between flashbacks and the present alternately. So while I feared for the things happening currently and my anxiety level remains high, Caroline and Jack\u2019s love story was unfolding thru the flashback and I was falling in love with them and couldn\u2019t help but get all hot and bothered along the way. They\u2019re both politicians on the rise. Their first encounter was far from congenial but from that first encounter grew a friendship which blossomed into more. And in a way, you can say they live happily ever after. But as their relationship solidifies, there are things happening in the country, things that both Caroline and Jack can\u2019t ignore and because of that, sacrifices have to be made, actions had to be taken.If I can quickly sum up my take of each book, this is how it would look:\nDissident\n: lays a good foundation for what\u2019s to come. You get to know Caroline. You start getting glimpses of what\u2019s to come down the road, esp for Caroline. You see Caroline and Jack fall in love.\nConscience\n: is the hardest to get past thru. While you continue to get flashback to see how Caroline and Jack\u2019s relationship progress, you get more of what\u2019s happening in the present, what was happening to Caroline, to be exact, and it wasn\u2019t pretty at all. Cecilia did not gloss over any of the atrocities and it was brutal to read.\nSojourn\n: shows how Caroline is starting to recover. But there\u2019s much more to be done. Caroline and Jack on the one hand continue to be solid in their relationship as you read thru the flashback.One the one hand, I personally am glad that I got to read this in its entirety as I think it enhanced the emotions reading the 3 books within it one after another. But on the other, now here I am, about to ramble, to try to express how much I LOVE this series\u2026The storyline alone gives you such fodder for contemplation. Cecilia categorized this as an erotic political thriller. I couldn\u2019t agree more. This is romance, yes; romance layered with heat, suspense, and action. There\u2019s also a dystopian feel to it that feels contemporary at the same time, especially considering the times the Americans are in at this very moment. It\u2019s fascinating in a disturbing but also inspirational way. The prologue alone hooks you right in. Immediately, the questions begin. Immediately, you feel the suspense. Immediately, you get a sense of the strength of the characters. The characters alone give a lot of room for good discussion. After everything I\u2019ll write, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to cover everything I want to, which goes to show the care that Cecilia took in developing them. I love how Caroline and Jack are on equal footing. Both are smart and intelligent, passionate in their beliefs albeit not always coming from the same side, have very strong commitment to their civic duties, and confident with and despite of their personal insecurities. Caroline with her feminist inclination, surrounded by similarly strong friends, embodies, in my mind, what young girls should aspire to be. And Jack is the man that a woman like Caroline deserves. So what you get then is the ultimate power couple.Their times together are impressive, witty, and explosive. There\u2019s something to be said about the maturity of these characters. There\u2019s a formality to some of their exchange that just seems fitting but also very heartfelt. While pretentious if taken out of context, it\u2019s appropriate, for lack of better word. And as much as I almost want to say that things moved at a sluggish pace at times, I also realized I needed to read them all to get a full sense of their story. I suppose my anxiety didn\u2019t help in that I just want to speed things up.And with all the things happening, not only did I fell in love with Caroline and Jack, but I became just as enamored with Caroline\u2019s friends. My heart broke over and over for Caroline and her friends the way things were unfolding in the present. The brutality was hard to stomach at times. I was getting just as angry and impassioned. I seriously hope one character will get his comeuppance in the hands of both Caroline and Jack.Considering how this book ended, which means it\u2019s the end of Sojourn, you know their fight has barely started. No matter what\u2019s in store for Caroline and Jack, they\u2019ve already made their marks in my mind. I bet I will cringe, I will swoon, I will be anxious, I will be smiling, I will be a lot of things, and none and all of that will matter because I\u2019m already sold right from the prologue, and I just want to be taken thru their journey in all its glory.My, my, my I think this is one of the longest reviews I have ever written! Yet I feel like I can talk about it some more. But I won\u2019t. I\u2019ve subjected you enough to my ramblings\u2026 I say just friggin\u2019 read it!!!!!(Pls note that I also own a copy)"}, {"userName": "~IreneOust~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13784133-ireneoust", "userReview": "The amount of love I feel for this saga/author is impossible to translate into words but I'll try ...In order for me to enjoy the book, I only really ask for two things: originality and great writing.

It\u2019s a passionate romance between political opposites Caroline Gerard and Jack McIntyre, and fighting for what they believe in.The Author is new to me and I only took a chance because I\u2019ve been seeing it on a friend\u2019s feed plus the covers are beautiful. I actually didn\u2019t read what this trilogy was about before deciding to read it and for it being a political suspense was a surprise. A good surprise because I never thought I\u2019d like this one.Politics is a concept I\u2019d rather avoid because of the power play involved, the hidden agendas and double insinuation in words. The never knowing whether the words were spoken in sincerity or a mask to cover up what was actually intended.But this book, as timely as it seemed with the current events, is as reflective as it is written beautifully in my opinion. This book made me think back on my views and made me reflect upon it. Of what my decisions in the future will affect, or if I will choose a person in position because of the goodness of his/her heart or because I just accepted what the media feeds me.This book touches other points in life, not just the political aspect or how people acts when something happens beyond our control or what can we do about it, but also of life, and relationships, be it romantically or family and friendships.I could also say this book has made my heart stop in suspense and swelled in overflowing love. Made me fall in love, broke my heart, the struggle through life, laugh and smile and the reliving of each scenes as if it was happening to me. The pain and the blacking out of some that are utterly gruesome and unimaginable. But, everything I\u2019ve mentioned is a given when you read this book.This book has been a slow read for me because it was heavy, and light at some part, and yes, my vocabulary has been challenge. (The times I had to stop to look up those meaning. Seriously, and people thought I\u2019m good in English. Not my first language, okay?) But all in all, this is a book I\u2019m very proud to recommend. I can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the series and to continue to know the journey of Caroline and Jack.(And yes, I\u2019ve written the review even before I made it to the finish line.

She has a blooming career in the House of Representatives. Enter John (Jack) McIntyre, a fellow politician whom Caroline said some not so nice things about. Through an apology and a drink these two start a friendship that becomes more over time. The attraction was always there. As Jack and Caroline spend more time together, these two easily become one of my favorite couples. Their love story is inspiring and beautiful.SO much is revealed in the next book, Conscience. And in true Ms. London fashion, we still have questions at this point. However, the way the story slowly unravels will have you on edge the entire time. As long as this book was, I never felt it. I craved the next page. Even when forced to put down the book, I often found myself thinking about reading it. The author\u2019s seductive and alluring prose is what makes this saga addicting. If this is what every political thriller, romantic suspense book is like, then sign me up! My heart pounded through every page. Every single one. Through the declarations of love between Jack and Caroline. To the raw and grittiness that occurs. I was absolutely invested in the story from the moment it began. The writing is truly superb as the author perfectly orchestrates a story of love and hope even in the face of danger and evil. As in the first story, the romance and suspense are perfectly balanced as there are twists and turns we never see coming.Sojourn and the rest of the books in this series has easily become one of the most unforgettable reads of my life. This riveting and compelling story gripped me. Stole my heart. And I don\u2019t think I will ever get it back. The author brilliantly feeds my romantic soul as she expertly balances the gritty life Caroline endures with romance and suspense. The scenes in this book are so passionate and sensual. You have no doubt that the love between Caroline and Jack is timeless. The ending left me breathless and in awe. My heart is so full. Can we please talk about the last chapter of Sojourn? Seriously? Cecilia London. You MOVE me. Your words OWN me. That had to be the most intense, beautiful, tragic, hopeful romantic chapter I have ever read in my life. I found myself reading it over and over several times. And each time, the words slayed me. I was IN that moment. This gut wrenching and heartfelt scene will forever hold a place in my heart. Captivating and thrilling, this story will hold on to you. And not let go. This author is extremely talented. Brilliant. She is a master of words. The story is told in the present as well as a series as flashbacks. The author effortlessly transitions between the two. She is very strategic on how she places these time frame. The writing is phenomenal. The author easy takes you to places as a reader I have never been. I am weaved through the pages of this story and feel every single emotion endured by her characters. She not only places you in their hearts, but she allows you to understand their souls. And everything they stand for. Why aren\u2019t we talking more about this book and series?

This introduction intrigued me and as I kept on reading the following chapters, there is a lot of mention of American politics which to be honest really confused me but that didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the story. The book jumps from the past to the present and vice versa.Caroline in the future is recovering from an attack on her life, the people who are trying to help her are seemingly disappearing one by one, and it is not clear why. There are many questions to be answered and not many answers, however I could not stop reading. I honestly have not been this attached to a book for a long time. The past is based on Caroline moving on from the loss of her husband and Jack who is really sweet and strange at times, wanting to be with Caroline. I\u2019m being purposely vague as I honestly think you should go into this book and saga blind.There is a cliff-hanger but luckily the next book is out, so off I go to read that one.4 stars!Conscience: Book TwoConscience unlike Dissident, features a lot of more of the present chapters. Jack and Caroline are happily married but they know that something is not quite right. Caroline is determined to get to the bottom of it however she is doing it on the quiet to avoid suspicion.I have to say I\u2019ve enjoyed the intrigue, finding out what is going on but the scenes in the \u2018present\u2019 times really hurt my heart. There are some gruesome bits and I cannot explain how much that hurt my heart.I read them one scene and I actually felt physically sick at it. That is a testament to the author as not many books can make me feel that kind of emotion. I\u2019ve devoured this book and hated real life stopping me from reading it. I cannot elaborate but knowing that what is going to come whilst reading this book is so hard because I just want to make it all better for the characters. I want me a Jack, he\u2019s so caring and loving, he\u2019s so sweet.Murdock, well the less said about him the better as far as I\u2019m concerned. I do not want to spoil it so I\u2019ll say no more. I\u2019m off to enjoy the next book and then be sad until the next 3 books come out.The ending of this book does give me hope but at the same time I\u2019m seriously scared to hope as I literally don\u2019t think this saga will end happily. Cecilia please, give me a happy ending because these characters deserve it!!5 stars!Sojourn: Book ThreeThis book is different from the first two in the sense that you get to see Caroline and Jack in their marriage. You get to see their happiness pour off the pages and yet amongst that there is political unrest and sense of doom.This book brings in Jones, Crunch and Gabe who I fell in love with straightaway as they know they're in danger if they get caught yet they're still going ahead with it. They're anti the government and so after a while they make moves to get in touch with the rebel movement. I\u2019m gonna say this, please please don\u2019t let anything bad happen to these guys, they\u2019ve wormed their way into my heart and I want to wrap them all in bubble wrap so they don\u2019t get unnecessarily hurt!The one thing I love about this book is that despite the fact it is a story it is so believable. I'm a bit sad that we don't get Jack in the present day or even a glimpse of what he's doing but I can understand why Caroline has to take centre stage. It gives the reader more tensions and questions to be answered. I have so many questions!Are the children alive? Is Jack alive? Is there going to be a showdown with Jack, Caroline versus Santos and Murdock? (please let this happen!)The ending is a cliffhanger but not a cliffhanger that makes me want to scream and throw my kindle across the room.I'm eagerly anticipating the next book!4.5 starsOverall for the trilogy: 4 stars!"}, {"userName": "Becky Cox", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22123451-becky-cox", "userReview": "The Bellator Saga: The First TrilogyBuy Links:AmazonUS:http://bit.ly/BellatorUSAmazonUK: http://bit.ly/BellatorUKAmazonCA: http://bit.ly/BellatorCAAmazonAU: http://bit.ly/BellatorAUB&N: http://bit.ly/BellatorBoxNookSmashwords: http://bit.ly/BellatorSmashwordsiBooks: http://bit.ly/BellatorAppleKobo: http://bit.ly/KoboBellatorI read the first three in the Bellator Saga; Dissident, Conscience and Sojourn like a starving animal. I could not consume them quick enough. After reading Dissident I searched to see if this author had any other books out and to my surprise she did not. After Conscience I messaged her to ask if this was indeed her first books or if she had written under another pen name and she confirmed, yes these are her first books. The reason I was so shocked was that the characters are so well developed and the plot is twisty and intriguing and all pulls together perfectly. The sex/romantic scenes are beautiful and hot. Did I mention hot. We all need a Jack in our lives. \u201cShe was trapped \u2013 caught between the nightmares that made her scream and the memories that made her weep.\u201dCecilia London has created a world that is not so far from what could really happen in America. This saga an epic love story. It is a bit political, a bit dystopia and a whole lot sexy. Caroline Gerard a political prison, tells the beginning of her political career and meeting Jack in flashbacks while she is being held captive. Each book takes us further into what happened to land Caroline in the Fed and what she is currently enduring as a political prisoner. But at the crux of all of this is a beautiful love story. Jack and Caroline have one of those amazing love stories that we all dream about finding for ourselves. \"You are my everything, Caroline. My world, my life, the reason I exist. We're going to get through this. I promise.\"\"It's not a church, sweetheart.\" \"It is to me. Books are holy.\"An EPIC story that had my emotions run the gamut. It makes my heart hurt. I spend days, weeks or months thinking about it and I tell all my friends to read it without hesitation. I laughed, cried and cringed along with Caroline. These EPIC books are few and far between for me, as they should be. Cecilia London's Bellator Saga is definitely on the epic level. I impatiently wait for the next installment of Caroline and Jack's story!http://www.amazon.com/Bellator-Saga-T...Reviewed by Becky for Jo&IsaLoveBookshttp://joandisalovebooks.com/http://joandisalovebooks.blogspot.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23107654-carla", "userReview": "*I was given a copy of this trilogy in exchange for an honest review for Stephanie's Book Reports.**Carla's Four Star Review**This set includes the first three books in the Bellator Saga: The First Trilogy. This entire series consists of six books, so none of the books can be read as stand alones.Dissident- In this first book, we are introduced to Caroline and Jack. They both have political ties and , unfortunately, have come together in a time of great political strife. Individual states are seceding, and the powers that be can no longer be trusted. This first book mainly focuses on the relationship between Caroline and Jack. Through flashbacks, we learn how they met and how their love developed. This story also lays the groundwork for the future story line.Conscience- Caroline has been captured by an organization called \"The Fed\", and she is being held against her will. She is being tortured both physically and emotionally all for information that she has zero knowledge of. The only things that are giving her the strength to survive are her past memories of her family and friends. Will she escape or be rescued, or is her life going to come to a violent end?Sojourn- This book offers insight into the transition that is taking place in Caroline's life. Of course, it also contains it's fair share of twists and turns.Sheesh, this is one thrilling and emotional trilogy! It is packed with action and adventure. There is love, and there is hate. There is good, and there is evil. Each story is unique and very well written. I will warn you that Cecilia London will definitely put you through the \"emotional ringer\" with this series! If you drink, you will probably want to have your favorite cocktail nearby!

Author Cecilia London you brought me to tears, made me laugh, made me swoon over Jack, put so much angst into their story and deliver such a complex love story that is mixed up in a dystopian society, that you just have to read this half of the series & you will fall in love with it just like I have! (It's a LOT of emotions, I know)Dissident ReviewIn the first installment of this book we meet Jack and Caroline. They don\u2019t get along at first and despite his charms; she tries to push him away. The chemistry between the two of them is phenomenal. I had to go back to read this book in order to get a feel for what was going on in Conscience. I received that book just before publication in exchange for an honest review, and when I started it I felt I needed the background of how Jack and Caroline got to where they are in Conscience. He is very playful and flirty with her, and she really tries hard to push him away. But once the two come together, wew! It\u2019s amazing how Cecilia has incorporated this love story into this broken version of the world you will read about in the series. I feel like this series for me is like mixing The Hunger Games and the Divergent Series together to get this dystopian society that you really just see the beginnings of the crumble in this book. So many sub-characters are introduced during this book that you will love throughout the 1st half of the 6 part series that you really want to pay attention to them so you really connect with all the characters and not just our stars. Although they are the best. Thank you Cecilia for giving us this series and I can\u2019t wait to read more!Conscience ReviewI am new to this series/author and honestly had not read the first book. I got to go back to the beginning for this series, to Dissident in order to review Conscience, and was very glad I did!This series follows Caroline and Jack, both political Representatives in DC. In the second installment of the six part series, we get more background information on how Caroline and Jack have ended up where they are now. In present day, they are running from the Presidents men that have pretty much overtaken the government and in doing so, Caroline ends up hurt and ultimately captured by his men. Jack is forced to leave her behind when she is slowing him down, at her request, and she insists he gets the documents on the flash drive to where they need to go. We still don\u2019t get a lot of information on who the documents need to go to, what they are, or why the people holding her captive have done so. I did struggle to get through some of the more gruesome details of her being tortured by Santos\u2019 men during this part of the book. I do not do well with those types of detail in book or film, so it was tough during most of the \u201cpresent day\u201d chapters. I do think this has been very well written, in that she kept thinking about the past during her time in captivity and that somehow gets her through it. She has flashbacks and memories of time with Jack and that somehow puts her mind at ease and gives her hope that she will be rescued. Several other characters make disturbing appearances in the present day, in this installment from the first book as well.The way the book flashes back and forth from present day, to back when Jack and Caroline were getting to know each other and still just working in DC as representatives, fills in a lot of blanks and questions I had form the first book.This series is a political thriller with a love story mixed in. Throughout both books I found myself on edge wondering what is going on with all the politics/government secession's and what will happen with Jack and Caroline. I love the mystery of this novel series because it stirs up so many questions. As much as I don\u2019t want a six part series, and want my answers to all my questions NOW, the way this is played out is sort of entertaining. Not getting all your answers about the who, what, and whys as to everything going on with Carline, Jack and the government. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next and get even more background information on their story and what has happened with them since they were married and Jack became Governor of Pennsylvania.Soujourn Review*I received an ARC of this title from the Author in exchange for an honest review*\u2026and I honestly absolutely LOVED and devoured this book! I began the series late this summer and fell in love with Caroline and Jack. In the second book I was so sad and hurt at what was happening with Caroline that I didn\u2019t think anything was every going to go her way again. Until I read Sojourn! This has been the best book hangover I\u2019ve EVER had and I just can\u2019t wait to see what is next in this series!Sojourn picks up right after Caroline is rescued from The Fed by three young men that are part of the rebellion. Two of them even work for The Fed as their cover. I fell in love with these new characters in Sojourn so much! The story of how everything plays out with them and the safe house is so well written and brings so much life back into her character that has been so beaten down and struggling for something to keep her going everyday and give her motivation to not just give up entirely. Caroline struggles both emotionally and physically in this third installment as she recovers from the mental trauma she has experienced loosing all those close to her, hearing them being executed or being dragged off to their deaths, as well as physically recovering from them breaking bones in her face, hands and other injuries she will have to struggle to move forward. She spends time with these men at the safe house as she recovers; Gabe, Crunch and Jones become her saviors in many ways. These three really do help her during their time together both physically and mentally. They are there to help her recover from everything she\u2019s been through. Where the last book was a nail biter because of reading all the gruesome details of the things that happen to her at The Fed, this book has softer notes of healing, recovery and still some very steamy flashbacks of her and Jack! The sex scenes were hotter than ever and this book is very sensual in nature in regards to their relationship as seen through her dreams, or nightmares as she begins to see them as. Although very pleasant memories, they become nightmares to her as she will never see him again or any of her friends and family, and these memories does torment her throughout the story.\u201cI relish doing things like this to you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI love to give you a good spanking but this is so much more intense. I can see how much you enjoy it too. I\u2019ve never met a woman who wants to please me as much as you do, not just in bed, but in all aspects of life. You\u2019ve given up so much for me, Caroline, and given me so much in return.\u201dThis book ends in a place I tried to see coming one of my own theories, but most people just won\u2019t see the ending coming. The last chapter I was biting my nails and crying so much, I am still raw and vulnerable from reading these book days even after the last sentence. You won\u2019t regret picking up part three of the series, as you will too gain a whole new perspective on the character Caroline is and meet some new characters to love along the way!"}, {"userName": "dreamerinexile", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5330732-dreamerinexile", "userReview": "Two souls, one monster 5 golden starsThe Bellator Saga is an epic story of love, romance, mayhem, devastation, party-politics, swooniness, monsters, evil spawn of Satan, Jack \u2013 the sexy politician and sassy and smart, Caroline.When I first read the blurb, I had no idea the series was going to take me on a devastatingly swoon-worthy yet epically gut-wrenching journey. I experienced every emotion from Caroline\u2019s recovery at the VA hospital, to her life before the dissent, to her budding romance with Jack, to the tortures that follow, to every other tiny little spec that left a footprint in my heart.Dissident starts off with the epic storyline; two people are running in the dead of night. Each step they took, every labored breath that was taken left me shivering. I felt myself tear up when they had to stop and then it was over. I was caught in the web of intrigue beautifully crafted by Cecilia London.With that shattering start, we bounce back 5 years in the past. We meet the two main protagonists from the Saga, Caroline and Jack. Their first few encounters weren\u2019t what you expect from soul mates. But then again, the whole fiasco to their beginning was due to Caroline unable to handle losing the love of her life. Waaait! Whaaat do you mean she loses the love of her life! That\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Well if you\u2019re lucky in life, sometimes, if the Fates takes a liking to you, then they give you Caroline\u2019s life. Umm considering what happens next, I don\u2019t really know how much the Fates do love her. But I digress, yep, she has lost her love and in her emotional state makes several not too awesome comments which results in her being on Jack\u2019s not my favorite person list. Sigh. JAAAACCCK! This man is so freaking awesome, he\u2019s perfect, even when Caroline was being a douche, Jack was the perfect gentleman. Jack McIntyre is not what he seems. There are depths to him only a select few know about and I thank god every day that he found his way into my heart and stole it. I never want my heart back from Jack. Cos he\u2019s the type of hero every man should aspire to be. He\u2019s got the perfect mix of swoony, romance, smart, protectiveness and sexy!My little romantic heart swooned some more as Jack and Caroline\u2019s friendship blossomed. Dissident was definitely an interesting read, as Cecilia London, kept yanking my emotions every which way when from the beautifully bourgeoning past, she catapults you to the present. Watching Caroline recover inside that hospital took a toll on me, while it seemed she was fairly safe inside, evil minions of the evil spawn of satan was plotting to annihilate everything that Caroline stood for. But even in the midst of the darkest nights, there will always be people who are brave enough to shine their light.As the story progressed I learned more about the people who made up Caro\u2019s world. There was Mo and Feef (two of my favorite-st people in the whole book) and then there was Bob, Chrissy and Caro\u2019s two shadows Jen and Kat.When Caroline wakes up, she has no idea where she is, but she remembers what was looming over like a dark cloud. Just when she caught a tiny ray to light, it was yanked from her brutally and what transpires in Conscience is both heart-wrenchingly beautiful and horrific in its brutality. Conscience is again told in snippets of the innocent past that helped Caro live her vicious present. The contrast between the past and present left me gasping for breath. I felt my heart rip apart from the devastation. The present brought us to a standstill while Caro was dragged to interrogation, where the evil spawn of Satan goes all out with his cruelty. The powers that be have absolutely no conscience; they will stop at nothing, they will do anything and everything to break Caroline, whether by breaking bones or breaking minds, it\u2019s immaterial. They just want to get the truth out of her. I hated what happens in the present and craved the past but was scared to dive into it. The past brought with it the epic romance between Jack and Caro. I loved learning more about Caro, the woman behind the charm, wit and the smart-ass sarcasm. I learned about the zest to make a change, I loved her courage, her big heart. The past made my heart pant and my soul sighed.The past once again intervened with a sledgehammer and I felt the total devastation as people from Caro\u2019s past were paraded in front of her to make her torture complete. She endured one vicious attack after another. I wondered time and again how someone could continue to survive after what she goes through. I felt sick, my tummy hurt and my heart bleed along with Caro.By the end of the book, the only thought circling my mind was, Will Jack come for her? Will she have her HEA? Will she once again hold Mo and Feef, give Chrissy her snark and so much more? Or will the light finally leave her as the indignities of her present laps up the last of her courage and leave her a shell of woman who lights up Jack McIntyre\u2019s world?The journey continued with the aptly named 3rdbook, Sojourn. The story continues where we left off in Conscience. Sojourn is like soothing balm compared to the first two books. Even though Caro finds herself rescued, the past is still hauntingly family chomping at the bits to destroy her mind. Her rescue squad does everything they can to heal her wounds, but the wounds inside her mind is not that easily healed. Caro feels the loss of her family and beloved Jack like a pin pricking her senses every second of every day.Sojourn gave us a true insight into the mind of our brave heroine, who gave up everything to put a wrong to right. Her struggle, her inner battle leapt from the pages of the book and instilled a hurt in your core. As the story progressed, she managed to get a semblance of calm before all that is eviscerated when she meets the rebellion leader. The first three books from the Bellatore Saga has swept me away on a wave of love, mystery with an insane twist of evil complemented by the strong characters played by Caro and Jack. Cecilia London has created characters that will forever hold a place in my heart. I have felt every passion imagined along with the painful beatings and mind numbing horrors of the mind. I for one would definitely recommend the series to anyone who is a fan of romance and thriller."}, {"userName": "Beaut\u00e9 De Livres  (Vivian Freeman)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41808039-beaut-de-livres-vivian-freeman", "userReview": "--> $0.99c SALE - GRAB YOUR COPY TODAY (LIMITED TIME ONLY) <---AmazonUS:http://bit.ly/BellatorUSAmazonUK: http://bit.ly/BellatorUKAmazonCA: http://bit.ly/BellatorCAAmazonAU: http://bit.ly/BellatorAUB&N: http://bit.ly/BellatorBoxNookSmashwords: http://bit.ly/BellatorSmashwordsiBooks: http://bit.ly/BellatorAppleKobo: http://bit.ly/KoboBellator____________________The Bellator Saga: First Box Set TrilogyAt the end of 2015 I had finally managed to clear my schedule and dive into a series that had been sitting on my (never ending) \u201cTo Be Read\u201d list.

Each one has a cliffhanger, but you will be rewarded by picking up the next book in the series. Cecilia London is a phenomenal author, and will have you begging for more. I loved these three books, and know the others will be just as fabulous. I don\u2019t like to give spoilers, but it is hard to write review a series without talking about each book, so please be warned!Dissident:Caroline a rising star in the Democratic Party a Congresswoman, and is doing everything to keep it together for her two girls after looking her husband. Jack is also a Congressman, and a known playboy. Their start was a little rocky; Caroline said some rude things on the political trail. But after an apology, wine, and a long night of talking they soon form a friendship. Jack is able to help Caroline heal her heart, and learn so much more about herself. While these two are growing as a couple, their political word is turned upside down.This book is told mostly in flashbacks, but also with hints of the present. It has the most amazing cliffhanger!Conscience:Dissident left off with Caroline in the hospital trying to figure out how to escape, and this is exactly where Conscience picks up. This is more of Caroline\u2019s story, her thoughts and who she really is. It also shows us the steamy side of Jack and Caroline, and man do I mean HOT!

Dissidents prologue is action packed, full of suspense and cultivates questions left and right as the heroine, Caroline is on the run with Jack\u2026. but from who? This is just one question you\u2019ll have as you dive into The Bellator Saga, a series that grabbed me and wouldn\u2019t let me go \u2013 as the story begins we\u2019re sent back five years, the story developing through both past/present tense slowly unveiling secrets \u2026. dark secrets that are lurking throughout every.single.chapter. Cecilia London warns us this is a six book series, ending with a cliffhanger \u2026.and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been as affected by a series before \u2013 to the point where I\u2019m emailing the author pictures of my face covered in tears\u2026.. hating her \u2013 loving the characters and having real fear for what is going to happen next. Again though\u2026 Dissident is only the beginning. As the story continues in Conscience we pickup right where we left off in Dissident, Caroline is slowly recovering\u2026 only to wake up in a nightmare I\u2019m not sure I could handle\u2026. reading this book, Cecilia London broke me \u2013 and broke me hard. I\u2019ve felt for characters in the past \u2013 I mean who hasn\u2019t? But when you\u2019re sobbing to the point you can\u2019t even continue reading? Just one sentence\u2026. and the image of a stuffed hippo. Even thinking about it breaks my heart \u2013 months later. Read.This.Series. You will understand. The Bellator Saga is a series I have told endless people about and one that\u2019s soooooo hard to explain without spoiling the entire story for you. But trust me, you will fall in love with Caroline. She\u2019s a quick witted smart mouthed politician who stands up for herself, and the people that mean most to her. The friendships she holds dear, you will find yourself feeling the same \u2013 you\u2019ll want to be a part of their conversations, their inside jokes. Throw Jack McIntyer into the mix and you have some of the hottest scenes I\u2019ve read in a very long time. The Bellator Saga is very much a genre crossing series that will stick with you for a very long time. You will laugh with Caroline, you will fall hard for Jack, you will have hope in your heart that there is a light at the end of this tunnel \u2026. you will feel every single piece of this series."}, {"userName": "Danielle Goodwin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32814331-danielle-goodwin", "userReview": "Cecilia London's \"Dissident\" is the first tale in the Bellator Saga. It's an interesting premise. Something has gone wrong and states are seceding from union and government leaders are enemies of the state somehow. This storyline is being slowly revealed in an intertwining way with the backstory of the leading lady, Caroline. Half political thriller and half romance. The intimate scenes usually just include the foreplay elements and hint at what happens - more of a \"closed door\" approach - some of the foreplay, however, is described in full yummy detail!Cecilia London's \"Conscience\" is the second tale in the Bellator Saga. When I reviewed #1, I wrote that the intimate scenes had a \"closed door\" approach, but not so with #2! There are lots of sexy, fully detailed nookie scenes. Mmmmm... I really like the way the story is told as a mashup of past and present. And the sexy Jack flashbacks are the best! I can't wait to see what's next in #3 (\"Sojourn\") coming next year!Cecilia London's \"Sojourn\" is the third tale in the Bellator Saga. Just in case you haven't read the series, something has gone wrong and states are seceding from union and government leaders are enemies of the state somehow. This storyline is being slowly revealed in an intertwining way with the backstory of the leading lady, Caroline. You definitely need to read #1 and #2 before you read #3. It's hard to say more without spoilers. Overall, just a really good #3...probably the best #3 I've read in a while. It's gritty and amazing."}, {"userName": "Monica Graves (nightreads)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4592682-monica-graves-nightreads", "userReview": "The Bellator Saga is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read and I loved every minute of it! I\u2019m not big on political stuff or reading books with characters that don\u2019t fall under NA. So I am super glad that Cecilia reached out to me and asked me to read them.I have read a lot of books in the last few years and nothing comes close to being similar to this series. It\u2019s one of a kind and I have to say that it was super exhilarating, suspenseful and it really keeps you guessing as to what will happen with all the characters involved.I\u2019m usually one to finish a book pretty fast, my average is between 1-3 days. Yet for these ones it took me longer than usual to finish. Not because it was bad, but because I needed take a breather and mentally prepare myself before going back and continue reading. If Cecilia had to take breaks while writing/editing then she did her job because there were points where I didn\u2019t want to keep reading and had to take breaks because some points were just too much to deal with emotionally and mentally. There are a lot of scenes in Conscience that had me cringing and feeling really bad for Caroline, but man is she one tough chick. This is the first of this type of book I\u2019ve read, and as I mentioned before it is unlike anything else I have ever read and I have read a few hundred books in the last few years. To me it falls under a political, suspense, romance with a bit of erotica mixed in. And it\u2019s one of the first that I\u2019ve read where the characters are older than the NA genre."}, {"userName": "Emma bramley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40514335-emma-bramley", "userReview": "dissidentthis is the first book ive read by this author and I was pleasantly surprised, what a good read. the story alternates between the past and the present which helps you understand the characters better. the chemistry between the two main characters is defiantly hot. this works really well with the story line which contains, love, suspense, chemistry and more. you are defiantly left wanting more.highly recommendedconsciencethis is the second book in the set and starts straight after the first book. this book has loads of action and suspense which will keep you hooked till the last page. this story can be brutal in places but this is well written by the author. the story is told in the same way as the first with flash backs to the characters past. cant wait to read the next one.highly recommendedsojournthis is the third book in the set and you must read the first two before starting this one. this book again contains the flash backs from the characters past. this is a very intense and imitate story you\u2019ll want to keep reading till the end. with in the story the secondary characters become more important to the plot. defiantly a must read series.highly recommendedhttps://obsessedbookreviews.wordpress...https://www.facebook.com/obsessedbook..."}, {"userName": "\u2764\ufe0f Diana \u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11021977-diana", "userReview": "So glad I started this series!

This trilogy is hands down one of the best I have ever read. I was blown away with the story. The plot is sheer excellence and its execution is brilliant. The pattern focuses on the past and the present keeping you in synchronisation with the story. The characters and story gradually develops in all three books, creating a mystery that leaves you fixated and it also connects you immensely well with all the characters. Its a concoction of emotions, love, fear, gut wrenching pain, passion, humour, strength and so much more.\u00a0Its so graphically detailed that certain parts of the story gave me chills.

Two words :I was utterly captivated by this political- erotic story and Jack is definitely a book boyfriend material and Caroline was my freaking hero out there.\n  Three incredible books that gonna stuck you to your seat!I won\u2019t write a review for each book but more as a whole part.\u00a0When I read the prologue, I was already hooked, the mood was settled and just when things was getting interesting, I had to discover how the main characters; Jack and Caroline met and finally got into this situation. Two \u00a0political opposites. One EPIC love story!Alternating between present and past, mostly through Caroline\u2019s POV.I\u2019ve never though being hooked into a political plot tainted with a huge erotic background. And the author, Cecilia London managed to pull the strings with brio, suspense on top!\nCaroline Gerard, widowed mother of two girls was managing her personal and professional life, the best she could. As representative Gerard, her political side, she is fierce, witty passionate, and defending her opinions. She\u2019s not afraid to stand for what she believes.This woman is a force of a nature.\u00a0A beautiful soul with a clever mind and a hot tempered side.Jack McIntyre \u2026 Sexy Silver fox, charismatic, suspenders lover ...\u00a0 damn sexy!Anyway when it comes to that man, I was sold.\u00a0More experienced, with an smoking hot charisma, I was under the spell. More aged, with a Playboy-millionaire reputation, he meant trouble! \u00a0A complex man with so many sides but only dedicated to the one he loved, mysterious and mesmerizing. When he met again Caroline, after some first disappointments, he wanted to be her friend but couldn\u2019t deny the chemistry and hot sexual vibes between them \u2026 These two could put a room in fire, even just by their witty banter and sexual innuendos!Oh my \u2026 I love the smutty moments in the books! Caroline was pretty adventurous and bold out there, exploring her deepest desires and Jack was aimed to please. Alpha-dominant and just smoking hot, be ready for some cold showers. Intense, passionate, rough, and kinky, these moments were putting their relationship to another level, revealing how much they craved, loved each other, with a complete trust.I have to warn you that was only the tip of the iceberg because be prepared for a freaking tsunami of emotion, not only about their love story but also what was coming next : a period of extreme drought, when Caroline had to fight for her life and her ideals while a conspiracy was preparing, under the shadows, waiting for the best moment to strike. When this moment came, nothing would ever be the same.Even if I had to say that the second part of the book was pure torture to me, with some unbearable times, when I was almost praying for the coup de grace, and the darkness was invading Caroline\u2019s body and soul, I felt hope. This story stirred so many emotions. A constant battle of power, in the political arena where everything could change in a blink of an eye, and the world you knew didn\u2019t exist anymore.The writing was stunning, with enough foreboding to challenge the reader; the political narrative was elaborated and perfectly combined with the romance.As you might guess, I loved it!5 stars are not enough and if I don\u2019t read the second trilogy soon, I\u2019m gonna lose it, really!Highly recommended, a must read!\n\n ** My rating **"}], "description": "\"This series is off the chain.
