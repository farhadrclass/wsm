It was a really quick read! Going into this book I thought that Alexandria would have amazing character development, and end up being a nice humble girl, but no such thing happened. She only ended up being slightly less snooty than before. Although, at the end of the book her act of kindness in the last 3 pages is generous, but there wasn't much improvement of her personality.However, I really enjoyed the friendships between Alexandria and Ruth and Alexandria and Nebala. The best friend thing was really cute. I was a little disappointed also with how we didn't really see any other characters. I would have liked to see more Sarah and Mary Beth.Overall though this book was pretty good. It was a light, fun and quick read and I would recommend it if you're in a reading slump!"}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "**Some Spoilers**Alexandria Hyatt is a fifteen-year-old rich white girl from LA. An only child of divorced parents, she\u2019s always got everything she\u2019s ever wanted, and expects nothing less. She\u2019s manipulative, selfish, narrow-minded, sheltered and ignorant. Two months before, she was up before a judge after taking a golf club to a schoolgirl\u2019s car \u2013 while the girl was in it. Now she\u2019s been caught shoplifting while on probation and the judge \u2013 the same judge, who has his neck in a brace due to whiplash after being rear-ended by a girl just like Alexandria \u2013 is not inclined to believe her yet again. Six months in a juvenile detention centre is her sentence.Naturally, the idea of living in a prison with a roommate and a toilet in the room is the worst thing Alexandria can think of, so when an alternate proposal is made by the DA that she join a diversion program that would see her working with an international charity for three weeks, she jumps at it instantly.From the moment she arrives in Nairobi, Alexandria is confronted with the worst thing she can imagine: her contact with Child Save, Ren\u00e9e, wears socks with sandals. The rest of the people at the centre \u2013 staff and volunteers who are building a new school for Maasai children \u2013 include a group of eager church youth and a uni student, Christine, who is just as pretentious and superior as Alexandria. And they all dress bad. What with the lack of electricity, the toilets that are holes in the floor, the hard work needed to build the school, the bad food and contaminated water, Alexandria uses her manipulative wiles to get her own way as much as possible, but finds it\u2019s not as easy as it usually is. A Maasai girl, Ruth, befriends her and introduces her to village life \u2013 mud huts and families of 12, the girls walking miles to collect dirty water while their brothers patrol with spears to keep the lions at bay. When Ruth\u2019s mother goes into labour and the baby is a breach, the family comes to Alexandria for help in getting to the nearest clinic \u2013 25 miles away on a deeply rutted, pitted road. She takes the centre\u2019s old jeep and when the clinic refuses to take the dying woman, throws her enormous amount of spending money in order to get the surgery happening. It's written simply - narrated by Alexandria, so we get to hear all the charming things she thinks (and see how sluggishly her mind sometimes works) - and can be read in just a few hours. Walters has carefully focused on just a few of the things troubling countries like Kenya, and introduces a whole new culture: the Maasai, who believe they own all the cattle in the world, so taking yours isn't actually stealing. This book doesn't come across as propaganda or a \"do-gooder\" story, though I often wondered, while reading it, how much different it would have been had it been longer, more involved and fleshed out, and with a different kind of protagonist - an adult book, I guess. For all her flaws, Alexandria is a surprisingly engaging main character. She is alone because she cuts herself off from people she deems unworthy or simply too daggy. She very gradually confronts some of her assumptions, prejudices and stereotypes, and is not really a bad or mean girl: she just has always valued possessions and impressions over anything else. Only in Kenya where no one is impressed by her clothes or jewellery or connections, can she throw off some of the pressure she\u2019s put on herself to match expectations, and begin to appreciate things. One of the things I liked about this story was that Alexandria doesn\u2019t change, she doesn\u2019t become a completely different person. When she returns, her father gives her the keys to her 16th-birthday-present-Mercedes, and she asks him to instead get her a cheaper car so she can spend $20,000 on a medical clinic for the people she knew, like Ruth. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want a car at all, just that she\u2019s recognised her exorbitant extravagances and how needless they are. She gains perspective. While the character is based off the Paris Hilton-types, it\u2019s not a satire, and even if you can\u2019t relate to her wealth, priorities or sheer superficiality, she becomes a (surprisingly) good role model and her experience brings Africa just that bit closer to home."}, {"userName": "Kevin Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4299626-kevin-craig", "userReview": "This review is taken from my new review blog:http://www.trythisbookonforsize.blogs...Alexandria of Africa is written in first person, from Alexandria's point of view. Interestingly enough, Alexandria is not very likeable. She's actually quite terrible. She steals for kicks. She lies. She's in trouble with the law and doesn't understand why everybody won't just leave her alone.The story opens in Canada, with Alexandria facing a judge for a second offense. She is so blas\u00e9 the reader wants to reach into the pages and smack her. Such is her sense of entitlement. Walters does a wonderful job of taking us right to the brink of unrest in the way we feel for the narrator. The reader wants to see Alexandria receive just punishment not only for her actions but also for her outlook on the world around her.Although she does receive a sentence, it's not the one the reader would like. In lieu of a stay in a youth detention centre, Alexandria is sentenced to a work program in Kenya. The reader becomes more angry as we are privy to Alexandria's constant inner dialogue of entitlement. But we know she's in for a rude awakening...or a blossoming, if you will. Walters sets all the signposts for that eventual enlightenment with dead accuracy, through the experiences Alexandria faces along the way.This poor little rich girl is a slow learner. As she meets the people she will work with in Kenya, she stubbornly finds fault with them where others would see good. The turning point doesn't happen when Alexandria is put to work in the sweltering heat of Africa. That, I think, is what makes Walters' storytelling so fine. He could have taken the easy route and made Alexandria open her eyes when she saw the work that needed to be done for these people less privileged than her. But she didn't. She did everything to make it look like she was working, when in fact she was slacking off...thinking about nails and clothes and cars and home.Enter Ruth, a Maasai girl who takes Alexandria in to the world of her small village. It is an eye-opening experience for Alexandria that shaves some of the sharper corners off of this unlikeable character. The outcome of Alexandria's journey is a fulfilling one for the reader, who was beginning to think there was no way she would compromise her spoiled rich-girl outlook on life.To tell you more would be to reveal more spoilers than I already have revealed. I'll just say that Walters wrote a fine story of personal growth that doesn't come off as being too preachy or lesson oriented. He manages to make the reader dislike his narrator to the point where they seek her failure. But he also manages to subtly make that character open to the possibility of change.This was a pleasant read. It brought me back to the wonderful country of Kenya. It also helped to shed light not only on the plight of some of the country's poorest people, but also on the wonderful spirit they have in the face of that plight. I happily recommend this book. If you have been to Africa, it will skillfully take you back there. If you have not...it will allow you to see it as acurately as any book can."}, {"userName": "Scarlette", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9601382-scarlette", "userReview": "I think this is my all-time favorite book!

But when she is arrested for shoplifting, she finds herself in court. This novel follows Alexandria\u2019s journey to Africa, in hopes her life will change for the better. This book review is based off of \u201cAlexandria of Africa\u201d,an excellent quick read novel. The story \u201cAlexandria of Africa\u201d is written by Eric Walters and published by Doubleday Canada. The theme revolved around a spoiled teenager recovery from theft, through experiences, friendships and a trip to Africa. It also touches on how privileged we are here in Canada. \u00a0\u201cAlexandria of Africa\u201d is \u00a0currently is rated 3.9/5 on goodreads and is recognized as a humorous quick read. Eric Walter has received many awards for his 80 books published, but not any specific awards for this novel. Other readers has compared this book to \u201cBeverly Hills Maasai\u201d and \u201cShaken\u201d, books also written by Eric Walters. Personally I selected this book as it incorporated two of my favorite types of novels, realistic and comedy/drama. Sometimes I feel like realistic novels, such as \u201cMy Sister Lives on the Mantel Place\u201d are too intense and serious for my likings. Although novels likes this are often meant to share a message or a story, at times I wish they were written with more humor as it can be much more fun to read. I also decided to read this book as it was a quick read, and something I could read on the go. I also have some interest in possibly traveling to a third world country for humanitarian work, and I was interested in how the author would explain it. Personally I found this book relatable, as it discussed some first world problems I also found it interesting as Alexandria took us along her Journey to Africa. It made me laugh when Alexandria started to complain about the \u201cinconveniences\u201d of Africa, but also reflect as I was able to view the story from another point of view. I realized that life here sure is easier, and for that we should be grateful. Overall I really enjoyed this book as it made me connect Alexandria's issues to my own and took me on a unique experience to Africa. \u00a0As Alexandria silently pouted in the courtroom in sunny Los Angeles, her parents frantically started arguing with the judge offering to pay any amount of money. You see, money is never an issue for the Hyatts, and Alexandria\u2019s parents will do just about anything to make their little girl happy. And with no exceptions were they going to let Alexandria go, just for shoplifting. After some arguing, Alexandria's overpriced lawyer was able to get her out of serving \u00a0jail time, but instead signed her up on a humanitarian trip to Kenya, Africa. In the beginning this was fantastic news for Alexandria, as she didn\u2019t quite get the fact that this trip wasn\u2019t going to be sun tanning and sightseeing. Turns out this trip involved walking for miles, building a school from scratch and a new friendship with a schoolgirl that would change her life. Although this trip wasn\u2019t what Alexandria expected, it was just what she needed a wake up call showing her how fortunate she was. This uplifting and humorous novel was possibly set in the late 2000\u2019s. The overall theme of this story based on how fortunate we are here in Canada to have what we have, as the author really made it clear that we (audience reading the book) are all very lucky. For things such as our healthcare, education, living situation and the endless amounts of opportunities. It was about Alexandria realizing how lucky she was, and starting to do more for the less fortunate and less for herself. At times like this it made me very happy, as I knew Alexandria as a spoiled blonde but as the story progressed I witnessed her coming around to realizing how much she has to give. The genre of this book is a realistic drama. I really liked the way Eric Walter\u2019s connected to the reader by sharing Alexandria's common \u201cissues\u201d as I could relate and understand Alexandria as a character better. I also feel like many other high school teenage girls could relate to her, so overall Eric Walter did a great job of connecting to the reader. I thought the quality of the writing was great, but would have liked to see some \u201charder\u201d words. I do feel like this book is a little bit below my reading level, and I would have enjoyed more of a challenge. Besides from the fact that this book was a little bit too easy for me and did not push me further I did like how the author used irony in the story to make it more interesting. Lastly Eric Walter wrote at a medium speed, at times it was filled with action and other parts seemed to more slower. Despite being slow a some parts, his writing was still very clear and easy to understand. And I often found myself not being able to put the book down. To conclude I liked the theme, characters and the author's ability to connect with the reader but disliked the fact that the book was a little too easy and think that the speed of the story, was a little too slow. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a quick easy read to read this book as it is funny and takes you on a journey to Africa. I think a female student in a lower grade would enjoy this book most, as I stated earlier it definitely connects to female teens the most. I would rate this book a \u2158 as it was able to hold my attention, make me want to read more and connect/relate to the characters. What could have been better is the pace and the the overall level of reading. Overall I enjoyed this quick read, that made me think about how lucky I am to live in such an amazing, safe environment."}, {"userName": "Diana Medve", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48940842-diana-medve", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book but think it could have been longer as a lot happens in a very short amount of time."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15861683-erin", "userReview": "Hmm. This isn't my type of book. It just isn't.I hate Eric Walters. Let me rephrase that: I dislike Eric Walter's writing style. Exclamation marks on the ends of sentences (that aren't dialogue)? No thanks.Summary:\tThe story starts off when Alexandria was caught for shoplifting and was sent to court\u2014definitely your typical rich-kid character. Instead of juvie, the judge offered the chance to go to a diversion program in Africa, where Alexandria would be placed with volunteers to help build a school in a small, poor town. As you can probably guess, she wasn\u2019t thrilled, but according to her it was better than prison uniforms, because no one looks good in orange, or stripes.\tWhen Alexandria goes to Africa, she\u2019s shocked that nobody there is impressed with the things she owns and the people she\u2019s met. In fact, she hates everybody at first. Add the annoying happy people to barely any electricity, and our protagonist can\u2019t wait for the program to be over. Fast forward, and Alexandria starts to connect with other volunteers, even learning a bit of the African language Swahili. While building the school in a small town, she finds a friend in Ruth, a girl her age. After warming up to more people, she goes as far as to use her dwindling supply of expensive makeup to get her co-workers ready for an African festival, which she won\u2019t be attending.\tWhile everybody\u2019s away, disaster strikes: Ruth\u2019s mother goes into labor with a baby, but experiences difficulties, leaving 15-year-old Alexandria to drive Ruth\u2019s mother, father, and Ruth (the only English-speaking one) to the nearest clinic, miles away. In honor of Ruth\u2019s friend, the new baby\u2019s name is Alexandria.\tBack home, when her father surprises her with a car, she decides to trade it in for a smaller one, donating $20 000 to build a better hospital closer to Ruth\u2019s home. Alexandria\u2019s point of view on life has changed. She\u2019s experienced the challenges that Ruth and her family have, as well as other villages, and learns that not everybody is as lucky as she is.**************************************************************************Woo-hoo, happy ending, everything works out, girl learns her lesson.Too predictable for my liking."}, {"userName": "Fire_Dragon_", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4534422-fire-dragon", "userReview": "\"My mother also wants to know how to spell your name.\" Ruth said\"Do they need it for the hospital forms?\"Ruth shook her head. \" They need your name for the birth certificate.

Eric Walters. Characters I hate. Characters I did hate but now I frickin' adore. I want this book to bear my children. Now, I need to be clear: I am a total sucker for books about Africa, books about third-world countries, and books where you're not required to like the main character. I've also met this guy, and my copy is a signed one (although, incidentally, I got it at Chapters a few years after I actually met him - lucky coincidence that they had one, I guess,) and let me tell you, Eric Walters is a faboo dude. You can keep your John Greens and whoever else is popular these days; this right here is my man. Unfortunately, the book wasn't flawless. I feel it was way too fast-paced, the court scene in the beginning was a real WTF-moment, and Alexandria's voice for the first third of the book was a tad too cheesy and stereotypical. On the bright side, the good definitely outweighs the bad. Alexandria. The whole point of her was that you'd hate her, and then she'd slowly suck you in to loving her. That's not just me saying that, by the way - Walters told us that that was the point. And he did a damn good job of it, too. I wanted to choke the little beast for the first several chapters, and then she showed her hidden side. She's a Trekkie who picks up on languages fast (and not like Karou; Alexandria actually learns them, rather than cheating with wishes, like everything else Karou does.) She's got a real backbone and, best of all, it was awesome to see her apply her rich-girl skills to her real problems, especially the math and driving. Like, totally radical. Her voice even got less annoying as the book went on. Aside from my love affair with Alexandria, I liked almost everyone else too. None of them stood out like her, mind you, except perhaps Ruth - goshems, what a cutie. I love Ruth, man, I really do. She reminds me of Seepeetza/Martha, from My Name Is Seepeetza, and that book is just artery-bustingly great. And the ending. THE ENDING. FRICK. THE END. ING. OH MY GOD. Since I'm typing this on my iPod, I guess I'll have to hide this entire review for spoilers - sigh. They named the baby after her. THEY FREAKING NAMED THE BABY AFTER HER. Actually, I'm being dramatic. That wasn't even the best part. The best part was, by far and without a doubt, Alexandria accidentally threatening to put the Askari in a fire and burn them. Dear god, that was great. I actually had to put the book down and laugh at the ocean for a while. Oh yeah, did I mention that I read this whole thing in a single sitting? On the beach? In Mexico? I had no reason to tell you that, actually. I just wanted to be arrogant. TEE-FRICKIN'-HEE.So yeah, that's that. It wasn't a huge book, so unfortunately I can't say all that much more about it. Oh, but I do love the cover. So much more interesting than any of those typical \"pretty\" covers - girl in a dress. Girl in a dress. Girl in a dress. Nah, this is cooler. Anyway, it's 2:08 a.m., I'm having hot flashes and I think I'm about to throw up on my bed, so it's probably best to call it a night.

Her court date just seemed like an inconvenience to her, and she is crushed when she finds out what her sentence is. Alexandria has the option of going to jail or volunteering for one month in Kenya. As the title implies, she chooses the shorter, more labour-intensive option.Eric Walters is an author whose motto might well be quantity over quality. He has written a lot of books, and some of them are things I would never read again. This book does not fall into this category. It is a wonderful book that appeals to young people living in countries like the United States about poverty and realizing what is happening to the people who aren\u2019t talked about on social media.The character development in this book for the main character is dramatic. She starts out as a girl who does not want\u2014but expects\u2014her parents to give her a BMW convertible for her sixteenth birthday. She shoplifts for no apparent reason, seeing as she has all the money she could ever use to buy anything she pleases. At the end of the book, her eyes have been opened to the lifestyle of families in third world countries and she does some things she never would have done at the beginning of the book.Alexandria of Africa has a sequel which was released two years after the first book in this duology was. Although Alexandria of Africa can be read and thoroughly enjoyed as a standalone, Beverley Hills Maasai complements it extremely well and shows some of the characters a while later. If you enjoyed reading the first book, I would strongly recommend the second.Overall, I would recommend Alexandria of Africa to people who want to see some truly remarkable character development as well as a diverse cast of characters.Happy reading,Zahra"}, {"userName": "Enik\u0151", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1195946-enik", "userReview": "This book is on my son's mandatory reading list for the upcoming school year.

The plot unfolds very nicely and, I must say, surprisingly. Although it is a quick read, it takes longer than expected for Alexandria to actually arrive in Africa after her day in court. Once she is there, things get even more interesting than at the beginning, and the story plays out so fast that she is back home before you know it. Kudos to Eric Walters for getting straight to the point, getting things done, and getting her home.As for the ending, I thought I knew exactly what would happen, what the transformation would be, but there were still surprises in store. The change that comes over Alexandria is very well written. I could see it unfolding and it was all very believable. She is still herself at the end of the book-she doesn't suddenly turn into a saint or anything like that.

For older kids, the book is quite mundane and I found myself rolling my eyes at Alexandria's immaturity.Overall, I think this is a waste of 200 pages and since this book's main focus is on one character, that character is really disappointing."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11424811-meg", "userReview": "Throughout the beginning and middle of the plot, I had felt that everything about the story had been... lacklustre. Alexandria's character especially had me rolling my eyes and wanting to put the book down and mark it off as another Did Not Complete. Still, I read on, and was pleased to find that the character development I had been hoping to find for the fifteen-year-old rich girl protagonist was very much present after all. Alexandria's quickly developing friendship with Ruth proved very helpful towards her character, allowing her the room and opportunity to grow from a snotty brat into someone more empathetic, someone caring, someone kind. It is for this reason that I have given 3 stars as opposed to 2; had it not been for Ruth, the story as a whole would have been quite dull."}, {"userName": "Darlene Foster", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2916220-darlene-foster", "userReview": "Alexandria, the heroine of Alexandria of Africa by Eric Walters, is a teenager who has everything she wants but downplays her intelligence and resourcefulness in favour of make-up, designer clothes and material processions, until she gets caught shoplifting and is sent to Kenya to help build a school. As Alexandria learns to live without cell phone reception or hot water, has encounters with Maasai warriors, a herd of elephants, and a mud hut village; she discovers an inner strength and resilience. Her adventures, woven together with descriptions of the Kenyan landscape and people, make this a compelling read. Every first-world teenager should spend time in a developing country but most of them won't. This book is the next best thing."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6101087-elaine", "userReview": "This book was disappointing considering the author Eric Walters usually writes excellent kids books. For 3/4 of the book, Alexandria would critique every person she came in contact with, judging their hair, clothing, make up, social status, etc. I found it to be quite overdone. I won't be recommending this book to anyone.Alexandria is a spoiled rich girl who has been caught shoplifting for the second time. This time the judge does not let her off but rather sends her on a trip to Africa to help build a school. She never shows remorse for shoplifting but does come to see that money isn't what makes people happy and wants to give money to help these people she has met (not her own money but her rich father's)."}, {"userName": "Calynn", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28827151-calynn", "userReview": "This is a great middle grade-young adult novel. Some of the characters are a little extreme, but I understand that that would be necessary to show the contrast and the message that the novel is trying to convey. I really loved how Alexandria grew throughout this story. It was very believable, because it really wasn't that extreme. Her eyes were opened, but she didn't become a completely new person.This is a very interesting, scope widening novel. I first read this as a child and was certainly culture shocked. I would diffidently recommend reading this, young or old(though it would be more effective young), this is a fantastic story of growth and compassion."}, {"userName": "Sarah Korporaal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40155763-sarah-korporaal", "userReview": "Being a person who mostly reads action stories and finds other genres difficult to get into, this book was one of my favourites by Eric Walters. It starts off in Beverly Hills where a rich spoiled teenager named Alexandria is charged with shop lifting and rather than being sentenced to juvenile, she is sent on a journey that will forever change her life. Working with a charity group in Africa to build a school, Alexandria begins to realize the mistakes she made in life. The selfish rich drama queen is transformed into a selfless young adult during her time in Africa. It is a great read for any age, 10 and up. I would recommend this book to family and friends."}, {"userName": "Isabel Rocha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8998304-isabel-rocha", "userReview": "This book was very good! I find that it was very interesting and was just the great size. I would recommend this book for sure, to 10 and up. I think it is very good because you think one thing of the title and book that at the end you have a whole new idea! I find this is a great book! It would be a lot better if they always said what the characters were saying in the other language. I am a very curious person and I am always wanting to know everything. So, that would have made it better for me. All and all this is a great book and i can't wait to read the second book, called Beverly Hills Maasai."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3584349-katie", "userReview": "This book is about a girl who has had too many run ins with the law and ( instead of going to Juvenile Hall for a year ) is sent to Africa to build schools. I thought that the ideas in the book were good, but I thought that the author could have explained things in more detail and been more descriptive at times. Another thing that I would have liked is if the ending had been a little longer as I thought it was cut short. Al in all, I enjoyed reading this book, but there are a few things that I thought the author could have changed."}, {"userName": "Franxilicious", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4884385-franxilicious", "userReview": "Although it's geared for a younger audience (12-16 yrs), I enjoyed the book. The book is filled with humoristic dialogue, making it an easy and enjoyable read. The plot of the story is good, a rich and egocentric teen who is sent to Kenya, Africa, to volunteer at a charity as punishment for shoplifting. I would have like to see a deeper development of the main character as she reacts to the dramatic differences between her world and the village in Kenya, but I do understand that the book is intended for younger readers. Overall, a good light and informative read."}, {"userName": "Carlie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6718507-carlie", "userReview": "When a rich and spoiled girl ends up going to Africa, she\u2019s not in the mood to live in a tent and help Africans. She\u2019s also shoplifted, again. Some kind of discipline for her, but she will soon learn that it\u2019s not. She makes friends and truly helps people. I liked this book, but it was okay. It wasn\u2019t the kind of book you\u2019d being dying to be able to sit down and read the next chapters. It still was good. I liked the second book, Beverly Hills Massai.

In the story, a wealthy teen named Alexandria is arrested for her second time shoplifting, and instead of spending time in juvenile detention, she is instead sent to Kenya to help build a school, and on the way she makes a good friend and saves that friends mother and baby sister.

Being glamorous and rich is simply what she was born to be. When Alexandria is arrested for shoplifting, having to drag herself into court to face a judge just seems like a major inconvenience. But Alexandria has been in trouble before\u2013and this time she can\u2019t find a way to scheme out of the consequences. Before she knows it, she\u2019s on a plane headed to Kenya where she has been ordered to work for an international charity. Over 7,000 miles away from home with no hot water, no cell phone reception, no friends or family, Alexandria is confronted with a land as unfamiliar as it is unsettling. Over the course of her month in Africa, Alexandria will face a reality she could never have imagined, and will have to look inside herself to see if she has what it takes to confront it.", "title": "Alexandria of Africa\n      \n          (Alexandria of Africa #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4955889-alexandria-of-africa", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320506188l/4955889.jpg", "reviews": 102, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127860.Eric_Walters", "name": "Eric Walters"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Cultural", "Realistic Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4955889-alexandria-of-africa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934467-the-rule-of-three", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1369507.We_All_Fall_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21469162-fight-for-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1909490.Safe_as_Houses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12308204-end-of-days"]}
