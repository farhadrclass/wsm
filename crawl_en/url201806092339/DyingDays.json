Each time I read another of his books I'm surprised that it just gets better. He manages to capture the genre perfectly. The funny is spot on, the horror is ghastly.The entire Dying Days series is worth adding to your collection. Dying Days 3, like its predecessors is so much more than just a simple zombie tale. Darlene Bobich, all around badass chick fights off everything but the kitchen sink! When I grow up, I want to be Darlene! Okay, maybe not the black thong. I'm not a fan of wedgies.I wont spoil the book by telling you about the specifics because it's worth discovering on your own. But let me just say...holy twist Batman!! Gotta love a zombie with a God complex. Now there's something you don't see everyday.Rosamilia hits it out of the park with Dying Days 3. The ending has left me salivating for more. Oh ya, and looking for a new place to live. He's scared me away from Florida!Visit bookie-monster.com for my full review."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983118-frank", "userReview": "The Dying Days saga continues with the third installment of the main series title. Dying Days 3 continues to put Armand Rosamilia's talent for writing zombie horror on display. Rosamilia keeps the story line ever changing and evolving. Dying Days 3 is no exception, this time the zombies take a quantum leap.As usual, the story keeps focus on the survivors. Namely Darlene Bobitch and her small band of survivors living on stilt houses in Flagler Beach, Florida. While Darlene continues to hone her kick ass no-holds-barred style of living and loving, the zombies she fights on a daily basis also start to evolve.Rosamilia treads dangerous territory with where he is taking his zombies. Some may scoff at the very idea of the twist. But, unless your are a die hard purist, you should embrace the change and get excited for the possibilities it presents for future installments in the series.All in all, the action continues to be tight. There is never a boring moment and you turn the page and try to keep up with the action. The twist with the zombies keeps you guessing as to where the story (and the series for that matter) are going to go. The end really ramps up the jaw dropping and cliff hanging as we now must all wait with mouths agape for the next installment in the series."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11602149-jason", "userReview": "Yet another fun zombie story! Each book gets more and more interesting and I love how quick the reads are."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "(spoiler alerts)Darlene is back and she is the same hard shelled, soft centered, take no nonsense, body obsessed heroine; I can\u2019t help but love her, even when she is prattling on about her thongs!The Flagler beach survival group has a new threat looming; who is killing all the zombies and stacking them under the pier?Will the Lich\u2019s plans come to anything?AR brings a new element and twist to the series \u2013 Frank is a zombie but he has become self aware, and he his not the only one. I can\u2019t think of a worse scenario for all involved, although Frank and the Lich seem to be liking it.I really enjoy this series of zombie books as there are no big sub plots or lots of different groups to keep track off, its very much here and now, and in your face, usually with a big fat tongue in cheek dose of humour. There are still the intense emotions, some wild sex and gore laden fights but it\u2019s much more a \u201cBmovie\u201d style novel, and I love that. However, don\u2019t let that comment fool you into thinking the characters are wooden or 2 dimensional, far from it, Bri\u2019s little lack of prom rant was actually quite upsetting when you think of all that would be lost in an apocalypse and the deaths are heartbreaking as AR keeps you very focused on the survivors. The zombies are very real, if a little warped. AR seems to take total delight in being as freaky as possible. He also manages to make his little ragtag survivor group very real without any military training and inclusive of young girls and old men, not necessarily who you would pick to aid you in a zombie fight but wow they make a mean drinking and movie watching bunch and shouldn\u2019t survival be worth living, at least a bit of it.This series is really starting to hot up on the weirdness front and strays far, far, FAR from the purist ideals of zombies \u2013 but good! AR is a talented writer (try is other, non zombie novels/novellas/shorts) if these zoms are not to your liking!"}, {"userName": "Pheebz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32536934-pheebz", "userReview": "In this book We meet Frank the zombie, ex-surgeon, the husband of \"Patient Zero\",an evolving Zombie and a unique POV.(\"Oh Crap!\") Darleen & John finally get together.The small group of survivors start to notice, some very subtle changes with some of the undead.This small group of survivors are slowly dwindling, some are taking off on their own in the middle of the night and taking part of what little provisions are left with them when they go.More than one member of this small group of survivors are begging to question the validity in the desire to stay alive in a world where a safe haven is just a myth.Each day they must fight to stay alive. Supplies are few and each time they send a team out to search for food there is no certainty that they will return.They also believe there must be another group of survivors close, the number of infected out to kill them at every turn are decreasing and someone is piling up the carcases of the dead again on the highway.Mr.Armand Rosamilia, has created a world that few could begin to imagine. The characters have great depth and personality.He describes this world in such detail you can see it clearly in your mind. I went between the Ebook and Audiobook. Amanda M Lehman does a wonderful job with the voices and the story."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12534351-annie", "userReview": "I have liked this series, and m moving on to book 4 now...It is really becoming terrifying for the group because these zombies are regenerating...and they can think again...and they are truly evil!! Not only are they still sex crazed maniacs they want to eat babies and stuff...its just really scary!!!
