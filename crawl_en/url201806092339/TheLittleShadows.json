It actually took me 2 weeks to read this book. It was my own private hell. This is the story of 3 Canadian sisters' travels through early 1900's vaudeville. The author must have done extensive research on vaudeville acts pre WWI and she describes each and every one of them, ad nauseum. An editor would have been greatly appreciated and this 520+ page book should have been half the length. However once you strip away all the description of the acts the story of the 3 sisters has been told before, nothing very interesting or different here. Very boring."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "What a wonderful story!It began Canada, to a cold, snowy day in 1912.Flora Avery took her three daughters \u2013 Aurora, Clover and Bella \u2013 to an audition. She had been a vaudeville star, before her marriage to a school-teacher, and now she wanted the same for her girls.I wondered if she was a pushy, show business mother, but she wasn\u2019t. She was a widow, struggling to cope, and doing the best she could for her girls.Vaudeville was hugely popular in those days, when cinema was in its infancy and television was a long way in the future. But it was very, very competitive.The girls \u2013 The Belle Aurores \u2013 sing and dance well, but so do many others. Fortunately though they have Flora\u2019s contacts \u2013 and her tenacity \u2013 and a little luck to set them on the road.The three girls will go through many ups and downs as they travel the Vaudeville circuit. And there will be tears and laughter, joy and pain as they all come of age.Three sisters quite beautifully drawn. I saw so much that they had in common, I saw the ties that bound them together, but I also saw that the three were quite different.Aurora is the oldest and she is bright, practical, and prepared to apply herself to do what she knows is best for her family. Clover is a little younger, and she is quieter and more thoughtful than her sisters, but every bit as willing as Aurora to do whatever needs to be done once she has seen things through. And Bella, the youngest, is vivacious and warm-hearted, but maybe just a little bit headstrong.They were utterly real, their relationships and their interactions were exactly right, and I loved them all.Life would sometimes take them in different directions, but the bond between them was unbreakable.Watching them as the years passed was a little like watching a theatre show: indeed the book is divided into acts, and then those acts are divided into short scenes, sketches, vignettes. And I saw every detail. Their lives on and off stage, all of the people around them, the theatres, the boarding houses. The picture of their world was so complete that I really did feel that I had stepped into another age.That isn\u2019t to say that I didn\u2019t have to do a little work: there were times when things were left unsaid, events were left unreported; times when I could only see things from a distance. I didn\u2019t mind that. It helped to draw me in to the story, whereas if everything had been explained I probably would have just stood back and enjoyed the spectacle. The story moved slowly at first, but as the three sisters grew from girls into independent young women, as they found new interests, as they formed new relationships, as they had to make difficult choices, it gathered momentum and it was quite irresistible.Because this isn\u2019t just a wonderfully vivid picture of the world of vaudeville; it\u2019s also a moving account of the lives of four women, moving forward with their lives, supporting and understanding each other, and holding on to the ties that made them into a family.It\u2019s a book to read slowly, so that you can take in every character, every song, every sight, every little incident. There really is so much to appreciate, and it is all drawn so beautifully.And now it is over, but I\u2019d like to think that the Belle Aurores are still out there somewhere, still performing \u2026"}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "The Little Shadows is a beautifully written coming-of-age tale of three sisters at the beginning of the twentieth century. At a time when moving pictures were in their infancy and television was the stuff of science fiction, vaudeville was one of the few forms of entertainment available and was hugely popular. So, when their father dies, Flora, the girls' mother decides to have them audition as a song-and-dance routine. They are not particularly talented but, thanks mainly to the eldest sister's beauty and Flora's connections, they soon find themselves on the vaudeville circuit in the western US and Canada.Author Marina Endicott is obviously fond of her subject and has done her research. She describes in great detail many of the acts which were popular at the time. Although most of the characters are fictitious (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle does make a cameo appearance), many of these acts are based on real performers like Buster Keaton. Also, many of the songs the girls sing are ones which most of us would know like Danny Boy. Although very few of us (including myself) have ever experienced a real vaudeville show first-hand, being able to recognize and hum along with the tunes lends a sense of familiarity to the story.The book is divided into acts as the girls progress from novices to seasoned veterans of the circuit and these acts are further divided into short vignettes or skits just as a vaudeville show would have been. There is even an encore and Ms Endicott has definitely saved the best for last.The Little Shadows is historical fiction at its finest - three dimensional characters the reader can relate to, a vibrant picture of a bygone era, and an author with the ability to make it all come to life while remaining true to the time - so let's all give a warm round of applause to this heartwarming ode to vaudeville."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143619-michael", "userReview": "Vaudeville is a wonderous art form that has sadly long left our world. A world were stage entertainment is king and is a life that Flora wants to get her three young daughters Aurora, Clover and Belle into and will fight to the bone to have them be successful. Flora a former Vaudeville performer herself is struggling to keep the family afloat after the death of her son to pneumonia and the suicide death of her husband and now she is down to her last $20. After numerous humilating failed auditions in dingy heated halls the girls finally get a break wich will see them hit the road with the Vuadeville curcuit wich will take them in through Canada and the US.For five years we track the girls who will be first known as the Belle Auroras as they play to a string of provincial theatres ranging from the dire to the dismal. In this time the girls will encounter all that life throws at them with the tough and demanding life of the circuit to seduction' triumphs' top billings to joy and tragedy when the girls break up during the time of the first great war. As a documentary of popular theatre The Little Shadows is encyclopaediac and often absorbing. Endicott has clearly left no stone unturned. The book also features some of the great classic songs of the times during the performances such as Buffalo Girls, After The Ball, Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me A Bow-Wow wich are described in in great detail but perhaps in some cases excessivly.The main characters are a sheer delight with Flora or Mama as she is known to her girls being the apitomy of support and love. While the girls all were unique with there own quirks and personalities. Aurora who although gorgeous was equally vunerable, Clover quiet and spoilt and Belle who is sensual and pensive are all vivid creations but not always clearly differentiated. The other characters are a mix of charlatans, eccentrics to the ordinary people with extroidinary talents. The story itself is rich and poetic with its delivery although some may find it irrating and overwhelming. There are also wonderfully funny sex scenes with unsettling analyses of male performance. All of this adds up to be to a wonderful entertaing read. With themes of art, family and sisterly love and the importance of moral in times of uncertainty. Moving and original i can not recommend this book enough."}, {"userName": "Rafaela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1938822-rafaela", "userReview": "[There was a review here.

It is the story of three sisters, teenagers as the story begins, who travel with their mother to support the family as a vaudeville act. The book is 527 pages long, but I was engaged in the story immediately. I loved the way the author switched back and forth between the sisters (especially) and the mother (occasionally). It took a while for the characters to grow on me, but I enjoyed all of the story telling and the pictures of life in vaudeville.Through the first half of the book, we follow the sisters in their travails in vaudeville. They all love the life and entertaining people, and I liked that it wasn't a chore for them. If they were tied down in one place for too long, they got bored. In the money or not, they wanted to be entertaining in vaudeville more than anything else.At around the midpoint of the book, the sisters are all maturing and various aspects of life intrude upon their plans and goals. I don't like to say more than that, but at this point, I was more involved with the characters and pulling for them with their various problems or triumphs in life. This book covers the years from 1912-1917 and thus World War I figures a great deal. That was also a plus for me. I like to learn about wars in a fictional setting.Marina Endicott has done extensive research on vaudeville, as she describes in her acknowledgements and at her website. This book shows the poverty and uncertainty in the vaudeville life for most performers, and how their fortunes may rise or fall based on luck just as easily as talent."}, {"userName": "Alexis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689723-alexis", "userReview": "Extremely mixed feelings about this one. It is probably quite good, but I just couldn't get into it. I ended up reading a multitude of books while reading this one, which is a sign that a book is not doing something for me.That said, one of the reasons why I didn't like it was because I LOVED \"Good to a fault.\" I find that sometimes when I love, love, love one book by an author, it makes it more difficult for me to love other books by them. (See Lynn Coady's \"The Antagonist\" due to \"Mean Boy\" love and Miriam Toews' \"A complicated kindness\", which makes everything else she does pale in comparison) This is unfortunate.There are a lot of things that Endicott does right in this book. I loved the prairie locations, and the history in this book. I loved how the characters moved around and travelled and the history of vaudeville.However, I had a really hard time telling two of the sisters apart and I couldn't keep them straight in my head. I read another review which said that the reviewer was distracted by the recounting of the vaudeville sketches- and I had the same problem. I think that this book would actually make a great movie.I suspect that I would have enjoyed this book more if I'd read it at a different time. I've been sick and my concentration is off, and I felt like I needed to concentrate to follow this. So, yes, there's a lot of good stuff here, but I wasn't in the mood to get into it."}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty", "userReview": "I have been looking forward to this novel since it came out and I first read its blurb, and despite requesting several review copies, I had to wait until it was given to me as a birthday present back in June. What I found when I opened its pages was a marvellous novel. I am so interested in vaudeville, and this story is such a great one. I love the way in which the story is split up into sections pertaining to the theatre \u2013 \u2018Ouverture\u2019, \u2018Act 1/Act 2\u2019, \u2018Intermission\u2019, \u2018Act 3/Act 4\u2019 and \u2018Finale\u2019. Endicott\u2019s descriptions are sublime, particularly those which relate to the theatre. Her words weave a vivid picture. I loved the relationship which she built between the Avery sisters, and their care of one another was very sweet. The many strands of story which come together and then separate again have been well realised, and make for a very rich and unforgettable plot. True to its content, The Little Shadows is a novel which sweeps you up and takes you on tour with it, and I for one cannot wait to read more of Endicott\u2019s books."}, {"userName": "Pam Bustin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1247028-pam-bustin", "userReview": "Damn that is one good book.The ending had me weeping.

It is the flash of a firefly in the nightthe breath of a buffalo in the wintertimethe little shadow which runs across the grassand loses itself in the sunset.~Crowfoot The Little Shadows opens in 1912 as Flora \u2013 recent widow and former vaudeville star, down to her last twenty dollars \u2013 ushers her three teenage daughters to an audition at the Empress Theatre in Fort Macleod. Having been trained in song and dance by their mother for their entire lives, the girls believe themselves ready to perform professionally, but it's not until they tread the boards and rub elbows with seasoned acts that they recognise their own amateurism. Fortunately, some leads and luck and a willingness to work for next to nothing sends the Belle Auroras off on the vaudeville circuit of western Canada and the US, where the girls hone their craft until they become headline acts themselves. Spanning the years from 1912 \u2013 1917, we watch as the girls grow into women against a backdrop of the drums of war from Europe and the last glory days of vaudeville before the motion pictures take over. What a fascinating time for author Marina Endicott to explore with this lovely work of historical fiction.As a regular patron of live theater, I was hooked by this book right from the start. More particularly, I once sat in the audience of the Empress Theatre and watched as actor friends of mine were married on that very stage, and when the fictional sisters later move into The Arlington in Edmonton, I could recall the artsy friends I had who also lived there (not in a coveted top floor suite, but with an original murphy bed nonetheless). As I can see that reviewers either love or hate The Little Shadows, I must acknowledge that part of my own enjoyment of the book is likely related to how much I could identify with the world portrayed within it; where some readers might think the book would benefit from fewer song lyrics and Abbot and Costello-type comedy routines written out in full, I loved how immersive they made the reading experience; like watching an evening of theater.As for the sisters themselves, I got a real Little Women vibe from their relationship, and although the time periods of these two books don't quite overlap, they had similar writing styles (complete with parenthetical exclamations!), and as both books are about girls and their mothers trying to get by without the presence of a man, I don't think that the similarities are accidental (and appreciate the authenticity that the tone lends; I believed it could have been written in the time in which it's set.) But whereas the March sisters had their passions held in check by the Victorian morals of their age, Aurora, Clover and Bella Avery are fully human and sexual beings, constantly pulled between the backstage licentiousness of their profession and the need to appear as respectable artistes of \u201cpolite\u201d vaudeville (they might vamp and wink to the audience, but this is never burlesque). The honesty of their emotions \u2013 and the awareness that girls on their own must do what they must to get by \u2013 is what marks The Little Shadows as a thoroughly modern book, full of self-awareness and compromise. As the three grow older and more distinct, I believed each one of them and the choices that they made.What makes this a wonderfully Canadian book is the growing presence of WWI. Even though the male vaudeville performers are mostly Americans, when the setting switches to a farm in Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan and a flat in London, England, the effects of the war in Europe on the Canadian consciousness is vividly portrayed, complete with telegrams notifying deaths and returning soldiers suffering the effects of gassing and shell shock. That Endicott chose to set her story in the overlap of vaudeville and Canada's first great international war effort makes for a fascinating and holistic view of our own history.\nAll men who had been in battle knew things she would never know. She was eavesdropping. But she, waiting without word for weeks, being with Victor when the visions plagued him, knew things that men did not seem to remember.\nAs I started with, I've known plenty of actors and other artistes and I could never imagine myself performing onstage \u2013 not just because I have no talent for it but because I have no intuition for it. What Endicott demonstrates so well in this book is that her performers aren't just trying to entertain their audiences, they're attempting to commune with them; to create an interactive conversation of subconscious call and response. When the Belle Auroras \u2013 or even the elocutionists and comedians \u2013 reach that level of interconnectedness with their spectators, amusement is elevated to art and we're all the better for it. As one artiste explains the importance of this effort:\nPerfecting it. Making it \u2013 realer, or less real ... We are only pointing at the moon, but it is the moon.\nWith The Little Shadows, Endicott also achieves this level of transcendence; this elevation of amusement to art. Throw in some funny patter, a truly Canadian backdrop, and a believable coming of age story, and this book checks all my boxes."}, {"userName": "Simone", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6314348-simone", "userReview": "[ The only character I started to become familiar with and attached to was Gentry who Endicott quickly dismisses, sending him to his death in far off Montreal (a death which never seems to actually happen, given how imminent he felt his demise was going to be, it is strange that he out lasts some of the sprightlier characters in the novel).

First is the fact that I read Good to a Fault earlier this year and loved its exploration of the complexity of modern life, its depth of characterization, and its choice of a messy and somewhat ambiguous ending. Second is that I am growing weary of historical fiction and annoyed by the fact that almost every major Canadian publisher has released a 'big name author' work of historical fiction this fall - Vanderhaeghe, Ondaatje, Hay - I'm sure there are more. What I'm not sure of is if there have been any 'big' Canadian novels that deal with contemporary characters and settings - nothing comes to mind. And in my attempt to read at least the six Booker shortlist titles, I was confronted by yet another historical novel, Carol Birch's Jarmusch's Menagerie.Obviously these are my problems, not those of this novel itself.And yet....Reading other community reviews I too found this one difficult to get into. I spent the first hundred pages trying to keep the three sisters straight in my mind while being simultaneously plunged into the hectic world of vaudeville and encountering a cast of dozens of other characters as well. This situation improved as the novel progressed, but I'm not so sure other readers will have the same amount of patience and commitment to finishing a novel as I do.This is a huge book both in terms of sheer page numbers and subject matter, although really it focuses on less than a decade in the lives of the three main characters. Should there have been three main characters, though, I wonder, especially since the middle and youngest sister get short shrift? The eldest sister gets far and away the greatest share of air time (even though the middle and youngest sister are, in many ways, far more interesting as potential characters). Should the villain be quite so cheerfully, pragmatically villainous and should he really be allowed to drive off into the sunset without our ever getting another peep at him - even though he leaves the eldest sister in a lifetime of limbo and is far too flamboyant to imagine doing anything but working as a vaudeville impresario? And yet, presumably, a man known to every newspaper reporter in North America, successfully vanishes with only one rumour of a sighting from the close-knit vaudeville circuit. Should some of the minor characters (such as the comedy duo East & Verrall) be ever-so-hauntingly revealed as sexual-preference-ambivalent in a scene of less than a paragraph? Would an upright Saskatchewan family really have opened its arms during World War I to not one but six down-on-their luck members-by-marriage, especially when one of them is a 'no better than she should be' sister-in-law, another her daughter who may or may or may not have been legally wed when she conceived the child she arrives with, and a third another of her daughters who's living and having children in a Fabian-style arrangement with her non-husband?I found the ending implausible and the backstory unconvincing. By the time the three sisters enter the world of vaudeville the youngest is 13 and yet not one of the sisters has formed a single friendship at the schools they presumably attended (after all, their father was a school teacher). In order for this to really have worked as a novel, the alternative to vaudeville would have to have been set up as truly unbearably spirit-crushing, and it wasn't. Still, I found the book grew on me and the characters became clearer as time went on. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't love it. I'm happy to see an author tackle a very different style of novel from her previous one. But I would have to rate this one a not-so-near miss.Other takes on this novel: (positive) http://ow.ly/75JFO and http://ow.ly/75JJb and a particularly scathing review that rather more emphatically focuses on some of the points I've mentioned: http://ow.ly/75JMu"}, {"userName": "Melissa Lee", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15977297-melissa-lee", "userReview": "Vaudeville was a popular form of entertainment that featured a variety of acts beginning in the late 19th century. Marina Endicott\u2019s The Little Shadows is set just before and during the years of World War I. It is a form of entertainment that I have never read about before, so I was intrigued to discover what it was all about. The author drew influence from Buster Keaton and the Pantages theaters. It was evident that the acts enjoyed at these shows were quite different than what is standard in the present day. Endicott painted a detailed picture of the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of theater life, both on stage and behind the curtain. Also described in detail was the different performances including song lyrics. Unfortunately I found this to become tedious to read after a few chapters.At over 500 pages in length, it took me quite a while longer to finish this book, than I hoped. This was due in part to the fact that I had a hard time connecting with the sisters. The plot felt quite drawn out and anti-climactic.Thankfully my interest began to pick up during the last 100 pages or so. I found this book to be written beautifully and the language rang true to the time period. I also liked the way each chapter was divided and named.Even though I didn\u2019t exactly love this book, I would still recommend The Little Shadows by Marina Endicott to those who enjoy historical fiction with a focus on entertainment."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4987113-lori", "userReview": "A very enjoyable book. Captivated and enchanted as I was with Marina Endicott's earlier book, \"Good to a Fault\", I was excited to read The Little Shadows. Set in 1912-17 in western Canada and focused on the Vaudeville phenomenon of that time, This story revolves around the experiences and relationships of four women: Flora a new widow and former Vaudeville performer, and her three teenage daughters: Aurora, Clover and Bella. Switching seamlessly back and forth through the different Points of View of Flora and each of the sisters, Endicott deftly gives the reader a real sense of each personality and an appreciation of the differences between these women but also why the love and loyalty between them is so strong and unbending no matter what unfortunate circumstance threatens their well-being or their family unit. Life on the Vaudeville circuit was not something I had any understanding about but this story effectively portrayed what that must have been like: constantly negotiating and dealing to keep your act \"on the bill\", forever altering routines and adopting new ones to keep your act fresh and perennially on the road traveling from small town to small town as your act moved up (or down) in popularity and notoriety. Reading about this lifestyle and seeing how driven these performers had to be gives new meaning to the phrase \"the show must go on\" no matter what. As much as I enjoyed the insights into Vaudeville that this book gave me, what I enjoyed most was the love and loyalty felt and the relationship between these sisters. With their story spanning the beginning and a good chunk of World War I and what the devastation and horror for men fighting overseas meant to mothers, wives, sisters, girlfriends and small towns everywhere, the story of the war, overhanging the lives of these three sisters, emphasized the importance of the presence of love, loyalty and resiliency in families in order for them to survive and thrive no matter what.

Marina Endicott lifts the curtain to reveal Aurora, Clover, Belle and their mother auditioning to join a vaudeville house. The Avery sisters are young and pretty with sweet voices and their mother, once a performer herself, is prepared to lean on old acquaintances to encourage her daughters success. The life of all but the most successful and talented acts is difficult, performers must fight for their place in the line up to assure continued work but at the whim of the manager, or the audience, they can be dismissed and forced to move on. The Avery's grow up amongst a motley collection of performers, moving from theatre to theatre in search of their big break and the dream of earning $1000 a week. The Little Shadows follows their career from naive teenage girls to seasoned performers as they navigate their way through success and failure, joy and heartbreak.With a complete lack of irony, what I loved about The Little Shadows is also what made this novel a bit of a slog to read. Endicott obviously spent a lot of time researching vaudeville at the turn of the 20th century, the details of absolutely everything are exquisitely rendered - from the dank, dusty dressing rooms to the intricacies of a slapstick routine and the fine stitching of delicate costumes. The author breathes life into this hidden world with beautiful imagery that illustrates both the setting and the period in which it takes place. I truly admired the author's ability to so finely create the Avery's sisters world, but I also felt that at times, all this detail overshadowed both the plot and the characters. The story centers on the Avery sisters, Aurora, Clover and Belle who are just 16, 14 and 13 respectively, though lying about their ages, at the beginning of the book. The girls mature in this unusual setting where they must behave as adults even though they are still children. Aurora is the prettiest with the finest voice and is also the most ambitious of the three. Clover is the quietest, an astute observer of the lifestyle and the characters she encounters. Belle, the youngest, has the personality of the performer, she is effervescent, curious and a bit of a dreamer. Despite their general appeal though, I struggled to connect to their characters. Endicott describes how they put on their makeup, labour over their costumes, learn to sing from their diaphragms but she rarely gives access to their inner thoughts. They are swamped some how but what they are rather than who they are.Similarly, Endicott describes the other inhabitants of the world of vaudeville in detail, stepping us through their various routines or roles but again, rarely shows us what these characters think or feel.Endicott intends for the story to be driven by character rather than plot but the lack of direction is frustrating at times. Mostly I felt the book moved from one beautifully described scene to another without really going anywhere at all. I assume the intention was to give the story the structure of a vaudeville show but largely the story failed to come to life when the curtain came down, which is when the real action should have happened.I really wanted to be swept away by The Little Shadows, and it is fascinating for its historical detail and unique setting, but for me, it lacked soul."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348805-marleen", "userReview": "The year is 1912 and after the death of their father and baby brother the three Avery sisters, Aurora, Clover and Bella hit the road with their mother to start their career as vaudeville stars.Flora Avery, the girls\u2019 mother, worked in vaudeville before she married their father and gratefully uses contacts from the old days to get her girls started. But, it is by no means plain sailing. The world of vaudeville is highly competitive and knows no mercy. If you don\u2019t entertain the audience you are out, no matter who you are or how bad your circumstances.Aurora Avery, aged 16 when the story starts, is the eldest of the three sisters and the clever one, shrewd and determined to do whatever it takes to make sure her family and she will not only survive but prosper. Clover, one year younger is thoughtful and quiet, but determined once she makes up her mind. Bella, the baby, is full of fun and good natured but headstrong and single-minded when push comes to shove.The vaudeville world will take the Avery\u2019s through ups and downs, expose their weaknesses and enhance their strengths. It will bring them into contact with a host of characters some good and dependable, others who would use them and others again who look down on them.When the girls start on their career they have little but their hopes to sustain them, but as the years go by and they grow up they learn about life, about themselves and about the world. Ultimately they emerge as strong, independent women while never losing the close bond that was forged through blood, shared experience and a deep love.This is a wonderful story about what ties a family together, about learning to deal with life and keeping your chin up no matter what obstacles you find in your way. Through ups and downs, and individual and joint interests the four women always have each other to fall back on. Innocence, pride, fear and na\u00efve carelessness all combine to make the three Avery girls irresistible characters. By the time I finished the book I felt I knew the girls personally and would have been proud to call each one of them my friend.The book shows the compromises that need to be made in order to gain or keep the life you want, and the rewards as well as the disappointments you might meet on the way.This is also a fascinating insight into the world of vaudeville. Filled with intimate details the life of the artists on the stage is shared with the reader to such an extent that it is easy to visualise the settings, the performances and the hard work that goes into making it all look easy. Readers will recognise some of the songs mentioned in the book, and quietly hum along as the lyrics appear on the page.This is a book to read at your leisure, unrushed while savouring every word. Allow yourself to join the stars on the stage, let the descriptions of acts and sets transport you to the world of vaudeville in the early 20th century and enjoy the applause of the appreciative audience. And, once you finish the book you will want to put your own hands together to applaud Marina Endicott for the wonderful book she has gifted her readers."}, {"userName": "Gail Amendt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5739689-gail-amendt", "userReview": "I love historical fiction, and this book does exactly what historical fiction should do, both entertains and educates. The fact that it takes place largely in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Montana, in places I have visited, makes it even more appealing to me. I was hooked right from the opening chapter, which takes place at the Empress Theatre in Fort Macleod, which is still standing and which I visited last summer. And it explores the world of vaudeville, about which I have always been curious but knew very little. Beginning in 1912, just prior to the start of WWI, this is the story of the three teenage Avery sisters, who begin a career as vaudeville performers after the untimely death of their father and younger brother. Not wanting to live on the charity of in-laws who never really approved of her, their mother takes them back to the world she knew before she married their father. Vaudeville is a very cruel and competitive world, where acts are cancelled on a whim, and it is often a struggle just to earn enough for food and a roof over your head. While the sisters lack somewhat in talent and experience, they are determined, and we watch them struggle and grow as they dream of leaving \"small time\"\" vaudeville behind and making it in the \"big time\", where top rated acts earn $1000 a week. Along the way they meet some unique and fascinating characters, many of them based on real vaudeville performers of days gone by. Many of the vaudeville acts described are also based on real acts from the past, and the songs performed are songs that were popular in that time and would have been performed frequently on vaudeville stages. The author has definitely done her research. I learned a lot of theatre lingo, and also learned about the different levels of respectability in the entertainment of that time. Vaudeville was considered respectable family entertainment, variety was somewhat lower class, and then there was burlesque. Some people have complained that this book is too long and too descriptive, but I loved the way we are immersed in the world of vaudeville. All the traveling and the coming and going of all the different performers did get somewhat confusing, but that is what I suspect living in the world of vaudeville felt like as they were constantly moving from city to city, living in a series of hotels and rooming houses, and performing with different people all the time. There are some minor inconsistencies in this book that drove me crazy, and which the editor should have caught, but this is still a really good read."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30824320-pamela", "userReview": "I started out not enjoying it very much, but got caught up in the sisters' lives and what a glorius ending. It reminds me how important an ending can be, especially one that is memorable: \"Wait!\" she cried. \"Wait for me!\"And maybe there is just not enough novels of Canadian historical significance.NOW Magazine review:I have been known to mock the Governor General\u2019s fiction jury when it appears to worry more about its mandate than about the quality of the work. Because the GGs want to honour the regions, for example, the fine but not spectacular Cool Water, which came out of the Prairies, took the prize last year.This year I\u2019m feeling the opposite. Marina Endicott\u2019s novel The Little Shadows has made the short list, and though it\u2019s not, literarily speaking, a knockout, it does exactly what a worthy GG entry should: shed light on a part of Canada\u2019s history that otherwise would\u2019ve stayed in the dark.The novel begins several years before the First World War, when Aurora, Clover and Bella are trying to survive on Canada\u2019s vaudeville circuit under the wing of their widowed mother.Endicott\u2019s plumbed the canon to recreate entire acts by some of the great stage players of the time, reproducing song lyrics and stunts to take the reader right into their world.Before she started writing fiction, Endicott was herself an actor, and you can tell. She describes the thrill of performance as only someone who\u2019s been there can. And as the sisters develop as artists, she demonstrates her deep knowledge of what it takes to become skilled at stagecraft.The book is long but told in brief episodes, so it can be read in snatches without getting lost. And that brings me to a tiny weakness in Endicott\u2019s fiction. Like her fine Giller-shortlisted novel Good To A Fault, The Little Shadows, despite its frank treatment of menstruation, pregnancy and sexual assault, is a gentle read. But though it\u2019s not exactly gripping, it is absolutely absorbing.And, as a work evoking an underappreciated phase in Canada\u2019s stage history, it\u2019s infinitely worthy of its spot on the Governor General\u2019s short list. We find out who wins on Tuesday (November 15)."}, {"userName": "Melissa T", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803789-melissa-t", "userReview": "****Please note I won this book as a Goodreads Giveaway*******I feel somewhat bad for only rating this book as okay. I feel guilty that it took me so long to finish reading it, especially after winning it as a giveaway. I thought this book would be more fun than it was, being about the vaudeville era.The main disappointment was the plodding pace of the book. I put this down after barely a hundred pages to read other things. It dragged on, and didn't really catch my interest until somewhere around page 350. And even then, half my reason for finishing it was for the sake of finishing it not necessarily because I wanted to know what happened. It was just too somber for my liking. The characters seemed thrown together, just like the jumble of all the different chapters. Which weren't even chapters so much as headers. It reminded me of reading an article in a textbook or something. The format was meant, I think, to resemble the nature of vaudeville and have the approach of vignettes, and a show, but it didn't mesh for me. I felt that the background was really lacking as well. Especially the parts of the story regarding the girls brother Harry, and their father. They all cared for the brother and father, that was obvious, but there was little explanation in the way of their deaths and I felt that a little more back story would have been helpful.The whole courtship (or lack thereof?) of Aurora and Mr Ridgeway seemed to be pointless filler. The relationship with their uncle seemed that way too. It served the purpose of helping bind up the end of the story but the way that the past fight is brought up in thought only without any real mention is just useless, it could have been cut out entirely. There were too many characters and too much crowding of them, for me to get pulled in by the story. This author is new to me, but sadly after struggling so much to get through this I don't think I'll be trying to read anything else by her. At least not anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Maia Caron", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32693545-maia-caron", "userReview": "After immensely enjoying Good to a Fault some years ago, I came to The Little Shadows with big expectations. I was not disappointed to again find myself in the gifted hands of one of Canada\u2019s great writing talents. The Little Shadows is literary historical fiction at its best. Many beautifully written passages reminded me why Marina Endicott\u2019s books have found themselves on the Governor General\u2019s Literary Award and Giller Prize short-lists.The Little Shadows tells the story of the three Avery sisters and their mother in alternating points of view as they negotiate the world of vaudeville in the early 1900s. The book is a love letter to vaudeville, and more compellingly, conveys a thespian\u2019s engaging behind-the-curtain viewpoint.The enjoyment of historical fiction is to become immersed in another time and place, far removed from the modern world. While reading The Little Shadows, I could almost smell the dust in the wings of the Canadian prairie theatres and intimately knew the eccentric characters that danced and sang across its stages. I came away with a new appreciation for vaudeville performers and what they endured to bring entertainment to audiences in an age before moving pictures.This book contains one of the most compelling sex scenes I\u2019ve ever come across and beautifully styled prose that makes concrete the abstract feelings that we all have but struggle to put into words. For instance, one of the Avery sisters muses on love and thinks she has always \u201cbeen happiest alone.\u201d Endicott writes, \u201cNot pretending, not folding herself small to fit in someone else\u2019s grasp.\u201d That line really struck at my heart and encapsulated thoughts and fears I\u2019ve had about entering into marriage. It's not easy to convey an emotion like this, that many women must feel but are unable to communicate, even to themselves. Marina Endicott digs deep and brings a beautiful story of the past into the present day."}], "description": "Here is the eagerly anticipated new novel from a brilliant writer whose last book, Good to a Fault, was shortlisted for the prestigious Giller Prize and won the Commonwealth Prize for Canada and the Caribbean.The Little Shadows revolves around three sisters in the world of vaudeville before and during the First World War. We follow the lives of all three in turn: Aurora, the eldest and most beautiful, who is sixteen when the book opens; thoughtful Clover, a year younger; and the youngest sister, joyous headstrong sprite Bella, who is thirteen. The girls, overseen by their fond but barely coping Mama, are forced to make their living as a singing act after the untimely death of their father. They begin with little besides youth and hope, but Marina Endicott\u2019s genius is to show how the three girls slowly and steadily evolve into true artists even as they navigate their way to adulthood among a cast of extraordinary characters \u2013 some of them charming charlatans, some of them unpredictable eccentrics, and some of them just ordinary-seeming humans with magical gifts.Using her gorgeous prose and extraordinary insight, Endicott lures us onto the brightly lit stage and then into the little shadows that lurk behind the curtain, and reveals how the art of vaudeville -- in all its variety, madness, melodrama, hilarity and sorrow -- echoes the art of life itself.", "title": "The Little Shadows", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10868799-the-little-shadows", "average": 3.26, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391572327l/10868799.jpg", "reviews": 144, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1567757.Marina_Endicott", "name": "Marina Endicott"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10868799-the-little-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414533-the-little-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15924381-the-little-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13401490-the-little-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4681859-good-to-a-fault", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23165091-close-to-hugh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3688555-open-arms", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12330390-new-year-s-eve", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22246526-charit-bien-ordonn-e", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
