Highly recommended, but with the caveat that the narrative does at times move a bit slowly and haltingly (this did not bother me all that much, but I think it should at least be mentioned as a so-called heads-up)."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/407290-tom", "userReview": "It was with hesitation that I purchased and eventually picked up this book to actually read. James Herriot is one of my favorite authors of all time. I grew up reading him in middle school, and he's my fall back author for when I'm feeling totally depressed and crapped out. So his books are very meaningful to me, and I was hesitant to discover any back story. This biography was written in chronological order by his son. It probably could have benefited from another format. When the author begins talking about the great-grandparents, it's purely derived from letters and distant documentation - not meaningful relationships, so it comes across as clinical and dry. When we finally get to the Herriot side of things, it's titillating but there's a lot withheld. Wight's significant encounter with depression is talked about but I feel like his son was trying to protect his father, so he never is at liberty to actually disclose those tough details. And there's shockingly little about Wight's wife - almost as if she declined to be involved. The ending is tough - do I really want to know what happened to my dear friends? Wight dying painfully of cancer, Donald intentionally overdosing, and Brian dying of disease. Painful, and I almost wish I didn't know just so that I could make believe Herriot's snapshot in time was eternal."}, {"userName": "Brett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5231835-brett", "userReview": "This book was a very interesting insight into the beloved author and \"World's most famous vet\". It seems Herriot was every bit as likable in reality as he seems to be in his famous semi-autobiographical books. Herriot's son, Jim Wight tells us proudly of Herriot's successes and unflinchingly of his struggles, which given his very private nature were often completely internalized. As a side bar it is also delightful to have some knowledge of the men on whom Tristan and Sigfried Farnon are based and indeed it sounds like their portrayal in print is mostly spot-on.Right up-front, Wight tells us that he was reluctant to pen a biography about his famous father because he doesn't really consider himself a writer. While it is true that he writes in a different style than his dad, his biography is accessible and interesting to read. For me, he really hits his stride about thirty pages in. In a couple of places, Wight seems to inadvertently fall into the trap of recounting stories we've already heard told so masterfully in Herriot's canon. I feel these time are unfortunate because they don't play to Wight's strengths as an author. And a couple of times, Mr. Wight comes off a tad defensive in tone over some details that I would suppose the misunderstanding of which has been a source of irritation. But these are very minor flaws, and I am grateful that he has shared with us his unique perspective on the life of his father.I believe Mr. Wight provides a wonderfully succinct and insightful epitaph to his father's career as an author on Page 238:[Herriot:] felt compelled to describe the old Yorkshire he had grown to love -- a way of life that was fast disappearing -- and he wanted to preserve it for others to enjoy.And thank god he did!Herriot was always a little bemused by the interest that we Americans showed in his stories about his far-away rustic agricultural community. I must admit I'm bemused by his bemusement! But he supposes at one point the drive behind our attraction to his beloved Yorkshire. He says, in essence that he supposes we are drawn by the quiet, slow-paced, old fashioned ways that contrast so sharply with the face-paced, industrialized lifestyle which most Americans live. It is an accurate supposition, I think. What a remarkable man. What remarkable stories. What a remarkable legacy."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4478821-susan", "userReview": "You think you know James Herriot by reading All Creatures Great and Small and all the other books he wrote, but, you haven't really known him until you see him through his son's eyes. Jim Wight has written a marvelous memoir of his dad. If one can have said of himself that he refused to let fame go to his head, that his family was the most important thing he had, and that his love for his work showed in every word he wrote, he lived a good life. James Alfred Wight, James Herriot, lived a good life. He's left an excellent example of manhood for generations to follow."}, {"userName": "Luann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651844-luann", "userReview": "Jim Wight has written a moving tribute to his father, James Alfred Wight, known as James Herriot to millions of fans around the world. At times it felt too long and detailed, but then he would catch my interest again with a funny or interesting story that hadn't been shared in any of the James Herriot books. In places it was quite reminiscent of the autobiographies of Dick Francis and Roald Dahl who shared some similar experiences - especially during the war. In fact, Dick Francis is mentioned several times and is even in one of the pictures. He says: \u201cDick Francis, author of many best-selling books about the world of horse racing, was one of the most famous people Alf got to know well and he was probably one of his favourites \u2013 a modest and charming man with whom he kept in touch throughout their almost parallel climb up the ladder of fame.\u201dI particularly enjoyed the personal memories shared by Wight about his father and others well-known from the books. He quoted from diaries and letters written by his father and even included a few love letters Alf wrote to his wife. There are also 16 pages of family photos.It was very interesting to find out what bits were real in the books and what had been changed. Mostly only the names of the people and the settings were changed. The stories James Herriot told in his books were all based on actual events. The last paragraph in the book says: \"James Herriot, the unassuming veterinary surgeon who enthralled millions, was no fictional character. There was a man I knew, who possessed all the virtues of the famous veterinarian - and more. A totally honest man whose fine sense of humour and air of goodwill towards others ensured that he was respected by all who knew him. A man on whom, after his death, a Yorkshire farmer delivered his final verdict: 'Aye, he were a right decent feller.' That man was James Alfred Wight.\"If you are a James Herriot fan, I highly recommend this book.

Although I was mortified when I first learned that 'James Herriot' was not the real name of the author who had since childhood enthralled me with beautifully written stories of the strong bonds between the human and animal worlds, I realize now that this was a selfish attitude--I did not want 'James Herriot' to protect himself and his friends from the inevitable media coverage that resulted from his multi-million book sales, I wanted his real name so that he would in fact be the man I read about. I realize now that his rejection of the public approach chosen by many authors only shows that he was a far more real person, and that his stories came just as much from his memories as they did from his heart. Jim Wight's biography is not truly surprising--I would have worried, had it been. We KNOW James Herriot from his books; this just fleshes out the story a bit, and in that Jim Wight succeeds admirably. From the irrepressible antics of 'Siegfried' and 'Tristan' to his own unique mind, James Herriot's stories thrilled us, and Jim Wight brings that man into the realm of hard truth.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1774879-april", "userReview": "I grew up reading and rereading James Herriot's books.

One is Sebastian Barry and the other is James Herriot. I devoured everything JH wrote in my younger years, so when we planned our four week return to England, I just had to visit his house/surgery in adorable Thirsk. It was such a moving experience for me. I was one of the Americans who loved his stories about animals and people with a passion. I laughed and cried my way through the books by this beloved writer. It's only fitting his son should tell the story of his Dad. His admiration and love soak the pages. There are some surprises in this book; they made me appreciate and love (JH) even more. Now I must read his books again. Yorkshire was just as gorgeous as he said it was. I highly recommend The World of James Herriot for anyone in the area. It's an interesting time capsule of the 1940-50s if you're a fan or not. IF you're a fan, it's an absolute must!

James Herriot has to be one of the most beloved authors in history, and the delightful thing about this book is that it shows the person behind the books was just as good as the books!Alf Wight as he is described in this book was a kind, funny, hard-working man who stayed humble even when he (finally) became very successful. He loved his work, he loved his family, and he loved writing. According to his son, the stories were all either true, or else heavily based on true stories with just a few details changed. James Wight writes like his father! That was really surprising. Not exactly like, of course, but enough like. He has the same open, inviting, amused tone. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s written anything else or not, but I\u2019m going to find out!One last thing. I read this book at the same time I was reading Prairie Fires, the biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Laura Ingalls Wilder came off as boring and slightly annoying, while Alf Wight came off even more interesting than I would have expected \u2014 and a decent human being as well! (Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s daughter Rose, by the way, is even worse than her mother, a manipulative egomaniac with really bad judgment.) I used to want to go visit all the Laura Ingalls Wilder historic sites, but that urge has kind of dissipated after reading the book, while my previously non-existent desire to visit James Herriot\u2019s Yorkshire is now burning strong. Goes to show how powerful a good book can be!"}, {"userName": "Bob Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson", "userReview": "So the popular books by James Herriot, novels which told the story of a country veterinarian charting a course through the changing times of the modern world with humor and heart-felt passion, were in fact written by a man named James Alfred Wight. The exact nature of them had been questioned in the past: were they fully fictional beyond the grain of truth given by Herriot\u2019s veterinary background, or did each story have authenticity of its own? This book, by Alf\u2019s son, Jim Wight, attempts to dispel most of the mystery created by these pseudonymous books. The first chapter of Herriot\u2019s first book (I will use Herriot for the subject in his literary capacity, Alf for the personal, and Wight for the biographer, Alf\u2019s son), depicting an absolute ordeal of a calving gone wrong, gripped my instantly when I first read All Creatures Great and Small; I was glad to learn that nearly every story in these books was an actual events in Alf\u2019s life, though rearranged for best narrative effect.This peeling back of the curtain, especially from such an intimately privileged position (Wight was not just Alf\u2019s son but also worked in the same veterinary practice as his father), reveals some details that, even if one took the Herriot books at face value, would surprise a reader. Alf\u2019s depression, and his spat with his partner (and inspiration for Siegfried) over his portrayal in the books, were fascinating glimpses behind the scenes. Wight writes about this with care and taste, not revealing details just to be salacious or to sell more copies, but to make the portrait of his father whole. The use of archived material from his father\u2019s life (Alf was a prolific letter writer) helps to make the narrative come alive, and the photo spread is particularly nice. Wight writes competently, though not with as much flair as his father; he shares some Herriot\u2019s knack at inspiring emotion. Some readers of Herriot\u2019s novels may not appreciate a book that tells about how principal characters from those books met their deaths in the real world, but for me the principe of approaching death in a direct way is a key feature of the James Herriot experience. If you love those books, read this one. If you get bored with childhood stories, skip around until you first meet a character you particularly enjoyed in Herriot\u2019s books, whether it was a human or a dog. You\u2019ll gain a new appreciation for the world behind those books, the stories told within, and even some new ones that weren\u2019t ever written but just passed down though"}, {"userName": "Linore", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809961-linore", "userReview": "For the James Herriot fan, this book is as good as it gets next to having another Herriot book. Written by the son of James Herriot, Jim Wight is not the writer his father was, but the stories in the book that run along the same vein are entertaining and informing; however, the book is a biography of James Herriot, not a memoir of the veterinary life; the few stories included are fun, but incidental.I recommend reading at least one of the wonderful books by Herriot before reading this. Yes, you've read the Herriot books already--I know, I have too, numerous times. Read one again. It will make this book all the more poignant and meaningful to be closer to the characters when you encounter them in their \"real lives\" here. (I re-read EVERY LIVING THING.)As a writer, I found highly fascinating the account of Herriot's literary rise to success. Much is included here, from how book titles were settled upon, to the names of editors and decisions all along the way that spurred the country vet to world-wide fame. We get an excellent picture of how it all happened, the dips and high points, and how Herriot handled it all. My respect for him has only grown after reading about the \"real man,\" and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to join the thousands of fans who flocked to Yorkshire to meet the author before his time was up. Small detractions exist: There are moments when one feels the writer was padding the text to make it longer (much is made of the fact that American readers seem to want longer, fatter books than Brits, for instance.) And oddly missing is a look at the real Helen (Joan Wight), or Herriot's children, including, even, the author. You don't finish the book feeling that you know him, which is not all that surprising since communicating feelings for this family comes across as laborious, or stilted. Perhaps it's just the way of the British, but there is an odd lack of warmth. Not a single picture of Joan before her marriage is included, and not one close up of Rosie as an adult. Nevertheless, a very good picture of James Herriot, the real man, emerges. And that's the real point of the book."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9617891-carolyn", "userReview": "A well-written, loving portrait of an extraordinarily gifted writer and an even more gifted veterinarian by James Herriot's son. Although most readers probably feel they know James Alfred \"Alf\" Wight by reading the stories by his alter ego, James Herriot, this biography offers a more complete picture of a sensitive, complex man. Wight's various health problems including a bout with depression lasting a couple of years are covered as well as his abbreviated career in the RAF during World War II. The author discusses Alf's relationships with his fellow vets Donald Sinclair (Siegfried Farnon) and Brian Sinclair (Tristan) in some detail, including a time during which Donald threatened to sue Alf because he was not happy with his portrayal in the movie All Creatures Great and Small. Alf was devastated to have hurt his friend, and from then on, he toned down the mercurial character of Siegfried in his books, although Donald was truly an eccentric. The author also describes his father's courtship of his mother, his father's canine companions throughout the years, and how and why he came up with the name James Herriot as a pseudonym.The humble nature of Alf led him to frequently say that he was 99% a veterinary surgeon and 1% an author, although it was his books and world-wide fame that brought him financial security. I have loved all of the James Herriot books, because of his obvious deep affection for animals and their human owners and because of the love he had for the countryside in which he lived and worked.

He took the pseudonym from a soccer player (who played on a team he liked) as he wanted to stay as anonymous as possible. In the book, I learned of his childhood, how hard his parents worked to assure that their only child had a good education, how he chose to be a vet, his schooling, how he got started in the practice that he stayed with for the rest of his life, his family, and how he wrote his books, and how they ended up being published. I also learned more about the area where he lived, the people and the customs there, and the changing world of being a vet in England in the 1950s and 60s.The book really did an excellent job of portraying the writer. Herriot/Wight worked extremely hard. He was gifted with a portable typewriter and late at night he used to pound out his stories.

He said that he never properly told his father how much he meant to him, and it seems like this book was made to make up for that. While it was sad to see the darker sides of these beloved 'characters,' I thought it was also important to realize James Herriot was actually a real person, a veterinarian with struggles, not some idealized veterinarian that all vet students seem to want to be. I do love returning to his books, to cheer me up and help me stay motivated in my own journey to becoming a veterinarian, but it was actually (maybe morbidly?) comforting to know 'James Herriot' had his own problems in life and his own journey wasn't as whimsical and magical as his books sometimes make it seem.

I was first introduced to \"James Herriott\" back in high school in the 70s, when \"All Creatures Great and Small\" was published in the U.S. I read the first two while in high school, then continued on with the series into college, and even read the fifth book, \"Every Living Thing\" after I got married. I've read \"All Creatures\" many times since, and the others a couple of times. Herriott and the occupants of Skeldale House have become like old friends, so it was interesting to read the true story behind the books. Jim Wight obviously had a very close relationship with his father, Alf Wight, the \"real\" James Herriott. I also had a good relationship with my father. We both loved to read, but had very few authors that we both enjoyed. One of those was \"James Herriott.\" My father grew up on a farm in mid-Michigan during the 20s and 30s, and so he could relate to the tales of the farms in the Yorkshire Dales. I can remember also watching the TV series as a family here in the U.S., through PBS and the CBC station out of Windsor, Ontario. Like Jim Wight, I lost my father in the last 90s (1998), but I'm sure he would have enjoyed reading this book about some of his favorite characters."}], "description": "With full access to his father's papers, correspondence, manuscripts, and photos, Wight has created a fitting and affectionate tribute to the well-loved vet and author of \"All Creatures Great and Small\". of photos.", "title": "The Real James Herriot: A Memoir of My Father", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38737.The_Real_James_Herriot", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386924549l/38737.jpg", "reviews": 166, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8152594.Jim_Wight", "name": "Jim Wight"}], "type": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Animals", "Biography Memoir"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38737.The_Real_James_Herriot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1054283.The_Real_James_Herriot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11532419-the-real-james-herriot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122780.James_Herriot_s_Animal_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9755611-herriot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1806930.Seven_Yorkshire_tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38738.The_Best_of_James_Herriot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450862.James_Herriot_s_Yorkshire_Revisited", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
