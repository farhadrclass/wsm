This book was so full of stereotypes, it was awful. I mean, the guy was, of course, handsome, attractive, great with kids, a good craftsman, and surprise - surprise, he even could play the piano! The woman was beautiful, sensitive, a great mum, a talented cook, bla bla bla... And Sparks doesn't even make the effort to change the setting. Not once! It's always near or in Wilmington, North Carolina. *yawn*It had its rare nice moments, therefore it's 2 stars. But what really sucks is that Sparks seems to have a very soft spot for soldiers since 9/11. So, talking of boring clich\u00e9s, the protagonist was a brave soldier fighting for his country in Iraq. *doubleyawn* I will never understand the American idealism about their soldiers. (And please, any people reading this, don't feel obliged to lecture me on that...) So, my conclusion, I will never ever read a Sparks again. The book before that was already a disappointment, but I thought I should give him another chance. Huge mistake, one I certainly won't repeat."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "''I'm not sure what I should put for an address. Like I said, I just got to town and I'm staying at the Holiday Motor Court. I could also use my mom's mailing address in Colorado. Which would you prefer?''''Colorado?''''Yeah, I know. Kind of far from here.''''What brought you to Hampton?''You, he thought. I came to find you. Nicholas Sparks has his reputation of writing the most popular and some quite beautiful/original love stories. Of course, The Lucky One was no exception. There were some elements I was annoyed about because they seemed too similar to his other books but, in general, it was a very nice read. For example, Beth\u2019s little 10 years old boy, Ben, reminded me A LOT of the other nice little boy in The Last Song (and I'm really not talking about in the movie but in the book) which, if you haven\u2019t read it, is a wonderful book. Also, the marines, army. \u00ab---- Dear John! At least, Thibault doesn\u2019t have the same personality as John so it\u2019s wasn\u2019t like I saw him instead of Thibault while reading. The pacing is very slow. Beth and Thibault are actually meeting each other after about 65 pages only, but the fact is that those pages were kind of long. There were many descriptions and psychological thinking when I wanted more dialogs and well\u2026 romance. Although, as we all know, Nicholas Sparks likes to write about the characters background and really want to make us connect in a way to them so, yeah, many descriptions. At first, it bored me but, after those 65 pages, it all goes well and the reading begins to feel nice and enjoyable.Beth is a good girl, someone I actually related to because she didn't date many guys or slept with many either. She was married to a man that she divorced off because, let\u2019s face it, he was not the good, stable kind of man, especially as a husband and dad because they did have a kid together. I\u2019ll say it and it\u2019s true, he\u2019s a pervert. The type of pervert that takes pictures of naked woman whenever he gets the chance to, when he is in reality a police officer! He\u2019s one of those persons that make you think, what is wrong with the world and how could some adult do that?! There is no need for me to say it obviously, but I hate that guy (named Clayton.)Thibault is sweet! And funny, easygoing, calm. The perfect man. The problem is\u2026he\u2019s just too nice. He is perfect but perfect doesn\u2019t exist in reality (for me) and I couldn\u2019t believe in him as much as I wanted to. He was likeable, yes, and a great character, yes, but this contemporary was just so\u2026unrealitic to me. Like, how could this possibly happen? How could someone, in the army, find a picture with a woman which becames his lucky charm and he decides to find (and will find) that woman in question. Plus, that the woman in question is single... It could, maybe, but I can't/don't believe it. I enjoyed reading it though and will keep reading other books by Nicholas Sparks because they\u2019re cute and bring different emotions out of me. Though it is not my favourite (Dear John is for now.)The romance is wonderful, as always. I would recommend this book but, if you have the choice between let\u2019s say\u2026The Last Song, Dear John and The Lucky One, in your place, I would personally choose Dear John then, The Last Song, and then The Lucky One.

Here we are given a story with a slightly darker edge and far more suspense then his usual soppy romance. Dog lovers and fans of The Guardian in particular will appreciate this engaging romantic suspense.One of the great (or not so great) things about Nicholas Sparks is that he doesn\u2019t always give you a happy ending and it was with this in mind that about half way through -just as the flood waters started to rise, secrets began boiling to the surface and I was completely invested in the characters and their budding love story, I began to get nervous for the ending. I mean you just knew something bad was going to happen, the clues were all there but the real question that kept me turning pages at a frantic pace was\u2026 to who? Each chapter here has been written from a different characters POV incorporating Elizabeth; a divorced mother with a young son who along with her no-nonsense Nana run a dog kennel in their small North Carolina town, Clayton her ex-husband and the town sheriff (bully) comes from a influential family yet harbours some nasty little secrets.Iraq war veteran, Logan Thibault is our hero and alongside his dog Zeus has walked (yes walked) from Colorado in an obsessive search for the unknown woman from a photograph he found during his three harrowing tours of duty in Iraq. He believes the picture to be his good luck charm and directly responsible for keeping him alive. In the end all the characters merge for a predictable yet ultimately nail-biting ending.The last chapter is very, very sneaky with Sparks keeping you on pins for pages before finally giving up the ending of which I had no clue. I fell in love with all of these well fleshed out characters, each coming with rich personalities and history including several flashbacks. The love story is well done and as I said before not too soppy. Thibault is a quiet, tortured hero and just so damn lovely with Beth perfect as his caring yet tough partner. The antagonist is creepy and also well written yet because of who he is you can\u2019t really wish him dead. Sheesh, I even fell for the boy and the dog. So yeah, I highly recommend another Nicholas Sparks novel."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261835-barb", "userReview": "A typical NS book, which seems like a gender-reversal of \"Message in a Bottle\".

Problem is, I have a real love/hate relationship with Nicholas Sparks. I'm a happy ending kind of a girl. I read books to escape the sadness, drama and sometimes craziness of life. I swear, every other time I read a Sparks book I swear I'll never read another. I don't like it when people find true love and then one of them dies or does something stupid so they're ripped apart forever (Dear John anyone?. How much did that blow?!!) Plus, that's not even that realistic because I know very few people that has happened to. Anyway, on with the review. . .SPOILER ALERT: I did a little research and determined that this one might be a safe one to try. I held my breath through a good portion of the book, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but at least it wasn't sad. As I was reading reviews I saw a lot of people complaining that this book was very stereotypical. Pretty, perfect people, a villian you love to hate. Well, that's probably true, but those are the books Sparks writes and most people like him for that. Like I said, some like to escape the reality of life a little. Overall, the book was a lot of fun. I had a hard time putting it down. I loved the love story of it.

Let me begin with some positives so I can avoid being hunted down and beaten by the army of Nicholas Sparks fans.Sparks is an excellent storyteller and a master of the romantic motif. He is good at taking a timeless story element and putting a new spin on it. He is also good with pacing, using smooth and lyrical words during romantic moments and quick and terse words in the more suspenseful moments.However...There are few things more irritating than a writer who feels the need to explain everything to his reader. Sparks does this often, in all of his books. It is as if Sparks caters to a demographic of readers who do not want to think and just want to enjoy a book. I get that, but there are also those (a lot) of us out there who don't enjoy a book if it doesn't make us think. I know what an IED is. And if I didn't know, I would find out. In one scene, a group of college kids make a joke about crabs. I chuckled, until I read the next line in which Sparks explains the joke! This, in my opinion, is inexcusable.In addition to that, I have a serious problem with some character point-of-view issues in this book. Sparks names each chapter after the character whose third-person point of view he follows in that chapter. This is an admirable and challenging method. But he breaks it several times throughout the book in order to (once again) explain something that the character may not know.Oh, and there should be a law that romance writers are no longer allowed to say that a character \"completes\" another character. Overdone, overused, and it lacks originality.There also were very few surprises in this book. I won't say too much, because some readers may be surprised by some things. But I was not.The book gets three stars, however, because I did enjoy the story. Also, Logan Thibault was a likeable character, not too romantic-lead cliche, and had some depth. Nana was funny, lovable, and provided some solid heart for all of the characters. The rest of the characters, however, seemed straight out of the book of character cliches (strong, determined female lead, controlling ex-husband, conflicted child divorce victim).It may be a while before I read another Nicholas Sparks book. Maybe one day when I just want to read a good story with predictable characters, no surprises, and that makes me say, \"Gee, that was nice\" but probably won't stick with me long after I've finished it."}, {"userName": "Ivy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2307899-ivy", "userReview": "This wasn't one of my absolute favorites--just okay. I have read several Nicholas Sparks novels and I put this one in the category of \"True Believer\" and its sequel, \"At First Sight\".By now the author pretty much has a formula which he follows in most of his books: always set it his home state of North Carolina, there is always a storm where the plot twists and/or reaches its climax, someone usually dies, and the couples always fall in love and end up in bed--usually, boring, uninteresting sex ensues. This 14th novel is no different.Logan Thibault is an ex-marine in search of a woman whose photo he's been carrying for the past five years. He found it in the sand in Iraq and ever since he has carried it, he has felt lucky. It has helped him win big at poker games, and kept him alive in situations that, by all accounts, should have ended his life. His friend, Victor tells him he has a debt to pay to the woman in the photo as it has proved to be a lucky charm. When tragedy strikes, Logan follows his friend's advice and sets out on foot, with his dog, Zeus, from Colorado to North Carolina, stopping along the way to seek information about E.--the only letter of the woman's name found on the back of the photo.Upon entering Hampton County, Logan has a run in with the local sherrif who doesn't like the looks of him or of his German shepard. This sherrif later on becomes a big player in this story as he interferes in Thibault's life and plans. Here is where the action begins. Of course, Thibault finds the woman in the photograph and what usually happens in Sparks novels happens, but the story lacked the passion found in \"The Notebook\" and \"Nights in Rodanthe\". I don't feel like Sparks ever really peels back enough of the layers that make up these characters. I never get to know them as well as I should. A lot of his stories are just on the surface--and once in a while he ends up with a winner like the two previously mentioned books. For the most part though, his books are airport novels--an appropriate read to pass the time but it doesn't stay with you. I have found that to be the biggest disappointment with most of his books. NONE of them are keepers. Here is another one for the donation pile."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1110686-amanda", "userReview": "Whenever I go to read a Nicholas Sparks book my first (and usually only) question to anyone who has read it is \"Am I going to cry?\" I ask this because in many of Spark's novels the main character dies in the end often in a tragic way. Since, I now want fun books with happy endings, it breaks my heart when this happens. However, Sparks has such a rich and inviting writing style that even with these reoccurring tragic endings, I can't help but fall in love with any and all of his books. The characters come alive and the love stories are magical, yet real at time. \"The Lucky One\" is no different. It is a beautiful story with strong, animated characters. Logan Thibault is one of my favorite characters in literature. He is Veteran of the U.S. Marines and a quiet, confident man who is looking for his destiny. He finds it in Elizabeth, a single mom living in her hometown of Hampton, NC. Their story is beautiful and a delight to read. Once I started \"The Lucky One\" I did not want to put it down. The story is compelling and sweet. Sparks is at his best when writing this novel. And to answer the question of whether I cried...I did not. At least, there were no sad tears. But it is a story that stays with you, in a good way.I give \"The Lucky One\" five out of five stars.

Nicholas Sparks is a #1 New York Times best-selling author with over fifty million copies of his books in print worldwide and translated into over forty languages. Other titles include: The Rescue, A Bend in the Road, The Guardian, The Wedding, True Believer, At First Sight, Dear John, The Choice, and Three Weeks With My Brother. Nicholas Sparks has also had four of his novels adapted into major motion pictures including: Message in a Bottle, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe. Nicholas Sparks resides in North Carolina with his wife and family.While in his third tour of duty in Iraq, U.S. Marine Logan Thibault happens upon a half-buried photograph of a beautiful young woman, simply known as E. After no one has claimed it, Logan finds himself drawn to it and carrying it in his pocket wherever he goes. More importantly, he discovers it brings him luck. His friend, Victor, seems to think it was his fate to find it and calls it his lucky charm. Once he is back home in Colorado, Logan can\u2019t seem to get the woman out of his mind. Understanding just how crazy it was, he sets forth on foot from Colorado to North Carolina in search of what very well may be his destiny. He didn\u2019t have any illusions of what might await him, but he sure wasn\u2019t expecting the instant attraction to Elizabeth, the sincere fondness for her Nana, the friction with her ex, Clayton, or to fall immediately in love with her ten-year-old son, Ben. Pursuing the path he chose and attraction for Beth, they ignite a passionate affair of the heart, never knowing that the secret of how he came about the photo could destroy everything he had waited his entire life to find.True to form, and with a power-house ending, it\u2019s no secret why Nicholas Sparks has captivated readers worldwide for some time now. How rare it is to find a man who can craft a story in this genre with so much insight in the human condition, affairs of the heart, the importance of family- and to do it in a manner that always seems new and unique. I find that to be the best part of this author, that when he has you crying, laughing, or ready to spit nails, he has the power to make you believe that anything is possible- that fate and destiny are not myths, after all. (Insert sigh here), Another great read from a true gem in this genre.The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, is an engaging, charming, and witty tale, determined to restore your faith in happily ever after again.Kelly MoranAuthor and Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Anna Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13518500-anna-marie", "userReview": "I read it because I can't watch a movie without reading the book, first. What I want to know is, HOW this man got so popular? He can't write for crap. Utterly unbelievable. First of all, we have Elizabeth, who is a single mom who is a teacher (think lesson plans, grading papers, gone all day, etc) who takes her son to chess/baseball/violin, who also cares for her grandmother (who had a stroke), AND co-runs a kennel/obedience school out of her home AND is carting her son back and fort to visitation... and on top of ALL of that, cans her own home-grown salsa. In. What. Time? Let's be a little realistic, shall we? Yet every time we see her in the book, she's just hanging out on the porch. Yeah. Right.Then there's Logan, who only exists in someone's imagination. A man who is that perfect does not live. He's a pianist. A violinist. Has a degree in Anthropology. Fixes cars. Trains animals. Is a war hero. Survived ELEVEN bombings in Iraq. Plays chess, makes kites out of garbage bags and straws like MacGuyver, is a prolific reader, WALKED from Colorado to North Carolina, has a bottomless wallet of cash only... it's just crazy.Then there's fun little stupid things like when Nicholas Sparks has Elizabeth planting thousands of tulips and daffodils every spring, so they can come up after the azaleas. Um... tulips and daffodils are PERENNIALS... they come up every year, you don't have to re-plant, Nick... and tulips are the FIRST things that come up, along with crocus and daffodils. The man drives me crazy.And I'm not even sure I want to see the movie. The book says Logan got a degree in anthropology, has done three tours of duty as a Marine in Iraq, has 'wild' hair and a vagabond appearance and \"doesn't look like a college student\"... and they cast Zac Ephron?

I've only read a few of his books, but already I'm seeing a pattern and I found myself getting bored and saying, \"Awe, come on,\" throughout. The plot was too predictable, the characters were too generic, and I guess I just wasn't in to the whole storyline. The creepy cop ex-husband didn't help my desire to continue reading, either. Trite. That's how I'd describe it. Trite and that it left me feeling let-down. That being said, I read the book in a day....I kept wanting to be done with it and get it over with. While it was a rather harmless, quick-read romance, (which I like at times), I don't think I'll read another of Sparks' books. Too bad. I had liked previous books by him. He's gotta do better than this, though.Oh, and it kind of bugs me that he puts a full-blown photo of himself on the back cover of the book. What's that all about?

I was certain it would be a female author; this book has all the hallmarks of girly, escapist fiction. But no, HIS name is Nicholas Sparks......hmmmmm, never heard of him. Then, I saw the list: The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe, A Walk to Remember.....good grief, how did I miss this when I made my purchase? It should be noted that while I enjoy a good romance as much as the next girl, I try VERY hard to avoid cheese. (Except Twilight. I'll admit it; I read that series.) In fact, I was once forced by my little sister to watch the movie, The Notebook, and I have never laughed so hard in my life. Or felt so ashamed. But, I digress...Not only is the story cheesy, but Mr. Sparks seems to follow a cookie cutter pattern for his books, as well. Admittedly, I haven't read any of his other books, but enough of them have been made into movies that I've picked up the general gist. Let me see if I can predict his next book, shall we??? Emotionally unavailable, slightly damaged male figure meets super sweet heroine that's probably had a few hard knocks (divorce, a death, single motherhood, whatever) in life and together they overcome some epic drama that leads them to the meaning of love. Sometimes it ends on a happily-ever-after note; sometimes one of them dies. Vomit. To all of you who enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, I'm sorry. Really."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/387934-karen", "userReview": "The famous Nicholas Sparks creates yet another amazing tale of lovers.Driven by luck and determination, Logan Thibult is in a search for a woman in a photograph that he found serving war in iraq. The photograph saved his life numerous times and with little persuasion by his friend Victor, he set on a journey to find the woman and repay the debt he felt he owed.Elizabeth, a woman who spent the rest of her life after highschool struggling through life as a single mother, is overwhelmed with her life. She's lonely because her ex-husband threatens all of her suitors and she feels as if she should give up on love once and for all.Logan then comes into her life and she experiences for the first time many things that she never had the chance to do. Logan faces the trouble of trying to tell her the reason why he's truly there and in the meantime falls in love with her.I recommend this book to individuals who enjoy romance...basically any Nicholas Sparks fan. The book went by fast for me, especially with the help of its descriptive words and mood that the text created."}, {"userName": "Rodaw", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7433497-rodaw", "userReview": "V\u0161echny knihy od pana Sparkse m\u00e1m prost\u011b stra\u0161n\u011b r\u00e1da :-) A u Talismanu to bylo tak\u00e9 tak.

This book grabbed me from the first chapter, clearly written and intriguing characters and, even though I had a pretty good idea of where the plot was going and didn't really have any surprises, I still really enjoyed the story and how it was told.Logan Thiebault is a great character and I really wanted him to find his way and his HEA. Without too much detail, his experiences as a marine and how that affected his life were well-told and made him an easier character to understand, even the idea that he didn't really quite understand himself was easy to believe. His dog Zeus was a nice addition to his story, the fact that the dog was truly his best friend. I'm glad I took the time to read this one."}, {"userName": "CC", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892060-cc", "userReview": "The cheese factor is pretty high for this one, people. When Logan Thibault, a Marine serving in Iraq, finds a picture of a pretty woman in the sand, his friend Vincent considers it to be Thibault's good luck charm. Thibault doesn't, but whatever. Once out of the Marines, Thibault tracks down Elizabeth -- the woman in the photo -- by walking -- yes, walking -- from his Colorado home to a small North Carolina town. There, he finds out she's a single mother. And her ex-husband, a deputy, is an asshole. But lo, Elizabeth runs a kennel on the side, and Thibault has an awesome German Shepherd. Clearly it was meant to be. Parts of the book were illogical... It's mentioned that Thibault attended Colorado University in Boulder. After graduation, he joined the military -- knowing he'd be sent to Iraq. Why? I haven't a clue. Apparently, neither does Sparks. Ahem... CU Boulder is a party school for rich kids. Tuition runs thirty grand a year. NONE of those kids sign up for military service upon graduation. At a state college -- maybe, if you were concerned you couldn't find a job. A community college -- sure, to give yourself a better life. But spending 120 grand on an education and then enlisting (for no reason) to possibly get killed in Iraq? No effing way.So there's that. In addition, the writing was just plain sloppy. Characters randomly appeared or disappeared for convenience sake -- Nana; or were brought in for huge chapters for exposition sake -- Melody, anyone? -- and then never mentioned again. Cliches and caricatures reigned. Clayton, Elizabeth's ex was an overwrought, unbelievable villian. But Thibault and Elizabeth were even worse...They're pretty. That's all. Elizabeth is a hot blonde -- which was mentioned 150 times lest anyone forget. And Thibault is six feet tall, blue eyes, strong, sexy, smart, pure-minded, a gifted musician, and endlessly patient with Elizabeth's ten year-old child, to whom he is an instant father figure. Sure he is. They had no points of view. No goals. They're pretty, so they must belong together. Oh, gawd. And the ending? COP OUT. At least be man enough as an author to have your characters HAVE to make that kind of hard choice. No, instead, \"it\" happens off the page, and by accident. The characters are wusses. I could kick both of their asses. But it's okay, because, hey, everyone's pretty.There was a tiny light of good dialogue for maybe ten pages between Thibault and Elizabeth. I longed for more of that. Also, the dog, Zeus, was awesome. In fact, I considered giving it another star just because of the dog. Essentially, there's no CARE here. There's no skill. It's all patched together without motivations or authenticity. It's like the author himself doesn't live in the real world. Does he know people like this? It's not possible.

Me gust\u00f3. Sip. No shame.Logan, encuentra esa fotograf\u00eda en la arena y su suerte cambia completamente. Aunque no est\u00e1 seguro de lo que significa, la conserva con \u00e9l durante cinco a\u00f1os. Cuando se encuentra m\u00e1s perdido de lo que hubiera deseado, decide ir en su busca. En parte le debe su vida, y en parte siente que algo debe hacerse.Esta parte es MUY extra\u00f1a. MUY MUY MUY. Muy raro, muy perturbador, muy escalofriante. Un tipo que no conoces de nada, que duerma con tu foto bajo la almohada, que decida buscarte \ncaminando\n desde Colorado a Hampton sin ninguna raz\u00f3n aparente da que pensar sobre la clase de tipo que es.Y el gran conflicto es ese. Lo dice la sinopsis, pero es gracioso. Keith, el ex marido de Elizabeth, tambi\u00e9n sabe que eso es raro. Completamente extra\u00f1o y digno de alg\u00fan soci\u00f3pata. Es como si se hubiera burlado de la incoherencia de su propia trama. Que Sparks se hubiera dado cuenta de lo absurdo que suena que alguien en su juicio te busque con tanto ah\u00ednco. Sin conocerte. Solo por una foto que encontr\u00f3 en la arena. Tiene su gracia el asunto.A\u00fan as\u00ed, me gust\u00f3. Lo le\u00ed bien, me enganch\u00f3, no me dej\u00f3 tirada en un charco de babas por amor a estos dos, pero mantuvo mi atenci\u00f3n. Cosa que no cre\u00ed posible. La otra pega es lo perfectos que son. Super perfectos. Super bellos. Super habilidosos. Como si no concibiera en el mundo un personaje que no tuviera m\u00e1s virtudes que defectos. Como si Elizabeth no pudiera permitirse envejecer. Porque como dice, parece que con la edad estaba m\u00e1s bonita que las universitarias con las que Keith sal\u00eda. Pero ser\u00eda una est\u00fapida si pensara que es algo exclusivo de este autor, porque todo el mundo suele caer en los estereotipos. Pero qu\u00e9 se yo. Esperaba m\u00e1s.Lo que s\u00ed, sent\u00ed que Logan era de piedra. A\u00fan con sus pensamientos, recuerdos y lo que fuera, era bastante imperturbable.

And OMG this was so awesome!! Like I totally loved it. To be honest I first thought that I would put it down after a few chapters; but then everything started to, you know, mix together so perfectly, that I couldn't help but loved it. The writing style was nice and simple, with no use of tricky words or hard-understanding stuff. Specially loved those little phrases Nana used with Elizabeth all the time. And such a curious fact that Nana named all the time Keith as the \"late husband\", like a premonition of what was about to happen later.The plot was nice developed and entretaining; all points of view highly interesting. Though I woud have loved one from Zeus point view :)The ending was shoking. Cause I totally did not expect that, but however, was good according to the story. And I have to admit that I had a little heart attack in the final scene (when Beth visits the cementery), cause for a moment, I thought that Logan had died and no. That could not happen. He is just so perfect and bae and gosh so hot.Also love the quoting and still have to see the movie (if someone has already seen it, can you tell me if it is a good one?).\u201cIn the blink of an eye, something happens by chance - when you least expect it - sets you on a course that you never planned, into a future you never imagined.\u201d"}], "description": "When U.S. Marine Logan Thibault finds a photograph of a smiling young woman half-buried in the dirt during his third tour of duty in Iraq, his first instinct is to toss it aside.
