The series begins with a fire that kills 5 firefighters and the three books follow various families as they mourn, try to heal and survive these losses.After All is the final book. I immediately connected with Susan, the director of the Hanover Falls homeless shelter and the widow of one of the firefighters who lost his life when the shelter was destroyed by fire.After All could be called the Book of Secrets Revealed. Susan begins to discover her husband's secrets and at the same time feels drawn to another firefighter.

Susan Marlowe is beginning to pick up the pieces of the life she knew that was destroyed in ashes just eighteen months ago, when her husband David and four other firefighters were killed in an accidental fire at Grove Street Shelter.She was the one responsible for running the homeless shelter despite her husband David's misgivings about wondering if the shelter was doing more harm than good to the cities residents. Yet when fights, and threats began to break out there, David felt that Susan was opening herself up for more trouble than it was worth and their marriage began to take a turn for the worse, with each of them spending more time at their jobs than at working on strengthening their marriage.Now that Susan has begun to rebuild the Grove Street Shelter in a building across from where the former one stood, she is once again making the headlines in the local paper, The Courier. Seems now that Bee Quinton, feels its her responsibility to seek the answers for two letters to the editor about the homeless shelter and its purpose in bringing out the worst criminals to the city. When Susan takes the bait in defense of the good the shelter offers families in need a place to stay over sleeping in their car, she does more harm than good in feeding Bee just what she needs to make the front page.Fortunately for Susan, not everyone believes the homeless shelter is a bad thing for the city when Chief Peter Brennan speaks out in her defense reminding the citizens of Susan's diligence in having fire alarms and smoke detectors installed. Now if only he can keep his mind on the tasks of running the local fire station instead of romantic thoughts about Susan. However Peter finds himself the source of competition between Susan and fire inspector Andrea Morley, a first in his life since his previous wife Lana left him when they couldn't have children.Just what type of closure will After All bid for its readers in this series conclusion? You'll have to pick up the book and find out. Even though this is the third and final book in the series, there is enough back story for the reader that this one can be read as a stand alone, but trust me, if this is the first book you've had the pleasure to read from Deborah, you'll definitely want to pick up the other two.I received After All by Deborah Raney compliments of Howard Books, a division of Simon and Schuster for my honest review and LOVED it! Just the perfect amount of suspense and romance to keep the reader entertained and turning pages til the end. If you love Christian Romance novels or have a spark for firefighters, then this is a MUST read for you! I rate this one a sizzling 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Erin Cataldi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi", "userReview": "In this past year or so I've become one of the most well-read christian romance readers in all of Indiana. Bragging rights? Anyhoo, I grabbed this book because based on the description (and it's genre) I figured it would be a quick read and I need to start zipping through my insanely large \"to read\" book-pile from Goodreads. It was as I guessed an insanely fast read, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The story follows Susan, the widow of a fallen fire fighter who struggles to deal with her loss, with her family (she has two adult sons), and her homeless shelter. Her husband and five other fire fighters died in a tragic fire the year before when her fledgling homeless shelter caught fire. Many people in the town thought good riddance of the homeless shelter and were aghast when she re-opened it in another location so soon after her husband's death. She faces opposition everywhere she goes, especially from Fire Chief Peter who harbors some blame at the homeless for starting the fire that killed five of his men, including Susan's husband, the year prior. Against his better judgement he starts to help out Susan and they begin to develop feelings for each other. Besides struggling to keep the shelter open, Susan must deal with the fact that her son informed her that her fallen husband had been cheating on her prior to his untimely death, and then she has to deal with the temptress herself as she tries to steal Peter away from her. Overall, this was a small quick plot that was easy to plow through. Not the most romantic or impactful, but a light breezy beach read that fills the time. Not great, not bad. But alright for a Christian romance. Disclaimer, this book is the third in a trilogy, although you would never know it by the way the story is set up. It stands easily on it's own, I was never once confused.I received this book free from Goodreads giveaways in return for my unbiased, honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: AFTER ALLAuthor: Deborah RaneyPublisher: Howard BooksMay 2012ISBN: 978-1416599951Genre: Contemporary romanceEighteen months after the tragic Grove Street Fire took the life of her husband, David, and four other heroic firefighters, Susan Marlowe thinks she\u2019s finally beginning to heal.But then she discovers that David carried a secret to his grave.A secret that changes everything she thought their marriage had been.For the sake of their sons, can Susan forgive the unforgivable?Andrea Morley lost her closest friend in the fire.

It is always neat to see how they have moved on in their lives.Susan Marlowe has gone forward in her life, nevertheless it is not easy. Loosing her husband and the love of her life, she realizes that while things were a bit different in her marriage with David, she never realized exactly how things were. David's death took a secret to his grave, but that secret was not staying buried with him. Their son Davy knew the truth and it is now destroying his life, as he cannot handle the truth that his father was not what he had thought he was. Susan is not sure how to help Davy, because he is not revealing all he knows until a fire in the woods behind their house brings things to a head. Pete Brennan, fire chief will never forget the fire that cost him so many lives of his fire fighters. He carries that burden with him, along with a failed marriage, he is not sure he will ever date again, much less fall in love. Imagine his surprise when suddenly he is trying to juggle two women in his life. Susan Marlowe the wife of one of his firefighters lost in the fire, and Andrea Morely the area fire inspector. Will he figure it out before he looses something important in his life. I loved the conclusion to the Hanover Falls Series. Deborah Raney truly tells a story that hooks you and keeps you reading to the end. A great story that deals with loss, hurts and betrayals, she handles the story line wonderfully.

I have been looking forward to its release since last summer when I interviewed Deborah Raney about Forever After, the second Hanover Falls book, and she also gave me a sneak peak into this final novel. After All primarily focuses on Susan Marlowe, the director of the homeless center that burned down, killing her firefighter husband and four of his coworkers as they battled the blaze. Fire Chief Peter Brennan is also a primary figure as he deals with the aftermath of the tragedy. Deborah Raney has crafted a wonderful story that pulsates with emotion - grief, betrayal, anger, and resentment - but she doesn't leave her characters defeated or overcome as hope, faith, forgiveness, and new love rise from the ashes. A hint of danger and suspense and a rather unexpected ending add further depth to this story. I was captivated by After All and read it in almost one sitting! While it can be read as a stand-alone, you will want to read the entire series to fully appreciate and understand the complete story. (As a side note, I particularly love how the titles flow into each other - Always Forever, Forever After, After All!)

Why haven't I heard of this series and this author before? I absolutely adored this book. I can't begin to express how much I thoroughly enjoyed this one.Raney crafted a world that sucked me in from the get-go and characters that I couldn't help but love. I haven't read the previous two in the series, but I have a feeling like I am going to have to go back and do so. Let's start with the characters. Yes, both Susan and David made some mistakes, but I couldn't help but like them. Their hearts were in the right place and I definitely loved watching them interact with each other.I've already mentioned I loved the writing, but I'm going to mention that again. I really enjoyed Raney's writing style. Her writing was beautiful, but didn't draw undue attention to itself. Instead, her writing simply took me on a journey where I could unwind and just be thoroughly entertained by the tale. I love Christian fiction and this is one that I'm going to be keeping on my shelf."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "In the conclusion to the Hanover Falls series, I found a story riddled with the human condition. A sweet and tender love story that must test the odds. And a cast of characters, I couldn\u2019t help but care for. It\u2019s like stepping into real life, with a divine purpose to entertain.I have to chuckle *just* a bit since a great deal of the scenes were centered around a meal of some sort with the characters; what is it about food and socialization? (wink) But it\u2019s one thing that gives the novel its charm, because it carries a rich undertone of real life, while giving the reader characters they can cheer for, situations that keep us worried and wondering how they will outsmart their problems.Having read all three books in the series in the order they were released, I have to say \u201cAfter All\u201d has been my favorite. It ties up some loose ends from books one and two, gives us snapshots of past characters lives and moves on with the third widow of the Hanover Falls Homeless shelter\u2019s fire.A quick read, but a fulfilling one, as it tangles and weaves life and family situations in Susan and Pete. Wonderful little subplots that keep the story focused.A great way to end a good series. Now, this reader wants to know\u2026what\u2019s next?This review is my honest opinion.

I have to say that Deborah lights firecrackers when she writes. Not only are there sparks of romance there is sparks of jealousy as well. Susan is working on putting the pieces of her life together after the death of her husband David. She is finally getting the Grove Street Shelter up and running, something that is near and dear to her heart. Some in Hanover are not happy about the shelter and the \"element\" that it brings. Then there is Andrea Morley, Susan knows there is something about her she just can't shake, like why was she at her husband's funeral and so upset. Susan finds herself dating, something she hasn't done in 25 years and she is enjoying it, she just never thought it would be Hanover Fall's Fire Chief.

Unfortunately due to the tragedy surrounding the fire at the last shelter the town of Hanover Falls is not as enthused about the shelter as she.While Susan deeply mourns her husband David she also mourns the last couple of years of their marriage where they seemed to have drifted apart. When she learns that her husband had been having an emotional affair she is devastated. She feels guilty and angry and in the midst of trying to care for her almost adult sons she knows she must lead by example and forgive. But can she?Fire chief Peter Brennan walks with a cloud around him. He is carrying the weight of his divorce, the fire tragedy, and his own self-doubt. When Susan walks back into his world he catches a glimpse of what could be. As he begins to notice her as more than just a friend healing begins to take place in his heart. He renews his connection with the \"man upstairs\" and begins to find purpose and meaning once again.It all sounds rosy until you throw in a troubled fire inspector who is yearning for the love she lost and isn't allowed to mourn. She was the other half of David's affair. She's searching for the love she had with him that she was never allowed to fully explore. On the prowl for a man she puts continual snags in Pete and Susan's budding relationship When a mysterious fire starts in Susan's backyard and a disturbed individual starts following her the plot does indeed thicken.This is the final installment in the Hanover Falls trilogy. I have not yet had the privilege of reading the first two books. I could tell right away I was coming into a series but Raney did a great job as an author of making sure I didn't get lost. This was a very easy and enjoyable read. With just enough depth to keep me thinking and enough intrigue to keep me turning pages into the night I very much enjoyed After All. Raney writes excellent character development and her characters are real relateable people. You'll find yourself understanding more of the troubled fire inspector as you learn about her past. You'll relate to grief Susan has she deals with a number of issues. You'll find Pete both likeable and human and you'll want to go find him and shake his hand.

Ever read a fictional story that seemed real like that? Well, hold on to your socks as this is one of those stories. It starts out with a small town firefighter group losing five of its own members in a single fire. We can all remember 09/11, so this isn\u2019t hard to imagine at all. During one of the last memorial services as the people are leaving, there is a figure looming in the distance. Why is that? Who is it?\tFrom that point on, we see how a widow continues to pour out her heart in a shelter for the homeless in the same small community. The community is welcoming the rebuilding of the shelter, but why is it being rebuilt? Well, I can\u2019t spoil it for you. In either case, the rebuilding isn\u2019t getting glowing reviews from some people and finding help or donations is turning out to be very difficult.\tThe main female character, Susan, is the woman who heads the shelter and is one of the widows from the fire. Her sons are grown, but one of them has had some trouble in the past and isn\u2019t exactly handling his future well either. The chief of the house has a broken marriage, and his walk with God is on rocky ground. What happens with them all? One character in the story is the first female fire inspector. She has something in her past that is directly making her future uncertain and maybe devious. Exactly what is she up to anyway? What I just shared is just the tip of the iceberg!\tThis is the third and final Hanover Falls Novel for Deborah Raney. It is a story woven together masterfully. There are many threads that run throughout the story and the ending just might not be what you were expecting. For me, this is the first novel I have read by this author, but it won\u2019t be the last. I love stories that can touch on reality and in the end leave the reader hopeful.

While not my favorite book of the series After All is a fitting conclusion to a series full of bittersweet moments.Susan Marlowe's life is dedicated to running the new Hanover Falls's homeless shelter so much so that unbeknownst to her her husband turned to another woman. Peter Brennan, chief at Station 2 is feeling the stress of his job more so than ever after the fire that took the lives of a handful of his finest firefighters. Both Susan and Peter are a bit wary of each other but come together in the face of even more problems involving the homeless shelter and its residents.With her trademark style of writing that pulls at your heartstrings Deborah Raney crafts a wonderful story of loss and love. Susan and Peter's growing feelings towards each other developed naturally and gradually that nothing felt forced or contrived. However Andrea Morley, the local fire inspector's story didn't quite mesh well for me. From what we were told about her past I would have the thought the story would have taken a completely different turn than what it did. I don't want to give anything away but I really think Bryn's story (Almost Forever) concluded wonderfully and very realistically. Throwing in the twist to the story with Andrea and Zeke in this book just didn't sit well with me because it felt forced, like everything had to end perfectly for all the \"good\" characters in the series.

With Susan's adult son back at home still dealing with the loss of his father, new information about her husband's activities, and clashes with the community, can Susan find a way to move forward?Susan doesn\u2019t seem like the cheerleader type. She didn\u2019t have the perfect marriage, she struggled as a parent, and she gets too focused on her work. Yet despite her tendency to see only the rosy side of people, her situation draws you in like few others could \u2013 because she seems real. As a reader, you can identify with her issues and want to know how she resolves them; you just might have the same things happening in your own home. With the added stress of the firefighters\u2019 jobs and the mystery man who keeps turning up, you\u2019ll be turning pages as fast as you can to race Susan to the end.I really liked the way that Raney didn\u2019t spill the plot all in the first chapter. Really great books have a hook, some information that the author withholds to keep you reading until the end; but Raney kept back more than the usual whodunit. Without even knowing exactly what the mystery was, she drew you into Susan\u2019s world, which at times looked incredibly bleak, but always gave you a shred of hope and a glimmer of what could be. After All is inspiring and encouraging with a sense of reality that is hard to find. I'll definitely be reading more Raney in the future.I received a free copy of After All from Glass Road Publications in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ibjoy1953 Hannabass", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5101390-ibjoy1953-hannabass", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOKI didn\u2019t read the first two books in this series, but I defiantly enjoyed this one. Susan Marlowe runs a homeless shelter, and after a horrible fire that takes the shelter, along with her husband and several other firefighters with it, she is left with the job of rebuilding another shelter for the homeless, along with building another life for herself, alone. It took 18 months to have the new shelter ready for more homeless, and the help of her husband\u2019s co-worker, Peter Brennan. Peter didn\u2019t really care for Susan because of her demands for the firefighters help, and at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but be drawn by her. And he also thought about the rumors he had heard around the firehouse about Susan\u2019s husband before he died in the horrible fire. Could they really be true? Could he Susan\u2019s husband have been cheating on her before his death?I think I need to go back and read the first two books in this series to enjoy the full story. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t heard about Deborah Raney before, but I will definitely be looking for her books in the future. In After All, Deborah creates characters that are sure to draw you into their story from the beginning. I love the secrets and suspense mingled with a little intriguing romance to help keep the pages turning.I highly recommend After all for a really good read. And I encourage you to look up the first two books in the Hanover Falls series and read them first. I love series, and there is nothing better than to have a full 3 book series to look forward to reading.A big Thank You to Glass Road Publicity Group for giving this book for me to read and review. I was not expected or required to provide a positive review. The opinions in this review are mine only."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Defoy", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613620-jennifer-defoy", "userReview": "I've not had the chance to read the first two books in the Hanover Falls series. And while I think that it would have given me a better understanding of the emotions that were associated with some of the parts of the story I don't feel like I had missed out from not reading them. The book was well written and it gave all the major background information so that I didn't feel lost in what was going on. I liked the main character Susan. She was a bit naive though. I'm not sure if her naivety comes from the fact that she was so busy with her own life that she didn't have a chance to see what was going on around her or if she was just a naive person. Because she did seem to have things together. 18 months after the death of her husband she's running a homeless shelter by herself. And despite the town's objections to the shelter she seems to be doing at least an ok job with it. I know if I lost my husband it seems like it would take more strength than I have to be almost solely responsible for the lives of so many people. But I also think that her ability to throw herself into the homeless shelter comes from needing something to keep herself occupied so that she's not dwelling on the loss of her husband. As in the few times that she is alone with nothing going on her mind does seem to wander to her husband. The story had quite a bit going on. There was a budding love story, some mystery, and tons of emotions. I didn't get a good sense of who most of the other characters really were, and I would have liked to have a bit more insight into Peter and even Susan's son Davie. But overall the story was good and it kept me hooked. I finished it in one day as I was just so drawn into everything that was going on."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754448-brenda", "userReview": "Deborah Raney is easily one of my favorite authors. Her stories are ones that I often think about for weeks after reading. She has a way of drawing me into a story, making me feel as if I personally know the characters, and that's just how I feel about the Hanover Falls series. Susan Marlowe is dealing with the pain of losing her husband in the Grove Street fire, but a secret that he was carrying comes to light, a secret that breaks her heart, and has her wondering if she really knew the man she was married to. How will she deal with the hurt?Even though this is the third book in a series, the story line still has the ability to provide a few twists and turns that kept me reading. There is still the mystery of who actually set the fire, as well as the emotional turmoil of losing loved ones, and trying to move on after such a tragedy. Susan is a commendable character. She is trying to keep the homeless shelter going, while dealing with the loss of her husband. When her son Davey not only drops out of college but also starts coming home drunk, she learns that he is carrying a painful secret, something that he knew about his father, her husband. \"After All\" is the third and final installment of the Hanover Falls Series, and while this book can be read as a stand alone work, the series is filled with such amazing characters that you really are going to want to read all three books. While I enjoyed the way the author wraps up this series, I really am going to miss my visits to Hanover Falls. I highly recommend this entire series!A complimentary copy of this book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Charity", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2824691-charity", "userReview": "I have long been a fan of Deborah Raney's books. She writes about subjects that other authors would shy away from and this makes her books one of my favorite reads! This novel is the last book in the Hanover Falls Series and was a perfect ending. It makes me wish there were other books to this series to show more of these peoples lives:)Susan is quite a strong woman and I found myself liking her, even when she would get on my nerves. I guess this is kind of how Peter Brennan felt, huh? I kind of picked up that Andrea Morley was not a nice lady and I wanted to slap Peter when he kept asking her out or thinking of her. I felt bad for Davy for all he was going through and his troubled life. Even though at times he was definitely wrong I kind of felt for him. There is mystery in this book along with some romance. There are several characters who show up from the previous books which made it all better for me. I enjoy when a series has previous characters and you see more into their life.Overall this is an excellent ending and wraps up some loose ends that you will have after reading the other books in this series. This deals with a delicate subject but is done in a good way. It opens up some ideas you might want to hold back your position of until after you are done with the book. Check out the reading group questions at the back of the book. Loved this and can't wait for the next series from Deborah!!I received a copy of this book for review purposes. I did not receive any monetary compensation.

The best part of Raney\u2019s writing may be that the characters are human. They have flaws and talents just like everyone else.

The families and friends were left behind must somehow pull through their loss and move forward, with God. They must look past the secrets that fill the small town and forgive each other and themselves.  This book is very well written and truly made me see the entire story unfolding in my head.

Maar toch vind ze stiekem Commandant Peter Brennan wel heel erg leuk. Maar dan vertelt haar zoon Davy, dat hij David met een andere vrouw heeft gezien. Dit boek was leuk om te lezen, de karakters zijn echt geweldig, vooral Commandan Peter Brannan. Ook vind ik het wel leuk dat je toch wat terug blikken had van het vorige boek, dus van Lucas en van Bryn. Wel had ik sommige dingen wel verwacht, zoals dat haar man ( die ongekomen is bij een brand) vreemd ging met Brandveiligheidinspecteur Andrea Morley. Verder vond ik het eerste en het tweede deel beter dan dit deel.
