I've picked my way through the so-called \"Classics\", got lost in Fantasy and Science-Fiction, been taken to other times by Historical Fiction, stayed up late to find out the answers in the latest Psychological Thriller, fallen in love with Romance, and rode the wave of every YA trend. And yet, I have never read a book like this one.Requests for indie/self-pub reviews come to me all the time. I usually take a glance at the first few pages and am almost always put off by the poor grammar or writing. I rarely make it past the first chapter and, if I do, the story quickly loses my attention. And, to be honest, I didn't expect Senlin Ascends to be any different. However, I took a chance on this because it came so highly recommended by Mark Lawrence, and I didn't come up for breath until I'd finished the final page. It is both a masterfully-crafted work of art AND an addictive pageturner. \n\u201cNewcomers may expect the ringdoms of the Tower to be like the layers of a cake where each layer is much like the last. But this is not the case. Not at all. Each ringdom is unique and bewildering. The ringdoms of the Tower share only two things in common: the shape of their outermost walls, which are roughly circular, and the price of beef, which is outrageous. The rest is novel.\u201d\nJust so you know: it's nothing like Mark Lawrence's work. As I said, it's unlike anything I've ever read. Senlin Ascends is about a man who loses his wife on their honeymoon to the Tower of Babel. Concluding that she must have entered the Tower, the book chronicles his ascent through the ringdoms of the Tower - each a unique, dazzling and completely weird world of its own - on a mission to find his beloved Marya.The writing is gorgeous and oh so very compelling. It's a bizarre tale that at times feels like one of those strange, suffocating dreams where everything is familiar but also not. There's this undercurrent of wrongness to the novel, even when Senlin finds himself merrily drinking wine on the Baths level of the Tower.\nSenlin was unprepared for marriage in every way. He possessed neither the imagination nor emotional warmth that intimacy required.Marya was so much better at taking the flaws of the world in stride, which was why she was indomitable and difficult to disappoint. She probably found the bull snails and drunken merry-go-round charming.\nCharacters major and minor come bounding off the pages. I always feel like the best tell for an author truly adept at creating characters is when smaller, secondary characters are important, well-developed and worthy of our interest and/or sympathy. Of course Senlin is important to us, but I also really enjoyed reading about the many people he meets on his journey - Tarrou, Edith, Adam, etc.But, really, it's so hard to explain why this book is so good. The best tool of a reviewer is comparison but Senlin Ascends just stands on its own. It's depth is almost literary, and yet it is hard to put down. It's unsettling, and yet darkly comical. The protagonist is a stuffy old headmaster, and yet lovable. Add to that some beautiful descriptions of each ringdom, portrayed in exquisite detail with everything from bloodthirsty executioners to clockwork animals... how can you resist stepping in?And the best thing about this? There's a whole sequel to enjoy!! Arm of the Sphinx is next on my wishlist.

That was unexpected! Senlin Ascends is one of the best reads I've had in ages. I decided to read it because one of the bloggers judging in my self-published fantasy contest had a very difficult time choosing between this title and another for the best of his bunch of 30 novels. In the end he went for the other book, which left me thinking that it was harsh luck to miss out by such a fine margin to a very different kind of story.Anyway, I was dragged in and didn't escape until I'd finished two or three days later.Don't read this book because you like mine. It's not like mine. It is, however, excellent.For me Senlin's Ascent hits on pretty much every level (no pun intended).It's the story of a man's literal ascent up the many tiers of the Tower of Babel, a series of bizarre ring-doms standing at the centre of a huge and varied empire. Senlin goes there on honeymoon armed with his expertise on the subject in hand, and finds the reality very different to what his reading has led him to expect. As with all journeys of consequence, Senlin's ascent has an impact on both the traveler and those encountered on his travels.It has truly excellent prose. So many lines made me deeply jealous. Clever, literary, insightful lines that cut to the quick of the matter.The story is compelling. It unfolds and unfolds. Because the characters are excellently drawn I cared very much about where it was all going.The imagination is unbound and intriguing. This has a strong Jack Vance, Dying Earth vibe, mixed in with overtones of Kafka, but it's also very much its own thing with hope and defiance to offset the cynicism. It starts rather gently and with a style you might find in many works of literary fiction but dark undertones build and so does the violence/action/excitement so that at the end it becomes a work that actually fits more closely to the kind of fantasy I've read a lot of recently (and remains an excellent read).So, in short, this is just the sort of find I was hoping would come out of the Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO). A truly fine book that after 3 years had only managed to gather 50 ratings on Goodreads (& as I am editing this review it's been released by a traditional publisher and has 3,500 ratings here!). It's a pity that it didn't make the final and l hope to read the book that beat it there, but I also hope it finds the audience it deserves and that this review will inspire some of you to give it a try!As a fanboy I decided to see how the tower (and Barad Dur) stack up against modern buildings.Go here to see it in high resolution.https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GVfMkBkZUS...Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "Buddy Read with Petrik \u2764This highly praised indie book series has recently been picked up by Orbit! After that news, and seeing the first two beautifully sitting on my shelf for far too long, I decided I wanted to experience this self published series before the year was over, but now I just want all the books immediately, because Senlin Ascends is a literary masterpiece. \n\n\u201cThe Tower of Babel is most famous for the silk fineries and marvelous airships it produces, but visitors will discover other intangible exports. Whimsy, adventure, and romance are the Tower\u2019s real trade\u201d\n\nSenlin Ascends is unlike anything I've ever read before. The basic premise seems easy enough: A headmaster that works at a school in a very small and far away village, has newly married a girl who compliments him perfectly. Senlin is a man of planning, habit, and always following the rules, while his new bride, Marya, follows her own beat completely and just wants to see the world. Senlin is also obsessed with a mysterious tower that is far, far away from him and Marya's village. So, what better place for them to honeymoon than the tower that he's been obsessing over his whole life. I mean, Senlin has a guidebook, and he always follows the rules, what could go wrong? \n\n\u201cthe Tower is a tar pit. Once you put a toe in her, you\u2019re caught forever. No one leaves. No one goes home.\u201d\n\nYet, we soon find out that inside the Tower of Babel there are completely different worlds living and dwelling inside each level, or maybe I should say functioning inside each level. And, yes, I said Tower of Babel, like the bible story you probably grew up hearing at least once about why we speak so many different languages. Basically, after the Great Flood happened, a bunch of people came together and agreed to build a tower that would touch Heaven itself. God, realizing what they are attempting, scatters them all around the world and makes them all speak different languages, hence our world today. Yet, obviously, the higher in the tower you are the closer you are to God and Heaven. Also, unbeknownst to me both times, this is the second Tower of Babel inspired story I've read this month, because I also read Nyxia (The Nyxia Triad, #1) by Scott Reintgen . So now I'm lowkey sitting at my computer like, \"Is God trying to tell me something?\"Anyways, this is a glorious painting done by Peter Bruegel, that I found because of my wonderful friend Mike's review, that is a very close interpretation to how I pictured the Tower in this book:And here is the Tower that the amazingly talented author, Josiah Bancroft, made that shows us around and inside a few of the levels known to man: (I looked at this constantly once Petrik showed it to me!)Okay, so now you guys know sort of what the gist of the Tower is and sort of what it looks like, but I'm sure you're reading this review to find out about the story. Oh, my friends, this story is a treat to any book lover who happens to stumble upon this tale. It's mystery after mystery, surprise after surprise, whimsical new steampunk world after whimsical new steampunk world. \n\n\u201cNot a solitary soul will help you here. The good souls don\u2019t have the means or mind for it, and the bad souls will only bleed you dry.\u201d\n\nAs Senlin is ascending the Tower, this book will constantly lead you to believe something, and you will, with your whole heart, but it will end up being so completely different. And the book will do this over and over again, but it will never feel forced or gimmicky, but it will always surprise you. I'm not sure any author I've ever read has been capable of doing that before, and, again, this is a debut novel by a self published author. (Which is why we need to support indie authors and find more hidden gems like this little masterpiece.) And the writing is so fantastic. It's entrancing and addicting, while also being one of the most immersive works I've ever read. Especially the baths, like, I'm still halfway convinced that I was there in my own little pinecone like shelf, watching everything play out through the streets of that city. This story reads like you're in a lucid dream that you're not sure you want to wake up from. Yet, it still feels like you're seeing everything through somewhat of a haze. Again, this tale is glorious and unlike anything I've ever read in my many years of reading. \n\n\u201cIt is easier to accept who you\u2019ve become than to recollect who you were.\u201d\n\nAnd Senlin as a character was wonderful to read about, too. Seeing the Tower shape him into what he needs to be, is worth its own review. I mean, the Tower changes everyone, but Senlin always stays true to his caring self that loves to learn and to teach others and it makes him flourish. Senlin's journey is nothing short of beautiful. I also loved the Tower itself, and how it is so much bigger than anyone realizes. I loved Senlin's theory and I can't wait to ascend the next levels with him. \n\n\u201cThe Tower is only as tall as the man that climbs\u201d\n\nThe side characters that Senlin meets along his journey are also nothing short of exquisite. Iren, Goll, Tarrou, Edith, Adam, Ogier, they were all such wonderful additions that truly shaped this story into something remarkable that leaves me with a loss for words. I could read side story after side story about each of these individuals and their time spent in the Tower. At this point, I also believe that Josiah Bancroft could very well just be a genius for crafting this complex tale that is so entrancing yet easy to follow. The only negative thing I can really say is that this book does end, and I mean it ends somewhat abruptly, and if you don't have the next book, Arm of the Sphinx, on hand, you are probably going to cry. If you're looking for a fast paced adventure, with a completely addicting story, with some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read, that is unlike anything you've ever read, please give Senlin Ascends a try.

It\u2019s almost always a risky bet to dive into an indie book, most people don\u2019t want to give it a try most of the time for a good reason, whether from their bad covers, clich\u00e9 stories, myriad of typos and grammatical errors, my point is, sometimes the harsh truth is that some indie books stayed indie for a reason, or just in the worse case, bad luck. Excluding the luck factor, Senlin Ascends, Josiah Bancroft\u2019s debut and the first book in \u2018The Books of Babel\u2019 series is the exact opposite from all these points I mentioned. Orbit books have picked up this series and it will be re-released in January 2018, I strongly suggest you get it or even better, as soon as you can if it\u2019s still available now. The reason is simple, everything in this book, you can feel how much love the author has infused into this book, whether it\u2019s from the plot, character, worlds, prose, or even the book production. I swear the trade paperback of this book could very well put a lot of publishing company to shame shame shame with their trade paperback productions. The paper is formed of a high-grade material and the ink is crisp that shone by the lights, you can see the letters glimmer.The plot started out very simple. Thomas Senlin, a timid, kind-hearted and sensible teacher is on a honeymoon with his newlywed wife, Marya to stay on the 3rd level of the majestic and literally gigantic Tower of Babel. Before they even got the chance to start their honeymoon properly, Marya was lost in the hectic and chaotic market and now, Senlin will have to explore the tower (which turns out to be of course, not what he expected) on a wild goose chase to find his missing wife.Yes, this is the main plot but don\u2019t let it fool you into thinking this is a simple story. The plot has almost every factor that will make any fantasy book intriguing. Friendship, philosophical, adventure, heists, books, hope, despair and even (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this) a tiny section of well-written romance, this means the reader will most likely something they can relate to here. The plot kept on unfolding with each part, which in my opinion is like three continuous novellas that were combined into one to form a bigger story.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn't have to go around congratulating each other for behaving with basic human dignity.\u201d\n\nThe characters are also very well written. Thomas Senlin\u2019s character development is amazing, his growth from the first part, where he was timid, sensible, innocent, to the man he must become to achieve his goal is gradual and realistic. He'll use all his wit and become a man of action rather than his usual stay true to his usual calm demeanor. However, another thing to be praised of is that every side character, Marya, Edith, Adam, Iren did receive the same treatment by receiving plenty of backgrounds information, circumstances, personalities and developments that will actually make them not just a simple side character to be excluded.\n\n\u201cIt is easier to accept who you\u2019ve become than to recollect who you were.\u201d\n\nOne of the main highlight of the book without a doubt lies in its world-building. I\u2019m going to spare you a lot of details here for your own good, you must experience every ringdom for yourself. It\u2019s all filled with unique settings, bizarre, made me feel like I was on LSD or high on drugs. Here\u2019s a picture drawn by the author himself to show you what kind of world you\u2019re getting yourself into, this is just a tiny fraction of the tower.Picture: The Tower of Babel, The Lower Ringdoms (From the author\u2019s official blog)The world is immersive, atmospheric, and combined with a unique, beautiful and well-polished prose, the Tower of Babel is a place you want and should dive into if you want an amazing and unique experience. Plus, I\u2019m also a sucker for Skyships and sky pirates. I\u2019ve played a lot of video games around steampunk, skyship, let\u2019s say 'Bioshock Infinite' example. So far there are only one or two novels I read that utilized this feature wonderfully and this became another addition to that list.Why not a full 5 stars with all the praises? Here\u2019s the thing. My minor problem with the book is because of the hype it gets. Senlin Ascends is honestly the most hyped indie book I've ever known in my whole life and I won\u2019t lie, this caused my expectation of the book to increase and it disappoints me a bit because, despite all the greatness of the book, I actually found some part less thrilling than it was supposed to be. This is honestly an \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d situation so you might want to take my con with the book with a grain of salt.The hype is definitely there for a good reason. There\u2019s no doubt that luck is required to get a signed deal, but I\u2019m of the mindset that in life, in everything you do, luck can be always be improved. With hard work, perseverance, patience, something great will not be lost in the world forever and that\u2019s exactly what happened to 'Senlin Ascends'. This book was published in 2013! Yes, 2013! It took 4 years for a publishing company to finally pick up this gem. SPFBO happened, Mark Lawrence (huge thanks to him seriously) and Emily May spread awareness for this book, if Josiah gave up writing after releasing the sequel, 'Arms of the Sphinx' in 2015, he won\u2019t ever be signed. Once you know you create something great with all your efforts, persevere and never give up, it's always easier said than done but that's how it is. Now, Josiah Bancroft has been signed by Orbit, and I\u2019ll say that it\u2019s totally well deserved.I'm going to conclude my review by stating that Senlin Ascends is a stunning fantasy steampunk debut. I may have fallen into the hype a bit and it slightly lowered my rating of the book but there\u2019s no doubt that this is a magnificent book that any lover of fantasy or steampunk must try to read, for right now, this is one of the most unique novels I've ever read.Bonus Picture: Look how beautiful the trade paperback cover of this series!You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I'm not sure if this was the hype of the book, my mood, or the book itself. I'm going to to with my mood as I found a lot of the book very good. I did take a little bit to get into it but that was because of reading other books I do believe. So here I am in the most unpopular opinion world. I do have some friends that gave it 2 and 3 stars but for the most part it's 4 and 5. I feel left out. I am going to revisit this book a little later to make sure it wasn't my mood because like I said before, I did like most of the book. I'm not going to write a long review as there are many long reviews here on Goodreads telling you all about the book. There is no sense in me writing the same thing over. This was a very strange/weird trip through the Tower of Babel with Senlin trying to find his wife that seemed to have gotten lost in the throng. But I wonder, did she really get lost? Did she get taken? I guess we shall see in the next books. \nThe happy traveler will look for the broadest, most beaten path, will look to his fellow traveler for behavioral cues, will be an echo but will not raise his voice.

I truly regret being late to the party but can safely say the hype is well deserved. Seeing only unanimously positive reviews from my blogging peers, I had to check out this 2016 #SPFBO's entrant as soon as I could. Thomas Senlin planned a seemingly perfect honeymoon at the magnificent, and world renowned Tower of Babel. Each level of the tower is a Ringdom- cities with different characteristics and unique aspects. Rumour has it that each stage is more beautiful than the previous. What better way to spend a honeymoon than to ascend the tower with his savings, guidebook and beautiful wife? Unfortunately, Senlin loses his partner amongst the massive crowds at the start of the narrative. He aims to find her by entering the tower and rising through the levels. He soon realises that the tower isn't exactly the same place which he adored from afar and which his trusty Everyman's Guide to the Tower of Babel had led him to believe it would be. This story has a lot of great things going for it. Most notable from the offset is that it is beautifully written. It felt like I was reading a classic rather than a modern self-published fantasy book. (Although Orbit has picked up the rights and this will be re-released next year by the home of Brent Weeks, RJ Barker and Nicholas Eames.) Although not a fair testament to the story as a whole, due to Thomas' character progression; some parts made me think it was similar to what a modern-day Candide would be, with a wide-eyed interesting hero having to deal with some inexplicably bad moments. The way Senlin is forced to change and adapt to these unusual surroundings had me putting myself in his position, therefore, empathy and affinity were created between us for that reason. He is a headmaster, very intelligent and overall a really interesting character. He's not the only person here that makes the story so strong although it seemed that would be the case at first. I won't divulge the reason why I thought that as that could approach spoiler territory and I loved some of the reveals. Unlike much Modern Fantasy, a lot of what happens here isn't too far removed from characteristics and science of our world. Though, in addition, Senlin Ascends does include some very interesting technology. Each Ringdom has its own peculiar politics and hierarchies which Senlin must understand if he ever hopes to progress and find his wife. This book also incorporates some greatly crafted villainous characters. This isn't the most action-packed spectacle but the way Bancroft presents, with slower moments and emotional flashbacks intertwined, the more action-orientated scenes have great impact. Especially the ending. The future possibilities seem awesome with the way things concluded. The finale convinced me this was definitely a 5-star read. This book gets referred to as Steampunk but I don't know what that is and don't really care much for sub-genre descriptions and deviations. I just care if I like it or not. An extraordinary debut that is well worthy of the hype. A beautifully written, highly engaging page-turning masterpiece where I was on Tom's side every step of the way. I'd read Arm of the Sphinx next if I could but as an #SPFBO judge, I'm currently busy trying to find some more gems like this.

It can be a sanitizing device, a seat cover, a dust mask, a garrote, a bandage, a gag, or a white flag. One may feel well-prepared with nothing but a pocket square.\u201d--Everyman\u2019s Guide to the Tower of Babel--Tom Senlin has dreamed about travelling to see the Tower of Babel, a marvel of the universe, for a long, long time. He is a headmaster and teacher, and so he is not a rich man and must rely upon the age old habit of saving his funds in order to even think about a vacation to see this spectacle of human accomplishment. His copy of Everyman\u2019s Guide has become his Bible in regards to everything he must know about the Tower. Senlin will soon discover that his Bible of the Tower has the same issues as the Holy Bible. There are inconsistencies with reality that would indicate that whoever wrote it may not have even been to the Tower, but relied upon speculative, second hand information. But these realizations have not yet been...realized. When we first meet Tom, he is stepping off the train, about to begin his honeymoon with his lovely, much younger wife, Marya. They are about to embark on the adventure of their lives. If adventure = nightmare.Within moments of arriving at the Tower of Babel, he has lost his wife. Rather careless of him, wasn\u2019t it? To lose one\u2019s wallet is inconvenient, but to lose one\u2019s wife is rather indefensible. Two eye blinks later, he has lost his luggage, rather burdensome after all when one is running about in a pell mell fashion looking for a misplaced spouse. He is a rube in a place of desperation. The Tower is a series of rings, and each ring has its own rules. Senlin is used to playing by the rules and informing others of how to play by the rules, but the rules of the Tower are baffling and rather dangerous for those who don\u2019t learn them very, very quickly. In the first level, he is thrust into a play as an actor. There is no director, and the script seems to be a nebulous creature that changes with the mood and whim of the actors. Let\u2019s just say that things go wrong.Senlin finds himself suspended outside the Tower in a rusty cage, many stories above the ground with one of his fellow actors, a rather lovely and equally bewildered woman by the name of Edith. They feel completely abandoned \u201d[e]xcept for the clockwork spider. The machine was the size of a large dog and was at once frightening and marvelous when it crawled above the curvature of the Tower. Steam gassed from the joints of its eight steel legs. It\u2019s internal gears were visible through its copper skeleton. It was the most intricate and elegant clockworks Senlin had ever seen.\u201dThe author Josiah Bancroft is throwing a steampunk nod into the stew of the plot. \u201dThe Earth doesn\u2019t shake the Tower; the Tower shakes the Earth.\u201dI just threw that quote in there to remind everyone that, yeah, the spider is cool, but the situation is dire. Of course, as we follow along with Senlin, he will look back upon his time suspended in that corroded and oxidized cage as his last sabbatical from complete chaos. His old life, that predictably boring: \u201dSenlin loved nothing more in the world than a warm hearth to set his feet upon and a good book to pour his whole mind into. While an evening storm rattled the shutters and a glass of port wine warmed in his hand, Senlin would read into the wee hours of the night.\u201d Then off to bed to dream of his own adventures. His own tales of discovery. What he wouldn\u2019t give to be back there, slightly inebriated, with Marya knitting some socks in the chair next to him. The levels don\u2019t get any easier. Treachery abounds. He learns to be a thief, a liar, a user, and a manipulator. The intellectual must become a man capable of anything. He must evolve from a man of stories into a man IN stories. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of his wife deepens. She joins the list of many others who have vanished into the bowels of the Tower of Babel. He makes so many enemies that, at one point, one of them mentions that they will have to hold a lottery to see who gets the pleasure of eviscerating him. The most disturbing part of all this is that someone has dispatched a diabolical assassin called The Red Hand after him. \u201dSenlin could feel the man\u2019s warm breath when The Red Hand said, \u2018You intellectuals are always so surprised to discover how fragile your body is. The mind is so robust, so remote. But muscles and bones are as simple as tied-up straw. They unravel and snap. And the more they break, the more the mind shrinks. In the moments before the cascade into death, the great intellect is reduced to a silent kernel. The mind is nothing more than a door into the dark.\u2019\u201d*Shudder!!* Senlin becomes a man among wretched men, and when men become desperate, they attempt do-or-die, foolhardy plans, while clinging to the slender hope of escaping the bondage of fear. \u201dWith subjugation comes certainty. Liberty is full of gambles.\u201dI had no real conceived notions about this book, except that readers I respected were telling me that I HAD to read this book. I certainly identified with Senlin. He is a man who lives in books, who is suddenly thrust into a divergent version of his own life, with a plot that twists and turns like the sweating torso of a man dancing on hot coals. It is easy to make mistakes in this world where the rules are obscure. The punishments are head-separated-from-body severe. Senlin feels acutely the responsibility of staying alive so he can save Marya from whatever fiendish circumstances she has become ensnared. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a story well told.

There was no romance in the scene before him. There were no ellipses here. The bodies lay upon the ground like broken exclamation points.\u201d \n\nThe plot is really weird/different and it also had some badass moments and a fair bit of gore (yay). So it pretty much ticked all the boxes. If you don't like this book your mudding crazy. I did have a tiny little minuscule problem, it did get boring and lose some of the weird acid trip vibes around the middle, however that ending truly made up for everything it was lacking. I want to fangirl over this book FOREVER. This book is a masterpiece. So basically it is about the Tower of Babel. Tom Senlin & his wife Marya go on their honeymoon to the tower, both coming from a simple small village are shocked when they see how huge the tower is. They arrive in the Markets which is crowded and extremely busy, Marya wants to buy sexy lingerie. Tom is the biggest prude on earth and can't think of anything worse then looking at woman look at bras, the thought alone makes him blush, lol. So he tells Marya to meet him at a sock stand. Marya never returns and Tom is sent on a wild goose chase through the tower, but to Tom's dismay his  Everman Guide to the tower didn't explain how strange the tower actually is. Nothing goes Tom's way and he finds himself to in the most bizarre situations. \n\"the tower is a tar pit. Once you put a toe in her, you're caught forever. No one leaves. No one goes home.\"\nThe tower is basically made up of different ringdoms. Every level is different and every level offers it known strange theme. The basement which was my favorite level had Beer-me-go-rounds where you would receive free beer by powering it up. So it's official guys, I'm moving to this basement, for free beer.. Anyway the tower is literally a maze we only got to see the \"lower ringdoms\" so I'm excited to continue with this series and get my mind blown some more. Senlin Ascends definitely doesn't lack creativity. A very unpredictable story with lovable characters.My favorite character was Marya, I fell in love with her very early on in the story. Her eccentricity attracted me straight away.\n'\"And you, sir, did you find my playing unusual?\u201d \"You meant it to be unusual. You are proud of your strangeness,\u201d he said'.\n I also fell inlove with her relationship with Tom. Holy shit I love them, they are literally the cutest couple ever. It was a very realistic, a real heart tugger (crying fake tears).Now her husband Tom Senlin is also another amazing character, his character development through this book was awesome. Tom continuously changed throughout the story, by the end he was no longer a prudish headmaster. He actually became a prudish, clever, determined animal. There was one moment in this, he literally gave me goosebumps nerd turned badass gangster: \n\"What does the key open?\u201d ____ asked in his distracted, almost dreamy way. Senlin cleared his muddy throat. He teetered on his feet and said without inflection, \u201cYou.\u201d He pulled the small trigger inside the key\u2019s bow.' \n He is my precious and I'm currently in the process of adopting him. I did have another favorite character but I can't talk about him because he was the bad guy. But I will tell you a secret *starts whispering* his fucking badass.I strongly recommend this book to all fantasy lovers. People who don't read fantasy but are looking for something different, this is definitely the book for you.

It raises expectations and sets the bar high so there is only one possible outcome; it gives the book a polarizing effect.I wanted to find out is the hype around this book justified and when I was done reading it there was only one answer: I don't know.Don't get me wrong, I liked the book (hence the four stars) but I don't think of it as one the best I've read or that was amazing as most of the reviews show. But it is certainly different. In a good way.The story begins with an introduction of Senlin and his wife Marya,who are traveling to the Tower of Babel, their honeymoon destination. But shortly after their arrival Marya is lost in the crowd and thus begins Senlin's quest, a search for his significant other.When I draw the line, there wasn't much happening plot wise in the first half of the book. I got an impression that the first half of the book is a symbolism art depicting different levels of society through Ringdoms (levels of the Tower), society full of decadence in all aspects, a world Senlin never experienced before. This focus on world-building and lack of progress story wise can be off-puting for some readers who expect a bit more action and even discourage them to go on but I never had such issues.Don't think of Senlin as a classical hero destined to save the day, or in this case, a damsel in distress. Think of him as a regular, slightly conservative man trying to defeat the system, a Don Quixote, if you will, fighting against windmills, windmills of course being a symbol of obstacles we encounter in our society, obstacles we can hardly skip over, a symbol of a fight that can't be won. Or maybe it can because Senlin's quest to find his wife is a symbol of force that drives him forward, forcing him to step out of his comfort zone and that is the moment when the story picks up the pace and we are presented with an interesting turn of events, events that involve scheming, betrayal, assassination and some great action sequences ending this book with a bang and setting the ground for the sequel.One thing that I found amazing was the writing. This was one of the most beautiful prose I've ever encountered and it is hard to believe that this is a debut novel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad your self-righteousness has given you some exercise, but you forget: we are not such a tidy, reasonable, and humane race. Our thoughts don\u2019t stand in grammatical rows, our hearts don\u2019t draw equations, our consciences don\u2019t have the benefit of historians whispering the answers to us.\u201d\n\nVery mysterious and unpredictable, a thought-provoking book, a book that may not appeal to everyone but it appealed to me and I'm looking forward reading the sequel."}, {"userName": "Petros Triantafyllou", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35342421-petros-triantafyllou", "userReview": "When I first laid eyes on this book, I felt that it isn't my sort of thing. I knew that I wouldn't like it. When I witnessed all the recent hype about it, I thought that it would be short lived. I knew that I wouldn't like it.When I was given the first book, I felt compelled to read it, but still, I was sure that I wouldn't like it.I liked it...Senlin and Marya are newlyweds on their honeymoon. What better destination could they chose than the Tower of Babel; an immense building of unknown high, where every floor is a completely different world. But Senlin learns the hard way that not everything is like it was promised in his guidebook. When his loses his wife in the crowd, his is left with only one option. To ascend the whole Tower and meet her again on the top. Thieves, Tyrants, Traitors, Men-turned-killing-machines and women with metal arms are nothing but mere obstacles in his way. \"If the law is malleable, Mr. Senlin, if it bends and conforms to man, then man will become resolute in his flaws. The law exists to give shape to man's ideals. When you think about it, doesn't mercy serve the wicked at the expense of the law?\"Senlin Ascends is an enchanting and exquisite tale that delivers \u03bfn every front. I was fascinated by the combination of Bancroft's immense imagination and his ability to ground this story in reality. The setting was as powerful as the characters, with power plays and backstabbings and enigmas that were illuminated by the characters' own actions while the story unfolds page by page. The wonderful prose is enriched with the excellent use of proverbial expressions, Ad Hominems, and the Protagonist's imminent catharsis. All in all, Josiah Bancroft's debut is a fascinating story and an admirable paradigm of the rare occasion where excellent prose, productive imagination, and intellectual creativity are masterfully intertwined, creating a story of untold beauty.You can find more of my reviews over at http://BookNest.eu/"}, {"userName": "Esmerelda Weatherwax", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esmerelda-weatherwax", "userReview": "Ah yes, the book that began my love of indie writing \u2013 I read this book a long time ago before I really had any kind of reviewing style. It was a short paragraph about me ranting \u201cTHIS BOOK IS AMAZING, BUY IT\u201d. So, I\u2019m redoing the review to give it the fleshed out review it deserves!Plot:Senlin and his new wife are going on a honeymoon, he takes her to the Tower of Babel which is a very popular tourist spot. The pedestrian traffic around the Tower is immense, and so is the Tower itself. It would dwarf mountains and most other fantasy architecture. It\u2019s absolutely enormous and I\u2019ve found a picture online that demonstrates the sheer scale of the Tower.Senlin becomes separated from his wife with all the hustle and bustle going on, and he has to find her. That may sound like an \u2018eh\u2019 plot \u2013 but the things he has to go through to try and find her are amazing and kept me turning pages until the wee hours of the night.Senlin starts at the bottom of the Tower, where the lowest of the low stay and start their journey. The first Ringdom is dirty, crowded and suffocating. There are so many people in there it\u2019s definitely not for those who are claustrophobic \u2013 think of the largest Indian or Chinese city and magnify it.All along the way Senlin doesn\u2019t know who to trust, or what to do. Each Ringdom is the size of a CITY, and he\u2019s trying to find one person lost among the crowd.The second Ringdom is by far the craziest \u2013 it\u2019s a city that\u2019s dedicated to plays and acting \u2013 but people have gone insane and start murdering each other. He has to run to get to the next Ringdom which is almost like Roman opulence. There are baths, artwork, fine food and drink and hotels. All the while he\u2019s meeting some super interesting people, I think John Tarrou was my favorite. He becomes a \u201cfriend\u201d of Senlin and sort of gives him the run down on how things work in the third Ringdom, including the fact that if you run out of money you\u2019ll be seized by authorities and turned into a Hod (slave).Final Score: 9/10Characters:The first book in this series is single POV, all seen through the eyes of Senlin. He starts out rather fuddy duddy, very stiff and very sure of himself and his guidebook \u2013 which is the worst guidebook in the history of guidebooks. It always leads him down the wrong path and watching him grapple with what he thinks he knew, and what the reality of the situation is was fascinating. He had a lot of growth from beginning to end which was great to see, and by the second book he\u2019s almost a totally different person. He really grows and learns how to think and fend for himself rather than relying on knowledge from his past.Final Score: 9/10 World Building:The Tower is mysterious, no one knows how many Ringdoms there really are, or how the Tower itself was built or who built it. There are a lot of theories floating around, but no one has a full map of the Tower.Hods are slaves that have either broken the rules or run out of money, they are all over the Tower usually using alternate stairwells and it\u2019s possible they are part of what keeps the Tower running.The Red Hand is a creepy and terrifying \u201cpoliceman\u201d that enforces the law in the third Ringdom. The scenes with him had me on the edge of my seat \u2013 he injects some kind of red substance into himself and becomes ridiculously powerful, able to rip heads from peoples bodies. Senlin gets on his bad side and it was intense to read about.Steampunk elements are everywhere, and there\u2019s a touch of animal fantacism as well with giant snails crawling up the walls.Final Score: 9/10Pacing/Prose/Tone:The pacing of the book started out slower, you\u2019re getting to know the character and get introduced to the world, but the more you get into it the fast it goes.The tone is definitely adventurous, exploring all of the Ringdoms with Senlin was a lot of fun.The writing in this book is absolutely phenomonal. It\u2019s one of the best written books I\u2019ve ever read \u2013 I\u2019m not usually into more flowery writing, I find it can take away and distract me from the story. But, with this book I was absolutely enamored with the writing and I immediately picked up the next book.Pacing Final Score: 8/10Writing Final Score: 10/10 Originality:This takes the cake on originality, I\u2019ve never read anything like this before ever, not just this year or last year. The Tower was a completely new experience for me, as was basically everything else about this book.Final Score: 10/10 Audience:For people looking for something very differentFor people who like adventure storiesFor people who like single povFor poeple who want excellent proseFor people who like steam punkFinal Score: 55/60 or 9.2/10"}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "You need to read this!

Because we love great writing!!!What a great find! When I decided to join on the buddy read for this book, I had only seen the beautiful cover - I miss this type of art on the currently publishing trends .. I had no idea what the book is about and from the name surmised that it must be about the strife of humanity to reach g-d like power. So, being a reader who is up for anything, I thought it looked interesting and after all, what could it hurt?Well, I have to say, this book did hurt. First, the writing style was so beautiful and simple at the same time, it was a painful reminder of how often all of us are being subjected to mediocre and sub-par all the way down to incompetently written works, to the point that when we encounter a thoughtful and well crafted work, it seems like a rare treasure!Second, it hurt my soul seeing this vision of the way humanity could have gone if G-D never destroyed the Tower of Babel... The land of Ur, the Tower becoming the center of human culture and advancement. Those who have been given the chance of generations to climb up the \"ringdoms\" of the Tower and have never stepped outside of its construction, see themselves as higher beings than anyone of \"lower\" birth. The author gives us a very disturbing and cruel picture of the human condition by juxtaposing the Babel life with the experiences of an optimistic but somewhat starched schoolmaster and his new wife, who come to the Tower for their honeymoon. Although not a very young man, he is full of idealistic views and ideals, wanting to believe only the best of people. His wife is a perfect match for him, despite being younger, because she awakens in him a sense of Whimsy and color in his black and white personality. This bright eyed couple, which we could easily identify with, gets separated almost from the start and we spend the book with Tom Senlin on his frantic search up the Tower for his lovely Marya. The human decay he is faced with is absolutely horrifying!!! It tries to change him and shape him in its own image, and the valiant battle Senlin wages to keep his basic values is vicious and violent. My soul was deeply hurt by the selfish and indifferent way people treated each other. The division of class which comes with the levels of the Tower and the cheapening of values and dignity the lower you are, are only some of the painful examples the author makes us consider. In the tumultuous political and social upheaval we find ourselves today, I can only pray that we can be as strong in spirit and grounded in decency as Senlin shows himself to be!!!!!!! And lastly, it hurts to be the reader, a person outside the action of the story, not only because it would be awesome to enter this imaginative but so real world, but because of not being able to reach out to the protagonist in some of his most difficult and lonely moments and share his pain with him. The way the Tower culture strips the person to the bare bones, rips away all sense of community, culture as a food for the soul, not a currency exchange, and makes the individual live either lost in the oblivion of slave labor, drunken stupor, basic instinct of survival, or mindless persuites of the flesh, is painful and demoralizing!!! I felt like weeping for the sparks of humanity which were extinguished by the Tower reality. It once again restored my commitment to rejecting the temptation to give in to the bitterness and hate those who want to reduce us to mindless slaves in spirit if not in action, keep trying to bait us to surrender to. We have to be better than that! Senlin manages to learn the rules of his new reality, but stays firm on his beliefs and I personally want to be him when I grow up \u263a\u263a\u263a!!!As I went on this tangent, I need not point out how deeply this book affected me. The thoughtfully structured plot had some slower parts, but they didn't bother me, because they felt like quiet moments for us to surrender to the melancholy of the loneliness Senlin was experiencing... They added to the intimate connection we developed with him and his tribulations... The prose was immaculate and being a first in a series of three, we are left with an open ending, looking forward to the next chapter in the ascending of Senlin up the uncharted hights of the Tower!!!"}, {"userName": "Kitvaria Sarene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1126371-kitvaria-sarene", "userReview": "This is one of the books that make me wish for more than 5 stars to rate it.For me, rating it is as hard as it was with Name of the wind - not because it is in anyway similar to that - but in not being able to actually say just WHAT I enjoyed so much.Trying to summarise this book is impossible to me, as it would sound boring and long winded... But it wasn't! I devoured it and it was so hard to put it down at bedtime or the end of lunchbreak, I might have been a tiny bid tired at work each day till I finished...What surely makes this book special is being so damn different! I read so many fantasy novels - and non can be compared to this one. It isn't epic, but it definitely isn't popcorn fantasy. It is most definitely not grimdark - but it has some of the grimmest parts of humanity in it (and some flying heads). It isn't about action, but it never gets boring and it has some very fast paced scenes. It looks deeply within its characters, without giving too much detail. It focusses on the main character and changing side characters, though even as they are changing you never have the feeling of them being unnecessary like it was in ASOIAF at times, were someone is introduced at great length just to die a moment later. It's more like doctor who, were every companion is important, no matter how long they stay.The book changed itself with every new part of the tower, and it works! It doesn't feel inconsistent, but it surprises you at every turn. You'll never know what to expect next and it makes for a thrilling read!As you see, I can't really put words on it - I can just urge you to go, buy or lend a copy and get reading and experiencing it for yourself!

If you're interested in this book, read this on my blog. And I mean YOU. Because I had wayyyyy too much to say about this book for Goodreads.

It's kind of hard to get through that. But then, it also helps you realize that change doesn't happen without pain and we don't become better human beings by sitting on our couch eating cake. And then comes the massive character development. So pretty darn massive, I'm not sure I've seen it done in a better way in a book I've read all year.Now I want to talk about the characters. Wonderful, real-life people, yet strong and colorful! Starting with Thomas Senlin, the main one, who undergoes a complete transformation and shows the best character development in the book, going further on with Edith, a woman Senlin meets in the Tower, turning from a petticoated country bumpkin into a strong independent lady, onto Tarrou, a man defeated by his demons and his own smallness, enslaved in body but suddenly freed in the soul, up to probably one of my favorite ones - Iren, the illiterate amazon hulk, finding her belief in herself and her own mind through Senlin's doing. All of this not just because Thomas is looking for his lost wife - it's because he is looking for fairness, not even justice - but rather meaning and justification that this is not the only thing life, the world and humanity can be. Because life in the Tower, said to be a hallowed and elevated paradise to the simple person, indeed is just a big, dark and treacherous lie, a trap meant to bring the naive and the innocent in, only to be eaten by the machine.This is for you, if you like adventure. Also, if you don't fear glancing at the real world - a really dark world. And believe in love. But brace yourself, because the first half of this book is really dark. People who ponder the real nature of the world order will also like this book. And quite simply if you just like books with good emotional development and great character building - you will love\u00a0this. It's a great book. A very strong one.

I like weird settings and I have read decent amount of adventures set in all kind of imaginative worlds so why is first Book of Babel as good or better as best of them?Why is this such an easy 5 star when this \"just\" an adventure book? Well in short it does everything it set to do incredibly well. Bancroft's writing is top notch and every dialog, monolog and description is joy to read. Than we have well written characters, it was pleasure to read about them and for those I hated. Tomas Senlin starts of as goofy character but we see real character development in him as he becomes more pragmatic, wise and confident but still keeping his ideals despite tower's best efforts to kill the. This is in a way his coming of age story.Setting is, dubbed by many the star of the show, is perhaps the main reason this book's success. It reminded me of mix between Pratchett's Ankh Morpork and Mieville's New crobuzone but with it's own distinctive flavor. Like mentioned place it metropolis (well several of them layered on top of each other since it's a tower we are talking about), supposed center of civilization but it's merciless place with dark and filthy side.

What if you could attend a school that could teach you the mysterious art of magic? What if dragons were real? What if we\u2019re not alone in the universe? What if swords could talk, and their sass could not be contained? Or, in the case of this book, what if God never destroyed the Tower of Babel and it became the center of civilization? Bancroft did a wonderful job weaving his tale of Thomas Senlin, a school Headmaster venturing to the Tower for his honeymoon with his lovely, plucky wife, Marya. Within minutes of leaving their train, the newlyweds are separated in the sea of humanity cresting around the foot of the Tower. Senlin Ascends is the story of Thomas Senlin\u2019s mad search for his wife as he enters the Tower and progresses further up and further in. Each \u201cringdom\u201d presents new challenges for Senlin and new philosophical conjectures to be mused upon by the reader. And each new leg of Senlin\u2019s journey exposes a new, darker, and more disturbing view of the Tower lauded as the center of civilization.What determines a person\u2019s worth? Their wealth? Their name? Their relationships? Their position? What is the meaning of life? Is it to live rough and drink much and just endure until the end comes? Is it to become someone else, to fill a role until you can\u2019t tell where it ends and the \u201creal\u201d you begins? Is it to frolic and mingle and bask in your station while gloating over and pitying those less fortunate? When you live a world above the rest of the population, can you continue seeing them as equals, or do they become something less than human in your eyes? All of these questions and more filter through the mind of the reader as they follow Senlin\u2019s ascension through the Tower.Besides the philosophical bent of the book, my favorite aspect of Bancroft\u2019s story was his main character, Thomas Senlin. When we first meet Senlin, he is self-conscious, nervous, absentminded, na\u00efve, snooty, and quite honestly helpless. But when faced with the loss of his wife, Senlin adapts. He more than changes; he metamorphoses. We watch Senlin endure hardships beyond his imagining and, slowly but surely, become an entirely new creature. But unlike many of those changed but the Tower, Senlin doesn\u2019t putrefy; he flourishes. Senlin becomes driven, focused, clever, and confident, all while maintaining a stunning optimism completely opposed to life in the Tower. He manages to make friends when none are meant to be found. His growth is some of the greatest character development I\u2019ve read in any book. Side characters, such as Adamos, Edith, Tarrou, Oglier, Iren, and even Finn Goll are all well fleshed out and grow throughout the story. Though she is missing for a larger portion of the novel, Marya is a lovely character whose many facets are revealed nicely through flashbacks. As the story progresses, her relationship with Senlin makes more and more sense, and the love he has for her becomes more real and poignant as he fights his way through the Tower in search of her. I\u2019m hopeful that Marya will be a greater presence in the second volume of the trilogy, because I loved everything I read about her.I enjoyed the book immensely, though I do feel it was a bit overhyped. The character development, as stated previously, was beyond reproach. The Tower itself was a wonderful setting, new and interesting and nuanced. But the pacing of the story left something to be desired, stretching the plot too thin in places. I also felt frustrated at the lack of an ending, though I know this is the first in a trilogy and can see where Bancroft did attempt to provide some sort of resolution. But besides the poor pacing, Senlin Ascends was a fantastic read, and felt truly unique, for which I couldn't give less than 4.5 stars. I will most definitely be reading the rest of Bancroft\u2019s work.A buddy read with the lovely weirdos over at BB&B!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "I can't believe it!

It's almost tangible, how as a reader, I could feel Thomas Senlin spiraling down from mild excitement to worry to total desperation when the realization that he may have lost her for good finally hits. It's surreal, yet you can feel being there with him, step after step.The story goes on and as Sanlin navigates the Tower and meets its colorful inhabitants (I'm using colorful as an all-encompassing adjective) he thinks about his time with Marya and those brief glimpses are lyrical and almost resembling a dream. Senlin is a wonderful protagonist, an \"all-weather friend\" and all too real.It's a tale of humanity lost and found, of vices and ambition, of desire and dreams, of the meaning of civility; of life, but never without hope. Prose, storytelling, reveals and rising of tension are great! It\u2019s unquestionably one of the best fantasy books I've read in a while (and I\u2019m not even into steampunk) because it\u2019s enthralling, entertaining and vaguely disturbing in its unbridled drive to make you think. I'm sure the author loves literature, for instance, the Tower with its ringdoms and horrifying (but impartial?) concept of justice, with all its symbolism, it\u2019s a little reminiscent of Dante's self-discovery journey and his longing for Beatrice.And what an ending! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s an originally self-published debut novel, it deserves all the recognition it gathered and more. It\u2019s also a testament to one of the best aspects of internet, where a non-mainstream work of value can find its readership without the backing of the publishing industry and eventually find a publisher, too. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series, I\u2019ve already bought the second volume and I\u2019m eagerly waiting for The Hod King (no kindle pre-orders yet) to get the best out of my next visit to the Tower.Experimental and beautifully crafted.\u201cIf the law is malleable, Mr. Senlin, if it bends and conforms to man, then man will become resolute in his flaws. The law exists to give shape to man\u2019s ideals. When you think about it, doesn\u2019t mercy serve the wicked at the expense of the law?\u201d"}, {"userName": "~Dani~ LazyTurtle's Books", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8340422-dani-lazyturtle-s-books", "userReview": "UPDATE 1/29/2018: We now have a podcast review for Senlin Ascends! Check it out on iTunes, here, or on your preferred podcatcher app!Read this review and more at Book Geeks Uncompromised.\n\u201cFor a man choked full of esoteric wisdom, he had very little idea what he was capable of. He knew himself but poorly.\u201d\nI want to write a review that reflects just how eloquent and breathtaking this book was but I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to. In trying to explain what was so amazing about Senlin Ascends to a friend of mine, I turned into a bit of a stuttering mess. I just don\u2019t have the words.The best way that I can think of to describe this book is to say that, while the story and world itself are richly imagined, there was something subtle that just really pulled me in and inspired my awe. And that doesn\u2019t even sound right to me. I am having so much trouble expressing exactly the feels that this book gave me\u2026 Because it wasn\u2019t the plot twists or anything like that drew me in. Rather it was the depths of human nature that was explored here that resonated with me on a level beyond just \u201cthis was a great story.\u201dThe more I think about it, the more okay I am with not being able to fully articulate why I fell in love with this book so much. All that I knew going into it was that it is about a man that is separated from his wife so he goes through the different levels of this great tower to find her and that the tower itself is kind of bizarre.And really, that\u2019s all you need to know. Everything else is best experienced firsthand.I seriously think this book deserves to sit alongside some of the classics like Frankenstein and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde. Not that this story is anything like those at all, but the writing just reminded me of those and that they are great stories that are also about something, that look deep into human nature and aren\u2019t afraid to call that nature out on its faults.\n\u201c\u2026 we have pooled our human genius into the building of an elaborate Tower and have filled it up with the same tyrants that have plagued our race since we crawled from the sea. Why does our innovation never extend to our conscience?\u201d\nI got nothin\u2019 negative to say with this one, guys. All the stars, all the ratings, whatever your preferred system of rating is, this one sits at the top. Senlin Ascends is a wonderful adventure about life, relationships, self-discovery, and peacocks!"}, {"userName": " *Keith*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68366729-keith", "userReview": "May I thank all at Orbit Books and Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.\"Not a solitary soul will help you here. The good souls will only bleed you dry. They'll sell you rumours, maps, guidebooks, things more suited for wrapping fish than finding wives!\"Thomas Senlin and his new bride Marya are on their way to the ancient Tower of Babel for their honeymoon. As they approach the end of their journey the sheer enormity of the Tower becomes evident, not to mention the veritable menagerie of people descending upon it in the hopes of riches and a new life. Upon arrival in the throng of thousands of people Thomas and Marya try to push their way through the huge market on their way to the base of the tower to start their honeymoon in the Baths (the third Ringdom in the Tower of Babel). Unfortunately before they even get to the tower Thomas and Marya become separated as Marya goes looking for something new to wear in the many market stalls that surround it. As Thomas waits for his beloved Marya to return the market seems to change around him. As the hours tick by it soon dawns on Thomas that Marya isn't coming back and has gotten lost in the sheer numbers of people that surround the tower. And so begins Thomas's search for his beloved Marya, Senlin's Ascent begins!\"Do you go everywhere lashed together?\" A note of mockery crept into his voice now.\"Yes, of course,\" replied the older of the two.\"Ever since we lost our little sister.\"First off I must say what a great book this turned out to be, I didn't know quite what to expect, even though I had heard good things about it I tried to stay away from other reviews for obvious reasons. It had almost everything I could ask for in a book, there were some quite dark and surreal moments throughout the Tower of Babel that really grabbed my attention, and some surprises that caught me out a treat.Thomas Senlin is a mild mannered and quite reserved headmaster of a school in a small village. He falls in love with one of his ex- student's (Marya), and as their relationship blossoms Senlin gains the courage to ask for her hand in marriage. Thomas who has been fascinated with the Tower of Babel for years, even teaching his students about it, seizes the opportunity to save up and take his new bride on honeymoon to this wondrous place (according to the Everymas Guide book to the Tower of Babel) that is, something that Thomas Senlin puts an awful amount of faith in.Marya brings a whole new meaning to Senlins life, enriching his existence more than he thought was ever possible, and throughout Senlin's search for her we are treated to the occasional flash backs from the time they spent early on in their relationship leading up to their ill-fated honeymoon. These flash backs usually happen when Senlin is at his most vulnerable and destitute. As Thomas Senlin embarks on his journey through the Tower of Babel he meets a wide variety of friends, all of which profess their desire to help him find his wife. But friends come and go and come back again, the question is can anyone truly have friends in the Tower of Babel? This is where the storey really comes alive for me and twists and turns wonderfully with characters you will hate one moment and like the next. This is also where Senlin finds out that things are very different in real life than what the Everyman's guide book says, and his experiences throughout his ascent brings into question, whoever wrote the Everymans guide book, did they actually visit the tower in the first place? Another thing that sets Senlin Ascends apart for me is the imaginative Ringdoms that make up each level of the Tower of Babel. Each level has a unique feel to it and in turn is governed by different factions or nobility. Just how many Ringdoms there are is under question and as yet remains a mystery?As the search for Marya evolves, Senlin undergoes many trials and tribulations and at many points throughout the book you feel \"what's the point in carrying on\" for poor old Thomas, and that's just when things become interesting! To sum up then, Senlin Ascends is a wondrous story of survival against the odds, love and devotion, dark scenes, as surreal a Stanley Kubrick film in parts and just when you think there's a lull in the story there's a surprise waiting around the corner. In my opinion Senlin Ascends raises the bar in Fantasy and deserves every accolade it gets, and will gain cult status I'm sure!\"The simplest way to make the world mysterious and terrifying to a man is to chase him through it\" Thomas Senlin.Thanks for reading."}, {"userName": "Scott  Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock", "userReview": "3.5*I absolutely love the writing style. The characters and world are described so vibrantly and the words just flow. That said there isn't a lot of action and it bogs down a bit in the middle. If you're an action junky this is not the book for you. If you like a smooth writing style, social-economic overtones, great character nuances and affectations then it is.

A unique story, setting and protagonist, as far as I'm concerned.I've heard great things about this story and I can understand why. It's very well written indeed and flows so very well on Audible - the narration is excellent.Despite this being a missing persons mystery, it felt as intriguing as a murder mystery in a Victorian style Steampunk setting. Almost completely set around and within a HUGE - seriously huge - tower, where the levels are like kingdoms, each as unique as the last and next.The protag isn't your usual tough guy or sword-wielding warrior or rogue. He knows no magic, but he has his mind, and a clever one it is too, pitting brains vs brawn; pitting his brains against the towers, which isn't what he thought it was. It isn't what anyone thinks it is!Intriguing, mysterious, fascinating and twisty, too. I really enjoyed it, truly. So, why 4* and not 5*, you ask? I... don't know. There was just something holding back my complete and utter excitement with this one. I enjoyed it, but it didn't truly wrench me in and along for the ride. The ending, however... the ending excites me for what's to come and I WILL be reading (or listening to it), that's a given.I recommend this, I really do. You just have to experience the tower and the prose. Don't miss out! I look forward to listening to the sequel and I look forward to reading folks' thoughts on both.Kudos to Josiah for thinking outside the box on this one!"}, {"userName": "Aristea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57608403-aristea", "userReview": "It took me a while to articulate some thoughts for this book - somehow I find it more complicated than usual due to the mixed feelings I have. On one side, the idea of the book and the writing style are simply sublime. Take the Babel Tower and make it the center of your story - in what felt to me like an early 1900 setting. Also, the writing is divine; I have been struck in the past by amazing and flowing verbiage. This beats all the competitors. A masterpiece. On the other side, I felt like the story was a bit all over the place, not very linear for most part (in an Edgar Allan Poe way) and missing entirely an essential element to fantasy: Action. True, the books seems mostly a social study - yes, I am borrowing this expression by fellow readers but it is spot on as to what this book really is - and it is interesting how this book goes through different levels (and types of society). And while I am writing the review, I can still feel the absolute dichotomy I was experiencing while reading. I still think I will read the following books in the series - especially because I want to see what the Tower has to offer to Senlin in the next levels!"}], "description": "'One of my favourite books of all time' Mark Lawrence\n'An extraordinary debut that is well worthy of the hype.

Immense as a mountain, the ancient tower is the greatest marvel in the world, comprising unnumbered ringdoms stacked one on the other like the layers of a cake.

But no sooner do they arrive at the Tower than Senlin loses her in the teeming throng.Senlin's search for Marya carries him through madhouses, ballrooms and burlesque theatres.
