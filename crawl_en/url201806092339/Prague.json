How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?\"\nBudapest: City of GritJohn Price left California for Budapest in search of adventure, but also to reconnect to his older brother Scott. When he was younger, Scott was a fat, unathletic, unhappy kid, but since leaving for Europe, he has sculpted his body and mind into someone very different from whom he used to be. By being around John again all the insecurities of his past come back to nag at the veneer of his new identity. When I graduated from high school, I moved to Phoenix to go to college. I can still remember waking up that first morning in Arizona and thinking to myself I don\u2019t know a single soul in this city. I was elated. I could finally be me. Growing up, especially in a small farming community, everyone knows everything about you. They have these disjointed ideas of who you are that have been formed from the shedded skins of your younger self. You have no control over what they decide to remember (or exaggerate) about you, and to ever escape those older versions of yourself is impossible. I wish I\u2019d been able to flee to a vibrant European city like Budapest but I had to settle for Phoenix. Scott does introduce John to his group of ex-pat, pseudo-intellectual friends. In the midst of them is a corn fed, patriotic to the bone woman from Nebraska named Emily. There is also Charles, an investment banker, who in the course of the novel puts together a deal to bring the historic Horvath press back to life. \u201dThere was something incorrect about this boy. His smile and word of thanks were wrong. He was made of dirty mirrors.\u201d There is Mark, a Canadian, in love with architecture and the past. \u201dCan you imagine standing right here and being in love and seeing the world how it looked before movies existed, before movies made you see everything a certain way?\u201d As John settles into the city and starts to make a name for himself as a journalist working for BudapesToday, he begins to put together a life of his own. He finds an apartment, absurdly cheap. \u201dThe balcony\u2019s floor was cracked in a map of meandering rivers, demarcating flakes, and slabs of concrete loose enough to lift. It seemed evident that eventually the balcony would collapse under its own, or someone else\u2019s weight. The building\u2019s exterior walls bore decades-old scars and bullet holes.\u201d The original owner leaves a picture of his wife and asked that John not take it down. This picture becomes a talisman of the apartment to the point that she almost seems like a part of John\u2019s own past. He meets a colorful Hungarian woman named Nadja at a bar who tells him stories of her past. She has been forced to leave Budapest too many times but always comes back when sanity has returned. John takes Emily to see Nadja in the hopes of impressing her, but Emily can not believe that someone has had that many experiences. To John those stories are wonderful pieces of culture history. To Emily they are just lies. As I skimmed some other reviews of this book, it was interesting to see the reactions to these twenty something characters who are all very intelligent, who have just read enough, seen enough, to formulate what they feel are informed opinions, but of course they are just on the beginning edges of actually knowing what they are talking about. The people who gave this book one star because they loathed the characters I believe missed some of the point of the book because Arthur Phillips is very hard on these people. He exposes them. He certainly does not romanticize them. I identified with many aspects of these characters. The flaws they display are certainly ones that I could attribute to my past self as I grappled with knowledge, trying to evolve beyond just being smart into someone with actual intelligence. \nI must warn you about travelling to Budapest. I did have to dance for my supper.The one star reviews seemed intent on punishing a writer for creating characters they\u2019ve met versions of in real life and didn\u2019t like. Many of them admitted, begrudgingly, that the lyrical writing is at times awe inspiring. Phillips also displays a depth of understanding of the human condition that had me rereading and thinking about passages such as this: \u201dJohn understood that some things mattered and some things did not and that the happy people in this world were those who could easily and rapidly distinguish between the two. The term unhappiness referred to the feeling of taking the wrong things seriously.\u201dI must admit though I really didn\u2019t like Emily. She is so square, so judgmental, and certainly someone who would give this book a one star rating. She certainly wouldn\u2019t like the direction her character takes, a direction she would have thought was impossible. Luckily, John meets the plucky, bald headed, artist Nicky who makes him really see things, and forces him to expand his thinking about what he really wants out of life. She has her thorns certainly and is always looking to fortify the voracious hunger of the creative monster. \u201dJohn, not knowing the topic under discussion, knew she was collecting garbage to feed her ravenous, drooling Muse, and loved her for her open use of people, even himself.\u201dPhillips also weaves in the history of the Horvath Press and the heritage of the current owner, Imre. The Press survived war, poor ownership, and anticipated the changing tastes of the Hungarian population. The books he published saved the cultural history not only of his city, but also of his country. \u201dThis was Hungary, and Imre was its memory. For some, the book acted almost as an opiate: The pleasure of leisurely or impatiently traveling from page to page and seeing lovely Budapest unbombed, undamaged, in black and white, was almost pornographic in its unattainable, voluptuous gorgeousness. Lipotavaros, the Elizabeth Bridge, the Corso, the Castel, the Nyugati Station in the day of its inauguration--the day it was the largest, cleanest train station in the world\u2026.\u201dTowards the end of the book the First Gulf War breaks out. Mark becomes absolutely addicted to CNN, which was the station that first gave us the twenty-four hour news cycle. I was working at Bookman\u2019s Used Books in Tucson at the time. We brought a TV up to the front of the store so that we could get updates as the war unfolded. The war was over so quickly that it almost felt like a movie with too abrupt an ending. Like most of America, for quite a while, I continued to be addicted to news. My obsession with play-by-play news cooled a long time ago as I discovered that news is too influenced by half lies, hidden truths, and political agendas. \nMaybe there is some fascinating reason why Phillips decided to call this book Prague, but I actually find it annoying. Almost all the book is set in Budapest, so logically the book should bear the name of that city not the sister city on the Danube who has always been considered more elegant, more interesting. It has been a long time since I\u2019ve been to Vienna, Budapest, and Prague, but I remember mimosas for breakfast in Vienna, a wonderful vibe in Budapest, and the breathtaking beauty of Prague. Each city was easily explored on foot and provided new wonders around nearly every corner. I can\u2019t recommend that tour enough. You may not like the characters, but I will say that no one remains twenty forever, and most pseudo intellectuals eventually discover how much more there is to know than what they can ever know. They grow up, and most become more humble. They take hard knocks just like the rest of us do and soon realize the universe doesn\u2019t play favorites. With time, they become less self-absorbed and start to realize the benefits of using their intellect to help people instead of using it to offer a pithy evaluation of others' shortcomings. You might like these people better in their forties, but until then don\u2019t bother to hate them. The wax of their character is still being poured into the mold.

It's about a group of American expats hanging out in Eastern Europe, Budapest to be exact, where they all yearn for Prague, the epitome of cool, told in thick stylish ironic prose that I enjoyed, laughed at, and occasionally envied. Having been an expat myself at about the same point in my youth, I immediately recognized these characters, and by the end, I knew them nearly as well as their real-life counterparts."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "A Tale of Two CitiesDespite the title, the novel \u201cPrague\u201d is set exclusively in Budapest, the capital of Hungary.A Confession and a GeneralisationFirst, a confession: I am hopelessly, romantically nostalgic about Hungary, a nation I have never visited.There is a girl involved, well a woman, and the years were 1978 and 1979.But you don\u2019t want to know about that. Besides, we would need a few glasses of Bull\u2019s Blood to taste the flavour of those times.Second: a gross generalization: obviously influenced by the context of my first confession, I have never met a Hungarian I didn\u2019t like or respect.Some More Gross GeneralisationsPart of the appeal of the nation and the people for me derives from the fact that they were part of two major social and political groupings during the twentieth century.Pre-Second World War, they were the eastern half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.From 1947 to 1989, they were part of the Eastern Bloc.Perched between Austria and Germany (on the West) , Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (to the North), and Romania and Ukraine (to the East), Hungary isn\u2019t quite German or Prussian, and it isn\u2019t quite Slavic.Its language derives from a distinct group called Finno-Ugric or Finno-Ugaric.The language with which it has most in common is Finnish.Despite being pivotal to two Empires, the Hungarians are a distinct cultural island in a sea of variety.Perhaps because of their differences, the history of this proud people is paradoxically marked by invasion and conquest by external forces.Yet, wherever its \u00e9migr\u00e9s have ended up, many of them have become extremely sophisticated and successful business people.The Irony of Place\u201cPrague\u201d is set exclusively in Budapest, the capital of Hungary.This reflects an underlying irony that, at the time the novel is set, many of the characters believed they should really have been in Prague, because that is where all of the action was.Yet Arthur Phillips chooses to set his fiction in the \u201clesser\u201d of the two cities.I still don\u2019t know whether this choice of title is insightful or sophisticated or just plain immature.There are several of these authorial choices that gnaw away at your satisfaction as a reader.And all of them could have been easily remedied.Only it's too late to do anything about it now.A bad joke can follow you around for the rest of your life.So there is a sense in which the author only has himself to blame for some of the criticism he has received in other reviews.I want to be a little more generous though.The Significance of TimeArthur Phillips was born in 1969.\u201cPrague\u201d is set in 1990 and 1991, when he was in his early 20\u2019s.It is the immediate aftermath of the Fall of Communism, when the country was starting to experience the shock waves and challenges and opportunities that rapprochement and integration with the West represented.An Abundance of CharactersThe truly Hungarian characters in the novel are in the minority.The real focus is the disparate group of North American expatriates who have been lured to Budapest by the thaw.Some seek business opportunities, some just want to be there to experience the aftermath of a cultural event as significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall, some are literally in transit on their way to Prague.All of them are in their 20\u2019s, \u201cyoung, anything is possible - friends, romance, adventure\u201d.Drumming Up BusinessArthur Phillips prefaces his novel with a quote from Thomas Mann:\u201cThe age of arms and epopees is past\u2026We are in for a practical era, you will see: money, brains, business, trade, prosperity\u2026Perpetual peace is on the cards at last. Quite a refreshing idea \u2013 nothing whatever against it.\u201dThese words provide an important clue about the design of the novel.It is not just about a Generation X, a \u201cLost Generation\u201d finding itself in Europe.It is partly about business and how it is done and who it is done between.Budapest is a new frontier town, and people, Americans, have come here to trade, to buy, to sell, to profit, only perhaps to put down roots, to build, to remain part of the future.We quickly realise that all of the main characters will one day leave Budapest, that for them it will be one long indulgence, a carefully maintained hangover, a broken heart, a battle scar, a chemistry experiment, an education, a stepping stone, a CV entry, the source of some future nostalgia.They will return to where they came from, clearly changed, possibly improved, only partly European, still essentially American.Of course, they will leave behind them the city and people of Budapest , who will still have bridges to re-build, a nation to shape, business to be done and relationships and families to form.The Expatriate EnsembleFor much of the novel, the cast is an ensemble.Arthur Phillips wrote it in the third person, so initially we don\u2019t identify with any particular character.He uses a nice plot device of a game called \u201cSincerity\u201d to introduce us to:\u2022\tCharles Gabor, an American of Hungarian origin, an up and coming venture capitalist here to buy State-owned businesses that are being privatised;\u2022\tMark Payton, a gay Canadian who has just finished a thesis on the history of nostalgia;\u2022\tEmily Oliver, a junior Nebraskan embassy employee who describes her job as \u201cneat\u201d;\u2022\tScott Price, from Los Angeles, someone who will only return to college \u201cwhen they institute a master\u2019s degree in living for the moment\u201d, but in the meantime survives on \u201ca diet of self-help books, brief and impassioned love affairs with Eastern philosophies, and a cyclical practice of wading in and out of various regimes of psychotherapy, accredited and otherwise\u201d.Ironically, Scott is the only one who finds true happiness in Budapest: he marries and settles down with a nice Hungarian girl.However, it is Scott\u2019s brother, John, who ends up being the keystone of the story.He is a journalist with an English-language daily newspaper.He has an eye for detail and a sensitivity greater than the others, and we see most of the events unfold and unravel through his eyes.He allows himself to be infatuated with Emily, but to no great effect.Instead, he finds himself in some sort of jump on again, off again relationship with shaven-headed Nicky, an ambitious and hard-working photographer and artist with the newspaper, who is one of the most interesting characters in the novel.A Stylistic DiversionThe above introductions take place over 125 pages.There is little action, we just get to see the ensemble in their new environment.Phillips draws his characters out patiently, and we readers have to be patient with him.His descriptions are detailed and lyrical, sometimes too lyrical.While your judgment is still suspended, some of the prose can come across as a little bit purple and in need of editing or self-censorship.It was particularly disconcerting to find this type of sentence on page 118:\u201cThe young American man with the stubbly shaved head, ill-fitting khakis, and worn blue blazer who answered the door found the alarming sight of John Price\u2019s bright red-smeared palm held up in mute explanation of why he could not shake hands quite yet.\u201dI even spent some time wondering how I would have edited or improved this sentence, only to conclude that only a complete excision with a blue pencil would do.Still, put on notice and alert to similar breaches, I discovered that this was the worst sentence in the book, and nothing that was yet to come offended me so greatly.Imre Horvath We meet two main Hungarians, the first of whom is Imre Horvath, an urbane sexogenarian publisher who is returning from exile in Austria to reclaim ownership of his family\u2019s publishing house.Phillips makes a strange stylistic choice in how he introduces him.Even before Horvath has appeared in the contemporary action, Phillips uses a 62 page section of the novel to detail the history of the Horvath Kiado, the publishing house that was established in the nineteenth century and managed by the Horvath family uninterrupted until the arrival of communism.We meet Imre\u2019s predecessors before we meet him.It is this chapter that I felt reads like a Wikipedia article.It is devoid of dramatic tension.It has no context until later, when it is finished and we move on.If you were already sceptical, this chapter would defeat you.I persisted, to my benefit.In the following chapter, we see how Charles Gabor treats Imre with little respect in their business dealings.In the earlier chapter, we learn that Imre deserves respect, if only because of the history of generosity, community-mindedness, decency and sophistication that he personifies.I read most of the dialogue between Charles and Imre, just wanting to slap Charles for his impudence and lack of respect.But this is the point of the novel: no matter what you think of Imre personally, he personifies an old Europe.Phillips\u2019 ensemble of New World Americans are like Henry James\u2019 characters climbing all over the face of the Old World and its cultural and business traditions.They\u2019re like 20-something management consultants coming in with their new-fangled management theories thinking they can change everything for the better.The old and tested must be bad, the new and untested must be good or, at least, better.There is a juxtaposition going on here.However, it is so much a part of the recipe of the novel\u2019s success that I would have preferred the content of the chapter to be revealed to us through dialogue or description interspersed within the action.As it is, there is too much of a sense that the Hungarian Goulash has been cooked unevenly, and parts of it are underdone.We are left to enjoy the idea of the meal, rather than the execution.NadjaThe other Hungarian is a faded female jazz singer, possibly of a similar vintage to Imre, who sings and plays piano at the Blue Jazz club, somewhere you can drink, talk and listen to music beneath posters of Mingus, Monk and Parker, a previous generation of jazz expatriates.John is captivated by Nadja and her stories, although we are never certain whether they are totally fabricated.She recounts tales of Weimar Berlin, ironically a time before the Second World War that was equally attractive to expatriates, if a little more ominous than 90\u2019s Budapest (although that might just mean that we couldn\u2019t see the omens for Hungary in the 90\u2019s).As if that experience wasn't enough, Nadja describes other adventures - being fought over by two Gestapo officers, \"her escape from Budapest, her bohemian life in the United States, her affair with a world-renowned concert pianist, her outrageous dealings with lesser European royalty\", her return to Budapest.Emily thinks she\u2019s a liar, John wants to believe her, because ultimately she, like him, is a story teller, a little bit of a magician. In the same way that Imre is urbane, sophisticated, accomplished, Nadja is vital, interesting, a spicy ingredient, the paprika in the Goulash.She is a source of life and even sustenance, even if her tales might not be true.At the end, when John visits her apartment, he is shocked to see so little evidence of her past.There are no paintings on the walls, no objet d\u2019art on exquisite cabinets, only perfume bottles in the bathroom.The minimalism of her surroundings strengthen the impression that her stories might have had no substance.However, John (and I) might just prefer to believe that she had few material possessions, because of the itinerant life she had always led.Her life was in her head, she was like a snail carrying her home on her back, she had nothing but her stories and her memories and perhaps her nostalgia for a life lived to the full.Success is Nothing Without a Succession PlanThe real action, such as it is, concerns the business deal between Charles and Imre.Charles puts together a joint venture with Imre to acquire the publishing house back from the State, the beginning of the restoration of his family heritage.In the absence of any family that Imre can locate, Charles is his new family, his succession plan, his guarantee of perpetuating the role of his enterprise as the conscience and memory of Hungary.Needless to say, for Charles, this is just a commercial deal.Imre is looking for continuity, Charles is looking for an exit strategy as soon as he has signed the papers.John writes favourably about Charles in his newspaper, and Charles gets what he wants.Ironically, just as the first wave of venture capitalists is leaving, a new wave of investors arrives.Charles\u2019 saviour is Hubert Melchior, a media entrepreneur, the owner of Multinational Median Corporation, not quite Rupert Murdoch, but a colorful, vulgar Australian nevertheless.Just as this deal appears to be coming to fruition, John decides that he has had enough of Budapest and catches a train to Prague.The middle and end of the novel are a lot more plot-driven than I have suggested.However, I am reluctant to reveal any spoilers.Sic Transit Gloria MundiThroughout the novel, we see individuals, relationships, families, businesses and nations in transition.In an ever-changing world, they seek continuity and stability.In the Old World, tradition plays a greater role, for good and bad.It gives its population a degree of confidence, but limits its possibilities.In the New World, there appear to be no limits on the entrepreneurial personality.Everybody seems to have confidence, but it is born out of individual egotism, not collective maturity or conscience.You get the sense that Arthur Phillips genuinely knows the world he describes in the novel, as diverse as it seems.Of Experience, Wisdom and MemoriesOver the course of the novel, some of Phillips' characters do nasty things to each other, and he has been criticized for being too cold in his treatment of them.However, I think that his characters are genuine, three-dimensional people with good and bad qualities.The expatriates are at their most youthfully ambitious, and therefore at their most naively ruthless.They haven\u2019t learned how to slow down and achieve their goals at a steady, methodical, more considerate pace.The Hungarians, Imre and Nadja, have a whole lifetime of experience and wisdom and memories.The expatriates, apart from their childhood, are at the beginning of their own journeys and are just starting to take their first cocky, over-confident Gen X steps.Apart from John, they reveal no respect for the wisdom and memories of the Hungarians.Even John has to take into account the judgement and scepticism of his friends.Yet, you also get the sense that this might be just one errant step in their own lives, that they will have up and down experiences of their own, even if they do not involve life-threatening moments or involuntary exile from your country, your family and your heritage.Varieties of NostalgiaYou also get the impression that the expatriates will look back on their years in Budapest with a great sense of nostalgia, something similar to the nostalgia of Imre and Nadja.But you also wonder whether, in the future, they will recall Budapest with a sense of guilt and wasted opportunity.To this extent, \u201cPrague\u201d isn't shaped or weighed down by youthful idealism.Ultimately, it is a fair-minded analysis of worlds and generations in apparent conflict.For me, it is a wise and mature work by a precocious author.The style of \"Prague\" is flawed in parts, all the more so, because the flaws stand out against a background of high quality.There were several occasions when I almost put it aside, the sentence I quoted above, the Horvath Kiado chapter.Yet I\u2019m glad that I kept going, and grateful that Phillips rewarded my persistence.I would trust him to take me on his future journeys, whether into the past or the future.Just as Arthur Phillips can create a perceptive nostalgia for the past, I suspect he can conjure a magical \"nostalgia for an age yet to come\"."}, {"userName": "Lp", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2007", "userURL":

It was a slog, during which I kept stopping to read reviews to figure out what on earth I was missing. The promo copy compared the author to Proust and Joyce. Reviewers likened him to Kundera. To me his work resembled nothing more than pretentious freshman ramblings designed to impress writing professors. I am here to tell you, the emperor has no clothes. This is a boring book, peopled by worthless two-dimensional (and that's being generous) characters, save one, who gets precious little ink. One reviewer said he could have done without section II, which introduces this one character of substance, a Hungarian printer. If it hadn't been for this section, I wouldn't have finished the book (hey maybe I could have done without section II after all!). The author's one gift comes out in his lists. At least you know there is some structure, and that it will end at some point. Unfortunately, there are only two or three lists in the book.His voice is very inconsistent. There are these extremely dry attempts at circuitous, self-consciously poetic humor (which for the most part fail) at the same time as there are these gee-whiz takes on things that I think are supposed to be suprising that most of us who hadn't fallen asleep figured out 100 pages ago. Unless this is some postmodern attempt at...postmodernism? In which case, yawn.The person who recommended this book to me, whose tastes I otherwise respect, found it very funny. I didn't get the humor at all. Some mention was made, too, of it being a \"Gen-x novel.\" And that that was a possible reason for my not liking the book. Oh, please. I'm not so old that I can't see Gen-X from here, but if it is a book about a generation, I definitely feel for the young-uns for being so....boring! One of the characters likens the losers who are wasting their ex-pat opportunities to the \"Lost Generation\" of ex-pats in Paris and Berlin in the 20s and 30s. This struck me as ridiculously funny, but not in the context of the story an a misguided character, but because I think the author really meant it.Of course this could just be the author being smarter than any of us. Ha ha. Still, I doubt it. In the middle of my struggle with this book, I happened to hear the author reading some story about a guy's tryst with an Eastern European spy/prostitute on \"This American Life.\" I didn't find his voice any more compelling when I could actually hear it.

I was lured into reading it by the magnitude of praise - it won numerous awards and the reviews were positive, comparing the author to such writers as Kundera and Hemingway, even F. Scott Fitzgerald - unfortunately that's not the case.The novel is supposed to deal with a group of expatriates who came to Budapest to discover themselves. That's an interesting theme, but it's all what it is - one prologned theme, without suspense. It quickly becomes tedious and the book starts to resemble an endurance test. Will you finish it or not?The characters are largely uninteresting. Writers? Academics? Embassy workers? Where are the people who bought cheap tickets and went on to have an adventure, to discover the newly liberated frontier? They're certainly not here. Prague is populated by a bunch of posers, who all read surprisingly alike therefore burdening thereader ith heavy feeling of dealing with thinly veiled self-portraits of the author, who's a Harvard graduate and a 5 times Jeopardy! champion. While there's nothing wrong with both, I propably wouldn't want to spend much time within a group composed solely of such people.Arthur Phillip's prose doesn't help either. There are some good lines, and gripping scenes, but they all drown in his obsession with surface detail, which amounts to whole paragraphs which amount to whole pages. The oppresively omniscient narrator resembles a an aging tour guide, and endlessly describes and describes everything till the tourists he's supposed to entertain start dozing off while they are still standing. It's as exciting as reading a phone book.Prague manages to defy two most important rules of writing at the same time - show, don't tell, and if nothing happens after page 100 or 150 why should the reader go on?It seems that the author doesn't care much about the reader, as he is utterly post having anything to say. Prague offers no new valuable insights and reads more like a writing exercise than a novel; it's meandering and unfocused. It consists of snarky phrases and sentences that are all style but completely lack any substance; the few interesting moments are buried far too deep in the verbiage and are simply not allowed to shine. It could be much better as a series of short stories, loosely connected vignettes, all dealing with the same theme: the crash of hopes and the loss of delusions. But, in this form, slugging through 367 pages is simply not worth it."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/782103-amy", "userReview": "No one cares about your boner, John.

In context, it serves to introduce the five main characters as they begin a game of Sincerity (each person states three lies and one true statement, and players try to determine which is which):\"Well, let's see what's what then,\" said the inventor and undisputed master of Sincerity. John Price watched Charles stretch his arms around the back of his chair, lace his fingers together, and lean back slightly to permit the lowering sun to touch his face. A symbolic opening of the game, John noted, as if Gabor were holding himself up to the light, an illustration of candor. And yet, it was an intentionally symbolic action. Indeed, John thought that he could see that Charles liked the idea of his competitors/friends noticing the symbolism but then being smart enough to reject it as not only a mere symbol but also an inaccurate one, a silent trick, since he surely did not believe that turning his face to the sun demonstrated any actual candor. And, John thought further, perhaps this was a small compliment as well, since Charles trusted that you were clever enough not to take the gesture at face value but to know that the act of intentionally symbolically revealing himself was meant to show that he was not revealing himself. Alternately, Charles might have been stretching.(p. 10, emphasis in original) This was the paragraph that completely sold me on the novel, a novel I loved through the last page. I love the complexity - how John is clearly intelligent but possibly overthinking, how Charles is someone who is completely capable of imbuing every gesture with multiple layers of meaning, how Arthur Phillips both loves and mocks his characters, the unspoken personal insecurities that lead to reading so much into possibly innocent movements... The paragraph (and the book itself) should strike the reader as pretentious - it certainly is - but the question remains whether that is a deterrent or a delight. I love it - but I love Whit Stillman movies and I went to Harvard Law School and I spend most of my time with people who like irony in its classical sense (meaning the opposite of what is said - not so much in an Alanis \"Huh, that's unexpected\" sense). I like to pretend that I'm not like the characters in this book, but I suspect that I am. And this novel is Arthur Phillips saying that, hey, if I'm one of these people with such sharp disconnects between their inner and outer lives, with such a thick ironic shell protecting them from the consequences of having or expressing real feelings.. then my life will be pretty tragic, but he'll care anyway, and maybe we'll all see the humor in it.Plot-wise, this book is an audacious debut novel about five young people who have crossed the Atlantic (four from the States and one, with frequent humorously bashful reminders, from Canada) to start new lives in Budapest, where they work unfulfilling jobs and dislike each other and lounge around their favorite cafe or bar to enjoy a mutual sense of being better than everyone else - while wishing they were in Prague, where real life must be happening. This expresses a bit differently in each one, of course, from the openly cruel Scott and Charles to the melancholy scholar Mark to the possibly innocent Emily, to the reader-friendly outsider John. This new Lost Generation (and Phillips pays homage to his predecessors here with plenty of references to Hemingway and other expat writers) passes about a year together from May of 1990 to May of 1991, and each character enjoys fascinating and thorough development by Phillips. They enjoy romances of various maturity levels, and a few of them get involved with a complicated effort to restore a Hungarian printing press operation (which leads to a fascinating sidetrack in Part II, tracing the history of Hungary through one fictional family, told as part myth, part history, and - in my favorite section - part hypothetical final exam for an MBA, which is heartbreaking and hilarious over the span of about five pages).I definitely see why many people dislike this book. The characters are hard to love, and there isn't much external action, plus the constant irony wears on the spirit a bit. Still, for the right reader, this is a masterpiece, a quiet warning of the dangers of irony and nostalgia and interpersonal deception, and a celebration of humanity even at its most hidden. I am madly in love with this novel."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/504017-bruce", "userReview": "In the early 1990's, the first flourish of \"Generation X\" novels started getting published. Writers like Douglas Coupland, Bret Easton Ellis, and Jay McInerney composed incredibly self-conscious, pretentious novels and imagined themselves the voice of a generation. What they were, in large part, was a squeaky reiteration of a far more compelling earlier cultural icon: upon closer examination, it became clear that, apparently, Generation X was almost entirely composed of squeaky-voiced Holden Caulfield clones.Flash forward almost twenty years or so and you have this mess from Arthur Phillips. Writing about the early 1990's, he seems compelled to channel the early 1990's literary voice. His writing swoops from purple patches of self-impressed drivel to painfully pretentious chunks of self-reflective irony. The novel is peopled with characters that, one imagines, are very much like Mr. Phillips: immature, slick, and so cooly ironic that even they don't know if they're full of shit or not.I desperately wanted this to be a good novel. In fact, I slogged through 350+ pages, hoping that Mr. Phillips would somehow be able to pull his head out of his ass long enough to string the few intelligent, funny, spiky bits together into a coherent narrative. My hope, however, was in vain, and now I just want a refund for the time I spent on this recycled piece of dreck."}, {"userName": "Suzy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597273-suzy", "userReview": "Brilliant book.

And such ennui as it was! A heavy, overpowering ennui, such as results from a participation in eight courses of steaming, gravied food, topping off with salted nuts which the little old spinster Gummidge from Oak Hill said she never knew when to stop eating--and true enough she didn't--a dragging, devitalizing ennui, which left its victims strewn about the living-room in various attitudes of prostration suggestive of those of the petrified occupants in a newly unearthed Pompeiian dwelling; an ennui which carried with it a retinue of yawns, snarls and thinly veiled insults, and which ended in ruptures in the clan spirit serious enough to last throughout the glad new year.\"I remember when Arthur Phillips' Prague came out and all the glowing reviews, The amazing, heartfelt, intellectual praise from every reviewer, every paper, every magazine. I remember thinking to myself, \"I've got to read this book!\"Then slowly came some tiny voices amid the howls.... \"You know, Prague is really pretty trite\", \"Prague is actually kind of boring\", \"If the book was cut in half it would still be a bit long\", \"What's the point?\"After reading these revised opinions, mind you this book was still high up in everyone's top 10 list, I decided I have no interest in reading this.Then it appeared on my book club list of July books, of course I voted against it but I was outnumbered.I can see why the other members of my book group would want to read this, The storie is about ex-pat Americans, Canadians etc in Hungary.

Getting a chance to meet new and interesting people, and hopefully sleeping with them, and the tiredness of being different from them and never fitting in. The bitching and moaning and the, \"why can't they do it like we do it back home\" conversations that are legion for ex-pats.But truth be told\u2026 Those conversations are awfully boring and the people having them are equally boring. Honestly I've done my best to keep away from most ex-pats in the 11 years I've lived in Japan.But I bit the bullet and read this book, and for most of it I was pleasantly surprised and quite enjoyed it.

How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?\"These words are placed in the mouths of the novel\u2019s principal characters, a group of twentysomething American expatriates who seek adventure and understanding in the newly freed Eastern bloc. And what struck me in reading the passage was that this outsized narrative covering a year\u2019s time in 1990-91 Budapest is remarkable ten years after its publication not only for its wit, style, and poignancy, but also for its portrayal of a world in which very little has changed. Emerging from the novel, one could easily see young Americans today asking exactly the same questions and arriving at exactly the same non-answers in post-revolutionary Tunisia or Egypt.In other words, the story resonates. But that resonance comes not only from the moment in history the story captures, but also from the author\u2019s seemingly effortless command of his art. Each sitting takes the reader on a gliding ride through imagery and emotion that is vivid, at times piercing, but always easy to digest. Even the massive interlude Phillips injects in Part Two is completely painless, and in fact invigorating. Here we are treated to hundreds of years of Hungarian history given as backstory for one of the novel\u2019s few aged characters, a device that illuminates the character, takes us on a exhilarating flight, and lays a solid foundation for the remainder of the story.As it turns out, I have once again let a book sit on the shelf for much too long.

Yes, ironically, the apotheosis of coolness is a novel about Budapest called \"Prague\" by a Midwesterner who lives in Paris.In a story of devastating emotional accuracy, striking intelligence, and irrepressible wit, Phillips follows five friends through Hungary in 1990. Here is a lost generation that knows it's a lost generation, a group of well-educated people who can sit at a European cafe and mock their imitation of the same dissipated scene from \"The Sun Also Rises.\" Imagine Marcel Proust writing an episode of \"Friends.\"When the Soviet Union ended not with a bang but a whimper and the Berlin Wall collapsed, Eastern Europe seemed a golden field of opportunity and hipness \ufffd quite simply, the place to be.\"Budapest,\" the narrator notes, \"just six months earlier an unlikely tourist attraction \ufffd began squeaking with new people eager to see History in the making, or to cash in on a market in turmoil, or to draw artistic inspiration from the untapped source of a cold-war-torn city, or merely to enjoy a rare and fleeting conjunction of place and era when being American, British, Canadian could be exotic.\"Clearly, the advice of the moment is \"Go East, young man \ufffd and woman.\" Phillips's novel joins a surprising number of books coming out this month that examine the expatriate experience: Ward Just's \"The Weather in Berlin\" takes a Hollywood film director back to his greatest success in East Germany; Gary Shteyngart's \"The Russian Debutante's Handbook\" follows the schemes of a young Russian trying to defraud a group of Americans in Prava; and Annie Ward's \"The Making of June\" plunges a naive Californian into the stark Balkans.\"Prague\" focuses on a sensitive, principled young American named John, who's arrived in Budapest in a hopeless attempt to bond with his older brother, Scott.The novel opens with one of its typically inventive moves: Some friends are playing an after-dinner game at the Caf\u00e9 Gerbeaud in Budapest. Each player makes four statements, only one sincere. At the end, they earn points for correctly spotting others' candid remarks or tricking others into misidentifying their own lone truth.In its pointlessness, its potential for abuse, and its elevation of insincerity to an art form, the game is a perfect metaphor for the treacherous arena these young people inhabit.John quickly befriends every member of this North American enclave, except his older brother. He falls in love with Emily, a naive Nebraskan who works for the US ambassador and smells like corn on the cob. He hangs out with Mark, a depressed postdoc student who's doing research on the history of nostalgia. And he works as an undercover PR agent for Charles, a new investment banker who's determined to begin his career by extracting a few gems from the sludge of Hungary's economy.The story moves fluidly, sometimes even dreamily, through John's experience in a culture that's swirling with nostalgia, deception, perseverance, and promise. With no particular skills to offer, he gets a job as a newspaper columnist from an insanely erratic editor with multiple accents. His assignment is to mingle with the natives and the expats and write commentary that's \"punchy, snide, modern.\"John is not naturally any of these things, but he can do a wicked imitation, a skill that drags him through a year of moral discovery, almost all of it negative.His dedication to chastity, romance, and loyalty can't possibly survive in this atmosphere, and the emotional flailing he endures leaves him clutching old values he can't fulfill \ufffd or relinquish. His brother returns his affection with disdain, Emily ignores his entreaties, an avant-garde artist he sleeps with exploits their intimacy for her paintings, and he finds himself serving as a reluctant liar in Charles's scheme to defraud a noble old publisher.(One of the novel's four sections jumps out of sequence to trace this publishing house through 200 years of Hungarian history. Structurally, it's an interruption that makes no sense, but like everything else in this clever novel, Phillips carries it off brilliantly.)What afflicts all these characters to a greater or lesser degree is crippling self-consciousness, a nostalgia reflex that treats every current experience as the material for some future memory. Real life, meanwhile, remains always frustratingly out of reach.These poor postmodern people are trapped in the refractions of their criticism. When John leaves a club after another unsatisfying date with Emily, for instance, he leans against the lamppost and smokes, but immediately he realizes it's \"a moment sticky with clich\u00e9s.\" Then he sees \"the silliness of seeing the silliness of it, and feels the pleasantly dry, infinitely regressing amusement he can feel at his own expense.\"Only the ancient jazz singer John befriends possesses the kind of authenticity he craves, but his slick friends deconstruct all her romantic tales. Trapped in this prism of critical analysis, these people will never suffer an \"unexamined life,\" but their laser irony burns every potentially fulfilling moment to ash.Phillips holds a precarious balance in \"Prague,\" satirizing the rituals of modern culture while cradling John's desperate search for a worthy life. This is one of the most sophisticated and profound novels I've read in years, a witty, humane tale of a generation stumbling in a dim glow that could be dawn or twilight.http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0620/p1..."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "Frankly, I am totally amazed by the number of people who absolutely hated this book.

It is an intense book, though, and I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone -- it would be for those who aren't in any hurry for action or expect that the author is just going to tell you up front what the book is going to be about. This is definitely one of the finest works of literature I have read in a very long time and it does demand reader interaction & patience. It's a book that you'll think about after it's all over.Let me offer you a quotation from the author, who spent time in Budapest, the setting of the novel (not Prague, which is more like a metaphor). It will pretty much sum up the feel the author is trying to create in the novel:\"For some people I knew, the ear-popping pressure of so much history and self-consciousness made it hard to get up in the morning, to justify your lunch, let alone your existence. What does it mean to tell a girl you ache for her as the two of you stand in front of a building with bullet holes in it? What does it mean to fret about your fledgling and blatantly temporary career when the man next to you managed to get himself tortured by the secret police of two different regimes? How do you compare your short and uneventful life to the lives of those who actually rebelled, fought, died, sinned? Does the present owe a debt to the past? Will this place be remembered, and me with it? Maybe this would all feel more real if I were elsewhere\u2026 But who do I talk to about this, when the only language everyone seems to speak is cast-iron irony?\"Prague is not just a story about expats who find their way to Budapest. It is also a story about those who have lived in Hungary under different occupations, including the Nazis & Communists, and how they've had to recreate themselves to survive, often clashing with entrenched cultural values. Set in 1990, shortly after the fall of the Wall in 1989, it begins by introducing the expat group: Mark Payton, who is writing his dissertation on Nostalgia; Charles Gabor, whose parents escaped from Hungary in 1956 and who want Charles to reclaim what is rightfully his now that the Communists are de-nationalizing former private property while he wants to make a fortune & indeed works for a firm of venture capitalists who according to him are worthless; Emily Oliver, who is in Hungary to work at the American embassy there, a job she got from her father's influence; Scott Price, who came to get away from his family whom he cannot stand, who ends up teaching English. The final member of this group is John Price, the main character, who follows his brother to Hungary and takes a job as a journalist for a periodical called BudapesToday.

Part I hyper-exposes them as cliches of the 20-something world travelers in a way that made me swoon and giggle and love each of them despite their know-it-all, on-top-of-the-world bravado. Part II shifts focus to the elderly Imre Horvath's past in relation to Hungary's past, and the publishing house his forefathers built. Good God. The whole thing reminded me of that awful semester in college where I ended up slogging toward a C in a history class I hated. Unfortunately, Imre Horvath's chapters are crucial to the next two sections of the book, business relationships and more history, nearly impossible to focus on, given the circumference of my permanent yawn. To be fair, there are still occasional gems in this novel, that kept me from using it to roast S'mores. Nicky, a bald bisexual artist who is both hands on and hands off with John, is a great character -- especially when she seduces the all-American snore, whom John thinks is the love of his life, Emily.

For instance, shifting perspective between two characters in alternating paragraphs; List-making, with lists so long that you forget you are reading a list.

However, many of the authors though conscious ramblings were hard to follow and the long section on Imre was way too long.

They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague have it better, but still they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making.", "title": "Prague", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92488.Prague", "average": 3.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320414664l/92488.jpg", "reviews": 460, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16223.Arthur_Phillips", "name": "Arthur Phillips"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Travel", "Historical", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92488.Prague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063619.Prague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212474.The_Egyptologist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9271896-the-tragedy-of-arthur", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5444895-the-song-is-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256397.Angelica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15281723-survey-of-african-marriage-and-family-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
