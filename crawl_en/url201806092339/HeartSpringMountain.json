A land that has witnessed their secrets their betrayals and has kept them for a long time. Vale will return to a place and it's people that is in her blood. In her quest to find her mother she will uncover secrets kept, and those she loved changed. Older, but still full of love, want and need. A wonderful book of time and place.The novel goes back and forth in time, narrated by the different women who are family, make this place their home. I loved the way this was written, loved the meanings behind the words. Loved the sense of place and family. We learn the history of the women, share their secrets, see their flaws and come to admire them anyway. Such wonderful characters though some don't live to have a full life, they still are remembered, still leave their mark. If you like the novels of Amy Greene or the novel Mercy Snow, then you will love this as I did.ARC from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "Complex characters, complicated relationships, women living seemingly simple , quiet lives in the woods. A narrative structure that can pose at first a challenge, trying to keep tract of the characters in the present and past since there are multiple time lines, multiple narratives. Yet I enjoyed the challenge and found myself vested in them. In this story of this place called Heart Spring Mountain and the family who lives there or have left there, the writing is lovely from these introspective narratives of several women and one man . You do have to read with care and make sure to look at the beginning of each chapter, which tells us the person and date . I fell right into their journeys up to and sometimes away from Heart Mountain, but I admit that I had to take some notes until I got further into it.  Vale returns to Vermont looking for her drug addicted mother who went missing during Tropical Storm Irene. After seeing an old family photograph, she also begins searching for information about her family, the past . The reader becomes privy to this family history through the narratives of the past as Vale slowly discovers things we already know or surmise. There secrets and deceits and a haunting revelation of a Eugenics program in Vermont's history. I won't go into detail about the names and times because it would be more meaningful if you read this to discover them yourself. I definitely recommend this debut novel, this story of women who in so many ways have a connection to the land. They discover their connection to it, to each other, to their history. There is definitely a message here about global warming and natural disasters. I don\u2019t mind the message and I got it very early on but I think the author didn\u2019t have very much faith in the reader as there are a few too many mentions of natural disasters in various places in the world . BUT, a minor issue because I really enjoyed everything else about it, so 4 stars .

Her hometown, although she can\u2019t remember what it feels like to be there.And then she arrives, and sees bits and pieces of her old life, the places she used to frequent, some changed with the destruction brought by the storm, some unearthed by the storm. The people, she\u2019d left them behind long ago, and yet there is this strong pull she feels when she begins to visit the family still there. The memories flood through her as time passes, each day it seems another thing she finds takes her back along the trails of her life there, all their lives. The people she loved, those that loved her back, those that couldn\u2019t love her in the way she could recognize as love, or even as their best effort at love. And when she returns to Heart Spring Mountain, she is drawn to her family more as she discovers stories she never knew about them, and we are able to hear from other family members in different times that offer enlightening insights into gaps in the family lore that Vale grew up with. These women have their own perspectives, their own stories to tell over the years, from the 1950\u2019s to 2011, the year of Tropical Storm Irene. Each of their unique views on this one place held by her family all these years, one a widow living on a farm, another a former member of a commune, a woman with a wounded, damaged owl. Stories that have been hidden, so long buried in plain sight, are brought to light. There is also the pull of the land which is strong, in this case it is family land long owned, but it goes beyond that. It is the place where these lives were lived, their stories grew from day-to-day lives just being lived to unearthed stories that are attached to a special place and time; the stories are part of the land, taking root and living in this timeless soil.This is not a book one can become complacent about while reading as it does shift in time and from one narrator to another \u2013 however, if you remember to look, the narrator and era are noted at the beginning of each chapter. The writing is often lovely, especially in the imagery of the rural Vermont landscape, along with the stories of these people who have carved out a life there for generation upon generation. \nHeart Spring Mountain\n covers quite a bit of emotional territory without feeling overly gloomy; there are many moments of joy and hope that help to add a tenderness and maybe even sweetness. Hope is almost like a silent character in this debut novel, always present, but sometimes overlooked in all the rushing about in Vale\u2019s search for her mother. In the process of the search for Vale\u2019s mother, she finds more than she bargained for, and a long-hidden family secret is slowly brought to light.

Her pain comes from different wounds, but isn\u2019t all pain shaded the same color? Soft blue, plum. Running up and down our veins. Recognizable across the room.\"I had the pleasure of reading an uncorrected proof of this novel months ago and it found me at just the right time. I was in the mood for nature, for disappearing and the writing hit me in all the right spots. I finished it late one night, sad that I\u2019d have to wait months to write a review, because it\u2019s a gorgeous debut novel. Vale has made a life for herself in New Orleans, away from her drug addicted mother, where she now tends the bar, immersing herself in the rhythm of her surrounding. In this life Vale is clean, sober, no longer influenced by her mother\u2019s dysfunction, addiction. Watching tropical storm Irene on tv, she realizes that the river town being washed away by floods in Vermont is the one her mother lives on, and it isn\u2019t immune to severe storms after all. A call from her aunt Deb, who feels more like a stranger than blood, stuns her with news that her mother walked off into the surging storm, seen by a neighbor walking towards the very bridge that has just collapsed. She grabs her cash and finds a bus back to the last place she ever wanted to return to. Why was her mother so restless, so desperate to escape a life of order?Home again in Heart Spring (her family\u2019s mountain) everything has changed, she sees the life her mother abandoned with different eyes. What Vale thinks she knows about her ancestors is poisoned by everything her mother has taught her. Her foolish, wild, free mother who believed they carried Indian blood. Was she just appropriating a culture, just how much history did her mother have right? Her aunt Hazel, unbeknownst to her, has a mind that is a \u2018leaky ship full of holes.\u201d She wonders, Is this Bonnie whom the storm has spit out\u2026 No. It is Bonnie\u2019s girl, Vale, here to find her missing mother. How is Hazel ever going to communicate everything she knows, feels, remembers (all those things that are wrong and makes things right) when she herself is slowly disappearing? How can she let go of this life, when there is no one to care for the land, so deeply ingrained in her soul, that their ancestors settled? Vale has come to hate what the land represents, a cruel history stolen from the natives at hands of her family. But why do the remains of their past, family photos, tell a different story?The addiction Bonnie has, the wreck she\u2019s made of her life is evident, but there is still beauty in the memories Vale has. When you come to understand where the wildness in Bonnie springs from, there is a keener sense of understanding how the ruptures came about. Lena and Bonnie are both mysteries begging to be solved, both ghosts in their lifetimes. Vale is strong, but she is lost without a true history.When Deb was young, she wanted to be free, to get back to the grass-roots of her grandmother\u2019s people, the farming of crops, working the land, seduced by the writing of Thoreau and her grandmother\u2019s memories, she makes her way to the mountain, to what she feels will be freedom! What she finds is a commune, but her youthful idealism will be shattered when the reality of hunger, poverty, betrayal, and the ever shifting direction of love occurs. When she finds Stephen, she clings, makes a home for herself beside him though he is unlike her fellow \u2018hippie makeshift family\u2019, the very ones she has walked away from. Over time, it becomes clear that a child isn\u2019t enough to pull him out of his silences. Deb and Hazel (Stephen\u2019s mother), are two lonely women who never wanted each other, blameless and yet pointing fingers at one another for the tragedy that takes place and here they are stuck together. Deb of the present is a mother longing for her grown son\u2019s return, far more attuned to working with nature than she was in her wide-eyed youth, caring for her mother-in-law, as close to the version of the grandmother she once longed to be as she\u2019ll ever get.Past and present reveal secrets about three generation of women, hidden truths that change the structure of the family as they know it. We meet the family hermit Lena, a spirited woman who was as much a part of nature as any creature of the earth. Untamed, misunderstood and just as capable of passion as any \u2018proper lady\u2019. Hazel is the steady sister, the keeper of order, and the one whose heart breaks on the cruelty of years, losing everything she has come to love. Hazel, \u2018a lifetime spent taking care of others.\u2019 Why can\u2019t she be selfish? Why, why does everyone prefer those who are free, abandon people like her who give so much, who make the right choice even when it robs her of all happiness? Why is nothing ever fully hers?I know I am all over the place, much like the novel, because it is true that it jumps. It can be a problem for me sometimes with other novels, but I was so deeply engaged by all the characters that it flowed beautifully for me. I had my heart in my throat halfway through, thinking about the cruelties of life and the infections of love, because love isn\u2019t always safe, romantic nor loyal. It\u2019s not just a novel about an estranged mother and daughter, nor drug addiction, nor faults in family lines, it\u2019s about all those things and nature is an ever-present character, sometimes a beast that reminds you it\u2019s beyond your control. How wrong we are about each other, and even more about ourselves. How much does our anger towards others matter at the end? What do we keep with our pain? What do we gain when we let it go?Available NowHarperCollins"}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6345942-kellie", "userReview": "A bittersweet and harrowing tale about returning home, returning to your roots.

They are deeply connected to their rural home land of Vermont and are tied to each other but not in a normal, open way. There are hidden inter generational family secrets and inner struggles. So there is a quest by the youngest woman, Vale, to find her missing mother, Bonnie, (presumably drowned) during a tropical storm. It\u2019s been a year since they last saw each other and it was under very bad circumstances. It is Vale who basically sets her formerly useless, stagnant life in motion by actively searching for her mother back home. The entire process allows her to find her true inner self as well as make peace and to have hope for the future and repair/reinvent family relationships. The author wrote parts of this story in a different style of some short staccato like sentences intermingled with normal length sentences. This was different yet had an impact on me. I found myself really connecting with those feelings/descriptions on those short worded \u201csentences/phrases.\u201d There was no need to add any other filler words to gain the impact desired.

I may have struggled with the flashbacks, the generations of women and the secrets hidden in the cabins on Heart Spring Mountain but the intertwined lives of these flawed yet powerful women drew me in.

The intentional obliteration of the Abenaki tribe, a New England ethnic cleansing will be what I take away from this read. I love when pieces of history invade the narrative.

I agree with other reviewers that it was challenging, if not difficult, to keep track of these characters. Until I was about half way through the book I was still wondering who was who and what were their relationships to each other. And that was despite the fact that I was able to spend large chunks of time reading in one sitting. If I had tried to read this book as I normally read most books in shorter time periods over a number of days, I might have given up because of the frustration over trying to keep all the characters straight in my mind. When she was asked about this in a radio interview she did, MacArthur noted it was because she had all these characters in mind. And she added that she wanted her readers to be able \u2018to empathize\u2019 with different points of view about things because she believes this is sorely lacking in today's world.Despite, or maybe because of, this complexity this is a rich and rewarding read. The characters seem to become very real people struggling with profound challenges in their lives. I was greatly moved by their valiant, and sometimes problematic, efforts to cope with their isolation and their search for meaning in the context of family history they only vaguely know about, if at all. Towards the end of the book the younger woman who is the main protagonist realizes just how important it is for people to 'resurrect' themselves after having been dealt with the blows of life. Determined and resilient these women, and the fewer men, in the story try to find their way in the midst of much turmoil and deeply painful losses. Perhaps it is my own stereotypical thinking but I am not sure how realistic it is for people living in rural Vermont to have as much knowledge of the fine arts as many of these characters do. For example, the book is filled with references to such literary giants as Faulkner, Thoreau, Grace Paley, and Keats. And to music by Neil Young, Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf, Leonard Cohen, Ruth Brown, Missy Elliott, and Nina Simone. Mac Arthur noted in that interview that she grew up with music being listened to by her parents, that she played in a band for 10 years with her husband, and that she is always thinking of music. There are also references to film which one of the characters turned to as a way to cope with the sudden death of her partner. One of the characters in the book noted, \"Where would we be without art?\" It shows in this book!So do MacArthur's observations about life, love, and the world we live in nowadays. Here is a short list of some of the things these characters say at various points in the story:  \"the past is part of the present and the future\" \"we are the sum total of our relationships\" \"near the sickness also lies the cure\" (we live in) \"a culture based on division rather than interconnection. Isolation rather than belonging.\" \"the curse of motherhood. They make us happy and yet we cannot make them happy.\"These may sound a bit too formulaic when seen this way. But I found them to be profoundly poignant in the context of the book's unfolding plot and character development.Likewise was MacArthur's timely inclusion of information about Native Americans living in Vermont. In referring to a book on Algonquin culture called No Word for Time she shared some fascinating ideas about time and society. She managed to allude to some relevant NA history in that region: the genocide of the colonial and post Revolutionary War days and a eugenics program in the 1920's in which many NA women were sterilized without their knowledge.In addition to the themes of the importance of resilience and art in people\u2019s lives the book highlights the author\u2019s concerns about the opioid epidemic in rural America, climate change, and corporatism with its resulting income inequality. While I largely concur with these concerns, I also agree with some reviewers who opined that she makes too many references to climate related catastrophes around the world. By the end of the book I began to feel a bit bludgeoned by all of this.However, all of these are relatively modest flaws in an otherwise outstanding book. For me a good piece of fiction leaves me wishing that the story did not end. I found myself wondering what would happen to some of these wonderfully resilient and creative women and men. Maybe (hope, hope) MacArthur will write a sequel? What a marvelous film this could be. Or a series on HBO or Netflix. I am not generally a fan of short stories. But I will certainly read MacArthur's collection which predates this novel, looking for the nuggets which were the start of these characters and the issues which she portrays in this book. Given my growing interest in things having to do with the history and cultures of our NA peoples in the USA I will also read No Word for Time.

It discusses what we owe to our ancestors, what we owe to the land we grew up on, and what we owe to the world in general. There were a lot of good descriptions of the land and I liked that. However, after awhile I was a little bit over it all. There were too many weird descriptions of sexual experiences. That\u2019s not my favorite and I guess for some people that is a part of life and caring for yourself. But for me, I just didn\u2019t really need all of that.

It can also tell a story across decades from the perspective of a single character and still turn into a coherent whole. But combining these two is hard to pull off; a tale told from the perspectives of various characters across various decades can easily turn into a mess. I am not sure how talented of a fiction writer Robin MacArthur is, but she is unable to thread this needle in Heart Spring Mountain.The idea that a web of connectivity binds together generations forms the crux of the novel. It not only takes for granted the notion that various flaws and talents can be passed down from generation to generation, but that transgenerational epigenetic inheritence is an almost tangible reality. The book takes place in three different decades--2011, the 1970s, and the 1950s (with a few relevant scenes from the mid-1980s thrown in). MacArthur's purpose in this is to show how three generations of characters--Lena, born in the 1950s and chafing at the conformity she is surrounded by when we are first introduced to her, and long since deceased when the novel begins-her daughter Bonnie, born in the 1950s and missing after a tropical storm hits Vermont in 2011 when the book first starts out---and Bonnie's daughter (Vale), who heads from New Orleans back up to her hometown in Vermont to lead the search for her mother, missing since Tropical Storm Irene struck the northeast-all experience various forms of the same struggles. Each of these females' desire to be as free from possible from the material wants of a capitalist society shape the lifestyles they choose to lead. Alongside this thread, the theme of a planet's climate careening out of whack due to the societal excesses they themselves try to avoid, but nevertheless also must pay the price for, reemerges throughout Heart Spring Mountain. Vale's return home to rural Vermont leads her to discoveries about her town's past and her family's past that lead to a difficult reapparaisal of her worldview. The rebelliousness of her ancestors--from opposing Vietnam to living on communes and off the land--is a trait she has admired in them, but the heroism of it is marred by the realities that have often been minimized or overlooked. Her town's participation in sterilization movements a century prior and removal of the Algonquin Native Americans from their land before that take a lot of the luster off what she had viewed as her region's honorable past. Discoveries about her own family's long-concealed secrets are not only disturbing to Vale, but explain things in the life of herself and kin that would have been difficult to unravel otherwise.The book would have benefited from a more focused narration. The themes were apparent but in need of more development, and the differing perspectives resulted in unnecessary confusion from the reader's standpoint. A somewhat haunting novel, Heart Spring Mountain ends up lost in the woods less than halfway through.-Andrew Canfield Denver, Colorado"}, {"userName": "Greg Zimmerman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41665-greg-zimmerman", "userReview": "First appeared at http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.co...Robin MacArthur's slim, elegant short story collection published in 2016 \u2014 Half Wild \u2014 surprised me in how much I liked it. And she pulled off a similar trick with her debut novel, Heart Spring Mountain. The story of three generations of women isn't something I'd normally leap at. But I liked MacArthur's style enough in her short stories (and her environmentalism \u2014 check out this interview in the Chicago Review of Books) enough to give her debut novel a try.I loved it.Like the stories in Half Wild, the setting for this story is rural Vermont \u2014 specifically a hillside where this family has lived for 200 years.Vale is a mid-20s woman who actually doesn't live in her childhood rural Vermont anymore. Instead, she has been living in New Orleans, bartending and stripping to make ends meet. And she's lost her sense of her roots, though she may not quite realize it. She had left Vermont after high school, and hasn't been back in the eight years since after a falling out with her drug-addicted mother, Bonnie.As the novel begins, Bonnie disappears during Tropical Storm Irene. It's late August, 2011, and Vale returns to Vermont, reluctantly, to try to find her. While there, and living in a ratty old camper on the family's property, Vale begins to research her family history, piquing her curiosity more and more as she discovers more, and furthering her sense of who she is now and where she came from.MacArthur writes in short chapters from the perspective of different characters at different times. Vale's grandmother Lena is a fascinating character \u2014 an eccentric, living by herself in a small cabin on the mountain, and owning a pet owl, as well as one big secret that will wind up having a profound affect on Vale.Deb is Vale's aunt who lived on hippie commune for a while in the 1970s, married Vale's uncle Stephen, and now takes care of Vale's grant aunt and Lena's sister Hazel, whose health is failing. Hazel still lives in the house that was built more than 200 years ago. The relation between all the characters is a little confusing for a bit, but once you understand who everyone is and how they're related (I drew myself a little family tree), the story unfolds much more easily.And again, as with MacArthur's short stories, the strength here is her description of place and her evocative, poetic writing. But her style can also be powerful, especially in Vale's case. She carries a depth of emotion that seethes beneath the surface. Something about MacArthur's writing, I just connect with; it's soothing, like the best stress reliever. So even though the pace is a bit deliberate, and not a tremendous amount actually happens, it's a novel I can't stop thinking about and can't recommend more highly if you're like me and love novels in which place is as much a character as the characters themselves."}], "description": "In this evocative first novel, a young woman returns to her rural Vermont hometown in the wake of a devastating storm to search for her missing mother and unravel a powerful family secretIt\u2019s August 2011, and Tropical Storm Irene has just wreaked havoc on Vermont, flooding rivers and destroying homes.
