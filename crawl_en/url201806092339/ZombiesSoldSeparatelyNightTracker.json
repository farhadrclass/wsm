Nyx and the team are sent to investigate a series of murders that give every indication her nightmare is about to become a reality. Number four in the Night Tracker series, Nyx continues to create a roller coaster ride of an adventure. I found Colin, a new tracker and dragon, completely captivating.

It features Nyx Ciar, who is a half human, and half Drow (or elf) princess. She is also a night tracker and private investigator who works alongside her partner Olivia Santos at Paranormal Crimes Private Investigations. Olivia is a spunky former SWAT team member who always wears different T-Shirts that say things like \u201cI Have PMS and a gun. Any Questions?\u201d She SHOULD be the heroine of this series even though sometimes her mouth and anger issues get the best of her and it makes enemies of those she needs to work with. With Olivia, we don\u2019t have to read about her clothes obsession or her family\u2019s wealth all the time. Olivia recently became the only human member of the Night Trackers under Rodan leadership as well as Detective Adam Boyd who is NYC\u2019s liaison to the paranormal council, who at the start of the book, is Nyk's boyfriend who she loves.In a nutshell, Twenty-two years ago, five year old Nyx watched as zombies grabbed her older brother Tristan and disappeared through a portal. The zombies with the help of an evil sorcerer wanted to take over the planet's inhabitants and replace them with his own beings. This caused both the Light and Dark Elves to unite in order to stop the killings of their people. After Tristan was taken, the offensive against the planet ceased.Today, Nyx is still seriously afraid of all things zombies and has been having nightmares about them. She wonders if she were older at the time, could she have saved Tristan from an evil sorcerer that tried to take over her home world. Her father refuses to even speak about what happened, blaming himself for a huge error in judgment when it came to protecting his people from the zombies.Now, they are back once again and threatening Earth\u2019s Otherworld population and have already taken over key individuals in top government as well as public offices. Nyk and her Night Trackers team, including new members Colin, the dragon shifter, and Penrod, a sprite who is the younger brother of Negel the hero from Vampires Not Invited, have to figure out where the zombies are coming from and who is controlling them. These zombies eat people, and are mindless in nature after having their souls sucked from their bodies. Unlike other books in the zombie arena, they are not the whole story and neither is the fight against them. Dislikes: I\u2019ve followed this series from the first book onward and still have problems with Nyk\u2019s obsession with Victoria Secrets panties and the fact that her Persian cat named Kali keeps shredding them constantly. You would think for someone who is supposed to be smart, would find a way to hide them, or lock them in a safe to keep them safe. But, of course that would be totally simplistic in nature and probably actually make the book even better.I also tire of her clothes obsession including her Dolce and Cabana purses and her thousand dollars shoes etc. Ok, we get the feckin point already. You are a princess and your family is as rich as Bill Gates and can afford to have your clothes trashed and go out shopping like each and every day.I\u2019m truly disappointed in the direction that McCray took with Adam and Nyx's relationship. She not only killed it off, but she buried it in such a way that there's no looking back to see if they can ever come together again. Not sure I see the point other than she doesn\u2019t want Nyx to enjoy her off time with a steady boyfriend who she just spent time in Belize with, or maybe it's because she feels she would be better off with someone of her own kind; pararnorm. Of course, the new dragon shifter is a playboy, so, Nyx won\u2019t be alone for long since he's already inserted himself into her life before the death warrant was signed on the relationship with Adam.Good: I liked Desmond the sorcerer who lost everything he ever had, including his own planet to the villain of the story Amory and his people. His actions end up saving the day and now it appears we will see more of him in future books. Good as well: The reunion between Tristan and Nyx was perfectly written, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing except maybe to watch the reunion among father and son. It also appears that we will be seeing him more soon as the sneak peek shows at the end of the book.Next Release: Vampires Dead Ahead (11/29/2011) which appears to once again bring back the Master Vampire Volod who nearly killed Nyk by infecting her with a toxin that kills paranorms."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933015-julie", "userReview": "\"Zombies Sold Separately\" is the fourth book in the Night Trackers series. This series is like crack for me. It has stereotypical characters, stiff dialogue, and other writing quirks that I find annoying (more below), and I yet I keep coming back. When the book opens, Nyx, a half-Drow/half-human Night Tracker, is having bad dreams about a formless evil. Shortly afterward, Nyx and her team are called to the site of a grisly multiple homicide. The bodies have been ripped apart and chewed on by something doesn't possess claws or fangs (yes, she can tell from the bite marks). The scene makes Nyx feel sick. Completely understandable for a normal person, but Nyx, we're told, is a warrior at heart and not a princess; she doesn't feel entitled. Yet she lives on the Upper West Side in New York, wears expensive designer clothes, and is made queasy by blood and gore. Meanwhile two new Trackers are added to the team to replace those who were killed in the last book. The new Trackers include Colin, a Dragon, and Penrod, a Sprite and younger brother of Negel from the previous book. Colin quickly became my favorite character in the book, and I hope we get to see more of him in future books. More murders occur and Nyx finally sees the \"creatures\" that are doing the killing...and she freezes up. Apparently zombies figure prominently in an event from her childhood that is so traumatic she has repressed many of her memories of it . Fortunately, her new teammates - Colin and Penrod - fight off the zombies and save her. Later that night, when Rodan, leader of the Night Trackers in New York and her boss, tries to remove her as team leader, Nyx throws a hissy fit about how he doesn't \"respect\" her and she'll quit Tracking completely if he doesn't let her continue as leader of her team. She also accuses him of letting his feelings (Rodan and Nyx used to date) for her get in the way of his job. Um, no. Nyx is letting her emotions get the better of her and Rodan is making an intelligent decision. She is still fuming the next day - \"what mattered was that he had tried to take [her] off the case entirely...that he had actually doubted [her].\" Yeah, because she completely froze and had to have her team rescue her. Wonder why Rodan wasn't completely sure she could handle the situation? Nyx spills the beans to her PI partner, Olivia, about the traumatic childhood event. Zombies had attempted to invade the Drow Otherworld when Nyx was five years old. One night, she witnessed her beloved older brother and a zombie disappear through a strange portal. No blood, no gore, no violence, yet this greatly scarred her emotionally. Nyx goes home to the Drow Otherworld to visit her parents and gets her father, the King of Drow, to tell her all about how the Drow battled against the zombie invasion. He also gives her a stone that was recovered from one of the zombies. From there Nyx returns to New York, and with the help of her new team members, Rodan, and an exiled Sorcerer, she finds a way to stop the zombie invasion for good. There's also a romantic subplot involving Nyx's relationship with Detective Adam Boyd and Colin; this subplot does interrupt the action a few times, including a long sequence in the middle of the book, where Nyx meets Adam's family. Still, I like Colin enough that I'm glad he got more page time. There are the obligatory amethyst/purple jokes (yeah, yeah, it's an old stale running joke at this point) and juvenile bickering amongst the Trackers that is, I think, supposed to be funny...if you were twelve. This book is written from Nyx's POV, and the author also seems to have bought stock in the word \"my\". For example, \"I grabbed one of my long dress coats from my closet\" instead of \"I grabbed a long dress coat from the closet\". This is one of numerous numerous examples where I wish an editor had exercised her red pencil. And some of the dialogue? Stiff as a board. If you can overlook the writing, the action is good and Colin rocks. The next book in the series is \"Vampires Dead Ahead\" and is slated to be released on November 29, 2011."}, {"userName": "Jessica (a GREAT read)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3549629-jessica-a-great-read", "userReview": "Cheyenne McCray's Zombies Sold Separately was absolutely the COOLEST Night Tracker Novel ever!! I've been excited about it ever since I heard the title, since as we all know from book 1, that Nyx HATES Zombies! So a book with her facing her most hated Paranorm how can it not be cool?!There's even a new duo of characters being added to Nyx's team! There's never a shortage of great characters in these novels, which is another thing I love about them. We now have Penrod, a member of the fae and Colin, a genuine dragon! I loved Colin's sense of humor! He was funny and witty and yet he could be serious when the situation calls for it! That's my kind of character!This case is probably one of the most toughest ones Nyx has ever had to deal with. Zombies, hello! But we've never really understood why she hated them so much. It was just a given, like in her glossary that's in the front of the book. Except now, we finally get to know what caused Nyx to have the strongest dislike of these Paranorms than all others. And it was pretty shocking.There are other shocks along the way as well. Nyx has a lot on her plate this time around. Not to mention that people and Paranorms are going missing for a time and then returning. Something isn't quite right about them either and when members of Nyx's team start to go missing, she has to take serious action.The book was well paced with action and Nyx trying to live out a semi-normal life with Adam, as normal as things can be that is. Truly there wasn't any slow moments in my opinion. It was just moving from one problem to another. There were even a few short chapters that were told from the bad guy's p.o.v., which became obvious in his first chapter. Although there it was third person p.o.v. so that we could distinguish that it was no longer Nyx telling the story. It did throw me off for a split second, until my brain computed the switch in \"person\". Nyx always uses first person and I can switch back and forth so easily it just threw me momentarily! The ending was shocking too! I mean after some of the events I can kind of figured something like that was going to happen, but it was still a nice surprise. And there was really only 1 tiny loose-end that didn't get tied up and I'm not sure if it's something we're supposed to remember or not, or if it's just something that resolved itself off scene...oh well! It wasn't too important, so don't stress about trying to find it!Overall rating 5/5 stars, so can't wait to read Vampires Dead Ahead later this year. There was a sneak peek at the end of Zombies Sold Separately, but I always try NOT to read those, because they become torturous! It's like trying to have one tiny taste of cookie dough and then stopping. It's just not humanly possible! :)"}, {"userName": "BarbaraH", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45845076-barbarah", "userReview": "Haven't read a paranormal in awhile So Glad I picked this that has been sitting on my TBR self gathering dustThrilling story with many different kinds of paranormal fighting the takeover of the world by zombiesIf you like this kind of book it is a must!"}, {"userName": "Ann Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4956715-ann-lee", "userReview": "Courtesy of Romance JunkiesNyx hates zombies.

After witnessing her brother\u2019s death, she can\u2019t have any dealings with them in any shape or form. When a series of suspicious murders start turning up in New York that point to vampires, Nyx and her team of Trackers believe that another, more devious force may be behind it. As Nyx delves deeper into the investigation, her personal life and demons start to interfere. She finds herself learning that the people she should trust are the ones she least expects and the ones she thought she could trust were the ones she never knew at all.ZOMBIES SOLD SEPARATELY is the latest book in Ms. McCray\u2019s NIGHT TRACKER series. Nyx starts out in a happy place but it quickly comes to a grinding halt when her latest case involves zombies. However, instead of running away, she faces her fear head on with guns blazing. I admire her tenacity and her willingness to forge ahead no matter how much personal pain she is experiencing. Her personal life suffers several hits but she also receives an unexpected gift that even in her wildest dreams she would never had expected. I\u2019m already curious to see what VAMPIRES DEAD AHEAD will bring because Nyx never fails to surprise me and I\u2019ve come to expect nothing less from Ms. McCray\u2019s urban fantasies."}, {"userName": "~Vixhen~", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3387478-vixhen", "userReview": "This time Nyx, the badass half human/half Drow, blue-haired purple skinned (once she shifts) night tracker, is battling Zombies. They are led by a demonic sorcerer, Lord Armory, who wants to take over Earth by stealing the essence (aka souls) of the humans and replacing them with souls of his disciples. Nyx and her unit, which include new trackers, the yummy Colin, a dragon shifter, and Penrod, a sprite and younger brother of Negel, from the last book, are taken by surprise when high powered influential locals as well as some paranorms start to disappear. When someone very close to Nyx ends up on the missing list, she enlists the help of Desmond, another sorcerer whose powers were stolen by Armory, to help her. Things also get a little emotional between Nyx and Adam, her human detective boyfriend. I can't say I was happy about what went down between these two at first, but by the end of this book I was ecstatic! This book was really good, and I'm not a fan of zombies. This story had a lot of twists and turns, and edge of your seat suspense. We get to see Nyx visit her parents and find out why she totally hates, hates zombies. I was happy to find out that Vampires Dead Ahead will be the fifth book out later this year. The teaser at the end of this book gives us a very interesting scene between Rodan and Nyx. I still have hope for those two. There is definitely some serious chemistry there. Not to mention Colin...

I found Nyx humorous and enjoyable. Now all of the characters are established, and they are not really progressing in any way I care about. Nyx has typical relationship issues and concerns and I found myself skipping over the lovey interactions between her and her man. There is nothing there I care about reading. Some may enjoy the banter between main characters that are in a relationship, but to me it's a bit of a turnoff and is boring. Besides that we have zombies killing people. We have to wait until page 100 for the characters to get that information though we already have it. Page after page of fluff and no progress to find exactly what the zombies are. I bet it has something to do with the only other chapter to be from a random person's point of view. Shocking. This is just too fluffy for me and there is no mystery. I don't care about the zombies and the sorcerer at all, don't really care about any of these people and their normal mostly boring lives. To keep a UF series going you need something new and fresh, extremely likable characters that experience life changing events, not just the same boring people solving some new boring mystery in their town."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3864002-stacy", "userReview": "Reviewed by http://urbanfantasyinvestigations.blo...Nyx is back in ZOMBIES SOLD SEPARATELY and is still landing herself in rough situations. We find out that Nyx had a horrible childhood experience that she completely blanked her mind of because it was so traumatic. She has to face the fear of the event and help solve the new zombie situation. As usual with the Night Tracker novels we get plenty of action and bad guy drama. Nyx has some issues with her personal relationships as well as some of her team getting into sticky situations as usual. There is also a huge shocker at the end that will definitely add to the series. I enjoyed the pacing and storyline a little better in ZOMBIES SOLD SEPARATELY then I did with the previous book in the series VAMPIRES NOT INVITED. I'm excited about the addition of a new dragon character Colin and cant wait to see where Cheyenne takes him and Nyx.

First and foremost, there was actual character development. Not a great amount, but still progress. Second, This book wasn't completely Nyx-centric. Although Olivia still had a minor role, it was reasonably explained. Plus, new fun characters with great potential have emerged. Finally, Nyx wasn't as extreme flip-floppy and overly emotional as she came across in book 3. The only con I will say is that each book has involved a greater and greater threat to paranormal society, and now this book involved a threat to the entire world - both paranorm and norm. I think this was the problem in book 3. Because when a character is racing against the clock to save the world, they really don't have time to develop. Plus, timing-wise in this series, each of these catastrophes happen in a relatively short time. So, it seems to me the series should step back a bit from world-wide genocide, give Nyx some time to breathe a bit, and maybe delve a bit more into character development. I'd definitely like to see some more on the backgrounds of some of these intriguing paranormals."}, {"userName": "Blow Pop", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1410521-blow-pop", "userReview": "Content warnings: insinuations of rape, death, violenceI actually really kind of liked this one.
