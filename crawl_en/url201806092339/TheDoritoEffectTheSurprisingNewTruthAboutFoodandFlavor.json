The pleasure provided by food, which we experience as flavor, is so powerful that only the most strong-willed among us can resist it.In nature, there is an intimate connection between flavor and nutrition.Synthetic flavor technology not only breaks that connection, it also confounds it.We\u2019ve been so busy trying to squeeze more food out of fewer resources, that we lost sight of the fact that food should be flavourful and nutritious\u2014think of tomatoes, carrots, and chicken purchased in the grocery store. All of them are pretty tasteless. The vegetables are woody and unpleasant. The chicken requires brining, marinating or saucing in order to render it edible.A hundred years ago, a typical tomato plant was twelve feet tall and carried four or five ripe tomatoes at any one time, with a few green babies still weeks away\u2026.A tomato plant now tops out at six feet and carries as many as ten ripe tomatoes at once. That\u2019s too many\u2026.It doesn\u2019t have enough leaves to power all that fruit, so it undergoes the plant equivalent of a brown-out. Like a frantic parent, the plant fills its fruit with the only thing it can: water. And the tomatoes taste like what they\u2019re filled with.Animals and people eat what they need because it tastes good. Experiments done with sheep and goats reveal that plants taste better to the animals when they need the specific nutrients that the plants provide. I remember our farm days, when the first garden lettuce was a matter of celebration, inducting us into a summer of fresh produce after a winter of more limited menu.Now, we have a whole industry that has learned to mimic the flavours of nutritious food. When we eat it, our systems are fooled into thinking that we are getting nutrition when all we are getting is calories. Since we need the vitamins and minerals, our bodies drive us to eat more of the same food in search of those necessities. (Have you ever found yourself obsessively eating cookies or Doritos or some other processed food, seemingly unable to stop? This is what\u2019s going on!) We can\u2019t reach satiation, because we haven\u2019t met our requirements for vitamins, minerals and fibre. The food problem is a flavor problem. For half a century, we\u2019ve been making the stuff people should eat\u2014fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unprocessed meats\u2014incrementally less delicious. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been making the food people shouldn\u2019t eat\u2014chips, fast food, soft drinks, crackers\u2014taste ever more exciting. The result is exactly what you would expect.This has been a very motivating read\u2014time to remove even more processed foods from my diet and search for fruits, vegetables, and meats that really taste like they\u2019re supposed to, like those I remember eating while growing up on the farm."}, {"userName": "Chrisl", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl", "userReview": "The kind of research that fascinates me.

The real shame, aside from the deleterious effects of dieting culture, is that just about every dieting fad ignores the biochemistry that doesn\u2019t jive with its doctrines. Atkins will make you lose weight, but it will place you in a state of ketosis so that when you switch back to a diet containing carbohydrates, you\u2019ll gain everything you lost. Chia seeds and coconut water for breakfast won\u2019t stave off diabetes if you follow it up with a greasy burger and fries from your favorite chain. There\u2019s no quick fix that everyone is searching for, but it can be a real pain to have to wrap your head around esoteric science. So, it is endlessly refreshing to listen to an audiobook that lambasts dieting culture, suggests a tragically ignored component of eating, and makes its claims based on underlying physiology. Oh, and Mark Schatzker is both funny and entertaining, which keeps this from being a scientific tomb that would scare off readers.In the days before I took up studying medicine, I did an undergraduate degree in Nutritional Biochemistry. Metabolism pathways, macronutrient use, caloric requirements, nutrient-dense foods, essential amino acids, fats, I took it all in over four years. So I can understand how it is to the dieting industry\u2019s advantage toshrug off pesky science that the lay population will \u201cnever understand.\u201d But here\u2019s the genius of Mark Schatzker\u2019s book, The Dorito Effect: he explains the fundamentals of biochemistry with such elegance that worries of jargon will be assuaged. Schatzker explains science as a journalist who did his research: sometimes it is simplified, but he rarely slips up. What\u2019s more, Schatzker comes through with his theory, the eponymous Dorito Effect that is a great overview of a budding field of research in the nutrition community. Roughly, we need to stop taking aim at fats, carbohydrates, and proteins and messing with their balance. Instead, we\u2019ve been ignoring a crucial part of overeating: flavor. I imagine that many readers will be shocked by what lies between these pages: a food industry that can apply \u201cnatural\u201d to a compound that replaces cinnamon with a pine cone-extract, and foods diluted in flavor by the need to be produced at an industrial level. Schatzker\u2019s tour through the food industry is also an evaluation of taste, and why flavor is important. Though I was impressed with the ease with which the author explains the science, it was more of a refresher for me than new discovery. With the second half, Schatzker dives in to the reasons for the development of flavor: why it was important for our ancestors to be able to identify food by flavour instead of eating indistinguishable leaves. Flavour dilution was also a concept with which I was unfamiliar but made intuitive sense when it was explained. So what keeps this from the full five stars? Well, for a book that relies so heavily on science, some of the book\u2019s ending conclusions are more extrapolation that hard scientific fact. This can be slightly forgiven for the relative infancy of the field of flavor research. It may well be that changing to natural flavour (read: real natural flavor) may help to remedy the obesity epidemic, and it is a novel route to solving the problem, but it is unsubstantiated by a randomized controlled trial. This book satisfied me as both a foodie and a former nutrition major. What\u2019s more, I think that this book presents a real possible solution to the state of eating in the Western world: it isn\u2019t simple, and it requires work, but it is also sustainable and more gastronomically satisfying. It is also a lot of fun to listen to, and I\u2019m sure that it would be just as compelling a read (that way you could skip over the endless chemical names, which the narrator reads in the audiobook edition). This is a nutrition book for those tired of nutrition books, and I highly recommend anyone with any interest to give it a read! [Review of Audiobook]"}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay", "userReview": "I\u2019d give this book 3-1/2 stars if I could, as I found it interesting, on the whole, but I frequently had second thoughts or reservations concerning the author\u2019s claims. Disclaimer: I listened to this book, rather than read it, so my recollection of the material may be less than perfect. The Dorito Effect has a snazzy title, breezy style, and is pitched at wide audience, all of which I think are commendable. However, I do think the author exhibits a tendency to stand on a soapbox proclaiming the book\u2019s basic premise, which is that nutrition and flavor have parted ways in modern food production. A new industry, which produces those lost flavors artificially, has stepped in and flavor has been added back to processed foods \u2013 but, alas, not nutrition. Our bodies, seeking nutrition, are never satisfied, and we consume more and more in a forlorn quest for what we need but aren\u2019t getting. An obesity and health epidemic results. You might say that Schatzker has a dog in the modern food fights, and that dog is flavor. However, I think he has oversimplified the issue, which is more complex than merely a degradation of food and soulless schilling of faux flavor. I\u2019m an obese person who eats remarkably little junk food \u2013 and, in fact, back when I was a heavyset child living on farms eating quite healthy and flavorful food, I was keenly aware that there seemed to be something odd going on, something which seemed almost beyond my control. I realized that to achieve a \u201cnormal\u201d weight I needed to eat less than others, get more exercise, and be forever vigilant, or the weight would come right back on. This was in the 1950\u2019s, in an age when McDonald\u2019s and Doritos and the like were not yet the nutritional norm. There were fewer fat people, but there were ones, nonetheless. Thus, I\u2019m always skeptical when someone claims that the rise of obesity is linked to\u2026 well, any one factor. I don\u2019t think that Schatzker does that here, but I am suspicious of his claims that we eat more because we are unsuccessfully seeking lost nutrients and driven by a constant barrage of artificial flavor goading us to eat more, more, MORE. I think, rather, that the sad fact is that there are multiple factors behind obesity and any one approach \u2013 eating \u201creal\u201d food, for example, or seeking out \u201creal\u201d flavors, which Schatzker advocates \u2013 will not suffice to tackle the problem. What of our sedentary lifestyle, tendency to drive where we once walked, the decline of home cooking and simultaneous rise of fast food, the overconsumption of sugar (still, after all these years, just sugar sans much in the way of flavor additives, but added to nearly everything), modern-day pressures holding to an impossible standard of beauty (resulting, perversely, in frustrated and guilty binge eating), the tendency of children to play with electronic gadgets indoors rather than blow off steam running around (in my generation's case, largely unsupervised) outdoors not to mention that their parents are far more likely to be binge-watching Netflix or pro football rather than going out bowling or dancing, the effects of a 24/7 non-stop media food image advertising blitz, and, perhaps most importantly, the huge government subsidies for corn, wheat, and soy farmers but absolutely NO subsidies for any other type of arguably healthier farming? Thus, a poor family can afford to eat little other than Doritos and other foods which are, regardless of their mind-numbing variety, basically all one form or another of corn (including, of course, the ubiquitous corn syrup), wheat, or soy. Sure, there are legumes, rice, and other foods on the grocery shelves, but they almost universally require more time to prepare and, just as importantly, more knowledge.The Dorito Effect, however, makes no mention of this appalling state-sanctioned nutritional malfeasance. It lays the blame squarely at the doorstep of the flavor/nutrition divide. While I\u2019m sure that Schatzker is correct in saying that modern produce and livestock are less flavorful -- and who, really, does not already know this? \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is as great a benefit to be found in a dogged search for the best flavor as he claims. This pursuit struck me as a sort of perverse elitism: it requires time, knowledge (again), money, and an educated palate. I belong to a CSA (community-supported agriculture service), yet in honesty, I am not all that hung up on which variety of tomato (and I receive at least a dozen) that I receive in each week\u2019s CSA box. Schatzker, on the other hand, devotes a substantial section of his book to describing a banquet he has a noted chef prepare using what he (Schatzker) has decreed is the ultimate tomato, strawberry, chicken, lettuce, and so on. I could not help but think, \u201cOh, here we go again: a STUNT book!\u201d (And by that I mean, the central episode relies on some novelty, like the purported Year with No Sugar, or some other attention-grabbing stunt.) In short, I was not terribly impressed by Schatzker\u2019s almost religious quest to find \u201cthe best\u201d flavor.I was also somewhat bemused by his attention to, indeed, devotion to, certain plant and animal breeders. He seemed to regard them with a certain reverence, but I\u2019d say in doing so he missed a very important point, one that was brought home to me recently watching an episode of \u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d about the pioneering chef Dan Barber. Barber and his colleagues work tirelessly to produce flavorful produce and livestock, but they do it not so much by selective breeding but by tirelessly working on soil management and improvement, close attention to crop rotation, and above all, eating seasonally. It is, in other words, a practice suited more to small-scale operations and the well-heeled clients of Barber\u2019s restaurants. However, Barber does have a broader mission to bring these practices into the mainstream, and I assume he writes of these in his recent book, The Third Plate, which I hope to read soon. But getting back to The Dorito Effect, suffice it to say that I was somewhat disappointed that the author gave so little shrift to sustainable farm practices, the imbalancing effect of government subsidies, and ways to incorporate truly nutritional food in a practical and affordable way into the national diet. Having said all that, here\u2019s what I liked unreservedly about the book: I loved the geeky parts. Yes, especially when it involved plant-insect communication, the dissection of modern farm practices (fattening of cattle, breeding of monster chickens, and feeding of pigs), what plants goats would or would not eat, Schatzker\u2019s forays into various flavor labs, gas chromatography, and all the multisyllabic splendor of compounds that are the essences of vanilla, chocolate, and many other treasured flavors. Those parts of the book, I well realize, may have been off-putting to some readers, but I personally enjoyed them. Schatzker also cites the seminal book on this subject, The Ominivore\u2019s Dilemma, and makes an earnest attempt to move Pollan\u2019s thesis on a bit, though I\u2019m not sure he succeeds. The last section of the book parrots Pollan\u2019s \u201cFood Rules\u201d without its effectiveness, but still it is an honest effort to point the reader in the right direction. And I practically cheered when Schatzker pointed out the folly of trying to eat \u201corganically\u201d \u2013 for it has been far too long that \u201corganic\u201d foods occupied pride of place in the healthy eating stakes, when in fact there is practically no regulation or research to support such claims. In the final analysis, I must say that any book that engages us in a consideration of modern food, the food industry, and the national health epidemics that plague us is one that should receive attention and consideration. Although I\u2019ve made many criticisms here, The Dorito Effect is an honest, personal, and approachable book, and it engaged me in a significant way and really made me think."}, {"userName": "Rob Haug", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7450820-rob-haug", "userReview": "Consider this a sceptic's review. Anyone who knows me, knows this is not an (audio)book I would normally grab. I already know I eat poorly. I didn't want to hear Big Agri and Big Food bashed, and I certainly didn't want to hear what a sad individual I am. I'm more surprised than anyone at my five star review. I think it was the cover that originally grabbed my attention. I also think this is the rare occasion that the audiobook may be preferable to the actual book.Loaded with terms like \"nuritional wisdom\", \"plant secondary compound\", \"psychobiologist\", \"emotional deception \", and \"oxidative stress\", this could have been another mind numbing pseudo-scientific diatribe about how big food is killing us. There is certainly some of that in here. But, what was surprising is that the author clearly sees most of our food habits as stemming from the best of intentions. At one point he even says that a billion people would have starved without the efforts of Big Food. He doesn't excuse what they have done, so much as suggest new things that could be done to continue to feed our world with healthier, tastier food.I found myself smiling and laughing throughout at many of his phrases and descriptions. For example: \"It's legs are so short and plump that chickens, which were once agile goose steppers, now waddle, and it's breasts are so broad and thick that modern chickens don't quite stand up straight. Today's raw chicken is the porn star of the meat world, sensationally curvy and expertly denuded.\"Or this brief introduction: \"It all began with the mysterious case of the delicious urine.\"Even this: \"Thus demonstrating a correlation between nutritional idiocy and economic idiocy\", after people measurably received more pleasure from a wine when told it was more expensive.I don't know that I would describe this book as groundbreaking, but it was probably more entertaining than it had a right to be.If nothing else, it certainly got me to think a little more about what I eat and how I might change that."}, {"userName": "David Dinaburg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg", "userReview": "I was upset\u2014outraged, actually. I felt disgusted, hurt, disrespected, pissed off, alarmed, baffled, depressed, and bewildered that industry doesn\u2019t care about real flavor. This surplus of verbiage happens a few other times in The Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth About Food and Flavor; this just happens to be the final one in the book, not special or more egregious than the others. To excerpt more than one would run counter to the complaint that a tedious pile of synonyms is unnecessary; it doesn\u2019t add emphasis and it isn\u2019t clever unless you\u2019re writing a title for a children\u2019s book. It is, however, a bellwether for the type of writing that abounds within the pages. Even the titling was an irritant; the marketplace is flush with overzealous, unsupported shock  subtitles. The Dorito Effect is surprising only in its lack of depth, new only in anecdote and supposition, and replete with truth only if you are incredibly cavalier with definitions.As the Monarch butterfly\u2019s regal coloring serves to warn birds they aren\u2019t going to like what they eat, this book\u2019s cover had one more signal that something unpleasant lurks inside; One of the back-quote blurbs is written by renowned anti-science physician Dr. Andrew Weil, whose most flattering description is \u201cfar more subtl[e] than the ham-handed Dr. Oz.\" A more-subtle Dr. Oz is still\u2026Dr. Oz\u2026but the book does make some compelling arguments and pull a few salient points, even if the narrative tone tends to err on the unpleasant side of casual flippancy:Food is complicated. And when a species that delights in one-word answers faces a problem as complex but crucial as food, the result is not surprising: a decades-long kangaroo court in which we keep putting the latest evil nutrient on trial. The truth is, it would all be so much simpler if it really were just sugar\u2019s fault. Yes, food is complicated. And so is people\u2019s relationship with food. The  European Food Information Council conducted a study into food choice; among the six determinants, biological determinants such as hunger, appetite and taste were but one. Under economic determinants there were cost, income, and availability; under physical determinants access, education, preparatory skills such as cooking, and available time\u2014for both shopping, nutritional research, and cooking all played a part; culture, family, peers, and meal patterns all fall under social determinants; mood, stress, and guilt were investigated under psychological determinants. The Dorito Effect exists in a vacuum, eschewing all determinants except for a single biological drive\u2014taste. The argument for taste is propped up mostly by animal studies, which take up at least a third of the text; overreaching statements like, \u201cFlavor all comes down to one thing: feelings. Animals desire particular foods\u201d abound, which is all well and good if biological determinants were the sole cause of human consumption as in most of the animal studies referenced. But The Dorito Effect doesn\u2019t even pay lip service to the dozen or so obvious issues surrounding a McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal: wrapped in a colorful box, it also contains a toy and has been used by millions of families as an affordable reward for their children for earning high marks in school or as an incentive for waking up for 5am for swim practice. In an outdoor pool. In April. In Upstate New York. (Okay, that one may have been specific to me). Nor does the book ever acknowledge the association that a Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s pizza party\u2014where anthropomorphic animatronic creatures sing to a boy or girl while he or she gets all the attention, all the praise, and presents!\u2014might bind the joy of feeling special with the smell of melted cheese and baked pepperoni. Or the rush of processed sugar and blue-raspberry flavoring from the lollipop he or she earned from acting brave before getting a shot at the doctor\u2019s office might create a strong desire for a sugar rush before potentially scary situations later in life. Or, perhaps, intense feeling of safety and love the first bite into a silver dollar pancake unleashes\u2014a home-sick-from-school-breakfast-in-bed-only taste\u2014might bring back, a contemporary suburban American version of Proust and his madeleine. These are but a scant few examples of how culture and society have wrapped themselves around our diets; there is so much more to human nutrition and craving-consumption variance than, \u201cWhat nutrients do we lack so we know what to eat?\u201d Even the counter-examples listed have focused solely on psychological determinants; a comprehensive list of hypothetical human determinants for diet would be, well, a European Food Information Council study, not a book review. \u201cAnimals eat what they need because what they need tastes good [to them]\u201d is the exact type of reductionist argument that the opening section The Dorito Effect purports to rail against\u2014it is \u201csugar is to blame\u201d wrapped in a shiny new box. As if it were not enough to completely gloss over the entirety of human emotional and mental connection to eating\u2014removing a vast history of culturalization and ritualization that food has undergone over millennia\u2014and reducing humanity to animalistic consumption of nutrients\u2014which, if you swap \u201ccalories\u201d for \u201cnutrients\u201d is an argument the author himself undercuts\u2014there is absolutely no mention of the socioeconomic burdens of nutrition. In fact, there is elitism and shaming, written in a smug tone that is simply unenjoyable to read: Speaking of deliciousness, if humans really are calorie zombies, then shouldn\u2019t Big Macs, ice cream bars, soft drinks, and the caramel fountain at Golden Corral be the very pinnacle of culinary gratification? And rich people should all be fat because, as the calorie zombies with the biggest wallets, they can afford the most calories. (Statistically, they are skinnier.) The restaurants that serve the most expensive and, one presumes, the most pleasurable food are not filled with extraordinarily obese clientele in the throes of epic food binges. Fine restaurants feature trim diners, a good deal of whom do not seem to be in it just for the calories. They order small pieces of raw oily fish that, it just so happens, feature brain-healthy omega-3s. They relish just-picked asparagus, say, or saut\u00e9ed langoustine next to pearly drops of emulsified oyster sprinkled with crumbled seaweed. As they eat these expensive small portions, they do not sit there silently fending off cravings for stuffed-crust pizza and bottomless Dr Pepper. Given the choice between oily raw fish and stuffed-crust pizza, a striking percentage would opt for the fish. The line cooks in fine restaurants\u2014men and women who have devoted themselves to the pursuit of gustatory joy\u2014have unfettered access to food in the top 1 percent of delectability, and yet, strangely, they keep their consumption in check. If it\u2019s corpulence you want, you won\u2019t find much of it at a restaurant with a three-month wait for reservations. You will find it at Denny\u2019s. Ignoring the fact that langoustines are garbage-eating ocean bugs that were only the purview of the poor two-hundred years ago and have been  rebranded as a delicacy by the very industry that \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about real flavor,\u201d the author discusses two times where he himself opts for the maligned \u201cpinnacle of human cuisine\u201d:I find myself continuing to consume certain foods even though I am no longer hungry. It happened again at a McDonald\u2019s in northern Vermont, where, on a family road trip, we pulled off the highway and I ordered a Big Mac, Coke, and medium fries, and downed all 1,120 calories in maybe three minutes. I wanted more. He went went to fast-food restaurant with his family on a road trip because it was convenient and he has young children; standard to the point of being clich\u00e9d. This could have been the opportunity for the book to discuss the social reasons why McDonald\u2019s might be relevant to our culture\u2014hungry children, financial concerns, travel-based ignorance of local cuisine, ease of access\u2014and instead he chooses to write a personal anecdote to how he ordered another burger and then, looking at all the overweight people in the McDonald\u2019s, threw it away in disgust after eating only half. The very essence of an insubstantial story, the written equivalent of \u201cempty calories.\u201d The next anecdote has enough similarity to the first that and a writer who less interested supporting his pre-established theory may have contrasted the two and unearthed some interesting questions:Forty-five minutes earlier, I had pulled off the interstate in Palo Alto to satisfy the need state of extreme hunger. I pulled in to a strip mall and grabbed a slice of pizza, a standard North American corruption of too much crust and industrial mozzarella. It tasted good going down, but the megaload of carb and fat induced negative post-ingestive feedback and I pulled back onto I-101 feeling bloated, exhausted, and mentally fogged.The 101 can be a food desert\u2014why not make mention that access is a crucial aspect of diet, much like in the McDonald\u2019s story? The author was on a trip in a car and couldn\u2019t find any other food; a pattern is emerging around the convenience of being able to feed yourself when you\u2019re away from home. Yet failing to plan how to eat isn\u2019t a failure of \u201cthe flavor industry;\u201d it is an endemic issue of a society that is always in motion, or a symptom of a lack of time in the traveler\u2014to research healthy options, to pack a lunch\u2014or a physical restriction because there simply isn\u2019t enough of a demand right off the highway to support anything other than pizzarias. The Denny\u2019s jibe\u2014\u201cyou will find [corpulence] at Denny\u2019s\u201d\u2014further underscores that it is not ignorance of the socioeconomic impact on diet and nutrition at work in The Dorito Effect, but an active contempt:Because what the heirloom [tomato] has also proved is that extraordinarily flavorful ingredients are expensive. The reason, alas, is yield. Even if every one of us from the lower middle class right on up to the 1 percent spent more on food to pay for those heirloom tomatoes, strawberries, corn, wheat, and chickens that cost $30\u2014a never-gonna-happen if\u2014we still wouldn\u2019t have heirloom flavor in the quantity we need. There isn\u2019t enough land.The colloquial \u201cnever-gonna-happen\u201d phrasing makes it seem like a folksy choice to be frugal rather than a necessity based on circumstance or mental state or\u2014harkening back to the author\u2019s own car trips\u2014convenience. And the specter of impossibility\u2014that we do not have enough arable land to feed the world\u2014is mentioned more than once:The story of the last fifty to one hundred years of agriculture is the story of massive, world-changing leaps in yield. The explosion in productivity has been so miraculous there\u2019s even a term for it: the green revolution\u2026.What, you might wonder, are plants replacing all those nutrients with? If we\u2019re harvesting millions of pounds of broccoli and that broccoli has less calcium and magnesium in it, what\u2019s taking their place?With nary a hint of foreshadowing or an iota of acknowledgement that these statements will be completely contradicted near the conclusion of the book, it appears obvious what The Dorito Effect thinks about industrial agriculture versus small-scale, heirloom produce. And then, abruptly: Harry Klee has delivered the best news in agriculture since the Chicken of Tomorrow contest: Yield does not have to come at the expense of flavor. The tradeoff between quantity and quality, the two most defining traits in agriculture, is not a zero-sum game. You can have both....Tomatoes didn\u2019t get bland as a direct and unavoidable cost of crop size getting bigger. The got bland because in the race to breed big crops that were disease resistant, hardy, and made it store shelves without getting bruised, flavor just lost. So you can have your cake and eat it too. All of that talk about pricing out the poor and running out of land were scare tactics, meant only to further shine the golden halo of industrial solutionism. That\u2019s simply despicable. To make such a tactic palatable, all that was required was to mention\u2014during the fearmongering scenes\u2014that there may be a solution already in the works. But rather than add an honest clarity to a sincere concern, The Dorito Effect spends its time lingering over its cake\u2014making the reader think that only smaller portions of \u201creal\u201d food can save the planet\u2014until, voila, you can have industrial agriculture after all!Then comes the eating of the cake\u2014literally. The entire final chapter is self-indulgent at best and a filler to meet page-limit obligations at worst. Ten percent of an already sparse book is spent listing the preparatory steps of the author\u2019s attempt to personally put together a dinner party celebrating \u201creal flavor.\u201d This involves shipping produce, sending invitations to the professionals that he had interviewed for the book, and ruminating on how sustained one feels after such a feast. It was the closest The Dorito Effect ever got to discussing human consumption of food as a culture-based ritual\u2014rather than a simplified rubric of required-nutrient intake\u2014so it is no surprise that the participants claimed to walk away from the invigorating social event feeling more satisfied. A question lingers, however; given the hypothesis that things taste good to people to signify to their bodies that the food they are eating contains nutrients they need, how is it that a dozen or so highly distinguished professionals from all over the country\u2014with regional, cultural, and general differences in diet that likely precludes being identically, or even similarly, low in identical nutrients\u2014would all be sated to the same extreme after eating an identical meal? Food is complicated. The truth is, it would all be so much simpler if it really were just flavor\u2019s fault."}, {"userName": "KatieMc", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc", "userReview": "Opps. Library book got returned before I could write a review and my bookmarks are lost so I don't have all my bookmarked notes. Review from memory.The Dorito Effect is an interesting take on food, nutrition and our love of eating things we shouldn't. The premise that fresh food has been engineered for maximum yield and flavor has been lost. No controversy there, we all know that those beautiful unblemished red tomatoes tastes like cardboard. As a result, we add flavors, like that addictive cheesy stuff on Cheetos. Historically flavor meant nutrition and our inclination seek variety of flavors is beneficial because it led to balanced nutrition. However, vitamin supplements and flavored foods confuse this flavor/nutrition association. The good news is that technology got us into this mess, and the author things that technology get us out of this mess. Audiobook gripe - don't refer to the book as an audiobook!

We start off with a history of Weight Watchers, then move into how flavor and the birth of Doritos change what humans like to eat and the tastes that go with it.

Sure, they were fine IN things, like soups and chilis where they weren\u2019t being relied upon for their flavor, but the idea of a BLT perplexed me. How could anyone find something with nothing but bacon, lettuce, and tomato enticing? It seemed like a good way to ruin perfectly delicious bacon. And then I started a garden, and I grew Rutger heirloom tomatoes in fertile soil that is part of the flood plain downstream from the feed yard on my husband\u2019s farm. They were juicy to the point of bursting, I didn\u2019t pick them until they were perfect, and even before I popped one into my mouth, the simple display of taut skin and bright red already had me entranced. I took them home and washed them. Still burning with the heat of the sun their subtle but sweet smell beckoned me to try one, and so I did two things I\u2019ve never done before: took a giant bite out of a tomato and enjoyed it.This was the beginning of my tomato obsession. If nothing else drew me to the garden the thought of my beautiful tomatoes would. I ate them with nothing but a little feta sprinkled on them, or lightly salt and peppered, I had tried a BLT and then realized that the bacon was getting in the way of my delicious tomatoes. (Note: I know buy bacon from a local coop, its much more naturally flavorful, and I look forward to this summers blts with homegrown lettuce, tomatoes, and coop bread and bacon). I ordered a specialty seed catalog from Baker\u2019s Heirloom Seeds. I have so many tomatoes circled in there that I know I will have to choose, I can\u2019t keep up with farming a whole acre of tomatoes, which is what would happen if I planted everything I\u2019ve picked up.The point is, I\u2019d never had a real tomato. I had just had *store* tomatoes, and those things hardly qualify. They\u2019re picked green and hard as rocks, and as such, don\u2019t get the nutrition and flavor as when they\u2019re grown on the vine. They taste like cardboard, and honestly, have slightly more nutritional effect on the body than cardboard. To demand flavor is to demand nutrition rich foods. Our bodies are crying out for both, but they don\u2019t know where to look because we constantly assault them with flavor grown in labs that is nutritionally deficient. We can reclaim the flavor of our fruits, vegetables, and meats just like we finally did with beer and wine and liquor, and we should, because honestly its an investment in health. We need to let corporations and farmers and supermarkets know that this IS what we want. We need to demand that they work on flavor and nutritional content, and that we know they can do that without sacrificing yield. I know that I am blessed because I have the money, the time, and the space to have a garden, and that I also have the money to invest in more expensive foods, but we need to demand improvements for all of us. After all, as long as we are on universal healthcare, we really are in this together, not to mention, as I age, I will benefit from a strong, nutritionally-empowered, healthy younger generation.This had been a year of reading about food and deciding the relationship that I want to have with it. Schatzker\u2019s book pairs perfectly with Moss and Pollan, because they all tell a different story. Schatzker tells the story of nutrition through the lens of flavor, our innate biological wisdom and desire that has evolved in us like all animals to be able to tell the good from the bad, and how we can start listening to our bodies again. I\u2019m keeping a food journal now, not to log calories, but to mindful of the effect that the type of calories I just ate had on my body- do I feel energized? Content? Still hungry? Overly full? I have found that a hunger for carbs sits lightly at the top of my stomach, whereas a hunger for fats is a deep gut, gnawing hunger. If I learn to listen to my bodies and cravings, I can give it what it needs, if I also surround myself with healthy options that it can choose from.I will say that I don\u2019t feel that this book was as well written as Pollan or Moss, but that is not to say it was written poorly. Schatzker doesn\u2019t have the years of experience and finesse or the training, but I look forward to seeing him evolve as a writer because the zeal and the talent is there. My real qualm is that he tried to use the big reveal trick too often, lets talk for pages and pages about a thing and THEN tell you what it is so that it has an impact. I kind of hate that in nonfiction books, because then I feel like I need to pause or re-read the pages to reflect on what I was told with the new information. Also, like, never do it more than once a book. Beyond that it was good, and my thing is really just a quibble. The stories he found and told were just as interesting to me as Pollan\u2019s and Moss\u2019s, but I also think they meant more because I had started with the other books and felt like I had a better background in the subject. I would recommend the set though, for sure, I think all of these are great books that every American should read."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "The quest for deliciousness is the fuel that powers the behavior, the god that breathes life into the machine. Animals eat what they need because what they need tastes good.\nWhat a fascinating book is The Dorito Effect: With equal parts accessible science and entertaining detective tale, author Mark Schatzker attempts to answer the questions, \u201cWhy is so much of the human brain devoted to the discernment of flavour, and why, with ever more access to fresh foods and diet schemes are we getting fatter and fatter?\u201d I found the answers to be informative and intriguing.The science behind flavour was so engrossing: Humans are able to distinguish more than a trillion different aromas in addition to the tongue-sensed flavours of sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami, and the little-understood kokumi. Obviously, this much evolutionary devotion to taste must mean something important is involved. Like the author, I had long thought that humans were simply programmed to crave calorie-rich foods, like sugar and fats, but it's really not that simple (or else we'd all be drinking pure sugar water and eating the fat instead of the muscle on our steaks). Demonstrating through experiments that animals from wasps to sheep to humans will unconsciously prefer foods that provide micronutrients that they've been deprived of, Schatzker proves that at the cell level, our bodies understand what it is we need to eat and we seek these foods based on the elemental flavours and scant aromas that we can't possibly be conscious of them possessing. Like some pregnant women who eat clay, it's often the weirdest tasting foods that turn out to be the best for us (like super bitter radicchio or olive oil so pure it burns the throat), and unsurprisingly, the benefits of whole foods cannot be reduced to a multivitamin.So, if our bodies unconsciously know what's good for us, why do we eat all the wrong things? Three breakthroughs occurred in the food industry at the same time in the mid-twentieth century: The mass production of plants and animals (which dilutes the presence of micronutrients, and consequently, flavour); the discovery of artificial flavours in the lab (the addition of which to unnutritious foods \u2013 like vitamin water or sugary yogurts \u2013 fools our bodies into thinking they're getting what they need, and when the body still feels malnourished, we crave more and more of these highly-flavoured yet nutrient-poor foods); and the enrichment of rice and flour and breakfast cereals in North America (which trains the body to crave carbs when vegetables are a much more efficient and complete source of things like niacin and riboflavin). I love learning about unintended consequences \u2013 the irony of so many wonderful breakthroughs that allow us to feed more people while nourishing them less. It was an interesting observation that countries like Italy, France, and Japan \u2013 that enjoy both long lives and vibrant food cultures \u2013 don't enrich their flour or wheat and have adults that eat a huge range of vegetables.I remember someone when I was little (maybe a friend's Dad?) telling me that when he was little, he loved to pluck a red tomato off its vine and eat it like an apple. I have never in my life had a tomato that I would eat plain and that's Schatzker's main point: We have bred the flavour out of our foods (which makes us crave foods with artificial flavours, or at least drench our flavourless tomatoes in ranch dressing) and that should be ringing alarm bells because it means that we've also bred out the nutrition. His investigation culminates in a dinner of heritage ingredients \u2013 grown slowly from pre-industrialised varieties of chicken, greens, vegetables, fruit and chocolate \u2013 which was intensely satisfying for him and the (mostly scientist) guests he had invited. One guest remarked, \u201cIf every portion is small and intensely flavored, then the entire meal stays at the place of greatest enjoyment.\u201d Sounds good to me, and if a person could get a meal like that at an affordable price...And that's the conclusion: There are affordable varieties of full-flavoured and fully-nutritious greens and vegetables available already, but so long as grocery shoppers want quantity for cheap, growers and grocers aren't interested in taking a chance on them; consumers must demand better. I am on board with the conclusion, but even if a barred rock chicken promises to be the most satisfying protein I've ever experienced, am I willing to pay $20 or $30 for one smallish bird at the meat counter?And, by the by, this book isn't a hippy-dippy anti-industrialisation, pro-organic shamefest. When talking about the human love of herbs and spices (which, as it turns out, we've been using for over 6000 years and have recently discovered to have a range of antioxident, cancer fighting, micronutrient benefits), Schatzker says:\nI am not referring to obscure, wincingly bitter herbal remedies from the Amazon sold in stores by people who think fluoride is a conspiracy.\nThe Dorito Effect is absolutely my type of book and I hope it gets wide coverage: This is just too interesting and important to learn and then ignore."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4112781-erin", "userReview": "my opinion: eh....In one line I can sum up the book: \"avoid artificial flavorings in 'food' and eat real, natural, and high quality produce and meat.\" Basically I have summed up every food/paleo/nutrition book written within the last decade with that phrase.

Our bodies naturally crave flavors that the current food isn't providing so we eat more trying to fill the flavor void we're missing. Focusing on mainly chicken and tomatoes, Schatsker does an excellent job tracing how the change in our food happened and the results. There is a complex relationship between flavor and nutrition in food and we have diluted the flavor to increase size and production. Chicken today doesn't taste anything like the chicken of the past. Tomatoes today are mostly water. \"The rise in obesity is the predictable result of the rise in manufactured deliciousness. Everything we add to food just makes us want it more.\" Schatzker points out thatthe big food companies have \"created the snack equivalent of crystal meth and gotten us all hooked.\" Not only is more and more manufactured flavor being added to things, the availability of the food with enhanced flavors is more available.\"The Dorito Effect, very simply, is what happens when food gets blander and flavor technology gets better. This book is about how and why that took place. It's also about the consequences, which include obesity and metabolic disturbance along with a cultural love-hate obsession with food. This book argues that we need to begin understanding food through the same lens by which it is experienced: how it tastes. The food crisis we're spending so much time and money on might be better thought of as a large-scale flavor disorder. Our problem isn't calories and what our bodies do with them. Our problem is that we want to eat the wrong food. The longer we ignore flavor, the longer we are bound to be victims of it. This book is also about the solution. The Dorito Effect can be reversed. That's already happening on small farms and in pioneering science labs.\"Schatzker notes the words to look for on your food that indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your nose and chemicals that fool your tongue. \"The following words indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your nose: natural flavor(s) natural flavoring(s) artificial flavor(s) flavoring, flavor. The following words indicate the presence of chemicals that fool your tongue: monosodium glutamate MSG disodium guanlyate disodium inosinate torula yeast yeast extract hydrolyzed protein autolyzed yeast saccharin (Sweet Twin, Sweet N Low, Necta Sweet) aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal, Sugar Twin) acesulfame potassium (Ace-K, Sunett, Sweet One) sucralose (Splenda) neotame (Newtame) advantame stevia.\"I have been talking about this book the whole time to anyone who will listen.

The world around us shows what happens when chemistry and artificial flavouring outpace knowledge in farming and human health.We obsess over the ultimate spice blend, and make them incredibly complex\u2014but when it comes down to it, we're trying to run from the fact that the food we're trying to eat in the first place is bland. 50 years ago, recipes called for just salt and pepper. Was that because they were culinarily inferior? Hardly. Rather because the food didn't need it. It tasted great on its own. In the past decades, agriculture has been optimizing for yield\u2014and that comes with a cost. Taste was never part of the equation, and as a result flavour has diluted. Livestock are fed homogenous diets to the point they need supplements to survive, and vegetables boast up to 30% less minerals and vitamins than they did decades ago. Tomato taste like cartboard? No problem, dip it in some ranch dressing.What is flavour? It's information about what we're consuming. If you deplete a goat of phosphor and inject it into maple, it'll associate the two. Put it on a phosphourus deficient diet for a while, and then offer them maple as a choice of food and they'll garble it, even if it has no phosphor. All animals are incredibly efficient at eating the right foods to honour their nutritional requirements\u2014when they're callibrated. Now humans are consuming fats, cheap carbohydrates and sugars masked behind the tastes of fresh vegetables, tacos and strawberry when none of the secondary compounds making these healthy in the first place are present in reality. Yet, our brain starts to crave it. It's not craving raw sugar, but flavoured sugar. The miscallibration of our natural flavour talent starts to fade, and we turn into carb-craving calorie zombies. Recallibrating this ability takes a long time, and is why it's so easy to slip into bad habits. The author argue we don't crave the sugar, but the flavour that's added to the sugar. Flavour becomes a piece of information that this is filled with secondary compounds that are good for us. Imagine smelling something bad, or drinking sour milk. Blandness, on the other hand, is a strong signal that something shouldn't be eaten\u2014but when we diguise the blandness through flavouring, our brain's natural system gets turned upside down. We start craving flavoured candies instead of apples and blueberries. Nutritionally rich foods satisfy us in a completely different way, causing us to be full in way less calories.\"Cooking is the easy part. The hardest thing about cooking is finding the right ingredients\".The sad thing is, that we haven't figured out how to provide high quality food at scale because we haven't had the need to.

Motivated by profit margins, the food industry has made food bland and as a result, less nutritious. Therefore, we should eat more whole foods and failure to do this leads to obesity, health issues, yadda yadda yadda. It's interesting but for the most part, nothing new for those who pay even the slightest attention to health and wellness.What's really disappointing is that the author\u2014aided by an obnoxious narration of the audiobook\u2014barely acknowledges the role class plays into food consumption and does not hide his disgust of fat people. Schatzker, who tells us he has a \"normal BMI,\" spends chapters blaming the food industry for creating addictive foods and then goes out of his way to tell us about how he lost his appetite at the sight of two obese couples at McDonalds. He details the dedication required to grow heirloom varieties of tomatoes and heritage chickens, both admirable efforts, but rolls his eyes at the public who don't want to pay more than 99 cent for a head of lettuce. We need more stories that address issues in the food system, but they would be better told by more empathetic authors. This is a book that's even too pretentious for me but mostly, it's the lack of humanity that made me lose my appetite."}, {"userName": "Powder River Rose", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22923455-powder-river-rose", "userReview": "Interesting, alarming, well-researched and it kept me absolutely engaged.

The quest for ever greater yield over the last 100 years or so has cost us not just overall quality and variety, but actual nutrition and flavor. Veggies, fruit, dairy and meat actually contains measurably less flavor than they used to. And far less nutrition. The research the author walks us through was fascinating. I can't remember the last time I inhaled a nonfiction book in 1.5 days. (Part of it was due to the fact he spent quite a bit of time in my hometown, following the work of Fred Provenza at USU's Green Canyon Ecology Center. It was strange to read his brief descriptions of landscape and the stores they went into, because this is my turf.)The fact that \"diluted\" flavor, and the resultant flavoring of our food supply (even raw meat! even butter!) is making us fat and unhealthy because our bodies crave nutrients that they aren't eating, so we eat more and more (portion creep) was rather sobering to have laid out. Especially the part where he compared our modern diet to that of livestock: part of the strategy of increased yield from animal food sources is to feed them a lot more carbs than they would eat naturally, and since all those carbs are nutritional- and flavor-diluted, \"palatants\" (artificial flavoring) are required (caramel flavored ground hay, corn and millet, anyone?), which then causes them to eat more than they otherwise would. Livestock grows much faster, and gets slaughtered just about the time it would start to become debilitated by obesity and inflammation-related disease. Humans aren't racing to pack on the pounds before slaughter, but we eat just about the same way. His conclusion is not all that encouraging. It *is* challenging to source truly good food. It costs more, and because it tends to be available only seasonally (not bred for transport, etc), you can only get it for parts of the year. On the other hand, Americans spend a much smaller percentage of income for food than people used to, and we have way more \"discretionary\" income than we think we do. It can be done, but only if choices are made, priorities chosen.I was surprised and impressed that he did not make this about GMOs. Sometimes the chatter against and for GMOs can be so loud we forget about other facets of safe, quality food. Like flavor. And I was also surprised that the discussion of food flavoring did not touch upon sensitivity or allergy. I'm chemically sensitive, and usually avoid artificial color, flavor and preservative (and all other petro-chemical creations, like fragrance and auto fuel, etc), and had read that \"natural flavor\" should be avoided too, but because additives are IN EVERYTHING, whether or not they're labeled, I have been lax about natural flavors. I will be reevaluating that and crafting an eating plan to avoid them more. So interesting. Reminded me a lot of Twinkie, Deconstructed in tone and scope. I'll be reading more from this author."}], "description": "A lively and important argument from an award-winning journalist proving that the key to reversing America's health crisis lies in the overlooked link between nutrition and flavor.In The Dorito Effect, Mark Schatzker shows us how our approach to the nation's number one public health crisis has gotten it wrong. The epidemics of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes are not tied to the overabundance of fat or carbs or any other specific nutrient. Instead, we have been led astray by the growing divide between flavor - the tastes we crave - and the underlying nutrition. Since the late 1940s, we have been slowly leeching flavor out of the food we grow. Those perfectly round, red tomatoes that grace our supermarket aisles today are mostly water, and the big breasted chickens on our dinner plates grow three times faster than they used to, leaving them dry and tasteless. Simultaneously, we have taken great leaps forward in technology, allowing us to produce in the lab the very flavors that are being lost on the farm. Thanks to this largely invisible epidemic, seemingly healthy food is becoming more like junk food: highly craveable but nutritionally empty. We have unknowingly interfered with an ancient chemical language - flavor - that evolved to guide our nutrition, not destroy it.With in-depth historical and scientific research, The Dorito Effect casts the food crisis in a fascinating new light, weaving an enthralling tale of how we got to this point and where we are headed. We've been telling ourselves that our addiction to flavor is the problem, but it is actually the solution. We are on the cusp of a new revolution in agriculture that will allow us to eat healthier and live longer by enjoying flavor the way nature intended.", "title": "The Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth About Food and Flavor", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609354-the-dorito-effect", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430942604l/22609354.jpg", "reviews": 713, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3452291.Mark_Schatzker", "name": "Mark Schatzker"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Food and Drink", "Health", "Science", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609354-the-dorito-effect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28511363-the-dorito-effect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25441309-the-dorito-effect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34110358-the-dorito-effect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7950231-steak", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39404532-steak", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23939189-america-s-wagyu-trail"]}
