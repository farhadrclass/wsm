You look at the title and the concept, and you think, \"Wow, that's a cool idea,\" and you open the book and start reading, and it turns out that the book and idea ARE cool. No disappointment here: this one's a thrilling survival tale set in an apocalyptic Old West, and it's definitely worth the read.Wanted's greatest strength is the main female character, Red. She's a tough, I-can-take-care-of-myself kind of hero, who increasingly attracts misfits and stragglers to her. She's formidable, both in how she handles a gun and how she deals with the traumas of her past. I found her a complex, compelling person whom I could trust to lead me on a rollicking and heart-felt adventure.The other characters of the book were also intriguing. I liked how a family attached itself to Red and Trace, starting with Wen, the sword-wielding sidekick. One particularly effective moment was the stopover where the little girl Rivers and the little boy Fisher joined the group--it put a new twist on the term \"terrible twos.\" Add in Caroline, Wen's love interest, and her father, Ira, and by the end of the book, Red and Trace have quite the community around them. I liked this focus on family, and it seemed wholly appropriate with the world is being eaten away by zombies.The only minor weakness is the lean amount of context. I would have liked to know more about how the zombifying disease spread. We get a few glimpses here and there that seem to hint that the great migration to the West is because the disease hit the East Coast so hard. I think that's a fascinating idea, and would have liked to learn a few more details about that. In addition, I wish I could have gotten to know a little more about Trace's past. He pretty much appears at the beginning of the book, and that's the beginning of our knowledge of him. Some of his back story would have been nice.All in all, however, Wanted: Dead or Undead is a fun, exciting ride that you're sure to enjoy. It should appeal to anyone who loves zombies, westerns, romance, or just a good story told well."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250501-crystal", "userReview": "Can I get a WOOHOO!!!! This book was one of the funnest reads I have read all year!!! Red is not your typical quiet law abiding cowgirl. She is rough, tough, and what every cowboy wishes they were. I fell in love with her character from the start when she walked into a tavern and shot the zombie that no one else managed to take down. I mean come on who wouldn't love her just for that??!! Not to mention her hilarious honesty about making sure you have something to protect yourself even while taking a tinkle (she uses another word here, but I am trying to keep it clean lol). Seriously I love her! Her path crosses with another whom she calls Cowboy and they go on the run together to outrun the plague that has taken over the US. Along the way they meet a few friends and a few foes and one very, very scary woman. I not only loved Red, but I loved Cowboy and her their companions as well! Every character was unique and I am already so invested in every single one of them. Don't be fooled by my simple summary, the story is full of twists and turns that I can promise you you won't see coming at all. I was floored more than once and it was amazing! I really cannot wait for the sequel! There are so many loose ends involving everybody that I am seriously on the edge of my seat!! I will say that westerns typically are not my thing. I usually pass them on by when I choose a new book to read, but I am so glad that I was handed this one. I can't say that I will pick up a western outside of this series anytime soon, but this has definitely changed my view point on them. I loved the setting so much!! Of course the whole zombie thing was really fun too, gruesome and scary but fun none the less lol. Angela thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to read your amazing book!! It was fantastic and you are incredible!"}, {"userName": "Misty Baker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4056115-misty-baker", "userReview": "Dear Lord, When the world finally comes to an end\u2026let it be with zombie! Sincerely \u2013 MeFor those of you that have been following for a while, chances are you know almost everything there is to know about me. 1. I love gummy bears. I think they should be considered a food group and be a required daily dietary need. 2. I have a very hard time keeping my feet still. It\u2019s a curse, the more I think the more they wiggle and at some point I might actually take flight. 3. I love zombies!Now, while number 3 might not shock you all that much, this might. I LOOOOOVE westerns. \u201cWHAT?!\u201d You say. Yep! Though I rarely talk about them and (to date) I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve reviewed a single damn one, I love them! So when Angela Scott emailed me last week and asked if I\u2019d like to give her new Western Zombie book a shot (get it\u2026shot. ha!) I replied with a \u201cHell Yeah! Send Immediately!!\u201dI know what you are thinking. \u201cZombies and Cowboys? That\u2019s almost as bad as Cowboys and Aliens!\u201dFirst off\u2026 Cowboys and Aliens rocks, so back up off it! Second, yes\u2026Zombies and Cowboys baby! Read it and weep people as you are thrown head first into a wildly entertaining mix of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d meets \u201cHell on Wheels.\u201d (<\u2013now that is a spicy meatball!) \u201cTrace Monroe doesn\u2019t believe in luck. He never has. But when a fiery-headed cowgirl saunters through the saloon doors, wielding shotguns and a know-how for killing the living dead, he believes he just may be the luckiest man alive. Trace wants to join Red\u2019s posse, but she prefers to work alone\u2014less messy that way. In order to become her traveling companion, Trace has to agree to her terms: no names, no questions, and if he gets bit, he can\u2019t beg for mercy when she severs his brain stem. He agrees, knowing only that Red is the sharpest shooter he\u2019s ever encountered. The fact she\u2019s stunning hasn\u2019t escaped his attention either. What he doesn\u2019t know, is that Red has a very good reason to be on top of her game. She not only has the answer for how they can all outlive the plague taking over the wild, wild west, she IS the answer.\u201dBefore you get all hoity toity with me and demand that this book sounds more like a love story than a round \u2018em up, shoot \u2018em down western, it\u2019s both. As a matter of fact\u2026despite it somewhat flowery synopsis, (\u201cThe fact she\u2019s stunning hasn\u2019t escaped his attention\u201d) it\u2019s actually kind of gross. (In a totally awesome zombie way.)Don\u2019t believe me? Ok\u2026I\u2019ll prove it. \u201cAt first he didn\u2019t see her. The headless bodies littered the ground like a forest of hewn down trees. Mounds of zombie corpses were splayed in various directions with broken, mangled limbs. Decapitated heads stared upward with wide, milky eyes and jaws that hung from broken pivots in an eternal, silent moan. Thick, soupy blood poured from the necks of the severed bodies, merging into one giant lake of blackened red.\u201dKinda makes you hungry doesn\u2019t it? *wink*The fantastically gruesome descriptions are not what drives this book though, (although man are they fabulous) the mystery behind Red does. It\u2019s not all that hard to peg Red\u2019s personality, she is stubborn and very independent, but regardless of the picture Scott painted (with her deep and captivating character development,) it\u2019s what she DOESN\u2019T tell you that will keep your fingers aching to turn the page. There is something wrong with Red, and as much as we love her\u2026I have a feeling by the time the series is all said and done, we are going to find ourselves on the other side of that fence.What about the plot? Well\u2026it\u2019s zombies for Christ sake so 85% of it is going to be focused on getting away from or killing them, (helloooo machete!) but there is a sub-plot, (a swoon worthy, hell bent on revenge, holy shit that is my brother) sub plot that is going to get very complicated in the next few books. (Several characters were introduced but not explained \u2013 think backgrounds.) And as much as I don\u2019t want to tell you this (cause it\u2019s kind of a spoiler) the book ends with the Zombies still having the upper hand. *rubs palms together in anticipation*So\u2026was it worth all of the excitement that I had going into it? I\u2019m going to go with yes. It was well written, well plotted and VERY entertaining (even the lovey dovey aspects of it!) If you like a good shoot out, and zombies trying to eat your brains for brunch, pick it up\u2026you won\u2019t be sorry."}, {"userName": "Janene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739786-janene", "userReview": "For all the Zombie readin' I've done, I can't recall ever having read a Zombie Western, so was kind of excited to find this one offered on Kindle for free. The book starts out with a minor editing issue on the very first page, and I thought, 'Oh, here we go...' Please, please, please...authors...have your work edited. By several keen eyes! When I see an editing issue, it is usually game-over; I keep reading to find issues...not for the enjoyment of the story.Once I got past the spelling oversight, I dove into this story and really had a difficult time putting it down. There's nothing new or unique zombie-wise going on here, but the author, Angela Scott, is a capable story-teller and creates convincing characters. There were several 'OH NO' and 'Oh, she did not just write that!' moments. The book leaves off, letting you know there is #2 to look forward to. A very quick 300 page book...and yes, I'm looking forward to #2. :)"}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "I received this book as a gift from the author for my review.Wanted: Dead or Undead. I have to admit I started reading this expecting a zombie western with lots of eating and being eaten along with some humor. What I got was so much more.The story starts with a nail-biting scene that leaves you with no choice but to continue reading.Trace is an opportunist, a card shark and a bit of a trickster. All he wants is to stroll through life with no complications. That wasn't hard until the zombies started moving westward.Red is a no-nonsense woman on a mission. Moving west towards California, she is hoping to find her brother. He joined the cavalry to fight the zombies and she hasn't heard from him since.The zombie plague has consumed the larger cities on either coast and is rapidly extending to the midwest.Thrown together by a chance encounter, Trace and Red slowly begin to trust each other. They will have to in order to survive. As they travel westward, their group of two slowly grows along with their attraction to each other. They both have secrets kept to themselves for fear they will shatter the tenuous bond growing between them.Angela Scott takes her time developing the characters and establishing her story, weaving in new characters along with their stories, and building genuine relationships. The scenes were so well written that I would swear I was there. I shuddered in horror, feared the worst, and sighed in delight.The cliff-hanger ending left my jaw dropping in surprise, already anticipating more.I will be looking for the next book in the series, Survivor Roundup Book 2I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read and a new series!"}, {"userName": "Nicole Hill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7193403-nicole-hill", "userReview": "I read this book because when I saw the tweet for it, I thought \" Zombies and Cowboys! Eye roll. \" That probably sucks. \" I was pleasantly surprised. It's the story of Red and Cowboy. ( They have real names but they are \" Red and Cowboy\") Cowboy is your typical southern city boy. He likes his creature comforts and hates \" roughing it \" Red is tough, beautiful and smart as heck. She has survived her entire family all of who died by her hand. She is also hiding a very large, very dangerous secret that will knock your socks off. This book is full of twists and turns that will keep you up all night. ( I was up till 1:30am. But I had to finish before I could sleep. ) For those die hard zombie fans, It has your typical Zombie lore and the struggle of those left behind but the author has thrown in a few curve balls to keep ya on your toes. It's like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly meets The Walking Dead. I loved it! Plain and simple. You will not want their story to end and the best part is...

It's a quick, smooth, entertaining read. The first thing that amazed me was the language. Angela creates a southern accent in everything, including the prose between all of the dialogue. It isn't annoying. Rather, for me it immerses me completely in the atmosphere of this apocalyptic world.Several times, I found myself picturing some of the old west skits in the classic Star Trek series. The zombies were so gross and so evil, that even when they weren't attacking, I could feel their presence in the world. I knew that this wasn't a traditional western...and that's why I kind of pictured the Star Trek westerns in my head as opposed to real westerns (like the kind Clint Eastwood makes). Things were just different. One stepped removed from what I was used to. And it had the effect of making everything fresh and exciting.Angela approaches zombie lore in a brilliant way. Her heroine (Elisabeth a.k.a. Red) is like a composition of Michonne from the Walking Dead and Sara played by Shirley MacLaine in the movie Two Mules for Sister Sara.Angela approaches her zombie apocalypse like most writers. She doesn't explain it. And the story is about survival. Where it gets clever, is how the characters survive and through the strange powers that Red manifests.The tale doesn't get too scary. But there are definitely some shocking moments. And Angela does not hold back on the gore. But honestly...who reads a zombie story and doesn't want gore?"}, {"userName": "Bethzaida", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4882003-bethzaida", "userReview": "This book was ridiculously good. What I like most about Wanted: Dead o Undead was that it caught my attention from page one. Then the rest of the book was equally amazing. I don\u2019t like zombies at all but this book was an exception. Maybe because I just read it during the day. But it wasn\u2019t all about zombies; it was more about surviving. Red is now in my top 10 favorite kickass female character of all time. She was AMAZING. I just enjoyed reading her character and seeing how much she grew throughout the book. I also loved Trace. He was a perfect balance to Red\u2019s character. I wish I could say more but I\u2019ll be giving away good stuff. This book definitely surprised me a few times and I was upset when it ended.

I might have to rave about this one. So, as you might guess it\u2019s a five star read. It was just like watching a movie, only better. From the moment I started reading it I felt like I could have been watching an old western. Only it was a western with zombies. It was so visual. Set in the old west, the novel begins as any western might. There\u2019s a crisis. A little boy calls to his sister for help. Immediately the sister drops everything and rushes to his aid. Little does she know, it\u2019s already too late... It\u2019s heart-breaking. It\u2019s violent. It\u2019s a western. With zombies.First off, the action sequences were superb. Be it on the cold unforgiving ground or in the back of a covered wagon, body parts flew and blood was splattered. True to a zombie thriller, there were scenes of dismemberment, biting and even ninja like zombie decapitation. In places it was just plain gruesome. Yet it all fit so very seamlessly into the western genre. There was plenty of gun slinging. Desperate shootouts and fingers poised on triggers. There were stone cold, poker faced death stares shared between characters and ...Ah yes, the characters. They were such personalities. Individual, yet timeless. And as the makeshift posse of zombie plague survivors forms, the reader gets introduced to several of them. Elizabeth Storey is a hardened zombie killing cowgirl in search of her brother. Trace Munroe is something of a shiftless gambler with a talent for talking his way out of a situation. Both have secrets. Neither are very hard on the eyes. So when the two team up to further their own goals, it\u2019s not surprising when a complicated romance develops. The romance is developed slowly over the course of the story, but it\u2019s well paced.What amazed me the most was the author\u2019s ability to create images the reader can pull off the pages. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s an excess of description. On the contrary, the visual quality was created with a perfect use of tone and skillful choice of words. I was amazed. It was very well written.Currently the Kindle version is available for $4.99 on Amazon. It\u2019s well worth every penny. I recommend it to readers in many age groups who enjoy a good story, a little humour, gore and romance. On a personal note, while I do enjoy a few zombie thrillers a year, my experience with westerns and cross genre novels has been more limited. Of course I have read the odd Louis L\u2019Amour, and watched movies like True Grit and The Warrior. However, Wanted: Dead or Undead was just so much fun it really made me think. Could every genre be improved just by adding zombies?"}, {"userName": "J.L.

While gaming inside a saloon, he runs into a gun-wielding, red-headed cowgirl. What\u2019s unique about this no-nonsense female is that she knows how to kill the living dead. Trace latches on to \u2018Red\u2019, despite her aversion to him, and soon discovers her well-kept secret. Knowing what he does, will he forgo the price on her head and let his protective instincts win or will he give in to greed?PLAYERS: Red is smart, self-sufficient and prickly. She prefers to work alone killing zombies. That\u2019s until Trace comes on the scene and refuses to be shaken loose. Red has a hard exterior that comes from necessity, and hides her vulnerability well. Trace, at first glance, is an opportunist. He too is smart, but he\u2019s also caring and takes family, friendship and responsibility seriously. I liked so many things about this novel. How Trace eventually wormed his way into Red\u2019s confidence through persistence and handles responsibility when it is thrown at him. The writer shows how good things come from cooperation and builds a strong bond between the characters, who come from diverse backgrounds. I could have lived without the \u2018eeewww\u2019 factor that comes with zombie novels, but feel free to ignore this particular comment. That\u2019s why this is a zombie novel, right? The author does a good job bringing across the gooey, nasty, stink factor that is synonymous with zombies. OVERALL COMMENTS: Wanted: Dead or Undead is very easy to read. The writer tells an intriguing story, the pacing is good and the characters are people I\u2019ve come to care about. The writer painted vivid word pictures of the world that is the Wild West and made the zombies fit right into the landscape. She created such an interesting cast of characters that I can\u2019t wait for the second book in the series to come out. I\u2019m not a fan of zombie fiction. I couldn\u2019t understand what the fuss was all about and I never thought I\u2019d say this, but Ms. Scott has \u2018turned\u2019 me into a zombie story fan.

I love zombies, but romance isn't my thing and I don't think I've ever read a western in my life. But I'm nothing if not adventurous, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm really glad that I did.Told in alternating POVs of Red, a beautiful loner with a tragic past, and Trace (also known as Cowboy), who first encounters her in a wild west saloon, Wanted: Dead or Undead tells their story as they move through the country, looking for a safe haven from the zombie hordes. As their relationship moves from unwilling on Red's part, to friendship and finally love, picking up Wen and two children on their travels, Trace gradually discovers more about Red, and the secret she works so hard to hide.I liked all the characters in this book, all are well drawn and likable, and it's impossible not to cheer for them as they make their way through some pretty hairy situations. And it's a very well written story - Angela Scott has a knack for making her words come alive on the page.Probably my favourite part of the book, however, is Red and her secret. It's something I've seen only a few times before in zombie books and it's done exceedingly well here - but if you want to know more, you're going to have to read the book!Although romance is really not big on my list of favourites, the romance between Trace and Red feels very natural and unforced - there's limited cheesiness and some pretty tender moments. I also enjoyed the Wild West setting - as I said earlier it's not something I've read before, but it does bring a whole new facet to zombie killing! Wanted: Dead or Undead is an enjoyable read, with some unique points, and I'll be definitely checking out the next book in the series!Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "KWinks  ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616052-kwinks", "userReview": "I did not expect much going into this book, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed it.

A zombie book \u2013 love. The fact I might pick up some more tips for survival \u2013 love. A\u2026western? I didn\u2019t know if I would love that. Seriously\u2026 historical western zombie story? But somehow Angela Scott pulls it off fabulously.This book starts with a gruesome and zombie-beautiful prologue. It is the stuff the zombie nightmares \u2013 or dreams! \u2013 are made of. And it sets up the book perfectly. But it doesn\u2019t really tell us too much other than we should be scared for our flesh!Then we meet Red. Red comes into a saloon and saves the day while everyone else was trying to shoot a zombie like it was the first time they ever held a gun. Good thing Red was there, right? Especially since Red is a woman. Yeah, not so heard of in the 1800s. Red is a young woman with fiery red hair. She is tough and a loner. But that\u2019s until Trace \u201cfinds\u201d her. See, he saw her in that saloon and decided he needed to see her some more. So he tracked her down. They became travel companions, each with their own secrets. Big secrets. Game changing secrets. But no names. So he is Cowboy and she is Red. And then they are on their way.And then they meet Wen, who is also on his own. And the duo becomes and easy trio. I really loved how this woman, who was a loner, morphed herself into part of a group. Sure, she fought it. But sometimes you can\u2019t fight destiny. And together, Wen, Cowboy and Red have terrific chemistry. And then their group grows some more.Meet Lasso. And Rivers. And Fisher. And maybe even a few others. I\u2019m a firm believer when the apoc comes we will need to group up. I mean, you can\u2019t stay awake 24 hours a day. You will need someone to watch your back. And a few more. So the fact that this group formed and grew was a pleasant surprise. Red began to show more and more signs of tenderness. See, Rivers and Fisher are orphaned children. And she turns out to have somewhat of a motherly touch. And her instincts kick in. She is definitely a strong heroine and she\u2019s earned my admiration. Sure, there are a few steps along the way where she stumbles. But that\u2019s what I like to see in my heroines. I also like them to find a man. Or love. I found myself hoping that Red would find that, because sometimes when you are taking down zombies it helps to have a warm touch to help ground you. But you will have to read the book to find out if that happens.Like other reviewers I expected some humor in this story. I am not sure why! I was concerned, I admit it. Once again, I\u2019ve proven I\u2019m often wrong about a lot of things. This book is an emotional and strengthening tale of survival. Its about hope and love, not necessarily romantic love but more of a camraderie/familial love. It might have taken place a century ago, but the heart of the survivor's story is there. There was some great action, and definitely some great zombie gore. So if you are looking for something a little different as far as zombies go \u2013 give it a try!"}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "Elisabeth Story's life has changed within the blink of an eye.

Dodging the undead through every city she passes, her only goal is to find her brother before she loses him in the process. Family is all that matters to her and she'll do everything she can to try and keep what's left of hers together.Trace Monroe knows what he wants, when he wants it. He's lived each day as if it were his last and has done his best to keep himself alive, at all costs. The world has changed in so short a time. The undead litter every corner of the world. Their only thought is to feed the hunger that roils within them.Using every ounce of his strength to stay alive, Trace has done well, up until now. His tricks at the card table have kept him alive this long and he's pretty sure they'll keep him going for awhile longer. Until he meets the fiery red-head that strolls into the bar where he's trying to turn his next trick. Quick with her guns despite her tough demeanor, she's able to save them all from a swift demise from one of the undead. A feat he can't help but to admire.As the dire situation grows, Trace finds himself pulling the beautiful woman under his wing. His gut tells him she's in a heap of trouble. Heck, he's seen the wanted posters to prove it. Yet there's something about her that's caught his interest and refuses to let go. Determined to protect her to the best of his ability, the two of them embark on a journey that will test their mettle, in more ways than one.Elisabeth knows she shouldn't place her trust in Trace's hands. Yet she can't deny that he's been there for her in ways no one else has in so short a time. Banding together as they fight against the undead, she soon realizes that there's more to him than meets the eye. Granted, she has her own secrets to keep. Never-the-less, she's willing to give him the benefit of a doubt in hopes of living through another day in order to eliminate the threat that's just around the corner.This was such a gripping and very intriguing story. I enjoyed every minute of it. Sure, this is another zombie story, but there are quite a few elements within it that set it apart from the rest. The first, of course, is the fact that it's setting takes place in the Wild West. I absolutely love westerns and this one didn't disappoint. Granted, I do wish that there was a little more history given as to how the plague came about and what the character's past truly was. This is the start of a very good series, I think. Hopefully, book two will give me insight in that regards soon."}, {"userName": "Timothy Ward", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867952-timothy-ward", "userReview": "I think Angela accomplished exactly what she set out to accomplish for a YA Western Zombie Romance. In all truth, my reading preferences only interest me into the zombie category and a curiosity for how she could combine these genres. That fact that I finished it is an incredible testimony; I normally tire of YA books before the first chapter is over. The prologue starts this book off with more balls than I expected from a YA, and then surprised me with how easily I fell for the two main characters. By the time you hit the twist, it's all over, you're hooked.I am not the type of zombie reader that only reads zombie books, but I was quite surprised by the twist she spins on the zombie virus; and yet it seems so obvious, I can't believe I haven't read someone else try this take. I'm not really a fan of westerns either, though that's more a product of my generation choosing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles over Bonanza. That said, I enjoy post-apocalyptic settings, and found the Wild West spin on that refreshing. There are safe zone towns, but those fall quick because keeping the infected out before they turn is difficult, maybe more so in this level of infrastructure and technology. I liked the wagon train scene and just the idea of pretending I'm on horseback shooting zombies and yelling \"Yee-ha!\" The teenage samurai was a nice touch as well.While I can't really fault Angela for anything in this book, my only criticism is that I wasn't ever really scared. I don't fault her on this because the book is YA, and not meant to scare like some darker zombie books. Angela's book requires zombies to evoke the character trials that keep us tethered to the end, but it isn't as much about the zombies being scary as it is about being scared that the two love interests won't be together. The zombies create a situation that threatens to pull them apart, but the real conflict is in their hearts not beating together. This book is about what these two characters need to change about themselves in order to find that happy ending together. How Angela was able to smoothly thread these two character struggles into a worthwhile and powerful emotional investment is why I finished it, but I can't say that I loved it because I don't like how the zombie stuff wasn't scary. This isn't my favorite book, but if you fit into the YA Western Zombie Romance audience, this book will likely become yours."}, {"userName": "Jasz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8632318-jasz", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book. Much more than I tought I would. I have to admit, I was genuinely suprised because if I would have to be honest, I tought this book wouldn't be good. Turned out I was wrong. I was sucked into a whole new world. A world where there's a war between the dead and the undead.The main character, Red, was strong, stubborn, undependent and a little bit complex, wich made her all the more interesting because even tought she was everything a cowboy could only wish to be, she was human (mostly), she made mistakes, she wasn't perfect and that alone made this story so realistic, even when it's all about the zombies. Another really good thing about this book are the twists and turns. I didn't think it was possible to have so much twists without the plot becoming too complicated. The story wasn't predictable. Normaly when I read a book I'm like: \"okay, now this is going to happen, than this, than that, and than the story will be finished and everyone will be happy,...\" But it wasn't anything like it, it really wasn't. Instead I found myself thinking: \"O God, what is going to happen next?\" the whole freaking time. I just couldn't put the book away, wanting to now what was going to happen next, how the book would end...The one thing I loved the most about this book was simply: NO INSTANT LOVE!!!! You could actually see the realtionship building between the two main characters. I think you could say; everyone saw it coming since there's always some love in a story but I have to admit, when Caroline was introduced, I was kind of doubting, afraid, she would ruin it and we would come to the conclusion that Trace had never loved Red.I want to read the sequel as soon as possible. I don't really want to wait, but hey, we can't get everything we want =)From now on Angela Scott is one of my favorite authors.I still have one question tough. In the book was said that Caroline was one year older than Trace. But how old are Trace or even Wed for that matter? We know Red was around 18 or 19 but is that it? Or did I miss something. Not that it really matters or anything. I'm just curious."}, {"userName": "Michell Plested", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1788176-michell-plested", "userReview": "I love the experimentation that has been going on for a while now. \"Experimentation?\" you ask.Yes, experimentation. Specifically in the meshing of genres that might not have happened otherwise. In this case the merging of a Western with Zombie Horror.In many ways, the stereotypical old west cowboy (from the movies now, not necessarily reality) is the ideal combatant for the zombie. Fast draw with the six gun. Deadly accuracy with the rifle. It should be no big deal to plug a zombie in the head, right?Except, in reality, not everyone was a gunfighter or a marksman. Most people were the normal, hardworking citizens all around us today.And so it is with this book. There are some of the aforementioned gunfighters who are able to deal with the zombie menace in a very final way. More often, the folk who are attacked by the undead are completely unprepared.The United States (or at least a small portion of it) serves as the backdrop for this novel. Humanity has been having a very rough go of it and it looks like the zombies are winning.The book focuses in on a saloon where our two main characters have a chance encounter. A zombie attack in the saloon eventually brings them together.In case you are wondering, this is not a fun book. People suffer and die. It is very much the apocalypse you might imagine.And it is a wonderful read.The characters all have very real hopes, fears, motivations and dreams. They grow throughout the story and left me always looking to see what they would do next. Their relationships are imperfect at best and the little group always seems to be on the verge of implosion, much like some families.It feels real and well-realized and I was invested in the characters.I finished the story and, while it was complete, I was left wanting more. Exactly what I was hoping for.Is it worth your time? I certainly think so. The book was always in the back of my mind when I had to put it down and I put aside my routines so I could \"read just one more page\"."}, {"userName": "Vidya-BooksAreMagic", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3906820-vidya-booksaremagic", "userReview": "Recently, I like to read zombie novels, more than fantasy (but, fantasy is still my favorite genre) and when this book came for review, I just accepted. And I am glad I did.Set in a post-apocalyptic zombie world, this novel focuses on a group of people, trying not to get infected and stay alive. Red, the heroine of this novel, is tough, independent and no-nonsense type. Trace is a guy, who starts following Red, after she kills a zombie in a tavern, when all other men failed to do so. Trace also knows that Red has a bounty placed on her head and tries to get Red to the city and get his money. Red, knowing nothing about Trace's intentions, just tries to get rid of him. During their journey, there are so many survivors here and there, who got themselves attached to Red and Trace and before Red knows it, soon they are like a family. But, Red has her own secrets...Okay, I know what you think - zombies and cowboys? (I can even see your eye roll..) Because I just did that, when I heard that. But, I really was surprised to see that this novel gives you a good reading time. In fact, this is the first western novel that I review.The plot is fast, original and well-developed and the writing is great. The character development is good and I loved almost all the characters. The trust, friendship and romance is all non-cheesy (and that's a good thing). This is a different approach to regular zombie novels and that's really appreciated. The romance part is tender and sweet. Enjoyed this page turner!My only complaint is this - I am not scared. Yeah, there are some gruesome descriptions, but I am not sure, why I don't feel that I-love-being-scared-of-zombies thing. Other than that, I liked this book and definitely would like to continue this series.Overall, this book created a feeling of sunniness while reading, and that alone should be enough for me to recommend it.Recommended for zombie western romance readers!---For reviews and more, go to Books Are Magic."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745176-maria", "userReview": "I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour in exchange for a fair and honest review. Zombies, a spunky heroine and a hero smoother than butter make Angela Scott's Wanted: Dead or Undead a great start to The Zombie West series. With plenty of action, fun dialogue and enough romance to keep things going, this paranormal tale of the Old West captured my attention from the first page. Well developed characters and good world building make this book a strong entry in the YA field.A zombie hunter by necessity, Elisabeth, or \"Red\" as she's now known, is roaming West in order to locate her older brother. Disposing of the infected along the way has become a way of life for her, running into a handsome cowboy who won't leave her alone is an unexpected surprise. Becoming the leader of a small posse of uninfected was never a part of her plan.A gambler and a cowboy, Trace Monroe has always believed in his luck. How else could he explain \"Red\" walking into a saloon and saving the patrons from a zombie no one seemed to be able to take down. Realizing she's the girl on the \"Wanted\" poster could lead to a large reward, if he can gain her trust. Falling in love with her was definitely not a part of his plan.The scenes between \"Red\" and Trace, or \"Cowboy\" as Red likes to call him are full of humor, plenty of action and sharp dialogue. A loner by habit, Red really wants to be left alone to go her own way - something Cowboy has no intentions of letting her do. Learning to depend on each other becomes quite the adventure.Joined by some colorful and interesting secondary characters, Red and Cowboy make their way across the land. Will Red ever become comfortable enough to share the secrets to her zombie hunting success? Will her secret change the growing romance between Red and Cowboy? You'll have to read Wanted: Dead or Undead to find out. I liked it and I think you will too."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5679506-meg", "userReview": "After reading Warm Bodies I thought to myself \u2018damn zombies are cool\u2019 \u2013 but then after reading Wanted I thought \u2018move over vampires, because ZOMBIES are my new love!\u2019This book, to say the least, was amazeballs with an extra dollop of cherry!

Got it in the mail, picked it up, then put it back down. I don't do zombies due to the blood and gore and the fact I don't enjoy reading descriptions of children dying. My only Old West experience comes from being made to watch Silverado as a child more times than I care to tally up. So you can see why my first reaction to this novel was a mixture of disinterest and hesitation.But the book I was currently reading was truly dreadful so I thought, eh, what the hell, let's do this. I was pleasantly surprised.Of the two main characters, Cowboy (Trace) and Red (Elisabeth), Red is the one who draws you in with her smartass, hardcore cowgirl act. She is one of the most badass heroines I've ever read about. Cowboy was a little harder to pick apart and I felt like his character was more glazed over than Red's. Only when the two came together did the story start rolling. Something about this book makes it hard to put down and I finished it in a matter of hours.Overall the Old West facts were fairly accurate, not that I'm a great judge of those things. But for instance, there is no way she would have held the reins in her right hand and shot with her left when it is never stated she is left handed. ALL cowgirls and cowboys (modern and ancient) are taught to ride with their left hand holding the reins so their dominant hand is free. It was little details like that that bothered me the most. As for the zombies, that part was disgusting and made me realize why I don't actively seek out zombie books.But overall, it was a quick, easy read that I'll think about getting the sequel to."}, {"userName": "Pen-rye-n", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3684532-pen-rye-n", "userReview": "ZOMBIES.

I liked the feisty MC, she takes nonsense from no one but as the story continues and we learn of her horrendous life, we get to see her softer side. Trace is more of a gentleman than cowboy but again it works in the relationship between them.The idea of treating zombies as a plague has intrigued me for some time and unlike recent books about the apocalypse there are no bombs, weapons of mass destruction that can wipe out some of the numbers, here you just have a gun, a sword and they are greatly outnumbered.

I guess for me it's getting old.I did enjoy the story that was based in what I consider the old west. In the days where you have saloons, life is poor for most, and family is everything. The author Angela Scott paints a different story on the people who die and come back as the living dead. Its an intense story, filled with adventure, blood shed, sadness and even love. The characters are likeable, especially Red, a female who has bean bitten and still walks with a beating heart.The narrator, Rebecca Roberts does a fantastic job in her telling of Wanted. She breathes life into this story and makes it a fun and enjoyable story to listen to. She held my interest from start to finish. I really LOVED her southern accents she gives some of the characters. She did a fabulous job with her take and accent she gives Red. You feel as if you're there, seeing everything as it unfolds. This is my second story that I've listened to by Rebecca and she definitely kept my interest held from start to finish. I look forward to hearing more of the stories she's narrated.

The romance aspect was kind of hurried and a tad unbelievable, though I think toward the end it started to resolve itself a bit better. The ending itself was a bit of a letdown, with no actual action and just the promise of it in future books. I wasn't overly in love with Wen or Caroline, or the kids for that matter, though Rivers had moments of badassness. I'm also not so happy with the Tough-girl-falls-apart trope that filled up the middle of the book.In favor, it had a pretty good flow, with some good character interaction. It was a bit of a different take on zombies, the whole bite immunity was different, and allows for some speculation. I also like that I didn't quite see everything coming a mile off. There wasn't a lot of story padding, or too much protagonist whining.

We slowly discover, as does Trance (and the slowly growing cast of smaller characters that join us in this journey) that Red isn't like normal girls. No, not at all.I won't give anything away to avoid spoiler territory, but I was impressed, the prose is nice and tight, and the pacing of the book is right on.I would have given it five stars, and was very close to doing so anyway, but I held off because I felt a little disappointed in the ending.
