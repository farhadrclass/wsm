Hall's writing is seamless, smooth, and compelling...\" Review by Mary PearsonWhat book was she reading and where can I get a copy of it?? At the very least tell me which single page took her away because for most of the book I was still waiting for some sort of action to arise out of the multitude of pages that consisted of nothing but info dumps poorly masked as history lessons for the main character. And finally when the action really did get under way (around page 180 of 220) and I totally got into the plot THE BOOK ENDED. (Yes, all publishers seem to want series or at least trilogies so they can milk them for every penny they are worth but at least make the books full length and not just 220 pages with no ending whatsoever.) Seriously the cliffhanger totally pissed me off, and it wasn't even about the main character but a secondary character that I cared for much more than Rachel. Just when I was interested it was over.The writing is seamless? Smooth? Compelling? REALLY? More like choppy. Juvenile. Boring.You have a main character so sheltered she barely speaks to more than 3 people for the majority of her life. Her mother whose past makes her wanted by the government but instead of teaching her child to fit in, not makes waves, etc teaches her all about the corruptness and injustices. Does she want Rachel to get arrested???You get a plot that while not original is different since it applies to a country modeled after the US - making a nation whose foundation is based on individual freedoms into a martial law type government after near world destruction from world wide wars. But instead of taking this idea of a future dystopia and making it succeed like The Hunger Games you get a a book full of potential that fails to deliver.Also, I needed a freaking map to explain the geography to me! The US was the only country name that was familiar (except I didn't realize for most of the book that whenever they said the U.S. they weren't referring to the United Stated but the Unified States!) Furthermore, the Line consisted of coastline, forest, and seemed like every terrain in the US, so what part of the country was it actually surrounding?? The called the area outside of the Line 'Away' (and was supposedly affected by weapons of mass destruction) yet all the foreign countries were outside the Line yet weren't affected like 'Away' was. So were they really far away from 'Away'? Do you see how confusing this is?! I feel like I am playing Who's on First with a book!!Who knows maybe I went into this book with the wrong mindset, or expecting to much, or....I don't know. I really thought I would love it but that just didn't happen. I have to read the second book in the series though (since it will actually be like the end of the first book) because I really want to know what happens. So annoying. The plot didn't grab my interest till the end but now I am hooked. (Yeah, yeah, you win Mr. Publisher man - but I still won't buy it! Yay for libraries!)Basically this book had so much potential that I want to rate it higher based on that alone. The plot ended with so many posibilities, but because of the lack of characterization and setting detail (oh and lets not forget the agonizing info dumps) I just couldn't give it 3 stars.My review in one word: Disappointment."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675749-amanda", "userReview": "It's not like there was anything wrong with this book. There just wasn't anything right, either. The writing is really clunky (I am pretty sure some of these paragraphs were \"what not to do\" examples in my high school creative writing textbooks). The characters are flat and boring. Plus, Hall does that annoying thing where she unnecessarily makes up words to sound more sci-fi (\"digim\" for \"picture,\" \"creds\" for \"dollars\"). Made-up words do not create an interesting world all by themselves. Overall, the world was not particularly well-developed or believable - when is this set? How is it possible that all of these countries (except the U.S.) have different names? How is the government simultaneously so tyrannical and so incompetent? And WHY did all of the \"world-building\" happen in the form of a pop quiz? The other big problem is that this book requires the reader to be concerned about the characters, which is impossible because a) we know nothing about any of them, nor believe anything they say because they are all painfully insincere, and b) you never believe that their world is actually dangerous. Oh no, they might have to wear jumpsuits? Ugh. Add to that the predictable ending and the lazy dialogue, and you're in for a real treat. I might have liked it in middle school, though, because I was a big \"X-Files\" fan and would have loved the over-the-top paranoia about the government."}, {"userName": "Tink Magoo is bad at reviews", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38603325-tink-magoo-is-bad-at-reviews", "userReview": "Really slow (like a Sloth), kinda boring (skimmed to 80% and still not a great deal was going on), the writing was also hard work to get through, so it's a DNF at 18% for me."}, {"userName": "Debut Authors Blog", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3334051-debut-authors-blog", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Miss Clark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1467942-miss-clark", "userReview": "Part of the 2010 Debut Author Challenge2.5 stars (Reads like the first half of a single book, not the first book in a series.)It was better than I had expected it to be after encountering some less favorable reviews. They were mostly concerned with plot and such.Evil, corrupt tyrannical government set in a futuristic society? Check.No rights and obscene, excessive taxes? CheckGirl who will somehow bring about the collapse of this unjust regime and inspire a rebellion? Check.So, clearly we have all the makings of a dystopian society set in an America years ahead, with all the other countries having different names and borders. To ensure the safety of America's own borders from ground invasion following the passage of international laws making nuclear/missile weapons illegal, the government of the U.S. created a force field around the states and anyone who happened to be on the other side got abandoned there when a neighboring country threw some radioactive weapons at the US. Lots of people died and those that did not ended up gaining some strange abilities down through the generations. (You cannot have radioactive weapons without genetic mutation and super powers. It is some unwritten rule.)The maps? What are they and why are they so important? How does Pathik know Daniel? Is Daniel still alive? Was not very invested in the fate of the characters, more plot driven. I'll probably pick up the next book to see what happens, but if it is dragged on any farther, I'm out. Publishers need to stop milking stories for more than they have to give.Cover deserves a mention though because it is a lovely one. It fits the story (the greenhouse being an essential building that figures into the story frequently)and the lighting gives an appropriately mysterious and spooky feel. The font, sparse, thin and rigid speaks volumes, as does the line running down. A cover that fits the book, enhances the attraction of the book and after reading it I was not confused by the cover or feel misled."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310688-kristi", "userReview": "If you asked me if I'm a fan a dystopian fiction, I'd tell you no. Yet everything time I read a dystopian novel, I end up loving it.... maybe I am just in denial.The Line is a very diverting novel. Maybe I'm just a dystopian newbie, but the whole concept was very intriguing. The first part of the novel was a little slow for me, the introduction of the characters, the explanation of the world. Don't let that slow start stop you from reading the rest of the novel, because you will be disappointed if you do!The world Hall has created is both engrossing and terrifying....the supreme control of the government, its constant domination over every aspect of life, it was intensely depressing. Most of the knowledge you gain about this world is in the lessons Rachel receives from her mom, so you're getting the lesson as well. That was a little tedious at times, but it was a canny way to give the reader a lot of information!The characters, while I found them to be a little blah in the beginning, really grew on me by the end of the novel. Especially Ms. Moore, that lady is layered like an onion! Rachel is an excellent main character, she's very easy to relate to, but she's a little naive and headstrong. The possibility for growth there is undeniable.Not to mention the last half of this novel... was just wow. I really can't tell you anything about it without being spoilery... but wow. What an ending!Overall, this is an awesome dystopian novel, don't let to slow start scare you away!"}, {"userName": "Reynje", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5590906-reynje", "userReview": "[In a nutshell: A girl crosses a forbidden line.

Her mother works for Ms. Moore, the owner, as a housekeeper of the large house. Rachel enjoys living far from town and away from the strong governmental control most other people must suffer. People living in towns deal with unfair and random taxes and, when they can't pay, are taken to jail.Most people would hate living on The Property because it backs up to The Line, a small section of the National Border Defense System that separates the people of the Unified States from Away and the Others. The Line is an invisible barrier that can only be crossed if the government grants permission and deactivates The Line.Rachel doesn't feel fear when she thinks of Away. She even tried to cross it once, but simply bounced back from The Line and landed flat on her back.Rachel's quiet life is turned upside down when two things happen.First, she finds a battered digital voice recorder with a partial message requesting help. Then, during a trip to town with her mother for the weekly supplies, they witness the arrest of a woman her mother recognizes.Rachel discovers she doesn't know her mother as well as she thought she did, that Ms. Moore has some unbelievable secrets, and the Away and the Others are closer than she thinks. She must use her wits and bravery to get through a dangerous and exciting time in order to save an important historical document and people she doesn't even know.THE LINE by Teri Hall is a fascinating dystopian novel full of strong female characters and a dark, creepy plot. The end, while a bit abrupt, is satisfying. Readers will definitely want to read more about the adventures Rachel is sure to find. The author leaves the story completely open for a sequel, and I for one can't wait to read it.The synopsis isn't the only thing I found intriguing about THE LINE.

Exciting, huh? I received it in the mail on November 21st of 2009. The cover states that it is \"Advance, Uncorrected Proof, Not For Resale.\"The back cover synopsis for this novel lured me in; it did its job nicely.The story concept\u2014about the people associated with The Property, which is on the inside of the US (Unified States) border\u2014sounds pretty cool. The border\u2014or Line\u2014is a force-field like barrier keeping the citizens of the country in and the Others out.I wanted to like this one more than I did. The story starts off a bit one dimensional and flat. The simplistic names\u2014The Property, The Others, The Line\u2014seem like kept place-holders.I couldn\u2019t get past the incongruities present. Near the beginning we are led to believe that glass can become old and brittle and break on its own. Incongruities such as having a greenhouse in which orchids (a type of flower) are grown, so close to the Line render the story that much less believable. And why are we growing orchids in a semi-post-apocalyptic world? Wouldn\u2019t hybridizing vegetables seem more useful? Who\u2019s buying these orchids? Another incongruity is the single-use border pass. Why? For what purpose would the government issue single-use border passes? The idea is never fleshed out. The reader is asked to suspend too much disbelief.The characters at one point go to the local city and I was thinking, \u201chere we go, we\u2019re off the farm now.\u201d Yet the reader gets little feel for what this post-apocalyptic city is like. The trip isn\u2019t explored, the city is barely sketched. So many opportunities to broaden what is on this canvas are left unexplored.In the end, there is no end. None of the conflict is resolved. None of what is revealed is redeeming.

Cuando comenc\u00e9 su lectura, no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 iba a encontrarme pues no hab\u00eda le\u00eddo ni una sola rese\u00f1a. Su prometedora sinopsis fue suficiente para hacerme con \u00e9l y leerlo meses m\u00e1s tarde. Tampoco sab\u00eda si mi nivel de ingl\u00e9s iba a ser suficiente para leerlo, o si por el contrario se me har\u00eda cuesta arriba. No ha sido el caso. Al principio s\u00ed miraba cosas en el diccionario pero a medida que avanzaba dej\u00e9 de recurrir tanto a \u00e9l. Lo he le\u00eddo sin complicaciones y lo he disfrutado much\u00edsimo, que es lo m\u00e1s importante.The Line nos muestra una sociedad supeditada a un estado opresor. Un gobierno que ha dado poder a los polic\u00edas, hasta el punto en que pueden detenerte por casi cualquier cosa. Basta que haya circulando un rumor sobre ti para que la sombra de la duda les haga vetar tu perfil (ficha inform\u00e1tica con todos tus datos). Y despu\u00e9s, te Identifican y si no tienes dinero, acabas trabajando para el Estado, viviendo en barracas con otros tantos desgraciados como t\u00fa. Por suerte, Vivian y Rachel viven alejadas de todo ese traj\u00edn. La madre es ama de casa en La Propiedad perteneciente a la Sra. Moore, mientras que su hija trabaja en el invernadero, haci\u00e9ndose cargo de las orqu\u00eddeas de la jefa de Vivian. En principio, todo va bien\u2026 pero hay algo que no encaja. Vivian es demasiado protectora. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que oculta? No es la \u00fanica con secretos del pasado, por supuesto. La Sra. Moore tambi\u00e9n tiene los suyos, relacionados con algo que ocurri\u00f3 anta\u00f1o en su Propiedad, algo relacionado con La L\u00ednea. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es la L\u00ednea? \u00bfQu\u00e9 hay detr\u00e1s de ella, en Away?Me ha sorprendido gratamente la concepci\u00f3n de los Estados Unificados. Si hay algo que caracterice a una distop\u00eda, como bien sabr\u00e9is, son los Estados totalitarios. Conocer c\u00f3mo se ha llegado ah\u00ed, los motivos por los cu\u00e1les se crea la L\u00ednea, as\u00ed como comprobar la crueldad que ese gobierno ficticio puede llegar a tener me ha gustado mucho. El hecho de que se explique tan bien la historia le da puntos a favor. En otros libros del mismo corte no lo hacen, o no en tanta profundidad.Otra baza a favor son los personajes. El narrador usa la tercera persona para expresarse pero lo hace seg\u00fan los sentimientos de cada personaje. La mayor\u00eda de las veces es Rachel, la chica protagonista, pero tambi\u00e9n llegamos a conocer a su madre y a la Sra. Moore. Las tres mujeres me han encantado. Son reales. Como t\u00fa o como yo. Vivian y Moore han cometido errores, han pasado mucho tiempo lament\u00e1ndose por ellos pero son luchadoras y valientes, cada una a su modo. Rachel es inocente pero inteligente y muy (pero que muy) valiente. Conf\u00eda en sus actos y conoce los motivos que la llevan a ello. Os aseguro que jam\u00e1s me hab\u00eda sentido tan orgullosa de que un personaje se llamara como yo. Las tres son buenas personas, pero Rachel tiene un halo especial, algo que me hace querer decirle \u201cYOU GO, GIRL\u201d <3Y no s\u00f3lo est\u00e1n ellas. Conocer\u00e9is a m\u00e1s personajes, como el viejo Jonathan o el misterioso Pathik, que es amor.Por si estos puntos no fueran suficientes para argumentar mi puntuaci\u00f3n, el \u00faltimo lo encontramos en la manera de escribir de la autora. Tiene una pluma preciosa, es capaz de traer a la vida personajes ficticios, perfectamente desarrollados. Ha sabido captar perfectamente los sentimientos contrariados de una anciana, el miedo y el coraje de una madre que lucha por sobrevivir un d\u00eda m\u00e1s y la dulzura y la valent\u00eda de una adolescente que quiere luchar por lo que cree justo.The Line no es una novela de acci\u00f3n trepidante, al menos no en esta primera entrega. Sin embargo, sabe captar la atenci\u00f3n del lector a trav\u00e9s de otros muchos puntos fuertes.

It made for a rather dull read. The concept is intriguing but the execution left me wanting more.The story takes place almost entirely on this property that contained a mansion of some kind, a guest house, and a greenhouse. There are orchids in the greenhouse that Rachel helps take care of, so required by Ms Moore, the crotchety property owner who\u2019s obviously hiding something. It\u2019s told in third person limited and alternates POVs between Rachel, her mother, and once or twice, Ms Moore but it\u2019s told in this storyteller sort of way that really detached me from everything that was going on. I had a hard time pinpointing Rachel\u2019s age because she came off so incredibly young and naive. She comes off as maybe 11 or 12 but I think she may be closer to 18 based on her mother\u2019s conversations about college. There was just such a distance there that nothing really stuck with me.There was a good chunk of \u2018as you know, Bob\u201d infodumping going on in regard to how the US ended up in its current situation in the guise of a pop quiz sort of situation. What really irked me about the world, though, was the terminology. It was just so . . . lazy. There was a corder, as in REcorder. Instead of the United States it\u2019s the Unified States. There were multiple instances of this and I just couldn\u2019t help rolling my eyes at each one. It\u2019s different without effort and that really bothers me. As someone who puts a lot of stock in world-building, even when you\u2019re deconstructing today\u2019s society, put some freakin\u2019 effort into it.Not a whole lot really happens in this first book of the series. It\u2019s just setting up what\u2019s to come in subsequent books and it feels like all this information I got in THE LINE could have been dispersed in other books. Plus there wasn\u2019t a lot of room for Rachel to grow as a character. She\u2019s so tightly controlled by her mother and Ms Moore that she doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to grow until the very end when she\u2019s left to fend for herself. And by this time I\u2019m already lost to the book.This is a quiet book that I really haven\u2019t heard anything about. I can\u2019t even remember reading much about it when it came out so I don\u2019t know if it gets better or not. But THE LINE was lackluster and kind of a let-down as far as the blurb goes.

At first the story is slightly confusing with the terms of Teri Hall's society; terms like \"Away\" and \"the Others.\" It's a dystopian novel which I absolutely adore ever since I read the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld. The story is told in third person, mostly by following Rachel, but sometimes following her mom or Ms. Moore. The pace is superb despite getting used to the terms they use for things. The plot is similar to most dystopian novels. There's a society which was created, or in this case walled off, in dire circumstances in order to save lives, but the government lets the power go to its head. The Property is in an issolated area which allows the main characters to live with very little interruption by government officials called Enforcement Officers. Rachel has a strong sense of right and wrong due to the way her mother, Vivian, has raised and educated her. When a scene at the market in a nearby town causes Vivian to sneak away back to the Property with her, Rachel begins to question her mother's bravery. Rachel then decides to act on her morals.

There is a way to write a book with an ending that feels satisfying as an ending and still have it be part of a series, and still have your reader dying to see what the next installment is about. Too many YA books these days seem to be composed as if the author is imagining what the story would look like on a movie screen.My only other problem was that the most interesting part (what happened to Away, what it's like there now) only really starts to be address right at the very end!Otherwise, I was very intrigued by this story and its 1984-like premise."}, {"userName": "manda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548051-manda", "userReview": "I wouldn't say this book was so bad I felt like throwing my iPad across the room, but it was just. so. boring. It's a pity because it had so much promise. Oppressive government, media-dictated society, isolation from other countries, unknown beings scattered outside the borders, covert rebellions budding up from the inside? It had everything that could've made an intense, mysterious, action-filled adventure.What it came across as, if I could put a name on it, would be fantasy drama. Imagine Harry Potter. Now imagine that the first book had been about Harry simply discovering what he was, then trying to get to Hogwarts.That was The Line.The Unified States had put a border around their country - an invisible force field known as the Line - in order to protect themselves against attacks from other countries. The states left outside the borders were simply abandoned, hence left unprotected when nuclear weapons were used against them. The result was death, mutation, and of course, super powers.Pure is a story about Rachel, a young teenage girl (I don't know how old exactly, or if it was even ever mentioned), who lives just beside the Line, where her mother works as a housekeeper for a surly and strict old woman, Ms. Moore.Everything changes when Rachel receives a message from someone from across the Line, begging for help. She's determined to deliver the aid he needs, and so must cross to the other side.Besides the lack of anything engaging, and the snail-paced progression of this novel, there are other things that I must take issue with. Hopefully they are explained in the second book. And hopefully I can find spoiler reviews because I'm not sure I'll be reading the sequels.\n1. Rachel\nOh how dull could a MC be. What I really didn't like about her was she is such a fucking cry baby. I get that the author's trying to make her seem like a sensitive, soft-hearted girl, but please. If Darwin's Natural Selection applied in her world, she wouldn't have made it out there on her own. She'd be crying over every spilt milk and injustice to society as the government drags her away.\n2. Narrative\nWas inconsistent at times. It's written in third limited, but often reads like omniscient. The tense also switches every so often to relay events that occured in the past before jumping back to the present (or simple past), making it confusing and annoying.\n3. Infodumping\nI am yet to read a book that does not include such cheesy ways of delivering background information. Pure uses the little gem that is \"quizzes\" to get all its information puked out on us. You see, Rachel is home-schooled by her mother, and is often \"quizzed\" to test her knowledge.\n4. The Key\nThere's just a few things that didn't make sense to me. Slight spoilers ahead.So. The \"key\". It is basically what allows people to cross the otherwise impenetrable line. It was said towards the end of the novel, that the people on the other side of the line had the keys, which is why Ms. Moore couldn't cross to join her lover.So I'm asking, since when did they have the key? How did it get there in the first place? And why didn't they fucking use it to cross to the safe side of the US??? Why wouldn't Indigo just come back for Ms. Moore if he had a key? Why would Rachel's father stay there all this time and not try to get back to his family???Again, I'm hoping it's all explained in the sequel. But since I'm not so invested in the characters or what happens to them, I'm not sure if I'll read it at all."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4600655-melissa", "userReview": "The Line is categorized as a YA (young adult) novel. With that being said my qualifications on the content are less critical than a book that is geared towards a more mature reader. However, I really don't have any criticisms of this book other than the slower start to lure me in. I'd say I wasn't fully invested in the story until page 70 or so, which was about a third of the way through. But from that point on the story kept building, the tension continued to mount until the final page that left me wanting to know moreand to go further on this journey with the characters. Luckily there was a 7 or 8 page 'tickler' of the next book included.Although on a different scope, I consider this book a combination of a dystopian society following a mini post-apocalyptic event. Government is in control to the extreme for the U.S. (now referred to as the Unified States), news and propaganda are filtered and changed before being fed out to society. DNA is recorded at birth as a means of keeping track of people. The list of government rules goes on and on, however there is a region of people who are not under this control. They are the Others who inhabit the land on the other side of the Line. They are Away. The Line is a means of border control, keeps people out and keeps people in. The people the Line is keeping, or kept, out though were it's own citizens. Now after many years of being cut off, barely surviving, a young boy makes his way to the Line in order to see if he can communicate with someone on the other side in order to get medicine for his sick and dying father. That's where this story takes off.Barriers have always existed in our past, continue in our present, so this barrier in the story isn't hard to believe there is a sense of reality. The Berlin Wall, Japanese segregation camps after the Pearl Harbor attack, apartheid in South Africa are all examples of barriers. They seem apalling to us, but at one time they made perfect sense to someone otherwise they would not have existed. And so the Line exists too.The Line in my opinion represents fear. Fear then builds upon itself and becomes an entity. What would happen if one of the Others crossed over or vice versa? You'll have to read to find out for yourself."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1178011-brittany", "userReview": "Rachel and her mother live on The Property and have for a long time. The Property is right next to The Line (a border to keep the U.S. separate from Away) but none of the government frequents out to this section of the border. Rachel didn't grow up with other kids but her mom has not kept her in the dark about the way things really are in the world. Rachel reads many articles about the mutants and other horrors that live in Away and though Await fascinates her it also scares her. She never gives it too much thought until she hears a recording that could only be from someone on the other side of The Line. The recording says that they need help.This was a great book and I just wanted to keep reading until the end. Unfortunately this book doesn't really end, which means there will be a sequel which is exciting but also really frustrating because I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! It is one of those books, the ones that leave you wanting more. I don't know what to say but I really enjoyed this novel. I loved the idea of this book; an almost dystopian novel which is a cross between M. Night Shyamalan's The Village and Orwell's 1984. They were pretty much only permitted to stay in their section of the world and the government was this big scary creature that was covering up it's mistakes and sending out propaganda. It was a little weird how well adapted Rachel was when she didn't grow up with much social interaction besides her mother and there were no other children. I like all the talk in the greenhouse. This book helps you glimpse into the excitement of breeding plants a little. The writing style flows nicely and keeps you zipping right through the story. The characters are very nicely developed and all pretty like-able. I say read it, but hopefully she comes out with the sequel soon because really, I can't stand the wait.First Line:\"It seemed to Rachel that she had always lived on The Property, though this wasn't true.\"Favorite Line:\"Vivian's voice was low, but as hard as the grip she had on her daughter's wrist.\""}, {"userName": "Steph Su", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2010935-steph-su", "userReview": "THE LINE is an intriguing but unfortunately very slow start to what could be a great and unique series. It\u2019s extremely hard for me to pass judgment on this book on account of its \u201cfirst in a series\u201d symptoms. If you have a patient love for dystopian literature, you might really enjoy this book\u2026unless you put it down first due to its slow pace and youngish writing style.Teri Hall has created a scarily believable dystopian world where the government has taken on a whole new type of authority and people must abide by these strict laws or else risk their lives. The idea of living behind a boundary, forbidden to even wonder at what lies on the other side, can be seen as a metaphoric manifestation of a child\u2019s struggle between staying safe by his/her guardians\u2019 rules or venturing out to learn on one\u2019s own, sometimes breaking serious rules along the way. This comparison is subtle but will likely make THE LINE appeal most to late elementary/middle school readers, who will be enthralled by this dystopian world and not put off by the way the story is told.Indeed, the story is unfortunately quite slow and often not flavorful enough to make it truly stand out among others in its genre. The first two-thirds of the book is spent slowly explaining the state of their world via long-winded and stationary dialogues, with few discernable scenes that contribute to the plot instead of the background information. And the \u201cturning point\u201d\u2014Rachel\u2019s discovery of the message for help\u2014really doesn\u2019t kick the story into action either. I\u2019ll concede that what we glimpse of the Others is fascinating and will surely make this book\u2019s sequel, AWAY, an interesting read. However, too much time is spent on world-building, and not nearly enough on the development of the actual story.Ultimately, readers may find THE LINE lacking in aspects of plot, and elementary in its telling-instead-of-showing writing style. However, this book will surely find its audience in young fans of Margaret Peterson Haddix, for it is truly an intriguing concept."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41584-jan", "userReview": "Summary: A dystopia projecting what might happen if the US builds a defense wall (The Line) around the country. A war with another country interferes before the wall is complete and an area of the country is left undefended. The inhabitants are exposed to bio-weapons and are now considered contaminated. The new repressive government forbids contact with them. Rumors swirl about what has happened to them\u2026are they now mutated monsters? Rachel lives with her mother near The Line and one day meets one of the \u201cother\u201d from the Away side. Even though it means risking her and her mother\u2019s safety, she wants to help the Others. Theme: Dystopia based upon projection of current fears about immigration, terrorism and repressive government measures to combat terrorism. Reminded me of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopias or one of Shusterman\u2019s sci fi fantasies.Style: Omniscient narrative third person. Short sentences keep the action going. Author works in dystopic back story through main character reviewing \u201chistory\u201d with mother.Plot: The strength of this novel is the plot. It is fascinating to speculate about a forbidden country that has been abandoned by its government and the reader is eager to see what happens when Rachel contacts The Others. The end leaves room for a sequel, which I would be interested in reading. Characters: well developed. I wanted to learn more about them. Mrs. Moore was really interesting. I liked the moral dilemma developed by the author where Rachel\u2019s mother must sacrifice her desire to resist the government in order to protect her daughter."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1676535-lauren", "userReview": "Even before reading The Line, I just knew it had the possibility to be destined for great things. The cover? Creepy yet intriguing. The premise? Creative and had the probability to go in a lot of directions. Sadly, while I did enjoy The Line quite a bit, the execution of the said premise fell a little too flat, in my opinion. The characters were one of the most rewarding aspects of the story. Since, I admired Rachel, the main character, for always being strong and doing what she thought was right. Leaving me to easily be caught up in her story. Also, I enjoyed how Teri wrote the story from the four main characters perspectives ( Rachel's mom, Ms. Moore, and Jonathon) because it lead for a interesting twists by seeing the character's lives dealing with the line and it lead the story to have an ominous tone. Moving on, as I said before, I went into The Line thinking the whole book was going to be a suspenseful roller coaster like ride. And whle it did get there eventually, it didn't do so until the book was more than halfway over. On one side, I could understand why it was like this because The Line is going to be a series and in having a series that requires back-story, but at times that said back-story got in the way and left potential action to fall right through the cracks. Though, it did improve drastically by the end, making me defiantly want to read the sequel, Away, coming out next year, because of the jaw-dropping ending!In all, The Line is a pretty decent debut by Ms. Hall even with it's faults!

That's not a cliffhanger, that's a book cut in half. I appreciate the popularity of trilogies & series--I'm a fan myself--but this was a novella.Also, the writing was amateurish, especially the dialogue. Mom & teenage daughter shopping: \"Mom, this fish is going to be delicious.\" I know that's not the best example, but it's just one that stood out in my mind. We're not giving lines to a robot, it's a teenage girl--they don't talk like that.And the characterization left something to be desired. These people had compelling stories, but I never really cared, ya know?But, with that all being said, she really has a great idea here--I really liked the world she created and I'm curious to see where she goes with it. So even if it deserves 2 stars, I am giving Teri Hall the benefit of the doubt that the next one will be better."}, {"userName": "Ab", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1307950-ab", "userReview": "Buy at left-bank.comThis book reminded me of \"House of the Scorpion\" by Nancy Farmer, \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry, and \"Uglies\" by Scott Westerfeld. If you like those, you'll like this. It's about a girl who lives in the U.S. (that's \"Unified States\") years after the Line was set up to keep people in and out. A bomb was dropped during a war that the U.S. really was the bad guy in, though the textbooks and \"official\" stories have all been changed (sound familiar?), and the radiation caused them to seal off the U.S. from part of itself, now called \"Away\". So Rachel is curious about the Line and Away and the Others (the people living in Away) and her mother has a past as a revolutionary and is hiding from the government, which has turned in to an attacker of its people rather than a protector of its people. So it's a fast read, young adult novel, but I sense there are more to come."}, {"userName": "Abby Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson", "userReview": "Since she can remember, Rachel has lived near The Line, a force field erected to protect the United States from attackers - and to keep The Others out.
