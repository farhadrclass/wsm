'famous' in their particular world of: money, fashion, moviemaking, money. i remember much of it actually, i see more clearly after thirty years of other reading that this is a fantasy. early part, where the protagonist is poor little relation of rich, undergoes transformation as kind of Pygmalion, marries ridiculously wealthy man, who fortunately then dies through strokes... she is sort of sympathetic. meant to be, anyway. but then comes her mature transformation to shallow, image/clothes conscious, wealthy widow...less sympathetic...in this fantasy the sex is graphic, mostly good, somehow revealing character, and i understand this is 'class' trash. yes romance maybe but sex always. i do not know if the blurb contentions are true. i did not read this until late 80s. i think a girlfriend had seen a tv miniseries at a vulnerable age, rec this to me, certainly brought some world i did not know then, retrograde portrait of gays/lesbians, one point at which one says 'shopping is like a good f...', sincerely agreed to by character..so in the end, or rather up to the point i started skipping, i was reading this almost as a satire. an error in thought. this is a sincere fantasy, not meant to be loved as camp, but it was a decision of mine whether i would try one of those 'fifty shades...' or reread this. so i reread this. i was only rating it by memory the first time and how much was that because it worked for girls i knew? there is a sequel. i will not read it...question answered, well i did read it again...this is a later addition:okay this is a question: do i want to reread this? after almost 30 years? from a somewhat more educated or at least read perspective, from a thoughtful, independent, mature standpoint? well i am interested in reading my youth so... but then it is a long book. did i read the whole thing? questions questions... oh wait a sec, i have to find a copy? maybe i will read dickens instead...final question: do/did many men read this book? does not look like it...first review: this was maybe most interesting in that girlfriends liked it, but the rampant materialism, the glamour, the money, the brands, seem embarrassing now. this was a book of the late-eighties (when i read it). i confess, one serious girlfriend loved being a (part time) model so i guess this is what i wanted, too. i was young, i was attracted to surface glitter. i think i read this through trying to discover what women want: money and sex. preferably, moneyed sex. this is before there was this sex and the city tv show, so maybe similar was vicarious pleasure of the times. plus ca change\u2026"}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "I loved Judith Krantz's books when I was in my twenties and still find anything contra to my own culture and old traditional values exciting.

Usually an overdose ruins a romance for me.

I think the main waste of potential was Billy as a protagonist. She was by far the most captivating character and the easiest to sympathize with for her humble, insecure beginnings but her page time was in competition with like five other mediocre characters. The entire time I was reading I kept asking myself \"why?\" Why make a book about this modern Cinderella type woman and her boutique and then devote hundreds of pages to supportive filler bullshit like Spider's obsession with a depressed model? Why put so much heart and genuinely good dialogue only sporadically into composition and then write a scene where a pregnant woman drips amniotic fluid behind her at the Oscars while looking for an earring? Why make a nearly 600 page book about self-obsessed, driven, rich people who can't make up their minds? The only answer I can put together is that this was an eager attempt at a late Valley of the Dolls knockoff. It's not completely horrible. Billy is a decent character and some parts are more entertaining than others, but you will forget the whole thing as soon as you turn the last page."}, {"userName": "Meghan Pochebit", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/783032-meghan-pochebit", "userReview": "Trashy.

So I thought it was time to read some Scruples. Especially since there might be a movie or show soon? Gotta beat the rush. And what did I think? Yes, it's trash. But most of it is pretty good trash! We have: an awkward, overweight girl from an upper crust Boston family who goes to Paris and becomes a swan, as one only can in Paris; a California boy, who believes in beautiful women (taking beautiful pictures of them, and sleeping with them, which is just so cliche); and a French/Irish girl with mermaid eyes (whatever that means) who comes to New York to make it as a designer. Billy, our swan, goes to secretarial school and becomes the happy wife of an older man, the founder of the company she works at, of course. We have some further scandal from her when her husband suffers from strokes and becomes an invalid at their Bel Air home. But! Then she gets involved with a Hollywood producer and snore...The whole book turns into Billy, her hubby, and various people making a movie. This seems like it's straight from the author's actual life, so I can see how that would creep in there, but it took the book in a different direction that I didn't like as much.Spider, our California boy is equally boring. He's flat, he's typical, his story gives us nothing. Unsurprisingly, Chad Michael Murray is in talks to play him in the movie(? show?). He seems eye-rolling-worthy enough.Valentine, of the mermaid eyes, has a shocking relationship toward the beginning of the book, then spends most of the book in a boring affair. Who she ends up with in the end isn't a surprise, nor is it particularly pleasant. It's actually pretty cheese-filled.There's also a whole lot in the middle and end of the book about a journalist whose name I can't remember (Maggie?), and it doesn't say much about her that I don't think she's even mentioned in this Wikipedia write-up. She was about as pathetic as Spider, if that tells you anything.The book was still a fast read, and I did like the first third to half of it. I think I'm mainly giving it three stars because of the potential it had--money!, sex!!, scandal!!!--and not so much what it actually is--some boring characters, also some completely irrelevant characters, a so-so ending."}, {"userName": "Lila Veen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16083010-lila-veen", "userReview": "I knew I'd love this book.

But this is how to end a book with a HEA. Judith Krantz probably didn't even think to write a sequel until years later, right? Everything happened that I wanted but it still left me wanting more.

It was about money and fashion, fame and glamour. I don't really remember the sex scenes, but I do remember Krantz's descriptions of outfits, interiors, store merchandise and scenes. Her later novels became something of a joke, and eventually became Lifetime movies starring Valerie Bertinelli. This one was different. And I think that is the brilliance of this book.
