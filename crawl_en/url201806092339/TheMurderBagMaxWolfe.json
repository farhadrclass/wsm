Detective Max Wolfe is new in the Homicide division of London's West End Central, 27 Savile Row and he and his colleague must find out who is behind the killings and why?The first time I became acquainted with Max Wolfe was in the short novella Dead Time that is set between this book and the next one; The Slaughter Man. I liked him and his family; daughter Scout and dog Stan immediately. So, when my mother saw a show on the telly where they discussed this book did I remember that I had it and of course, being the good daughter that I am decided to read the book to see if it would be something for my mother to read. \u00a0Well, that and because I wanted to read it, well mostly because I wanted to read it.Anyway, this was a real page-turner that in the end turned into my favorite kind of game; how long after midnight can I stay awake and read is it called. I stopped playing this game until around 00:45 am because my eyes started to get wonky. So, I continued next day and could hardly put the book down.This is a really good book, it's very dark, but so engrossing and I just adore little Scout and Stan. Max is a single father\u00a0and you get to know why a bit later in the book and let me tell you, the knowledge of why made me really pissed off. I vaguely remember reading something about the situation in the novella, but I really need to read it again now that I have read this book.The murders are brutal and even I found some parts hard to read and I thought that I was\u00a0quite used to read about the awful things men to each other, but it seems that there are still parts of me that find some readings hard.The Murder Bag was a well written and captivating book, full of twists all the way until the end of the book.I received this copy from the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "This is Tony Parsons first foray into the crime genre. That he usually writes contemporary family dramas shows in his creation of his characters, particularly his detective, DC Max Wolfe. Max is separated from his wife who has left him for another man, leaving their young daughter Scout behind with Max. Recently assigned to Homicide, he must juggle the demands of the job with those of being a single parent.The prologue to the book throws us straight into a brutal gang rape and murder of a teenage girl. Twenty years later Max is involved in investigating the similar murders of two seemingly unconnected victims when he realises that they attended the same exclusive boarding School and that several other high profile men could be at risk.This is a clever story, quite gripping in parts with a number of twists and turns. The characters are well written and the research into police procedures and murder weapons held by the police museum added authenticity."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "3.5* Dosta pisaca na engleskom u poslednje vreme okre\u0107e se pisanju krimi\u0107a (bilo da su ranije pisali ljubi\u0107e ili neki drugi \u017eanr) jer to se u Britaniji i Americi najbolje prodaje...

My thanks for the opportunity.This is the first novel in a new crime series penned by Tony Parsons, author of \nMan and Boy\n and other novels, none of them crime related. I was keen to see how he went with venturing into this new genre of writing and was happy to find this book a really enjoyable and good read.I REALLY liked the plot, I thought it worked really well and the entire book moved at a solid pace, not too fast, not too slow, just right. Great plotting, great characters and some twists you won't see coming. Smashing!Twenty years ago seven rich, privileged students became friends at their exclusive private school, Potter\u2019s Field. Now they have started dying in the most violent way imaginable. Pretty horrific deaths going on that's for sure.The book starts with a scenario that kicks off the book sharply featuring these seven boys whilst they were in their school days, it's pretty in your face stuff to start out with. But it gives us important background to the rest of the novel.Detective Max Wolfe has recently arrived in the Homicide division of London\u2019s West End Central, 27 Savile Row. He's a great character, I really liked him a lot, he's a bit of a maverick detective that is passionate about his work but I loved the way we got to see his softer side in his relationship with his daughter and the man when he is at home. He's soon hot on the trail piecing together not only who is killing these men, but what the connection is and the WHY of the killing spree, he's got a serial killer on his hands and he's determined to uncover the truth and get answers. He's not afraid to put himself in danger either, sometimes rather recklessly in his pursuit of the bad guys, he's a bold one our Max. There are secrets, lies and deception going on. It's messy and complex this case. I liked the writing style, it flowed well. He's not afraid to tackle some graphic scenarios, you need that in a good crime novel in my opinion. Especially where a serial killer is involved.It's good crime reading, it held my attention from the first page until the last, I was eager to see who the killer was, eager to see justice done and liked some of the moments in the book that complicated the investigation. I can tell Tony has done his research into terminology used in police procedures and investigations for this novel, he drops it in all the way through, perhaps a touch too much but it wasn't enough to interfere with my reading of the book.I like Max Wolfe and will be absolutely reading the next book in the series. A cracking read."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3908840-sue", "userReview": "\u201cThe Murder Bag\u201d aka The Murder Man (Max Wolfe #1) is the first novel in a new crime series by Tony Parsons, bestselling British author of Man and Boy. This is the author\u2019s first outing into the crime genre, and it is definitely a winner. For clarification, there are two names for this book; Murder Bag and Murder Man. I believe Murder Bag was the UK title and Murder Man was the US title.DC Max Wolfe, is a single parent to his five year old daughter, \u201cScout\u201d, and dog, \u2018Stan\u201d, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Max had originally worked as a surveillance officer, under the Counter Terrorism Command, in London\u2019s West end, until he was transferred to the Homicide & Serious Crime Command, under the direction of DCI Victor Mallory. I love how Max doesn\u2019t follow orders\u2026he follows his own tune!\u201cSeven schoolboys in military uniform, grinning at the camera twenty years ago.\u201d Potter\u2019s Field College is a boarding school for boys thirteen to eighteen in the combined Cadet Force.The first one, \u201cJames Sutcliffe\u201d committed suicide and had suffered from depression. Now there were six.Max is called to investigate a brutal murder, an Investment Banker, \"Hugo Buck\", is found with his throat slit. Now there were five. As more bodies turn up, DC Wolfe, suspects he is looking for a serial killer. The media are calling the serial killer, \u201cBob the Butcher\u201d. But why were these men dying? What is the connection?The\u201d Murder Bag\u201d became the \u201cdoctor\u2019s bag\u201d for modern homicide investigation. The murder bag itself is a forensic bag used at murder scenes.This is a solid fast-paced steady crime novel that held my attention from beginning to end. Information and clues are revealed on a need-to-know basis. Great plot and moving characters. I enjoyed this book so much that I went ahead and ordered the next book in the series, \u201cThe Slaughter Man\u201d, and was recently approved for \u201cDead Time\u201d from Netgalley, a DC Max Wolfe Short Story."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "Do some people deserve to die?In their schooldays, seven boys at Potter's Field, an exclusive school for the very rich, become friends.

It soon becomes apparent that Hugo and his school friends from Potter's Field school are under threat. I had problems with this read. I loved the opening chapters, with the dramatic scene of attack on the girl and the introduction to Wolfe. However it all went down hill from there. I found the scenes with Wolfe's daughter and the dog unnecessary and overly sentimental. The plot was pretty average and predictable. It was obvious that the writer had put a great deal of effort into research. I liked the Black Museum references and the ones relating to real life crimes. Overall I felt this was a fair attempt at a crime novel, but for me it sadly didn't work."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4501926-richard", "userReview": "This is a very modern book which will not appeal to all fans of crime fiction, indeed I expect it may split people 50:50 a bit like Marmite.It is an action thriller about a maverick police office, DC Max Wolfe who to say is impulsive is to imply the Pope may be Catholic as they say. He, that is Wolfe, not the Pontiff, is head strong, follows his hunches rather than the line of command and ultimately is instinctive. Happily he is flawed, prone to mistakes and not always the best with people. A senior police officer implies that Wolfe is the reason the Police are not routinely armed. However, for all his many faults he is a great Father and loves his daughter more than life itself.The book takes a while to settle down; more like modern poetry with stylised prose rather than simple narrative or engaging story telling. Yet it is gripping and if you can get over this you are swept along it what quickly becomes a compelling read. All the elements of a clever crime/murder/serial killer plot with original situations and elements.I personally enjoyed Max and the dwelling on his personal/home life had me worried for his nearest and dearest throughout the book.This is the first of what promises to be a new series based around this character. That bodes well as although he is well defined here there are plenty of aspects to explore. I must say though I found it strange that for someone who exists to love his daughter so much is so blas\u00e9 about his own personal safety. He seems to spend more time in hospital than a Consultant.Tony Parsons is an excellent journalist and reviewer, as seen on TV, with this book he will enhance his reputation as a novelist. With The Murder Bag he has laid out his credentials as an author of crime drama, detective fiction at its thrilling best for a modern time, I for one will follow this new career path with great interest, but then I love Marmite."}, {"userName": "Heena Rathore P.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19253213-heena-rathore-p", "userReview": "This book is by far the best crime book I've read in last couple of years!The plot is TOTALLY AWESOME!This book kept me on the edge of my seat all the time and it was unbelievably impossible for me to not read it in one sitting.

With all the pre-publicity hype and long build-up to its release, I was keen to read this, but was it a gripping read, or less of a murder, and more of a mixed bag? Knowing the blood, sweat and tears that accompanies the writing of a crime book, from crime writers of my acquaintance, I am always wary of being too critical of books, but as a voracious and consistent reader of the genre, I was a little disappointed and perplexed by this book for several reasons, and would slightly question the plaudits afforded to it by other reviewers. So seeking to keep my \u2018firm but fair\u2019 reputation intact, here are my observations\u2026The story is basic enough, with a group of men from privileged backgrounds, linked by their school years, finding themselves being picked off one by one, for some reason as yet unknown. Enter intrepid detective, Max Wolfe- not quite a believable maverick, not quite a complete dullard- single father of cutesy five year old girl with all the mawkish sentimentality that underpins this relationship- with a dog, Stan, who I felt more intimately acquainted with than many of the human protagonists. I think it\u2019s fair to say that The Murder Bag, is not in any way re-inventing the wheel in terms of the crime fiction genre. Indeed, in my reading of it, I felt that quite possibly the author has invested a lot of time in reading a selection of other crime writers, and extracting the best elements of several to be combined into his plot. Hence, what is produced is a curious mix of the solidity of the British police procedural, combined with the more salacious brutality of an American crime novel, with neither really working in tandem with the other.Also, it is abundantly clear that some serious amount of research into police practices, forensic profiling, social networking, the Iraq War, etc had been undertaken, but in a similar way to other over-researched thrillers (Dan Brown- I\u2019m looking at you), I did feel slightly bruised and battered by the amount of information crowbarred in, and its disturbance of the equilibrium of the plot overall. Consequently, I felt the book was rather stilted in its realisation and dialogue, and despite a promising opening did seem to lose its way from that point. There is a rather superfluous romantic entanglement for Wolfe along the way that added nothing tangible to the overall plot, and with the patchy unfolding of the murder plot itself, I found my attention wandering although I did not quite reach the point of giving up on it altogether, which does count for something I suppose.Overall a pretty disappointing read, but sure that with an endorsement by Lee Child and the solidity of the author\u2019s previous fictional output it will do well enough. Not a ground-breaking criminal debut for Parsons, but will undoubtedly not be the last of this series, as there is enough to warrant another foray with Max Wolfe in the future."}, {"userName": "Dimitris Passas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19705183-dimitris-passas", "userReview": "\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2.

We are shown from the very start of this novel that Wolfe is a man who flagrantly breaks the rules \u2013 sometimes, of course, that can be a good thing, but had one of his hunches in this book gone wrong his career might have ended rather swiftly. Quite often his behaviour seems rather too impulsive and you understand why his superior, Elizabeth Swire, becomes infuriated with him. However, a rather important act where he breaks several rules at once, at the beginning of the book, means that he is promoted to homicide. This is important for Wolfe, who has longed to work with Detective Chief Inspector Victor Malloy; someone he has immense respect for and looks to as something of a mentor. Wolfe\u2019s first case in homicide is when he and Molloy are called to investigate the death of a banker, whose throat has been violently slashed. An obvious suspect is his wife who, having caught him being unfaithful, had posted their marital bed to his office (meaning I liked her before I had even met her). However, shortly afterwards, there is another death \u2013 this time of a homeless man. At first, it seems that there can be no discernable link between the City banker and a down and out drug user, but it turns out that the two men both went to the same school \u2013 the exclusive, and expensive, Potter\u2019s Field. Wolfe finds a photograph of a group of schoolboys who have something in common; they are being murdered. .. The answers to these crimes lay in the past and a crime which took place many years before. Worse, someone on the internet is claiming to be the killer and people are applauding the deaths of these ex-public schoolboys , while their friends are now fearful of being the next victim.This is a fast paced and exciting book, with a good cast of characters. I did, however, find the over emphasis on Wolfe\u2019s love of dogs rather wearing. Almost everyone in the book has a dog, loves dogs, and they are linked to Potter\u2019s Field as well. I felt like saying, \u201cwe get the dogs, please shut up about them now!\u201d At times I felt as though I was in some awful \u2018cozy\u2019 gone wrong, where a dog would end up solving the case. Secondly, I was not thrilled with the way female characters were represented in the storyline. Wolfe\u2019s boss, Swire, is described as a kind of Thatcherite warrior, while other women are either headstrong, but need rescuing, are having affairs, are bad mothers or show various other disagreeable character traits. When Wolfe was actually out solving the case, the whole book came to life. The class of schoolboys, now successful lawyers, army officers and MP\u2019s, are wonderfully realised and it is obvious that they are not telling the police all that they know. This is the first in a series and it was well plotted, but hopefully, by book two, the author will concentrate slightly more on the mystery (which was really good) and less on the detective\u2019s problems at home.Lastly, I received a copy of this book from the publishers, via NetGalley, for review."}, {"userName": "Vanessa Loockx", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30687177-vanessa-loockx", "userReview": "Wel dit boek is aangeraden door mijn collega die me ooit Harlan Coben heeft aangeraden.

The plot is a little convoluted, and on a couple of occasions the coincidences a little too obvious, but overall it was a very enjoyable read.This gritty first Max Wolfe novel, already has me wanting to read the next in series."}, {"userName": "Alexandra (matobookalo)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35198025-alexandra-matobookalo", "userReview": "\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf (\u03bc\u03b7 \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2), \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03c2. \u0388\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae \u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c1\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc. \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf!"}, {"userName": "Vasilis Kalandaridis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21357414-vasilis-kalandaridis", "userReview": "\u03a9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bf.\u03a3\u03c6\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03ae \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae,\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2,\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae.\u0399\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u039b\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac anyway."}, {"userName": "Steffi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4676630-steffi", "userReview": "Ich war sehr gespannt auf \"Dein finsteres Herz\" und bin auch sehr gut in das Buch reingekommen.Max Wolfe fand ich als Ermittler sehr sympathisch und mal auf eine andere Art ungew\u00f6hnlich, denn er ist alleinerziehender Vater. Zwischen den ganzen trinkenden und abgewrackten Ermittler war dies mal eine nette und sehr erfrischende Abwechslung. Der Fall selbst hat ebenfalls ein gro\u00dfes Potential, aber gleichzeitig auch eine Menge Luft nach oben. Es geht viel durcheinander, manche Spr\u00fcnge sind so gro\u00df, dass man das Gef\u00fchl hat Dinge zu verpassen und ich des \u00f6fteren zur\u00fcckgebl\u00e4ttert habe, um Passagen noch einmal zu lesen.Ein richtiges Spannungsgef\u00fchl kam bei mir leider nur selten auf und manche Abschnitte waren dann doch eher langweilig. Vieles erschien mir zu konstruiert und zu gewollt. Auch die Aufl\u00f6sung konnte mich nur bedingt \u00fcberzeugen.Da dies ein Deb\u00fctroman ist, habe ich gro\u00dfe Hoffnung, dass mir der zweite Teil der Max Wolfe Reihe besser gefallen wird."},

toils and work.Max Wolfe, what a powerful name albeit a wee bit cliche, is a policeman whom is not so much a team player and views the world somewhat different than the average policeman. When the book opens Max is busy with a known terrorist and he alone sees him taking action. What happens next you'll learn reading the story but it leads to him getting a job at the homicide squad. The commanding officer of the squad being a bit Yoda, their superior is the token nitwit who is busier stroking politics than doing police work.Wolfe gets involved in a series of murders that involve the victims being part of a private school where they did some major misbehaving and it is biting their backsides or better put it is cutting their throats. The whole attitude is a wee bit cliche and for the better reader of thrillers the actual killer(s) are not that difficult to guess once they have made their entry in Parsons tale. Even the ultimate baddie is recognizable fairly quick (it being a wee bit of a cliche too). The best bits in the book are about Wolfe his daughter Scout and their dog Stan.Is it a bad book?- Heck no it is very well written albeit a bit to predictable for my taste. There are far better books about serial killers this one while well written and easy to read is just too average in a genre that has brought far better, original & unpredictable novels."}, {"userName": "Sarah England", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18148973-sarah-england", "userReview": "Not bad, and I'd certainly read the next one. Plenty twists and turns so - although I'd guessed a couple, not everything was entirely expected. My only gripe is something Kathy Reichs is terrible for - shoe-horning in exposition and explanations in the most contrived way. For example, if some acronym or bit of jargon is used, they will feature some character looking confused thus signalling someone else to carefully explain in the most excruciatingly artificial way. Just stick it in the normal text, for godsakes. Besides, Parsons went too far here, and got his history completely wrong - not only referring to the War of the Roses (rather than WarS - it was hardly a standalone event) but also putting it in entirely in the wrong period. A school chapel founded (so insistently in this book) by Henry VIII could not have been 'interrupted' in its building by the \"war\" of the Roses. They had finished 24 years before he came to the throne.

Then a homeless man, Adam Jones, is murdered in the same way. At first it looks as if they have nothing in common until the same photograph of seven students at an exclusive private school turns up in each of the men\u2019s possessions. As the other students in the photograph are being picked off and murdered Detective Max Wolfe has to find the killer..and soon.This book started off so well with the prologue depicting the murder of a young woman which is both shocking and disturbing. If the rest of the book had concentrated on the crime it would have made a much better book. Tony Parsons usual fare is based on relationships, so I suppose it\u2019s fairly natural for him to want to include a lot of his detective\u2019s relationships in this book. Unfortunately the relationships are wholly sentimental and do not work in the midst of a crime book. Whole chapters devoted to his daughter and their dog. Picking a fight with a man because he\u2019s laughing at his dog. It was really wearing. I like some background on the protagonists, you need to get to know them but this was just mawkish sentimentality.I also had a large problem with one aspect of his relationship with his wife. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers away but we are given information at the start of the book that strongly suggests one thing and your feelings are in accordance with what has been suggested. Then later on in the book it turns out that it is something else entirely and I was not impressed. I love twists and turns in a book but this was neither; I felt this was dishonest and the character was deceitful for no reason whatsoever. The issue had nothing to do with the crime and could easily have been set out honestly from the start. I lost any empathy I had and really couldn\u2019t be bothered with Wolfe\u2019s domestic situation after that. It may have bothered me more than it should but that\u2019s the way it is.I did enjoy the crime story. There was decent plotting and lots of real twists and turns that were well done. There was lots of research into police procedurals, which really didn\u2019t all have to be transferred to the page: trying to find the knife used in the attacks was long-winded. The detail about The Black Museum, an actual museum of criminal artifacts in London, was really interesting.Overall, the crime story was enjoyable but be aware there is a lot of background sentimentality and if you can cope with that it\u2019s not a bad read.I give it three stars but it\u2019s probably nearer two and a half for me.***Many thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for sending me the copy."}, {"userName": "Kortessa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44020185-kortessa", "userReview": "The \"Murder Bag\" is a book which I started reading with great anticipation.
