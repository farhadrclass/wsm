It was weird for me, for, in spite of how fascinating she is, I felt compelled to avert my gaze, as if I were peeping at the nakedness of a divinity, as if I were staring presumptuously into a sacred fire. How could the image of one woman, dead for fifty years, still channel so powerfully the archetype of The Goddess? My Story provides a few hints, but no real answers.Perhaps it is easier for The Goddess to possess a girl who is unsure of her own identity. Young Norma Jean Mortenson was unsure of everything: who her parents were, what it might feel like to be loved, even the legitimacy of the name by which she was called. (She did not know her father, but she knew his name was not \u201cMortenson.\u201d) Later, when she began to \u201cdevelop,\u201d she felt alienated from her own body, and thought of it as something other than herself, her \u201cmagic friend.\u201d She states that she never realized her \u201cmagic friend\u201d was causing sexual feelings in the boys in her math class, because she, at this stage in her life, had no sexual feelings at all. Sure, she consciously dressed in a revealing sweater, and practiced a new \u201clanguorous\u201d walk, but still she continued to be bemused and surprised at her effect on the men around her. Perhaps that way it was easier for The Goddess to begin to do her work. I think, though, that one of the most intriguing thing about My Story is the presence (and absence) of the voice of its ghost writer, the legendary screen-writer Ben Hecht (Scarface, Twentieth Century, Nothing Sacred, and more than a score of uncredited contributions to classics such as A Star is Born, Gone With the Wind, and The Shop Around the Corner). A couple of years after he scripted one of her best early comic performances (Monkey Business), he was hired to get her story down on paper, based on personal interviews and taped conversations. I surmise that the cynical ex-newspaper reporter only gradually warmed to the collaboration, that he often wearied of her tearful delivery and her doeful revelations: his nicknames for her were \u201cthe Ex-Orphan\u201d and \"La Belle Bumps and Tears.\" Eventually, though, Hecht seemed to see her emotional reaction as an advantage for him, for as he remarked, \u201cthe moment a true thing comes out of her mouth, her eyes shed tears. She's like her own Lie Detector.\" The completed memoir was also supposed to include her ascension to stardom, Gentleman Prefer Blondes, the death of her Aunt Grace, and her wish to give birth to a child. But\u2014alas!--the marriage with DiMaggio became too combative, and the whole project was scrapped. Hecht does an excellent job of re-creating the voice of the wide-eyed Norma Jean, but there are moments\u2014references to pushcart peddlers, a sexual \u201cvampire,\u201d a woman with a rose in her teeth\u2014that sound more like the voice of the 60-year-old screenwriter than the superstar still in her late 20's. And there's one anecdote--about a nice young war veteran hawking miniature silver stars in Union Station who asks Norma Jean to marry him--which sounds just like one of Hecht's \"cold city with a warm heart\" vignettes, straight out of something like his own Miracle in the Rain. But that's okay. Looking for the ghost of the cynical old screenwriter in this book's simple, well-crafted prose is one of the fascinating pleasures of reading My Story."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "The story behind My Story, the only book credited to Marilyn Monroe, is beguiling as almost everything that has orbited the screen sex goddess since her death in 1962 at the age of 36. Published in 1974 by Stein and Day under the title The Unfinished Biography of Marilyn Monroe, the book is a collection of anecdotes by Monroe and Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky in 1954 to acclaimed screenwriter Ben Hecht, who'd been hired as ghostwriter on a Marilyn autobiography. Hecht's abandoned work was later revised and published by photographer Milton Greene, who established rights to the manuscript and whose photos of Monroe are included in the book.Monroe's anecdotes focus on her impoverished childhood as an orphan in Los Angeles, her struggle to prove she could make a living as a motion picture actress and some of the experiences she had along the way. Historical detail is fleeting, emotional truth runs high. Her first marriage (at age 16 to James Doughtery) and second marriage (to Joe DiMaggio at age 28) are covered briefly, as is her sexual abuse as a foster child and failed romances, to lovers who are named or remain unnamed. These accounts are more candid than I expected, particularly when they come to Monroe's openness about her depression and feelings of intellectual inferiority. Highlights include:-- My mother's best friend was a woman named Grace. I called nearly everybody I knew Aunt or Uncle, but Aunt Grace was a different sort of make believe relative. She became my best friend, too. Aunt Grace worked as a film librarian in the same studio as my mother--Columbia Pictures. She was the first person who ever patted my head or touched my cheek. That happened when I was eight. I can still remember how thrilled I felt when her kind hand touched me.-- My admirers all said the same thing in different ways. It was my fault, their wanting to kiss and hug me. Some said it was the way I looked at them--with eyes full of passion. Others said it was my voice that lured them on. Still others said I gave off vibrations that floored them. I always felt they were talking about somebody else, not me. It was like being told they were attracted to me because of my diamonds and rubies. I not only had no passion in me, I didn't even know what it meant.-- The Hollywood I knew was the Hollywood of failure. Nearly everybody I met suffered from malnutrition or suicide impulses. We ate at drugstore counters. We sat in waiting rooms. We were the prettiest tribe of panhandlers that ever overran a town. And there were so many of us! Beauty contest winners, flashy college girls, home grown sirens from every state in the union. From cities and farms. From factories, vaudeville circuits, dramatic schools, and one from an orphan asylum. And around us were the wolves.-- There's another sort of man I've never liked--the sort that's afraid of insulting you. They always end up insulting you worse than anybody. I much prefer a man to be a wolf and, if he has decided to make a pass at me, to make it and have it over with. First of all, a pass is never entirely unpleasant because men who make passes are usually bright and good-looking. Secondly, you don't have to sit around with a wolf and listen to a lot of double talk about income taxes and what's wrong with the situation in India while he gets up enough courage to get into action.-- The truth is I've never fooled anyone. I've let men sometimes fool themselves. Men sometimes didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them--and fooling them. I have even tried to be straightforward with women. This is more difficult than being straightforward with men. Men are often pleased when you tell them the truth about how you feel. But very few women want to hear the truth--if it's going to be in any way annoying. As far as I can make out, women's friendships with each other are based on a gush of lies and pretty speeches than mean nothing. You'd think they were all trying to seduce each other the way they flatter and flirt when they're together.-- We sat a long time and discussed a new name for me. The casting director had suggested I think up some more glamorous name than Norma Dougherty. \"The man at the studio suggested Marilyn,\" I said. \"That's a nice name,\" my Aunt said, \"and it fits with your mother's maiden name.\" I didn't know what that was. \"She was a Monroe,\" said Aunt Grace. \"Her family goes way back. I have some papers and letters I'm keeping for your mother. They show that she was related to President Monroe of the United States.\"-- Success came to me in a rush. It surprised my employers much more than it did me. Even if I had played only bit parts in a few films, all the movie magazines and newspapers started printing my picture and giving me write-ups. I used to tell lies in my interviews--chiefly about my mother and father. I'd say she was dead--and he was somewhere in Europe. I lied because I was ashamed to have the world know my mother was in a mental institution--and that I had been born \"out of wedlock\" and never heard my illegal father's voice.There are at least three versions of any story: my version, your version and the truth. Based on what amounts to little more than a coffee table book, My Story definitely made me hungry for more details about Norma Jean Baker/ Marilyn Monroe. The icon's name alone brings to mind a mutant from the X-Men comic books, like Raven Darkh\u00f6lme/ Mystique. Norma Jean has a past as obscure as her identity. Marilyn is a powerful chameleon who had a profound impact on the mortals she came into contact with.

I've never imagined her to be such a deep and wonderful writer! I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I can tell you that as of this moment, this woman has become one of my favorite characters! She's become one of my teachers!She taught me a very important lesson: not to judge people, and to know that when I judge people I actually judge myself! When I say: \"Marilyn is a bad person\", I actually say: \"I'm a bad person\"!!!\"People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of a mirror instead of a person. They didn\u2019t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts. Then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.\u201dAfter I finished this amazing memoir, I mourned Marilyn. Her entire life - especially her childhood - was tragic! Now, when I look at her pictures I see a huge amount of bitterness in her eyes! I know now that, regardless of her enormous fame, she was a very sad person!She was just a little innocent sweet girl, who wanted to be happy. She didn't know her father, and her mother was sent to a mental institution when Marilyn was little! Her only family was her aunt Grace.{ this is one of my favorite parts }:\"But there was no bitterness in my aunt. Her heart remained tender, and she believed in God. Nearly everybody I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him. But when Grace talked about God, she touched my cheek and said that He loved me and watched over me.

I wish it was longer. It answers all the questions about Marilyn's youth and takes you up until she starts touring with the troops. She was a very smart lady. It does make me wonder, however, why every Marilyn biopic totally screws up the story of her youth. You can read it in her own words! There's no excuse to get the story wrong! And it's very dramatic, so it's not like any drama is added by changing the story. See? This is why I prefer autobiographies. Other people screw up the details.

No entanto esta personalidade \u00e9 uma das personalidades que mais me tem inspirado ao longo da minha curta vida. Pois ela foi capaz de lutar pelos seus sonhos, por mais que os outros dissessem que ela n\u00e3o podia. Come\u00e7ou por ser modelo, depois actriz e actualmente \u00e9 um \u00edcone de moda para muitas gera\u00e7\u00f5es. O mundo s\u00f3 a valorizou realmente depois de ela ter morrido. Porque ser\u00e1 que o ser humano s\u00f3 reconhece o talento dos verdadeiros artistas depois de eles estarem mortos?Este livro \u00e9 um conjunto de desabafos escritos pela pr\u00f3pria Marilyn Monroe. Conhecemos a sua dura inf\u00e2ncia, os seus medos, os seus sonhos e os seus amores. Entendemos que na verdade ela era uma mulher bastante fr\u00e1gil e solit\u00e1ria. N\u00e3o mostrava realmente para os outros quem realmente era.Foi um livro muito agrad\u00e1vel de se ler. A muito tempo que queria ler algo escrito por Marilyn. Sei que tamb\u00e9m escreveu poemas. Assisti o document\u00e1rio que fizeram sobre a sua vida. E por fim por dois anos ou tr\u00eas passou uma s\u00e9rie na TV intitulada \"Smash\" que foi inspirada na figura de Marilyn Monroe. Durante muito tempo foi a minha s\u00e9rie favorita. E ainda hoje adoro ouvir as m\u00fasicas (pois tinha o formato de um espect\u00e1culo de Broadway). Marilyn Monroe \u00e9 uma figura que deve ser mais valorizada, n\u00e3o pelo seu corpo bonito mas pela sua inteligente mente."}, {"userName": "Paria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL":

transitions Norma Jean Mortensen , who spent her childhood in a procession of foster homes and unyielding poverty made to become the Marilyn Monroe of legends. I haven't read much about Monroe, but still found her story to be tragic. Elton John's famous tribute to her story, Candle In The Wind likens her to a candle in the wind \"never knowing who to turn to when the rain came in \" and at least in this story which certainly captures her vulnerability, we see that to be true. As the continued lyrics say, I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid, the candle burned out long before the legend ever did. The heartbreaking part is that the great acceptance and recognition she so longed for did finally arrive ... just much too late and for the most part posthumously after her life was cut short at age 36. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "\u0641\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647\u062f", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5008212", "userReview": "\u0642\u0635\u062a\u064a.. \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0646\u0631\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0646\u0631\u0648 \u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0633\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0635\u0639\u0648\u0628\u0629 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0636\u0648\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0641\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0637\u0641\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0639\u0627\u0634\u062a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0635\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0639 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0634\u0648\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0643\u064a\u0646\u064a\u062f\u064a \u2013 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u062a\u0631\u062d \u0623\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0631\u062a \u0643\u064a\u0646\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0645\u0642\u062a\u0644\u0647\u0627 -\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0633\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0632\u0646 \u0646\u062c\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u062f\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u0642\u0637\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0641\u060c \u0647\u0644 \u0647\u064a \u0636\u063a\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0633\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0633\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0644\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644 \u064a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0633\u0642\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646\u061f \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627!!

Lavishly illustrated with photos of Marilyn taken by renowned photographer Milton H. Greene, this special book celebrates the life and career of an American icon\u2014from the unique perspective of the icon herself.There is apparently some doubt as to whether or not Marilyn actually wrote the words in this book, or if someone else did it for her. In either case, there is a poignancy about the book that is haunting.Like many women growing up when I did, Marilyn was definitely a screen star in every sense of the word. Larger than life, glamorous, enviable...But then the image began to slip a bit, with stories of her various mishaps\u2014her unreliability, her marital discords, her futile attempts to have a baby. Then one tragic night in August 1962, the whirlwind life of Marilyn was over. But the stories continued as the media ruthlessly circled the life and times of Marilyn, speculating about whether or not she died accidentally, or in a suicide attempt. Then later, there were conspiracy theories, hints of murder. But none of those questions were answered.When I bought this illustrated tome a couple of years ago, I was hoping to find information not previously known to the public. Perhaps a peek into her world through her own eyes. Hearing the story in her words (if they are her words) satisfied some of that curiosity; she came across as a wounded, but spirited woman who always dreamed big, despite the odds. She conveyed that famously described depth often belied by the surface exterior.The most chilling words in this \"memoir\" are the prescient vision she had of herself as \"the kind of girl they found dead in the hall bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.\"None of us growing up in the fifties will ever forget Marilyn, and her story lives on in the various books out there. But her own story in her own words adds significantly to the collection.I give \"My Story\" four stars, primarily because so much is left unanswered....but then again, at the end of this book, the collaborator's note says: \"This is where Marilyn's manuscript ended when she gave it to me.\" A book unfinished, perhaps\u2014just like her life."}, {"userName": "Flora", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873514-flora", "userReview": "Her unfinished memoir, and a spare, no-nonsense one. It by no means aims for thoroughness, and in fact simply offers a series of brief, haunting accounts of episodes in her life, most of which have little or nothing to do with her stardom. The first chapter, for instance, is called, \"How I Rescued a White Piano,\" and delivers with disarming matter-of-factness an innocuous little story that reveals more about her tragic childhood than if she had addressed it directly. If this book had been a novel about a completely made-up person, I'd be utterly taken with it and its author.

More than a memoir, what we have here is a collection of vignettes and anecdotes. After she goes to Hollywood, there's no real chronology. I found it odd that she would refer to her then-husband repeatedly as \"Mr DiMaggio\" instead of \"Joe\" or \"my future husband, Joe DiMaggio\"--maybe that's an indication of how things were going.What gave me the cold shivers was when she described the let-down of first being signed into the Studio System, and then dumped a year later. Suddenly she was \"unphotogenic\", \"not the type we're looking for\", \"not star material.\" (Personally I think dumping the heavy false eyelashes would have helped, but that's just me). She talks about realising that her promising career is probably already over: \"I knew who I was. I was the kind of girl who is found dead in a hall bedroom with an empty sleeping pill bottle near her hand.\"Brrrr! Considering that's pretty much how she was found....I remember reading the section on \"Men\" in a woman's magazine in the early 70s, probably when the book first came out. I read voraciously in those days but I was a kid, and didn't really get it at all. Now I guess I do.I found this a rather uncomfortable read, but then Miss Monroe led a rather uncomfortable life: from unwanted foster child to fearing she had inherited the family's mental instability, to struggling starlet, to actress who unsuccessfully tried to take control of her own professional life before \"artistic control\" was understood to belong to the artists who made it happen. Her constant plea for love and external validation was pretty overwhelming, though perhaps understandable.Many years ago I watched a television documentary featuring Marilyn's voice discussing just these subjects, with photos and footage as visuals.I felt the ghost writer/editor let the subject down somewhat; true, when the conversations were written down, he claimed this was as far as they went, but he then had over 10 years in which to edit them into some sort of shape. Yet another man did Monroe yet another disservice."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie", "userReview": "There\u2019s something about this one that puts me ill at ease. I either don\u2019t believe Monroe wrote this at all (it was, after all, an admitted collaboration with a ghostwriter\u2014 and it was only published after her death) or else I believe Monroe wrote it insincerely, as an autobiography that suited/enhanced her public persona. I just don\u2019t see how this infantile, blushing voice belongs to the same person who reads Turgenev, Zola, Proust, Joyce, Camus, Mann, Aristophanes, Aristotle, and Lucretius, or to the same person who started her own production company and broke an unfair contract with a gigantic film company and started something of a revolution in the film industry.I don\u2019t see how that woman could say things like \"I bought woolen suits because I remembered that New York and Chicago were in the North. I had seen them in the movies blanketed with snow. I forgot it was summertime there as well as in LA.\"Now, does that sound like something any competent person (in their twenties) would say? Or does it sound like something that fits into the carefully curated persona of a dizzy little dream of a working class girl whose cup size is higher than her IQ? Yeah.I also struggle to harbour any warm feelings for a woman who perceives all other women as bitches who just aren\u2019t good enough to satisfy their husbands. And that \u201cwomen\u2019s friendships with each other are based on a gush of lies and pretty speeches that mean nothing. You\u2019d think they were all wolves trying to seduce each other the way they flatter and flirt when they\u2019re together.\u201dFor that, I sincerely hope Monroe had no hand in this \u2018autobiography.\u2019 Because I kind of hate her if she did.It\u2019s also a little too tidy. Everything fits together too tightly\u2014like a novel more than an autobiography.

She was also strong, choosey, and had high standards which she stood by \u2013 even when it was not in her best interest. For example - not sleeping with the powerful movie executive as a career move, or marrying a man she was not truly in love with although he was dying and would have left her a fortune.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to women looking for an example of strength, character, and grace.

Unsurprisingly, it's rather melancholy. Marilyn mentions often episodes of crying in bed all night and having moments when she had wished she were dead. Her haunting vision of herself as \"the kind of girl they found dead in a hallway bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand\" was disquieting.My Story begins with Marilyn's childhood as an orphan deep in poverty: mistreated, abused, and unwanted. It reveals the emotionally and philosophically complex woman behind the sex kitten image on screen. It reveals a troubled woman with crippling insecurity and vulnerability, but also yearning for a sense of belonging, true unrequited love, and a place in this world. She possessed a strong appetite for learning about history and the arts. Marilyn's perseverance in pursuit of her Hollywood dreams despite the challenges and uncertainty in this business was inspiring, as was her drive to hone her craft. She talks about being desperately broke much of the time, but never comes off as pathetic or complaining. Marilyn regarded acting as an art form, something to be taken seriously, and she worked hard to reach the highest plateau she could in Hollywood. Marilyn climbed to the top with grace and integrity; she recalls refusing offers of starring roles for sex, which could have been career suicide. She also had several marriage proposals with large sums of money behind them, which she turned down because she wanted to marry only for love.This is not a tell-all full of juicy scandals. Marilyn does talk about a couple of supposed feuds with other Hollywood starlets, but she claims these ladies (and many others) were just jealous and truly had no reason to be so. She had no interest in married men (or hardly any men, for that matter), and she had no interest in sleeping her way to fame. She was honest, reserved off-screen, and devoted to her work. It was heartbreaking that Marilyn seemed to be able to count the number of people who were kind and helpful to her on one hand, and the countless number of people who tried to exploit her.My Story abruptly but sweetly ends during her marriage to Joe DiMaggio, on a bright note about looking forward to performing for U.S. soldiers stationed in Korea\u2014a life unfinished. In the hardcover illustrated edition I have, Milton Greene's photos are peppered throughout in full color, showing many shades of Marilyn: the screen siren; the playful woman; and the sweet, poor girl inside.I would have liked to see years included for significant events, or year ranges for chapters, but it's a beautiful book without anyway. Plenty of other places to find a detailed timeline of Marilyn's life."}, {"userName": "Nicole Pramik", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24437209-nicole-pramik", "userReview": "I'm not into celebrity biographies or autobiographies, but for some reason I was intrigued to read this. While I wouldn't call myself a fan of Monroe, I have seen a few of her movies and liked them, and, of course, I've heard a variety of stories and conspiracy theories surrounding her untimely death. This book, regardless of its authorship, ventures into the darker side of a life of fame and a quest for true love.(I do want to briefly bring up the question of authorship as some readers and reviewers have cited that the book was ghostwritten by Ben Hecht. Thus, one wonders if the words here actually came from Ms. Monroe herself or someone else who simply wanted to cash in on her publicity at the time and use it as a marketing tool. Regardless who actually wrote it though, this book unabashedly delves into the troubled childhood and tormented young adulthood of a rising Hollywood starlet.) Rather than a \"proper\" autobiography, where the writer chronicles his or her life with a sense of fluidity, My Story reads more like a series of vignettes rather than a linear chronicle of Monroe's life. And it is a sad tale indeed. Monroe's life is not depicted as a fairy tale but a grim look into a childhood and young adulthood marred by molestation, exploitation, sexual harassment and sexism, divorce, and addiction. While the book doesn't delve into graphic details of these events, it doesn't gloss over them either but presents them simply \"as is.\" Thus, Monroe isn't painted as a pathetic person but simply as a broken woman who longed to be unconditionally loved.As expected, My Story ends rather abruptly (so it won't be a surprise nor a spoiler here that the book doesn't contain anything concerning Monroe's later career nor her death). Yet the way it concludes allows for a sense of open finality to Monroe's life as her iconic status has never diminished. Some of her remarks here are also sadly prophetic and shed new light on what a young woman was willing to do to find love and be loved. Overall, My Story is a heartbreaking look into the life of an American icon. Whether you view Marilyn Monroe as just another \"dumb blonde\" or a truly talented actress, this will certainly open your eyes to the way women were treated during Hollywood's Golden Era, more as property than people. Monroe's story, as we all know, has a sad, tragic ending; but some of the insights she shares in this book do subtly teach us to be attentive to those hurting around us as sometimes the most damaging pain is held close to the heart."}, {"userName": "Miller04", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269669-miller04", "userReview": "I am about half way through this book....its nothing exciting or riveting.....it is simplistic in its approach.

She tried to be what the studios wanted, but she was an unique individual that will be remembered throughout history as a blonde bombshell of the mid twentieth century.PS Loved the photographs included in the book, well placed."}, {"userName": "\u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56052706", "userReview": "\"\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0644\u062f\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628. \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u062a\u0645\u0634\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0639\u0645 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0639 \u0645\u0636\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0632\u062d\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0635\u0641\u0629\u060c \u0643\u0646\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0630\u0628 \u0623\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0645\u0639 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0648\u0647\u064a \u062a\u0633\u0631\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627. \u0643\u0646\u062a\u064f \u0623\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644\u060c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0630\u0647\u0628\u0648\u0646! \u0648\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0647\u0648 \u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0643 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0643\u0646 \u0643\u064a \u062a\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0643?!.\""}, {"userName": "Sarah Cormier", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9658461-sarah-cormier", "userReview": "A great biography about a troubled but really interesting young woman who came from nothing and became one of the most iconic figures in the world.

In this intimate account of a very public life, she tells of her first (non-consensual) sexual experience, her romance with the Yankee Clipper, and her prescient vision of herself as \"the kind of girl they found dead in the hall bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.\" The Marilyn in these pages is a revelation: a gifted, intelligent, vulnerable woman who was far more complex than the unwitting sex siren she portrayed on screen. Lavishly illustrated with photos of Marilyn, this special book celebrates the life and career of an American icon\u2014-from the unique perspective of the icon herself.", "title": "My Story", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182230.My_Story", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391621740l/182230.jpg", "reviews": 353, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/82952.Marilyn_Monroe", "name": "Marilyn Monroe"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/113541.Ben_Hecht", "name": "Ben Hecht"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2965985.Joshua_Green", "name": "Joshua Green"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182230.My_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12291998-my-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257501", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2128653.My_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33304071", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/421870.My_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33642256", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343766-fragments", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8498396-marilyn-monroe-quotes-vol-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/956492.Marilyn_Monroe_in_Her_Own_Words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1413441.Conversations_with_Marilyn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8466823-marilyn-monroe-quotes-vol-2"]}
