Andrew Taylor really should be more popular. Maybe the fact that he isn't as popular is a compliment? At any rate, plot and characterization were both fantastic here. I was sucked in very quickly, and it definitely has the feel of a 19th century work of fiction, even though it is a modern work. This man is just a great talent and he continues to impress me. The books I've read of his have a completely different feel, but the writing is undeniably Taylor. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of his books!"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433129-heidi", "userReview": "I loved this book.I've read many of the reviews, and while I agree with some of the criticisms (more on that later) I was so thoroughly caught up in this murder mystery set in the pre-Dickensian era that I have to put it on my list of favorites. The atmosphere, the details, the environment was richly rendered, the characters were fully fleshed and three-dimensional, and the mystery was intriguing, properly grisly, intricate and always compelling.It is about a schoolteacher named Thomas Shield who gets caught up in the private lives of two of his students, one of whom is the young Edgar Allan Poe. Neither one of the boys plays a huge personal role in the drama (Taylor has been criticized for calling his book \"the American boy\" when it is not actually about Poe per se) but their extended families are front and center, enmeshed in a web of greed, love, and lust for power. Thomas finds himself a pawn in the hands of powerful people and has to fight to resolve the mystery in order to save himself from doom. Some people have said that Thomas Shield is not a wholly sympathetic character (I've noticed before this that Andrew Taylor tends to portray his male characters warts and all) but he's certainly sympathetic enough, and working my way through the mystery in his intelligent and perceptive hands felt very comfortable for me. Maybe he's not the most emotive of men, but I could imagine myself spending a very enjoyable afternoon talking with him, and what more can you want from a narrator? Another complaint is be that the book is too slow and psychological in places. For instance, when they first go to the country there is a long section where relationships are being worked out almost in the manner of Jane Austen. Conversations are had, discoveries are made, links are forged day by day, and some readers found this tiring. I personally loved it, because I knew it was all working toward the setting up of whatever terrible thing was to come, and I found the character development fascinating in itself.So I give it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. And for those who like to really experience the feel of a different time and place, I say this was one of the best. The atmosphere of both London and the country was so well rendered that I felt I was experiencing firsthand the stink of the factories, the bustle and clang of the street traffic, the gray miasma of coal-infused fog, the frigidity of the \"great estate\" parlors, the jouncing of carriages over hard country ruts. When I finished I really felt I had come back from a journey to the past."}, {"userName": "Zoom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom", "userReview": "Meh. I found the first half intriguing enough, but the second half bored me. I found it hard to stay connected to the plot and the characters. The more intricate the plot got, the less interested I became. I was tempted to abandon this book, but I'd already invested so much time in it. I don't know why I do this to myself, but I forced myself to finish it. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of two was because historical fiction requires a considerable degree of competence on the part of the writer, and I felt that he had earned it. That said, I won't be looking for anything else written by Andrew Taylor."}, {"userName": "Hilary G", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15167899-hilary-g", "userReview": "I did not like this book.This is the second book (Fingersmith being the first) in our reading list which appears to have got at least half its ideas from Wilkie Collins. Perhaps if I had never heard of, or never read, Wilkie Collins, I would have enjoyed this book, but since I have heard of him, and The Woman in White, and the Moonstone are favourites of mine, and since The American Boy is (in my opinion) so inferior to either one of these, I found the book irritating in the extreme.\"An enthralling read from start to finish,\" promises the Times, according to the front cover. I remained unenthralled. In fact, the major entertainment value of the book for me was spotting Wilkiecollinsisms, and shaking my head over what had been done to them. Compare and contrast:(The Woman in White)Walter Hartright (music teacher) comes into a house where there are two women, Marion Halcombe and Laura Fairlie. He admires Marion for her intelligence, but loves Laura Fairlie unconditionally.(The American Boy)Tom Shield (tutor) comes into a house where there are two women, Flora Carswall and Sophia Frant. He lusts after them both. He enjoys a sex-show staged by the manipulative Flora, and appears to have a bonk with Sophie while everyone else is out.Sordid.(The Woman in White)Count Fosco, the arch-villain is a fascinating and complex character. Evil, yet charming. A grand fraudster, yet somehow honest in his depravity.(The American Boy)Stephen Carswell is just vile.Sordid.I found it all rather sordid. It did not seem to me that all the flogging of boys at the beginning, nor the whipping of the mute girl were necessary to the story at all, so I found them merely prurient. The abuse of Flora added very little, might she not simply have been a chip off the old block? The affair of Frant/Mrs Johnson, Mrs Johnson being dressed in men's clothing? Why did Harmwell have to be black, unless it was just an excuse for the frequent use of the word \"nigger\"? What were all these convolutions of the plot for? The plot was so overloaded, I could barely follow the threads. By the time Shield met Harmwell for the second time, I'd forgotten there was a first time, and as for the Ayez-peur parrot, I neither knew nor cared where that had come into the story previously. I longed for the simple and pure motive for the crime of The Woman in White \u2013 money!I thought the characterisation was very weak. I couldn't credit Flora and Sophie falling for Shield because he was so colourless, so passive. There weren't really any characters who rang very true to me and some of them, such as the honest lawyer, Rowsell, were mere caricatures.I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I reached the end of this book and then found I had to waffle through more pages, telling us what a big influence Noddy was (pretentious crap!), what the author had for breakfast and his inside leg measurement. It was slightly interesting that the author had to keep looking in a dictionary to see whether certain words and phrases fitted the time period. I actually did the same when Flora said \"Tell it to the Marines\", and found out the expression was first used in the 1600s.The most interesting part of the book was the epilogue at the end, which told us something about the mystery surrounding the death of Edgar Allan Poe. I am interested in finding out more about this, but so far as this book was concerned, despite being like the pintle of a hinge, and the still point around which the whole business revolved, the American Boy was just part of the scenery.I didn't think this book succeeded either as credible historical fiction or as a murder mystery, and I didn't much enjoy reading it, but that is not to say that I think Taylor is a bad writer. On the contrary, I saw much evidence that he is a good writer, so it is sad to see him wasting his talent trying to emulate what was done better a century and a half ago. I gather his next book is about the future, so maybe then we will hear his own voice."}, {"userName": "Jeane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1530627-jeane", "userReview": "(Dear Fiona)The first thing I had to keep in my mind was that The American boy is set in 1800 London.

Dat voert echter een beetje ver voor deze rubriek maar jullie houden het te goed. Een onvergeeflijke misdaad is - gedeeltelijk - een verhaal over de jaren dat Edgar Allen Poe in Engeland woonde. Hij is in dit verhaal 'de Amerikaanse jongen' die liefdevol door de familie Allen wordt opgenomen. Hij raakt bevriend met Charlie Frant, en samen worden ze aangenomen als leerling op de school waar de hoofdpersoon, Thomas Shield, leraar is. Het verhaal speelt zich grotendeels af in 1819 maar het laat nog sporen na tot ver in die eeuw.Tom Shield heeft gevochten bij Waterloo (Slag bij Waterloo, 18 juni 1815) maar hij is daar, zoals we nu zouden zeggen, uitgekomen met een 'post traumatic stress disorder'. Een oude tante neemt hem onder haar hoede, en als hij enige jaren later weer min of meer de oude is, en zijn tantes gezondheid steeds slechter wordt, zal hij toch een baan moeten vinden. Mr Bransby geeft hem de kans om leraar te worden. Al snel raakt Shield echter betrokken bij de lotgevallen van de familie van Charles Frant, en vooral bij het lot van zijn vader en later van zijn beeldschone moeder.Dit boek kreeg zeer verdiend in 2003 de CWA Historical Dagger for Fiction. Andrew Taylor schreef met dit boek een moderne thriller, die zich toevallig bijna tweehonderd jaar geleden afspeelt. Nou ben ik toevallig een groot liefhebber van Engelse auteurs uit die periode, zoals daar zijn Charles Dickens en Wilkie Collins. Ik heb veel van hen gelezen. Het boek The Woman in White van Collins wordt wel eens de eerste echte detectiveroman genoemd. Als je toevallig ook van deze schrijvers houdt, zul je een enorm plezier beleven aan het boek van Taylor. Wat ik buitengewoon knap vind, is dat Taylor kans heeft gezien dit spannende verhaal neer te zetten met behoud van alle originele details die je ook in de boeken van voornoemde schrijvers vindt, maar met weglating van de soms lange - en ik moet toegeven: soms saaie - stukken die nu eenmaal eigen zijn aan een boek uit die tijd. Een onvergeeflijke misdaad is een boek dat mijns inziens het beste uit twee werelden biedt. Het verhaal is geschreven vanuit de hoofdpersoon, Tom Shield, die heel veel dingen meemaakt en ze daarom, zo zegt hij zelf, op een dag maar eens opschrijft. Waarom, dat weet hij eigenlijk zelf niet. Shield is een tamelijk goed onderlegd man maar ook een jonge man, met alle gevoelens en onzekerheden die daarbij horen. Dat komt prachtig tot uiting in de manier waarop hij zijn gevoelens voor Flora en Sophie beschrijft. Sophie is de moeder van Charlie Frant en Flora is haar nichtje, dat op nogal eigenaardige wijze in het bezit komt van een landgoed dat eigenlijk rechtens aan Sophie toebehoort. Aangezien Tom Shield hiervoor een handtekening heeft moeten zetten, is dit eigenlijk het begin van het intrigerende verhaal.Dit boek heeft een heleboel extra's: een uitgebreid verhaal over Andrew Taylor en hoe het boek tot stand gekomen is, informatie over Edgar Allen Poe en nog veel meer. Andrew Taylor heeft al twintig boeken geschreven en ik heb hem toegevoegd aan mijn lijstje: 'auteurs van wie ik alles wil hebben'."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/600922-tony", "userReview": "This is a book of suspense, culture, and murder. It is loosely and brilliantly set around the youth of Edgar Allen Poe. Don\u2019t let that attract or detract you; the book is written in such a way that the fact of Poe causes shadows in your reading that may or may not be true. It adds to the suspense.An Unpardonable Crime is a looking glass into the culture of old England of the 1800 and 1900\u2019s. There is a fascinating image created as one reads the book. There is high finance, hidden schemes, and unforgettable characters woven throughout.Subtly throughout the book is a strain of several romances, whose content and ending the reader may suspect, but whose appearance is unforeseen and pinnacle like. The two primary women in the book are incredibly developed and bring a level of awe to the setting. They are amazing.I chose this book for the Edgar Allen Poe connection (usually a murder and suspense novel will not make its way off the shelf into my hands) but when I was done the characters were playing on in my mind.At the end of the book (don\u2019t peak) there are several appendixes about Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s life and suspicions. These appendixes are actually a continuation of the history after the last event in the book. They are best read last; they are informative, interesting, and once again leave more questions than answers.I highly recommend this novel as a historical fiction, romance, and a situation that will take the reader to another place. A book that ends, and the reader wants more, in my opinion is the best of all stories."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2304684-david", "userReview": "It's such a great feeling when you have really enjoyed reading a book and find that there are plenty of other novels by the same author that you can add to your list of books to read.I enormously enjoyed reading this. I'm not really a fan of historical novels and when I'm in a bookshop I'll usually ignore those that are set in another era. I'm not really sure why, as this is one of a number of historical novels that I have read which have been excellent. Not having ever read any Poe, I'm sure much of the impact of Taylor writing a novel that pays homage to Poe's own work, while including him as a central character, was lost on me. I simply enjoyed a great thriller, which contains plenty of twists and turns. The setting in 1820 makes the reader pause for thought at times, as the fundamental elements of the story feel very current, yet the unfamiliarity of daily life at the time compared to the one we know today can suddenly be all too apparent. Unfamiliar social conventions, particularly regarding the class system and the interaction between sexes, help add to the mystery and tension in the book."}, {"userName": "Candy Wood", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858970-candy-wood", "userReview": "Though there are no police detectives, this is a murder mystery. The narrator, Thomas Shield, was at Waterloo in 1815 and is trying to get his life back on track by teaching in a Stoke Newington school for boys. One of his pupils is Edgar Allan, son of an actor and con man named David Poe, but the father is a more important character here than the ten-year-old future writer. The British title, The American Boy, is misleading. Mr. Shield experiences the extremes of London, from the dangerous slums of St. Giles to prosperous Bloomsbury squares (dangerous in more subtle ways). Russell Square is a short walk from Seven Dials, but the two areas were economically far apart. The period detail feels right, not intruding on the narrative, which has moments almost as spooky as a Poe story. Even the limited characterization of females fits the narrator's limited experience of women.

For it's certainly pacy and action-packed. But the fact that Edgar Allan Poe appears in it as a minor character is simply too tenuous, in my opinion. In the Epilogue, the author makes the case for his statement that the boy is a fulcrum, but I think the case shouldn't need to be made, if it was a good one.Americans certainly feature more than one expect in a tale based (largely) in London during this particular period. At the heart of the tale is the banking house of Wavenhoe. Old man Wavenhoe is ill and dying but has put his trust into the wrong hands. His previous partner is ill-mannered and uncouth if rich, and his current partner (the man who married his niece) is unprincipled and weak. The Bank crashes and the subsequent schenanigans draw in our hero, teacher to young Poe and his friend, child to the banking partner. Everything gets chucked at us: illegitimacy, incest, murders, race, bad guys, good guys, beautiful unattainable women and secrets. Oh and there's a reason for the Americans to be there which we do - eventually - find out.The ending is rather unlikely too, but then I'll admit that I'm finding more and more endings unsatisfactory, so it might well be just me."}, {"userName": "C.J.

The detective becomes one (like a priest or shaman) who makes sense out of existential crises (i.e. murder-how existential can you get?).Andrew Taylor writes historical fiction/mysteries and does so very well. In The American Boy, the historical part consists of a period of time when the Edgar Allan (Poe) is enrolled in a school in Great Britain. That part is true. Around this historical fact, Taylor weaves a mystery involving one of Edgar\u2019s school friends. The mystery involves a brutal murder and disfigured corpse. Is it any wonder Poe grew up to establish macabre fiction and poetry?There is a rich character development in the novel (though, curiously, not so much with Poe) and the pacing of the story encourages long periods of reading. The atmosphere is of consistently suspenseful danger with a streak of erotic tension added.The portions of the novel taking place in rural England neatly describe the language and customs of a class conscious society in the early 19th century. In that way, it is reminiscent of George Elliott (Middlemarch ), but could Elliott ever give us this line: \u201c\u2026merely shadows glimpsed moving out of the corner of an eye, half-heard hints, a yellowing finger in a satchel left on a tooth-puller\u2019s door\u2026I found myself pacing up and down the hall.\u201d He uses a Breguet watch as a metaphor for scandal: \u201c\u2026simple enough on the surface, but its apparent simplicity concealing a complex arrangement of hidden springs, wheels, checks and balances; organized according to rational principles, to be sure, but too delicate and complicated a piece of machinery to yield its secrets to the profane.\u201dThe characters and their relationships are highly nuanced, but did anyone ever really talk like this: \u201c She stopped again and looked up at me, \u201cI said thank you.

England 1819: Thomas Shield, a new master at a school just outside London, is tutor to a young American boy and the boy's sensitive best friend, Charles Frant. Drawn to Frant's beautiful, unhappy mother, Thomas becomes caught up in her family's twisted intrigues. Then a brutal crime is committed, with consequences that threaten to destroy Thomas and all that he has come to hold dear. Despite his efforts, Shield is caught up in a deadly tangle of sex, money, murder and lies -- a tangle that grips him tighter even as he tries to escape from it.
