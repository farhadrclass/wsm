The author complains about his companions \"traditional\" habits: talking about God/Islam, washing with sand/water (not soap), and then he complains because they're too western: watch too much TV, live in concrete houses (not tents). Sorry, but your noble savage doesn't exist - just because you read Thesiger's book about Arabia doesn't entitle you to find the perfect, unspoiled native. Poor, spoiled American wants to be a big, admired explorer. Oh well, you were just born too late, too bad for you. But, it was fairly well written - and other than annoying me, a good read."}, {"userName": "Teo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651243-teo", "userReview": "From Sahara to the Sea by foot, camel and whatever comes your way. It's a totally great concept and theoretically a great story and if the author wasn't such a snarky jerk about most of the people and places he encounters it would be even better. Dude - if you don't actually like it there, don't go. One of the common and fundamental problems with travel literature, rivaled only by its inverse - the complete and total awe and reverence of all things foreign, regardless of whether the things deserve it. All that said, if you're going to Morocco, it's absolutely worth reading.

A book conjuring up wonderful desert landscapes, this is a modern-day version to rival Arabian Sands which, in similar fashion to Thesiger's book, laments the lost nomadic life of the Bedouin.While volunteering for the Peace Corps, Tayler hears of a wondrous valley in the south of Morocco called the Draa - a no mans land in the Sahara yet to be fully modernised or corrupted. Having once served as one of the main caravan routes for transporting ivory, gold and slaves between Europe and Timbuktu - the last of which crossed the Sahara in the 1950's - Tayler is constantly drawn to exploring this infrequently visited part of Morocco.Tayler's journey begins in Tizgui travelling through Zagora and then onto the \"point of no return\" at Mhamid. From here he faces the Cul du Draa furnace as he treks towards Tan-Tan on the Atlantic - all told, a journey of more than 700 kilometres. When contemplating this journey, what definitely would've been useful was a map, which sadly was lacking.Mostly, this is a book about landscapes and culture. One where Tayler writes poetically of oases, desert massfis, wadis and hamadas and knowledgeably of its sharifs, marabouts, zawiyas, qsars and jinns. We also get the benefit of Tayler's fluency in Arabic and from the numerous prior trips and time that he has spent in the Maghreb - the land of sunset.Glory in a Camel's Eye is a good book where the teachings are much more about the places through which Tayler journeys through, rather than about himself. Magically conjuring up a desert world of infinite sand dunes, campsite fires, tasty duwaz (stews) and starlit skies only disturbed by the far off snorting of camels, this is a perfect book to enjoy over endless cups of mint tea.

This is another in the series of trips to places that no one ever goes but Jeffrey Tayler - and I for one am glad he does and writes so well about it. This time it is a trip down the Draa Valley in Morocco with two guides, three camels, and an observant eye for details, which he shares with the reader as the journey progresses. Some hardships are obvious and somewhat expected - cantankerous camels, the desert itself, sparse supplies, monotonous food, unclen conditions. Others are a little less obvious - as the trip progresses Tayler finds that the cultural differences with his Arabic, Islamic, nomadic guides are not only too big to overcome, but increase toward the end of the trip until finally, the journey ends just in time. A very worthwhile read and relatively quick but if you have not read Tayler before you might find the heavy use of foreign terms and words a bit off-putting -- it is something that runs throughout his books. He speaks several languages and in the first book I read I wondered if he was just showing off - but I got used to it, and the words are always used consistently and in a context where you can infer at least a general meaning. It also adds immeasurably to the overall flavor of the book -- you are constantly reminded that you are 'not in Kansas' anymore, and for some things in other countries, there just are no adequate English words."}, {"userName": "Max Carmichael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8194961-max-carmichael", "userReview": "As a travel writer, the neo-Victorian Tayler shares in the new fad of young professionals: \"experience\" as a consumer commodity. Alienated from the traditions of his own society, he attempts to buy a traditional experience from members of an exotic society colonized and degraded by the very Anglo-European imperial culture that constitutes his own ironic inheritance.Unfortunately, his inspiration is the romantic adventurer Wilfred Thesiger rather than the more domestically-minded Freya Stark. Clueless, he seems puzzled when mothers repeatedly approach him asking for medicine for their children. Freya doctored her way across the desert; all Tayler brought was money to pay for guides on his selfish adventure."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1392317-michael", "userReview": "Probably Jeffrey Tayler doesn't come up with the silly titles for his books that emphasize the danger in his travel escapades. This is the second of his travel books that I have read and he does seem to like what might otherwise be considered ill-advised trips - but he survives to write (and publish) about it. Tayler speaks Arabic (and Russian) and his descriptions of his interactions with his Arab guides are the most interesting aspect of this book. It took my about fifty pages to get into this but then I enjoyed it. He relates some history to provide context but this doesn't overpower things."}, {"userName": "Rogue Reader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2610419-rogue-reader", "userReview": "The best read yet on the harsh realities and romantic illusions of the deserts and their peoples, a trek by foot and camel from Mhamid, southeast of Marrakesh and at the head of the Draa to Tan Tan on the west coast of Morocco, the Atlantic. Fairly current too, years of drought have destroyed much of the nomadic desert tribes and true believers hector without ceasing. Tayler's command of Arabic, his observant nature and background knowledge bring wealth in his words, and glory in a camel's eye."}, {"userName": "Jody Grant", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/866567-jody-grant", "userReview": "A very good travel memoir--a genre I usually like the idea of more than the execution of. Because as much as I enjoy stories from actual live, I get frustrated when I feel robbed of story or craft. While sometimes I was annoyed by this narrator, I enjoyed his honesty and that he didn't hide or color his biases. It made his insights and his joys all the richer. This part of the world is especially intriguing and foreign to me. I enjoyed the isolation of his quest as well as the frequent social interactions of a seemingly solitary journey."}, {"userName": "Deb (Readerbuzz) Nance", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance", "userReview": "Tayler along with two guides takes off across the Sahara Desert.
