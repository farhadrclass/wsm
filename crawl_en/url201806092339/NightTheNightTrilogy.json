And I'm not belittling it at all with the phrase 'freaks me out.' Growing up in the 1970s and 80s, I felt sufficiently desensitized enough by television violence to be able to gauge how often I need to shake the jiffy pop and run to the bathroom before the program/violence resumes.Elie Wiesel's Night brings me back to my senses, makes me hate the cold hearted bitch I've learned to be. And not by some overtly dramatic rendition of the horrors of life in a concentration camp but more of the LACK of it. The down to the nitty gritty telling of what happened during the year that he was imprisoned. It wasn't going for the kick to the gut reaction, more of a confused, inconceivable retelling of day to day events, and this---this--- is what really makes me shudder and be at a loss for words. Hell, words? Who am I kidding? Try coherent thought.\u201cI would pause at every sentence, and start over and over again. I would conjure up other verbs, other images, other silent cries. It still was not right. But what exactly was \u201cIt\u201d? \u201cIt\u201d was something elusive, darkly shrouded for fear of being usurped, profaned. All the dictionary had to offer seemed meager, pale lifeless.\u201dHis description of his last encounter with his mother and little sister: \u201cAn SS came towards us wielding a club. He commanded: \u201cMen to the left! Women to the right!\u201d Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment when I left my mother.\u201dWords. The power they can hold is devastating. Yes, not a new thought, not an original one, yet fucking true nonetheless. Buna. Buchenwald. Mengele. Auschwitz. Words, but ones that incite something within. Creepy crawlies or nausea. Fear. I have met only one Holocaust survivor, that I'm aware of. And 'met' is too strong a word. I was working in a store during college and was collecting payment from a customer who handed me the money and flashed his tattoo. I paled. My eyes darted from the faded black green numbers that served as this man's identity to his face and knew that I was just another gawker. That in that one moment I had created a history for this man. No.. he WAS history. Certainly makes you rethink being pissed off that Sbarro's had left the food court. I think that my kids will most likely never meet a survivor. That books like Night and Anne Frank will have to serve as an education, a reminder that THIS, in fact, DID happen and that it is cruel and moronic and downright irresponsible to believe otherwise. I could say that I did have some sense of relief that at least I wasn't alive during this. That I didn't sit back and have some vague understanding of this going on. But, that's not really the case, right? We have Rwanda and Darfur and god knows what other insane situations happening out there---and we're outraged over the price of an iPhone. \u201cFor in the end, it is all about memory, its sources and its magnitude, and, of course, its consequences.\u201dSo, Elie Wiesel's account, at 112 pages, serves as a powerful, undeniable, testament. As simply stated as that.Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and tuned my dreams to ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never. And in the Preface to the New Translation, he says:  \u201cAnd yet still I wonder: Have I used the right words?' For me, yes. Most definitely, yes."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "The author, who is actually in the above picture, said it best in the forward; \u201cOnly those who experienced Auschwitz know what it was.\u201d I think we can all agree with that. But can we, the reader, even understand what happened there? Can modern men and women comprehend that cursed universe? I\u2019m not entirely sure.I first read this in my eighth grade History class. I was 13. It changed my life. Before this book my world was sunshine and rainbows. My biggest concern was whether or not a boy named Jason liked me back. I got mad at my mom when she made me go to bed on time, I complained if I didn\u2019t like what we were having for dinner and I argued about what I was and wasn\u2019t allowed to watch on TV.I thought I knew about WWII. Both of my grandfathers served in it and so my parents wanted to make sure that we understood the sacrifices they made, the things they saw. I watched documentaries about it with my father, the history nerd, listened to the few stories that my grandfathers would tell, but up until that point I had been intentionally sheltered from the horrors of the holocaust. I had only been told in the vaguest terms what had happened, that so many millions of people had been killed, that Hitler and his men had sought to exterminate the Jewish people. My parents wanted to spare me from what exactly that meant until they thought I was mature enough to be able to absorb it. But then I read this. And for the first time in my life I was completely self-aware. I felt like a child, like a complete and utter fool. For what were my \u201cproblems\u201d compared to those of this narrator? How \u201chard\u201d was my life compared to what he endured? What millions of people similarly endured? I now understood my own insignificance in the grand scheme of things and suddenly the reality of the world was a crushing weight. It wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. It was dark. It was ugly and unforgiveable. I remember getting really angry when I finished this. Mostly I was angry at the world and at humanity as a whole but I unfairly turned some of that on my father. After all, he hadn\u2019t prepared me for what I found in this book. At one point I even demanded that he explain this\u2026thing to me. He couldn\u2019t. Fifteen years later, my second read of this book has impacted me just as much as the first. There\u2019s this question I kept asking myself while reading. That question, was \u2018How?\u2019. I\u2019m sure that \u2018Why?\u2019 might seem the more obvious choice here but I couldn\u2019t let myself wander down the rabbit warren that is that question. Madness lies at the end of it. So I\u2019m left with \u2018How?\u2019. How did this happen? How did so many average human beings contribute to this? How did the SS working in the camps reach the point that they were physically and mentally able to toss live infants into flames? How were the German girls that lived within smelling distance of Auschwitz able to pass love notes to the soldiers that marched their skeletal prisoners past? How did these same starving prisoners manage to run 20 kilometers in the freezing snow? How could the SS officers that shot them if they stopped on the first day of their death march then shout encouragements to them the next? How could the German citizens near the train tracks throw bread into the prisoners\u2019 cattle cars just to watch them murder each other for it? How could human beings do these things to each other? How? HOW? \nHOW???\n Like my father, I have no answers.And that, I believe, is why many modern humans will never really be able to comprehend the things that happen in this book. Absorb it, yes. Bear witness to it, yes. Understand it? Hopefully never. I finished this at lunch today. And now I\u2019m sitting in my cubicle, glancing at my neighbors and wondering if they\u2019re capable of this kind of depravity. Am I? What would I do to survive? Would I beat my own father to death for the bread in his hand? I hope to God that none of us will ever have to find out the answers to these questions. If you read a single book in your life, this should be it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "This book is a hard, righteous slap in the conscience to everyone of good will in the world and should stand as a stark reminder of both: (1) the almost unimaginable brutality that we, as a species, are capable of; and (2) that when it comes to preventing or stopping similar kinds of atrocities or punishing those that seek to perpetrate such crimes, WE ARE OUR BROTHERS' KEEPERS and must take responsibility for what occurs \"on our watch.\"This remarkable story is the powerful and deeply moving account of Ellie Wiesel's personal experiences as a Hungarian Jew who is sent with his entire family to the infamous Nazi concentration camps of Auschwitz and later Buchenwald. The most chilling aspect of the narrative for me was the calm, casual way that so many of the nightmarish events that Elie witnesses were performed. For example, early on in the account, Elie is separated from his Mother and sisters (never to see them again). This life-altering, traumatically painful action is done so quickly and in such an off-handed, bureaucratic manner by the Nazis that trying to grasp the reality of it made me physically sick. That was only the beginning. Elie goes on to chronicle his subsequent attempts not to be separated from his father and the horrors he was forced to witness and endure. Along the road of this terrifying journey, we hear in Elie's own words of the growing disgust of his 13 year old self for both mankind and for God and how he eventually lost completely his own humanity in his resolve to do whatever he had to in order to stay alive. Written in a simple, unsentimental style (which makes the horrors described seem somehow more shocking), this is one of those important life-changing books that I believe everyone should read. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!"}, {"userName": "Chris Horsefield", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058695-chris-horsefield", "userReview": "Upon completion of this book, my mind is as numb as if I had experienced this suffering myself. So much pain and suffering are thrown at you from the pages that one cannot comprehend it all in the right perspective. One can only move forward as the victims in this book did. Step by step, page by page. Initially, numbness is the only way to deal with such anguish. Otherwise one becomes quickly overwhelmed by the images that evoke questions that cannot be answered. And yet, I read this book from the comfort of a warm home and a full stomach. Imagine the impact if it were otherwise. Imagine being forced from your home to live in barracks, living off soup and bread, forced to go outside in the winter without a jacket, and perform manual labor from dawn to dusk with the smell of a crematorium in your backyard.How many of us could endure this for just one day, let alone, for years? What would this do to us physically and more important, what would this do to us mentally? Yet, we witness in this book the miracle of the prisoner's survival. The strength and raw endurance of the human spirit. We must be reminded of this this glorious strength, but also reminded that it was the weakness of the human spirit that inflicted these crimes on others. Humanity has the capability of extreme strength, but also of extreme weakness (which often hides under the guise of self-righteousness and need for power over others). This book is necessary in order to remind us of this. These things must not be forgotten. Read this book even if you think you have read enough of the Holocaust and of pain and suffering. Every book that I have read about the Holocaust offers something new including this one. Read it as a memorial and a tribute. Read it as a reminder of how fortunate we are to have a free society and how we must preserve this freedom at all costs. There are those who would like to take it away. Fascism is alive and well. I started reading Holocaust novels after reading Edelweiss Pirates \u2018Operation Einstein'. (Edelweiss Pirates #1) [bookcover:(Edelweiss Pirates #1) \u2018Operation Einstein' \n they are must reads in this genre are of course Number the Stars \n Number the stars. I enjoyed that authors other works. That novel was 'The Book' that turned me onto YA WW2 novels. They allow us to reflect on our own lives, learn history and become better people."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "The first time I read Night by Eli Wiesel I was in an eighth grade religious school class. At that time it had recently become a law in my state to teach the Holocaust as part of the general curriculum, and, as a result, my classmates and I were the torchbearers to tell people to never forget and were inundated with quality Holocaust literature. Yet even though middle school students can comprehend Night, the subject matter at times is still way over their heads. The book itself although a prize winner blended into the religious school class and receded to the back of my memory bank. These years later I have been enjoying a religious lifestyle for my adult life. Upon hearing that Nobel Laureate Eli Wiesel passed away recently I thought now was as good of a time as any to reread his award winning account of surviving the Holocaust. Although only 120 pages in length, Wiesel's memoir of life in the concentration camps is one of the most powerful pieces of literature that most people will ever read. Wiesel discusses his relationship with G-D and talks about his conflicting feelings in regards to taking care of his father while in Buna and Birkenau camps. It was not easy to digest. Wiesel also writes in length about observing Rosh Hashanah while in the concentration camps. Why praise the Almighty for one's deliverance if one's existence is spent as a prisoner living on crusts of bread? It was easy to forget G-D or denounce His existence, even for the most religious Jews. These passages brought me close to tears. On this eve of Rosh Hashanah I can thank the Blessed Creator that I enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Even though the world is far from perfect, my family lives in a land of freedom and are free to worship as we choose. Eli Wiesel brought Holocaust awareness to many people and earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. His passing is indicative that few survivors are still with us and we should hear their stories while we still can. Night is a painful yet necessary read, and by reading it I can go into the new year thanking G-D for my right to live in relative peace and prosperity."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.\"These words and this book just tore at my heart. I have seen Night, have heard of Night for many years now. I waited to read it, unsure what I could possibly gain from reading another account of the evil existing among our fellow human beings \u2013 I will become enraged and depressed. I can\u2019t change history. I will be forced to examine my own faith and I don\u2019t want to do that. But then I discovered that my son was assigned this book as part of his summer reading for a high school English class. What do I want him to learn from this book, from this dark piece of our not too distant past? Should he pass it by so that he doesn\u2019t have to experience the horrifying details, feel the terrible injustice in this world? No. I do not want him to be a passive bystander. I want him to understand that narrow-mindedness, hatred and bigotry exist despite his fortunate and protected upbringing. Other human beings are right now suffering unimaginable sorrow, are being cruelly maltreated. History does repeat itself, perhaps with varying backgrounds, different groups of individuals. We can\u2019t let this happen. My son needs to read this book. His children need to read this book someday. I need to read this book. I did. I read this book and I cried. I was angry. I was disgusted with humanity. I understood Elie\u2019s words above, why he felt such despair. Everyone should read this book at least once. This is a slim book with a tremendous message. \"Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.

Yet that is exactly what I'm going to do, for while Night is a chilling account of the Holocaust and the dehumanisation and brutalisation of the human spirit under extreme circumstances, the fact remains that I've read better ones. Better written ones, and more insightful ones, too.Night is Elie Wiesel's somewhat fictionalised account of the year he spent at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. It's a chilling story about his experiences in and between concentration camps, his gradual loss of faith (he was a very observant Jew who obviously wondered where God was while his people were being exterminated), and his feelings of guilt when he realised that his struggle for survival was making him insensitive towards his dying father. It's gruesome, chilling material, and I felt very quiet after having read it. Yet I also felt vaguely unsatisfied with the book. I wanted more detail. I wanted fleshed-out writing rather than a succession of meaningful one-line paragraphs. I wanted less heavy-handed symbolism (the book very much centres on troubled father-and-son relationships, to echo the one central Father-and-Son one) and more actual feeling. I wanted a writer (and a translator) who knew better than to call an SS officer 'an SS'. And most of all, I wanted a less abrupt ending. I wanted to ask Wiesel what happened in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of Buchenwald. I wanted to ask him what happened to his leg, on which he marched for several gruesome days just days after having undergone an operation, and how he picked up the pieces afterwards, and why on earth his two eldest sisters, who died in Auschwitz as well as his mother and younger sister, never warranted more than a single mention. The latter was an example of seriously shoddy writing, I thought.Perhaps my questions were answered in the original version of Night, which never got published. In his introduction to the new English translation of Night, Wiesel mentions that the book as it is today is a severely abridged version of a much longer Yiddish original called And the World Remained Silent. I think I can see why the original wasn't published (quite apart from the fact that the world wasn't ready yet for concentration camp literature, the few quotes provided in the introduction make for heavy reading). The abridged version definitely seems more readable than the full-length one, and does an admirable job getting the facts across. Even so, I think the publishers might have gone a step too far in abridging the book to the extent that they did. No doubt the very brevity of Night is one of the reasons why it's so popular today, but personally, I would have liked to see a middle road between the original (detailed) manuscript and the incredibly spare barebones version sold now. Don't get me wrong, the abridged version is effective, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the Holocaust for people with short attention spans. I prefer Primo Levi and Ella Lingens-Reiner's more complete accounts of life in the camps myself, not to mention several Dutch books which sadly never got translated into other languages. But still. Night is an important book, and one that deserves to be widely read. In fact, one that should be widely read, by people of all ages and nationalities, to prevent nightmare like this ever happening again."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Terrifying.

The immediacy of the tragedy that was Wiesel's then comes to life in a way that a junior or senior can grasp. I also tell the story of my friend, Ida, and her \"no grandparents\". That is the hardest part for me as it is so personal. She was the daughter of survivors - she had no grandparents and I gave her mine. The sharing of my friend with my beloved grandmother and grandfather was one of the true blessings of my life and our lives were enriched through the immense addition to our family. I was also blessed by her adding us to her home and her celebrations. My faith was enlarged. This is a powerful book - a simple one to read, but a difficult one to comprehend. Engagingly written and honest to the core - even the difficult, prickly human parts that would embarrass anyone to reveal -- this is the heart of humanity's difficult path - how do we grow if we can't love one another for the similarities and the differences.

This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.Words cannot begin to comprehend the plight of suffering and cruelty\u00a0revealed in this book that had me on the verge of breaking into sobs page after page, so I'll let the writing speak for itself by sharing moments and passages that cannot be forgotten in time:This here is exactly why I refuse to participate with anything regarding Germany; the world is complicit in its indifference.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c...my hatred remains our only link today.\u201dIt pained me beyond words to see my people fall under the \u201cthis surely won\u2019t happen to me\u201d\u00a0spell.And the effect spreads like a snowball, gathering more and more edicts as the days go by.Nothing gets my blood boiling quite like seeing the numerous acts of silence committed by these citizens. People love to victim-blame the Jews by asking the distasteful question of why they didn't stand up to the oppressor... But a more\u00a0pressing notion, for me, is why those German citizens, watching idly by in the face of atrocity, didn't stand up to their fellow Nazis\u2026\u00a0\ufffc\ufffcI was appalled from start to finish with the above. Not only do they watch idly\u00a0by from a short distance away,\u00a0but to then FLIRT with them\u2026You think you've reached the peak of cruelty, but then you read on:Experiencing numbness in order to remain sane at the sight of tragedy.This French girl's wisdom has stayed in mind, in particular, because the next paragraph describes an out-of-this-world experience wherein Elie Wiesel stumbles upon her eons later:But the most painful of all remains to be the relationship portrayed between father and son that keeps both alive in the face of inhumanity.Many more sorrowful revelations are shared within the pages of this must-read. Elie\u00a0Wiesel's raw written voice commemorates all that must never be forgotten.My arms gathered with goosebumps at that because the date I was reading this book was April 11th.I'll end this review by sharing my favorite Elie Wiesel quote:\u201cThe opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.\u201d\nThis review and more can be found on my blog."}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "Night is perhaps one of the most remarkable, harrowing and haunting accounts of the events in the Nazi Germany concentration camps Auschwitz and Buchenwald. I read this powerful work only a few days before news of the author's, Elie Wiesel's, death were announced, and both shocked me. The first, because unless you have experienced it for yourself, you will never be able to realize the full extent of what happened in the Second World War with all its different facets and emotions, and the latter, because with Elie Wiesel, a remarkable man has left this planet who fought for memorizing the Holocaust, who fought against violence, suppression and racism.Perhaps you will not find the most eloquent, the most artful language in this work of literature, but that's nothing you should expect to find in a book dealing with something as frightening, as horrifying, as real as the Holocaust. In his nonfictional book, Elie Wiesel writes about his own survival in the concentration camps, about reflections of the father-son relationship with his father, about humanity and inhumanity. It's a book everyone should read, because ultimately, the Second World War is something everyone should remember. Forgetting would be the worst way to deal with it.A lot of people, more people than would be good, claim that it has all been \"so long ago\", is so completely irrelevant nowadays, just belongs to this boring stuff people are tortured with in school because it belongs to this dry nonsense called \"history\". I usually don't tell people they're wrong ... usually. Because in this case, they can't be more wrong. The Holocaust needs to be remembered, because if humans forget the mistakes they did, they will tend to repeat them. And I think everyone can agree that the Holocaust should never, never be repeated.This is a book which is incredibly difficult to review, just like it is difficult to read - not for its language or its style; I read it in one sitting in the course of three or four hours - but rather for the horrifying events Elie Wiesel talks about. I can only recommend to read this book to everyone, independent from how much you already know about the topic.And on a final note: Rest in Peace, Elie Wiesel."}, {"userName": "Heidi The Hippie Reader", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-hippie-reader", "userReview": "Night is Elie Wiesel's memoir about his experiences during the Holocaust. It is shocking and sad, but worth reading because of the power of Wiesel's witnessing one of humanity's darkest chapters and his confession on how it changed him.In the new introduction to the ebook version I read, Wiesel talked about the difficulty he had putting words to his experience. \"Convinced that this period in history would be judged one day, I knew that I must bear witness. I also knew that, while I had many things to say, I did not have the words to say them.\" pg. 7, introductionThe original version of Night was written in Yiddish. I wish I knew enough Yiddish to read it. There's something powerful about reading books in their original form.Wiesel closes his introduction with his reasons for writing this book: \"For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. He has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to our collective memory. To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.\" pg 12, introduction.Even though a member of his community warned Wiesel's village about the horrors that awaited them, they didn't believe him. After they were placed in a ghetto, the Jewish population of Sighet thought that the worst was behind them. \"Most people thought that we would remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Afterward everything would be as before. The ghetto was ruled by neither German nor Jew; it was ruled by delusion.\" pg 26, ebook.If I had been in their place, I don't think that I would have acted any differently. How could one possibly imagine the horrors that they were going to face?Wiesel is starved, overworked and beaten in the concentration camps. He loses more than his family and faith: \"One day when I was able to get up, I decided to look at myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I had not seen myself since the ghetto. From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me.\" pgs 110-111 ebook.Another Holocaust survivor's memoir that I highly recommend is Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

But this has to be read, and everyone should do so, it makes all the mundane things in life seem far more important.

Night is not a book that I can review. It defies critique, and even analyzing it from my sunny porch with a cup of coffee, feels wrong. Yet it\u2019s the reasons that Night belongs outside of criticism that make it so important. There is the Holocaust and then there is the world\u2019s relationship with the Holocaust. By the end of the 60s that relationship encompassed adult children of survivors, scholars, deniers, apologists, voyeurs, and people who hold their ears the moment the subject comes up. Night was written before any of that. It isn\u2019t influenced by other Holocaust literature; instead it is a foundational text, unvarnished source material describing one of most terrible things our species ever did. For that reason, I believe it should be required reading for everyone.Night is short and the writing is simple. It feels stark, honest, and hallowed in the way of powerful memorials. In the preface of my edition, Wiesel writes:\u201cThere are those who tell me that I survived in order to write this text. I am not convinced. I don\u2019t how I survived; I was weak, rather shy; I did nothing to save myself. A miracle? Certainly not. If heaven could or would perform a miracle for me, why not for others more deserving than myself? It was nothing more than chance. However, having survived, I needed to give some meaning to my survival. \u2026I knew that I must bear witness. Wiesel was a brilliant light in the darkness he depicts so powerfully. His obit in the New York Times, puts it well, \u201cThere may have been better chroniclers who evoked the hellish minutiae of the German death machine. There were arguably more illuminating philosophers. But no single figure was able to combine Mr. Wiesel\u2019s moral urgency with his magnetism, which emanated from his deeply lined face and eyes as unrelievable melancholy.\u201dWhen I started this review I was going to post a famous photo of him as part of a group of emaciated prisoners on the day that Buchenwald was liberated. But after reading that beautiful quote, I would rather close with this photo of the day he won the Nobel Peace Prize, which illustrates the knowledge he gave the world rather than the darkness he endured."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477946-kristen", "userReview": "A poignant and unforgettable 5 star read. \u201cHuman suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere.\u201d \u2015 Elie Wiesel, NightIt's been years since I've read this book, but as my son needed to read it for school, I decided to read it with him.

He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of 'never again.' \"I first read this book about 40 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. When I heard the sad news I decided it was time to drop what I was reading and refresh my memory of Wiesel's seminal holocaust memoir. As he says in his preface to the new edition, we all have a \"moral obligation to try and prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory.\" As some people drink to forget, I read to remember.Eliezer Wiesel's memoir sits with Anne Frank's diary at the top of the list of must-read books about the holocaust. While Frank puts a human face on those who died, Wiesel, as one who witnessed and endured the horrors of the holocaust takes the stand and testifies with heartbreaking eloquence of all that he saw and suffered. Much of Wiesel\u2019s eloquence is in its brevity. In little more than 100 pages he dishes up one of the most powerful indictments of Hitler\u2019s Final Solution ever written.  \u201cMen to the left! Women to the right!\u201dEight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment I left my mother. Wow. In 28 words he consigns over half his family to the crematorium. No emotion. No blubber. Yet nothing he could have said could have made the reader feel more keenly the horror of the event. The part of his story that chills me the most is not the constant death but how easily the inmates\u2019 tormenters were able to dehumanize them. What is worse; to kill a man or to turn him into someone who would kill his own father for a crust of bread? Yet Wiesel manages to remind us that even in the depths of Hell, there is room for a touch of the sublime.Those were my thoughts when I heard the sound of a violin. A violin in a dark barrack where the dead were piled on top of the living? It had to be Juliek.He was playing a fragment of a Beethoven concerto. Never before had I heard such a beautiful sound. In such silence. I shall never forget Juliek. How could I forget this concert given before an audience of the dead and dying? Even today, when I hear that particular piece by Beethoven, my eyes close and out of the darkness emerges the pale and melancholy face of my Polish comrade bidding farewell to an audience of dying men.The 2006 revision of the book includes a new preface by Wiesel and, at the end, the acceptance speech when he won the Nobel Peace Prize. In it he saidI swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. Although Elie Wiesel is no longer with us, his words, his testimony, will live on. Jewish tradition teaches us that we are never really dead until there is no one who remembers us. Let us hope that Eliezer Wiesel stays with us for a long, long, time."}, {"userName": "K.D.

Two teenage children who saw the atrocities of the German armies who were blinded by their loyalty to Hitler. There were a few differences: Anne Frank died in the concentration camp while Elie Wiessel survived. Anne Frank's diary, first published as The Diary of a Young Girl in 1950, was written in young girl's language while she was on a hiding while Night by Elie Wiesel tells the experience of a 15-y/o boy inside the concentration camps told later in the language of a 30-y/o man. Of course, I am not expecting Wiesel to do ala Frank McCourt in Angela's Ashes, winning the Pulitzer and later be hounded by controversy that what he told in the story were exaggerated if not untrue. Reading Night was still a haunting and extremely sad experience for me just like any other holocaust novels that I've read so far. I just thought that it would have been more gripping if Wiesel put more meat in his descriptions of the locales in the same manner as what Imre Kertezs (another Holocaust survivor) did in his Fatelessness and of course, Thomas Kennealy (he is a writer only) in Schindler's List. They are just too many books on Holocaust now and these are just the 4 among the more \"famous\" ones but my heart still cries buckets of tears while reading them.Critiquing a well-loved book like this is like blasphemy. I just feel like I am doing the 6 million Jews who perished in that horrendous shameless genocide an injustice if I say something about any literature depicting what they went through. What they went through has marked a permanent etch in our collective psyche. Their stories need to be told to and read by all the future generations. I hope that this generation and all the next ones will remember the Holocaust and learn the lesson from it. Saying these things is almost like a cliche since it is just stating the obvious from a well-known fact.This sounds like a beauty-pageant-kind-of-question but if I were given a chance to talk to one famous living person, I would choose Elie Wiesel. I will ask him what exactly he was thinking in that scene when the young boy with angel's sad face was hanged. He was looking at the boy, who because he weighted light (being a boy), did not die right away but hanged there still breathing for few hours. Somebody at the back said: \"Where is God? Where is God now?\" The 15-y/o Wiesel said: \"Where is He? Here He is - He is hanging here on this gallows.\" I know that he lost faith in God, but later in the scene when there was another \"selection\" he cried out to God again. I would like to know how he was able to switch back his faith despite what he was experiencing in the camp. What is it that make us believers cling on to God despite being all the hopelessness and desperation that we all go through at times?\n\nElie Wiesel is in the second row from the bottom. 7th guy from the left Oh, I have other questions but I hate long reviews.

Wiesel tells us with simple but supremely eloquent prose what effect these daily horrors had on the human soul.

After having been to the Dachau Concentration Camp in Germany, the images of the now-dead ovens still linger somewhere in the recesses of my mind, and to back to it, to read from someone who went through it, was not something I readily wanted to do. But I did; I gathered myself up and read through in a couple of days, the end of the book taking me by surprise, so engrossed I was. I was stoic as I read; no emotion showed on my face, and most of the time I read while alone. Inside, however, it was very different. The world that Wiesel conjures is not a make-believe land, but an echo of the world he lived in, the world he saw destroyed. The experiences he writes about come not from research in books, but from scars in his skin and soul. At times all I wanted to do was to put the book down and never go back, but that would be a gross disservice to all those who went through the fires of Hell and never came back, perhaps even more so to those who did and still bear the scars and carry the torch, crying to the world to Never Forget. At the core, Night is an intensely personal story, one you do not have to be Jewish to understand. Being Jewish helps, though, and makes the story incredibly relevant and compelling. Because as you read all the horrors undergone, you always remember that you are Jewish, that you are one of those they targeted, one of those put into the camps, one of those whom, when the next Hitler comes, will be at risk. I can understand why Wiesel says that, after all the books he has written, Night still holds a special place in his heart and soul; it is probably the same place in which he carved a niche for the story in the heart of every reader."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "In 1944, at the age of fifteen, Elie Wiesel, his parents and three sisters, were transported from Sighet to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Upon arriving they were ordered, \"men to the left, women to the right\". Elie would never see his mother and younger sister Sarah again. What followed was two years of living hell, two years of \"night\". What it was like in a concentration camp, what it was like for Elie and his father, can not be put into words that would be adequate to describe the reality. But Elie's account is graphic enough to make us wonder how anyone could have survived this horror. Most didn't; Elie's mother and youngest sister Sarah didn't; and Elie's father, who he tried to look after, tried to keep alive, didn't. Elie and his father survived a death march in the dead of winter from Auschwitz to Buchenwald where his father finally succumbed to illness and beatings. In the spring of 1945 the American Army arrived to liberate the camp and end the \"night\", or the nightmare. This book is hard to read, as are most books on this horror of the 20th century, but this is first hand account and reminds us of what human ignorance, hatred, and bigotry are capable of, and don't think for one minute it could never happen again because it can.Elie's two older sisters, Hilda and Bea, both survived the concentration camps and all were later reunited. In 1986 Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "Even though I have read many other books about the Holocaust, none of them have left me feeling quite so haunted as \"Night\". It's a book that everyone should read. Based on author Elie Wiesel's experiences, the narrator is an observant Jewish fifteen-year-old in the Hungarian village of Sighet. His family and other Jews were sent to live in the ghetto by the Nazis. Then they were loaded onto cattle cars and traveled for days without food to Birkenau. Eliezer and his father were sent to Auschwitz while his mother and sister were placed in another line, probably headed for the crematorium.Eliezer eloquently remembers the horror of Nazi cruelty--hard labor, beatings, and a lack of food and warm clothing. He shows how fighting for survival can also turn Jews against each other as they fight for a scrap of bread. His father offers emotional support, but is also a burden as he weakens. Eliezer questions his faith in God who allows such evil and suffering in the world. He is transformed physically, emotionally, and spiritually by his experiences. This chilling quotation sums up Eliezer's reaction to the horror so well:\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.Never.\""}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "I had trouble discerning whether this book was actually incredibly well written, or just horrifyingly honest enough to shock you into awe. What I have pulled from it is less the prose, and more the images burned in my brain from the chilling facts that they express. Having read The Lost, I was at least somewhat prepared for the places Wiesel was to take me, and the terror contained within this short volume is actually minor compared to the extensive atrocities researched and transcribed by Mendelsohn in his much larger, multiple-family account which includes photographs to get you really invested, scans of documents to validate his every statement, and transcripts of interviews with dozens of survivors to carve out a sense of emotional authenticity. At the same time, Mendelsohn did not actually go through the suffering inflicted upon the Jewish people during the Holocaust, and so with his voice comes this mildly disingenuous edge. Wiesel, on the other hand, has an authority which provides such weight to his writing that I would argue that Night, though compact and limited in scope compared to other books about Nazi cruelty toward the Jewish people of Europe, is probably the better of all the books I have read on the subject. Rather than just state the facts, Wiesel lets you in on how it really felt. He fesses up to the places that hunger and anguish can take you, to the way you can start to feel animosity toward even your own father, simply for continuing to live (and perhaps dragging you down in the process). To feeling so overwhelmed by the fear of death that you are actually emotionally void as you watch someone hanged in front of you, as at least it is one less mouth to feed, at least its not you, at least... He walks you through the guilt that inevitably follows such thoughts, and the constant meditation and self-analysis necessary to maintain your humanity in such inconceivably bleak circumstances. Attempting to imagine Wiesel finding the inner strength to voice these memories is explanation enough for what at times felt like terse phrasing. Forget harsh, I would probably be a robot if I survived something like this. I would talk. about. it. like this. If. at all. After a ten year wait, Wiesel finally decided to exorcise his demons with a scream. Well, the ones that were at all willing to leave. Read it in one sitting. I'm going to go off and figure out how to separate paragraphs now.*To be fair, I think I may have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about Mendelsohn for that article he wrote trashing Tarantino for Inglourious Basterds. His book really is solid and engaging. I just like this one (and Quentin Tarantino) better. I mean no harm."}], "description": "Born into a Jewish ghetto in Hungary, as a child, Elie Wiesel was sent to the Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. This is his account of that atrocity: the ever-increasing horrors he endured, the loss of his family and his struggle to survive in a world that stripped him of humanity, dignity and faith. Describing in simple terms the tragic murder of a people from a survivor's perspective, Night is among the most personal, intimate and poignant of all accounts of the Holocaust.
