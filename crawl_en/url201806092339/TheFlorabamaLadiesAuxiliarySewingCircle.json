I didn't like some of the stereotypes the author used (for example, the Indian family who owned the motel at the interstate exit in southern Alabama, and all the black service workers).I was 3/4 of the way through the novel when I finally understood the title, and I think that should have been evident earlier. It took a long time for her to set the scene. I understand that she wanted to create empathy for the characters, and that takes time, but it seemed like lots of character-building and not moving the story along for more than the first half of the book. Some of the character growth seemed to happen off-page -- or maybe just too suddenly. I was reading along, and then suddenly a couple is moving in together and taking on responsibility for some extra kids; a secondary character suddenly does something that negatively affects a whole bunch of characters (primary and secondary), and that surprised me. I didn't see it coming, and I think I should have. I was mostly satisfied with the ending; it's probably how I would have wanted the characters to end up. I might have made some tweaks."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190427-maria", "userReview": "I enjoyed some parts of this book tremendously, but overall it was mediocre. The author tried to cram too many characters in, and as a result it seemed that most of them ended up flat, like wallpaper. I think I still could have given the book a 3 instead of a 2, but the overuse of \"sotto voce\" in this novel was quite honestly unforgivable to me. The term was out of place, not fitting with the writing style at all, and it shouldn't have made it in even once. I counted at least eight uses of it (one of which occurred a mere two pages after the previous). It was distracting enough that my mind was focused on remembering how many times I'd read those words and not on the story. Most of the book was at least interesting enough to keep me reading on, but I lost motivation when I reached the end and ended up simply skimming the last 20 pages or so."}, {"userName": "Tammie", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2304074-tammie", "userReview": "This book was enjoyable. Some parts more than others. While the writer did well on the chapters concerning her main charactor Bonnie, who is upper-middle class, she treats Bonnie's students, women who have worked in a factory that has shut down due to foreign competition, as one-dimentional, childlike creatures. There is a condescending presence with them throughout the book, as if people caught up in this kind of life and work are somehow less complete personalities and of lower intelligence. There are towns in the South now that are nearly ghost towns because of all the businesses relocating to other countries because of Nafta and Cafta and such, leaving behind people struggling for existence, but these are fully adult, fully human people, the majority of whom are as intelligent as those born with a silver spoon, they just have to struggle harder to survive.  The romance part of the story is very delighful and Bonnie's family very real. The story is good and the characters interesting, I just can't help but feel a pre-Civil War attitude of the upper class toward the lower class (race not withstanding) winding through this book as she interfaces with those of lesser opportunity and is shocked to find one of them (Ruth) intelligent and several of them capapble. Bonnie suceeds in finding labor for the group, helping them to make ends meet, but with the attitude that their value is only in their labor, while their mental abilities are limited. It was \"just ok\", nothing more."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6102457-janice", "userReview": "If you read the jacket leaves, you've read the book."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6906916-joan", "userReview": "This book was disappointing.

There is a sewing bit in the last third of the book, but it isn't explored as well as it could have been. The story follows the ladies as they are downsized out of jobs, and try to find their way in new situations, returning to school and finding work. The sewing circle becomes a way to make some money, but even that has a disaster that the central character should have seen coming, I sure did. It annoys me when a woman is portrayed as just being stupid, making idiotic choices.

One day she's new on the job and the next time she's at work, she's established support groups and rapport. And, it started to bother me how many times she didn't remember something from her past when talking to childhood and college friends.

I was in college at the time so my world was very removed from hers. I am a native Alabamian, but I've always lived in a bigger city whereas Florabama is a small town. I can say that in my own family, we've experienced a situation where one of my relatives had to shut down his own factory because people were able to buy similar items at cheaper prices in stores like Wal-Mart. The stories are familiar to me, but not closely related. Also, many of the characters spoke with prejudices and used racial stereotypical phrases. I didn't like that, and it's not something I'm used to. Yes, I am a Southerner, and yes, I have heard many of those statements, but my family doesn't talk that way nor my friends and we don't think it's okay. Not all Southerners are quite so polarizing about things.Compare Bonnie and Ruth. Even though they come from such diverse backgrounds, how are their situations similar?Bonnie and Ruth are both similar in the amazing character growth they experienced thanks to being at the college. Bonnie found her sense of self and was able to use her natural talents and caring nature to nurture and help the women from the factory. Ruth was able to find the dream she once lost, she found her voice, she found the strength and support she needed to step out and live her life.Compare the leading men in Bonnie's life: the Duke, Riz, and Devoe. What are their strengths and weaknesses? How does each represent the typical \"Southern\" gentleman? How, if at all, does each represent the typical \"modern\" man?First off, the \"typical Southern gentleman\" is a man with manners, who loves and respects his mama, and works hard but plays harder. In my opinion, none of these men represent the \"typical Southern gentleman.\" Of course, all three of those men are in a higher class of society than I've ever entered. Devoe is a man who got caught up in the mistaken notion that more money and more things make a person happy and important. Riz is a sad soul who places his physical needs above anything else, feeding his lustful desires, and living a life of pleasure. The Duke represents the generation where men believed talking about emotions made them weak. He was a good provider, who loves his family, though and I think he always did what he thought best for them.What role does money play in this novel? Is it always a good thing to have? What are the ramifications of having too much? What are the benefits of not always having enough? Money is like a secondary character of this novel. It's represented with Devoe's indulgence and \"borrowing\" money he couldn't repay, it's represented in Elice's love of shopping and fancy things, it's represented in the factory workers who suddenly had even less than the little they had to begin with, it's represented in Bonnie where she must learn to adjust to a life lived paycheck to paycheck but she always knows she can get help from the Duke if she needs. I think having too much money can cause someone to feel better than people without money, but people without lots of money can become prejudiced towards people who are wealthy. Money is a dividing factor in relationships and can mean life or illness for someone who can't afford to even buy an antibiotic. Having money or not having money isn't an excuse for having a poor attitude, of being rude to other people, or to lose your identity.In the beginning of the novel, Bonnie looks back on her marriage to Devoe, before his bankruptcy and their divorce, and observes that she had lead a \"charmed life.\" Do you think a year later she would make that same observation? The observation that her life with Devoe, raising their kids, and helping charities was a charmed life? Yes, I do think she'd make the same observation, because it's true. That doesn't mean her life with Devoe was perfect, their marriage was obviously a bit flawed, but nothing is perfect. On page 7, Mrs. Patel, the hotel owner, says, \"Sometimes when we are in difficulty, old habits of the mind are the worst obstacles.\" What does she mean by \"old habits of the mind?\" How does this piece of wisdom apply to Bonnie? To the women she advises? I think that this could be an example of how Bonnie used to think about poor people. When she first met the ladies, she made some rather ignorant assumptions because they had worked in factories and not graduated from college. She thought that meant they weren't intelligent enough to complete college courses, or maybe even start their lives over. Bonnie also had to get over her old life, where she could buy whatever she wanted and not consider the price, she couldn't do that anymore and she had to learn to think about setting up house in a different way.The first night in her new house, Bonnie writes in a journal that she feels \"stripped.\" She is reminded of what she felt as an adolescent, \"as though her adult life had been no more than an interim, and now she'd come back to her reflective, questioning, self-conscious nature, worried about who she was, her place in the world, what the future would hold.\" These are scary feelings for a normally self-confident woman. Have you ever had these feelings? What kinds of incidents prompted them? I've lived most of my life as a questioning, self-conscious person. I'm only just learning to take confidence in my abilities and trust in my own opinions and observances about the world around me.What elements of the novel\u2014characters, events, setting\u2014are uniquely Southern? Could this story have taken place anywhere else in the country?Uniquely Southern? I wouldn't know. I've lived my whole life in the South so everything just seemed normal to me. Well, with the exception of laquered doughnuts, I don't know a single person who would spend so much money on a table decoration, nor many who could even afford to do so. How has Battle's depiction of the modern South changed your own perceptions about that part of the country? LoL, it actually made me wonder what people are associating Alabama with! The racial and poor stereotyping bothers me quite a bit. \"That part of the country\" isn't portrayed in the characters as I believe would be true to the area. Not my personal experience, just saying.What do you think of Bonnie's relationship with Riz? Besides a new mattress, what does he offer her? Is he better for her than Devoe? What will become of their relationship? I hate Bonnie's relationship with Riz. He's not at all interested in her as a person, he treats her like a toy he pick up when he wants and treat as he pleases, then set down until he wants it again. As far as I can tell, the only thing he offered her was the feeling of sexiness and desirability she probably lost in the last years of her marriage and her divorce, maybe even lost as a mother when she became more focused on raising her kids than her sex appeal. I hope she ends the relationship and finds a partner who listens and cares for her as a person, not as a bed fellow.Many of the characters in this novel have faced enormous losses and overwhelming adversity\u2014and ended up better off than they were before. Can you think of situations where disasters turned into triumphs? How can we apply the lessons these characters learned to our own daily lives?Sometimes it takes a tragedy or a loss to realize you aren't living in a manner worthy of your specialness and talents. I've experienced this several times in my own life. You don't always realize the benefit of hitting bottom, or having it hit you, at the time, you're so busy clawing and biting your way up to clean air that you don't even realize you're back on top of the mountain until you're standing there."}, {"userName": "Joyce Reynolds-Ward", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7315925-joyce-reynolds-ward", "userReview": "I liked parts of this book.

It's usually undemanding, has an interesting story, and can be enjoyed without a need to Google meanings of words or finding out more about historic events (that's fun, too, but that's for when I have more ambition).Florabama etc., is about women who have been thrown out of work thanks to their factory going out of business, and their new college counselor who is starting over after her husband squanders their savings and then abandons her. There's a lot of gumption here, along with the power and strength of female friendships, the healing energy of new love, and the learning curve in figuring out what you are willing to give up and what you would be wise to walk away from. I had difficulties with the patronizing way that the newly-unemployed ladies were dealt with, and the title is a misnomer, given that the Sewing Circle of the title is only briefly mentioned (and very late in the story). I also got frustrated with the way Bonnie behaved sometimes. Finally, the ending is terribly ambiguous - I realize we are meant to use our own imaginations to think about what happens next, but it feels so open ended that I had to wonder if Ms. Battle got to her page quota and just quit typing. Overall, reading this was an \"okay\" experience.

Hilly falls in love and we hear what she is thinking. \"His teeth must be white from eating rice and beans. He's tall for a Mexican.\" Weird stuff like that.
