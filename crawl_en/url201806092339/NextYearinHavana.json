In the acknowledgments, which introduce the book, Chanel Cleeeton call this \u201cthe book of my heart\u201d and thanks her family for sharing their stories. It wasn\u2019t until I heard her in an interview relating a story that her father told her about how people would put their valuables in boxes and bury the box before they left Cuba, that I knew the specific thing. This seemed to reflect a hope that they would someday return. A box buried by a young girl as she and her family flee Cuba in 1958 is a meaningful part of this novel. I loved knowing that this was the spark that started this story and that she is connected to the narrative because her family did indeed flee Cuba after the revolution. In Havana, in the late 1950s we meet Elisa from an affluent family, sugar barons as they are leaving Cuba. This narrative alternates with her granddaughter Marisol\u2019s in 2017 as she goes to Cuba to spread her grandmother\u2019s ashes. The past story is a love story where the political history of Cuba in the late 1950s is played out. I have to admit how little I really knew about this complicated history from the not too distant past. That made it all the more interesting to me.On one level you could read this as a love story and then there is another love story in the present day (which is not as believable as the earlier one ) or you could see the history and the politics, the Cuba of the past and present through these relationships. A story of family ties, love, and friendship woven into the politics and history of pre-revolutionary Cuba connecting it to the present day. Loyalty, love of country , the dangerous business of beliefs contrary to those in power told with the natural beauty of the island as the backdrop and the ambiance of Havana. I felt confident of the details of the politics given that the author has academic degrees in international politics. I thoroughly enjoyed this even with an ending that was a little too pat. It was well written and appealed to me from the beginning to the end.

With one step I am removed from the fringes and thrust in the middle of my life. In that space of the step, my world shifts. Everything is different now, and nothing will ever be the same again.NEXT YEAR IN HAVANA is beautifully written and at times excessive in the detailed description of the surroundings and landscape of Cuba and its inhabitants. It did enable me to picture a Country I will never get to see in my lifetime and in that aspect, I did appreciate the descriptive narrative. This read more like a history book than a romance. While there are two sets of couples, they seemed to play a secondary role to that of the main characters which were Cuba and its history of unrest and rebellion.The story switches from past to present. The past being 1958-59 Havana, where Elisa Perez lives with her parents and sisters. In the present, Elisa\u2019s granddaughter, Marisol Ferrera, is on a journey from Miami to Cuba where she has been assigned the task to spread her grandmother\u2019s ashes. Although having been exiled from Cuba for nearly sixty years, Elisa always yearned for a chance to someday return to the Country she called \u201dhome\u201d. When she was nineteen she fled Cuba with her family after Fidel Castro came into power. Her family was one of the wealthiest and powerful in Havana and a prime target for Castro.Marisol was very close to her grandmother and her death affected Marisol deeply. She knows that it still isn\u2019t safe for her to be going to Cuba but is determined to fulfill her grandmother\u2019s dying wish. She\u2019s also excited to be going to the place that her grandmother spent so many nights telling stories about. Marisol embraces her heritage. When she meets Ana Rodriguez, Elisa\u2019s childhood best friend, Marisol is given a box that Elisa left behind. What she discovers inside is a secret that Elisa took with her to her grave and Marisol questions whether she ever truly knew her grandmother. Marisol sets off on a mission to uncover her grandmother\u2019s secret past and along the way finds her own romance with Luis, a history professor at the University of Cuba and also Ana\u2019s grandson.During flashbacks, we learn how Elisa meets her one true love and how a happily ever after for them is nearly impossible. When we are back in the present we see that history is repeating itself with Marisol and Luis.Will Marisol have the HEA that her grandmother was unable to attain?Here are my overall ratings on the book:\nHeroes:\n 4\nHeroines:\n 4\nPlot:\n 4\nAngst:\n3\nSteam:\n 2\nChemistry Between Hero & Heroine:\n 3NEXT YEAR IN HAVANA releases tomorrow.Book Links: Amazon: http://amzn.to/2pdQBKF Barnes & Noble: http://bit.ly/2pYsJJYiBooks: http://apple.co/2pvYffqIndieBound: http://bit.ly/2zrt11mKobo: http://bit.ly/2wPZPMU"}, {"userName": "Astrid - \u2606Vanilla & Spice Books\u2606 ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7420520-astrid---vanilla-spice-books", "userReview": "Boy, 2018 has been epic so far...\nMy heart is full. Full with love for the characters of this book. With shame about my ignorance of the danger and problems Cuban people still face on a daily basis. Admiration for their bravery and pride. Affection for their good hearts. Sadness for their heartbreak. I struggle to get a grip on my emotions as I sit here and write my review.\nHow long will we be gone? When will we return? Which version of Cuba will greet us when we do?\nMarisol's exiled grandmother's last wish was for her remains to return to the home of her heart, Cuba, one of the priceless gems in the Caribbean Sea. Marisol only knows her country from stories her grandmother Elisa told her, who raised her and who she was closest to. Arriving in Cuba she traces back Elisa's life. At her side is Elisa's best friend Ana's grandson Luis. Together they uncover secrets only a few people apart from Elisa knew about.Two timelines follow alternating Elisa and Pablo as well as Marisol and Luis. There are parallels between Elisa's love for Pablo and Marisol's for Luis. Both of them love highly educated men, who have a deep love for their country. Patriotism isn't just a word for them, they live it, breathe it...die for it. And both of these men possess a quiet strength, an earnestness and intensity that draws both Elisa and Marisol in.It isn't surprising that Marisol and Elisa fall in love with men who have so similar character traits. Marisol and Elisa share the same kindness, brave heart, curiosity and love for their country. When Elisa's secrets start to surface it throws Marisol a little bit for a loop. Doubts about her knowledge of the woman who raised her arise, make her question if she knew her grandmother at all. Slowly she also realizes how\u00a0romanticized her image of Cuba is.\nI am Cuban, and yet, I am not. I don\u2019t know where I fit here, in the land of my grandparents, attempting to recreate a Cuba that no longer exists in reality.\nLuis and Marisol's instant attraction becomes complicated fast, their connection turns quickly into deep feelings. But how can they be together when neither of them fits into the world of the other? This stalemate situation makes you understand, however, that as divergent Luis and Marisol are, they also have a lot in common. It's exactly the same situation Marisol's grandmother and Pablo found themselves in, when they fell in love.\n\u201cIn this moment, I want you. But after that\u2014\u201d\u201cThen maybe we just have this moment.\u201d\u201cIs that enough?\u201dHe smiles, a tinge of sadness on his face. \u201cI have a feeling there will never be enough moments with you, Marisol.\u201d\nAs we follow Marisol and Elisa we learn about the Cuba pre-revolution and the Cuba of today. Chanel Cleeton draws the country in brilliant and rich colors and makes you want to get on a plane and visit, to see it with your own eyes. I adored all the main characters and Luis' grandmother Ana. There is a warmth, a gentleness to all of them despite the harshness they experience.Cuba is the fifth star in this story and she is as beautiful as she is terrifying. The author weaves her immense and profound knowledge of the country into the story and fascinates us with historical details. I suspect she also poured a lot of herself into Marisol and Elisa.\nThere is no home for us in a world where we can\u2019t speak our minds for fear of being thrown in prison, where daring to dream is a criminal act, where you aren\u2019t limited by your own ability and ambition, but instead by the whims of those who keep a tight rein on power.\nThis story is powerful and extraordinary. It's a history class with a handsome professor who has the ability to captivate and enchant you with spellbinding, informative and lovely narration about the people, politics and history of a beautiful country. Yes, there is a lot of historical details in the beginning and while this makes for a slower reading in the first 30 to 40% it is absolutely essential to understand the bigger picture. I loved learning about the Cuban revolution from somebody with such intimate knowledge about it.But do not fear, the story picks up at around 40% and then it reaches that level of unputdownable that I experience with all Chanel Cleeton books. I love all her stories but this time she has outdone herself.\u00a0Heads up - this is not romance. I think it qualifies more as fiction with romantic elements. But don't let that keep you from reading it, it packs a good amount of romance and love.This is the book I never knew was missing from my life. It has made me richer and given me an insight into the dangers Cuban people are still dealing with. I can't stress how important this story is, how fascinating, emotional, wonderful and educating. I have a new understanding of the history and I hope one day Cuban people will be free and rid of the regime so that their inherent exuberance and vibrancy can shine again with full power.\u00a0\nWe carry our home with us in our hearts, laden with hope. So much hope.\n\u00a0Next year in Havana.

The book opens with the Perez family fleeing Cuba after the revolution. This is the first thread of the story. The second is Elise Perez's granddaughter Marisol, traveling to Cuba, sixty years later to scatter her ashes in the country she had loved. The history of Cuba, Batista, Che and Castro are told in bold, detailed fashion using the Perez family to add a human element and interest to the story. This story would be my favorite part of the book, a look back at what happened to the Perez family, and a revolution that promised much be delivered little. Said to have ended Batista's cruelty, in effect, in one quote by the author, it just replaced one dictator with another.Marisol would find love in Havana but also many other things she didn't know she was looking for. Again the descriptions of Havana we're done well, but that in one week two people would fall in love, was a bit unbelievable. I enjoyed the characters, the different looks at the people who fled Cuba, and those who stayed. There are a few surprises along the way, in this very readable book. Things may be more open in Cuba but as the book shows the danger for some is far from over. Very well written, the history, thankfully for me but maybe all readers will not feel the same, overshadowed the love story. The ending poignant, heartfelt but a little to pat. All in all z good read about a country of which I am still learning.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "4.5 stars!   \u201cAm I dangerous?\u201d\u201cI have a feeling you just might be.\u201d  I made a resolution to myself last year that I would make more of an effort to read new to me authors when selecting future books. Chanel Cleeton is a new to me author, and when I saw the cover and title of this book I knew I needed to get my hands on it. And man oh man am I so glad I did because I loved this story.Next Year in Havana is told in present day by Marisol, a young woman grieving her recently deceased grandmother, Elisa, and goes to Cuba to spread her ashes. We also get Elisa\u2019s story in 1958 Cuba, a story of love and a divided country. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about the plot, but know both stories present and past are beautiful and will surprise you.  \u201cI walk down these streets, and I look out to the sea, and I want to feel as though I belong here, but I am a visitor here, a guest in my own country.\u201d\u201cThen you know what it means to be Cuban.\u201d  Cuba has always been a subject of interest for me, but not one strong enough for me to do some heavy research. Reading this book I felt I learned a lot about the country and its history, its present day happenings as well. At times the characters I felt got a little bit too political and by that I mean I did skim some political stuffs because it was feeling repetitive and preachy, but I honestly didn\u2019t mind it that much because I\u2019m giving it 4.5 stars.Normally when a book is told from two point of views I find I like one more than the other, but that really wasn\u2019t the case in this book. I loved Marisol and Elisa\u2019s stories equally, wanting to know more about both and never wanting to skip a POV. Both women are caught in impossible situations because of issues beyond their control. They feel powerless, and yet do everything they can for the people they love.Reading this book I felt as if I was transported to Cuba. I\u2019ve never been but felt I have based on the descriptive nature of this book. Cleeton is excellent at bringing her readers into her story and I honestly can say I am dying for her to write more books like this one.I know I will remember this book for years to come.   \u201cNo one warned me love would hurt so much.\u201d   ARC provided by the publisher Follow me on \u2665 Facebook \u2665 Blog \u2665 Instagram \u2665 Twitter \u2665"}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "Every once in a while I start a book and from page one I am completely enamored with the every aspect of the book - the plot, the characters, the setting, and the relationships. Next Year in Havana is this type of book; as I read, I was constantly ruminating about how fabulous the book was. I love that feeling, and to me, it is the sign of an exceptionally good book. Next Year in Havana is told in a dual timeline format, alternating between the late 1950\u2019s and present day. Both story lines are equally compelling, and Chanel Cleeton artfully incorporates both the beauty and history of Cuba into her tale about courage in the face of family and loss. Cleeton\u2019s family fled Cuba in 1967, and the personal connection and love she feels for the country are reflected in her tale. Cuba is a fascinating place to me, and stories set there always appeal to me. Next Year in Havana stands out because the author effectively integrates a significant amount of Cuban history while crafting a beautiful tale of family, love, and enduring relationships. I had never really understood the schism between those who left Cuba after Fidel Castro came into power versus those that remained. Without taking sides, Cleeton engenders sympathy for both groups and the difficult choices that those individuals had to make when choosing which path to take.I was curious about the title of the book when I began reading and thankfully she explains it: \u201cAs exiles, \u2026 hope is embedded in the very essence of our soul. \u2018Next Year in Havana. It\u2019s the toast we never stop saying, because the dream of it never comes true.\u2019 \u201d What a beautiful tribute to Cuba that decades later those exiled still hope year after year that they can one day return, and how incredibly sad that it has still not come to pass.Sadly, I think it is easy for Americans to forget how lucky we are to live in a country where freedom is taken for granted. Reading about present day Cuba is scary: internet and cell phone coverage is scarce, the government controls what information is disseminated, food shortages are common, and retribution for speaking out can be punishable by death. The reminder is helpful in our current political environment; freedom and equality are worth protecting, and it is important to speak out against those attempting to infringe on those rights.Next Year in Havana is spectacular. I loved the entire book and was thrilled with the small surprise at the end. I had an inkling that the surprise might be coming and was glad when it worked out that way. I struggled a bit with the resolution of the present day story line but am not sure that there was any other way for it to end; it certainly did not impact my view of the book. The cover of Next Year in Havana deserves to be mentioned also; it is simply stunning and fits the book beautifully. Thanks to Berkley Publishing and BookBrowse for the chance to read this ARC.

I loved parts & I disliked others. I loved Elise\u2019s story... the struggles she faced in a changing Cuba were heartbreaking. I had a vague knowledge of Cuba\u2019s tumultuous past & present, so I really found that part very interesting. At the same time, I enjoyed learning more about Cuba\u2019s struggles it felt over done in Marisol\u2019s story. The sentiments became very repetitive which made me lose interest & start skimming. Marisol & Luis\u2019s relationship was another aspect I didn\u2019t like. It seemed forced and tried too hard to mirror Elise\u2019s story. All-in-all not a bad story overall. I look forward to reading more novels about Cuba. \u2018To be Cuban is to be proud\u2014it is both our greatest gift and our biggest curse.

I will admit that I was reluctant to read this one at first, as I don\u2019t typically read romance novels and being that most of this author\u2019s previous works were contemporary romances, I was worried that this would be along the same lines -- however I decided to give this one a try, as I was drawn in by the historical aspect and also curiosity with the setting being in Cuba. It turns out I was right to give this one a chance, as the romance aspect actually took a backseat to the history and also family dynamics, turning this into a wonderfully written work of historical fiction rather than a run-of-the-mill romance trope.Alternating between two timelines, the story is narrated first by Elisa Perez in the late 1950s, as Cuba is in the midst of a revolution led by Fidel Castro against president Batista, and then later by Elisa\u2019s granddaughter Marisol Ferrara, nearly 60 years later, as she travels to Cuba for the first time to fulfill her grandmother\u2019s dying wish for her ashes to be scattered in the country that always had a special place in her heart. As we accompany Marisol on a journey that is as much about discovering her roots, her heritage, as it is about coming to terms with the death of the beloved grandmother who raised her, we are given insight into the history of Cuba \u2013 more specifically Havana \u2013 and what life is like for its people both in modern day as well as back during the revolutionary period, in Elisa\u2019s time. The juxtaposition of the two versions of Cuba \u2013 Marisol\u2019s romanticized version passed on to her from family stories and memories versus the \u2018real\u2019 version of the Cuban people\u2019s perpetual struggle and sacrifice \u2013 provided an eye-opening look at a country that embodied both beauty and hope as well as devastation and suffering. The disparity was so jarring at times that it really made me think about how grateful I am to live in a country that values freedom and at the same time, how so many things are taken for granted. I was absolutely humbled by passages such as this one, which was both a powerful and timely reminder of how lucky we are living in the times and parts of the world that we do: \u201cI can\u2019t fathom living in a world where you have no rights, where there is no oversight, no accountability. The United States isn\u2019t perfect; there\u2019s injustice everywhere I turn. But there\u2019s also a mechanism that protects its citizens \u2013 the right to question when something is wrong, to speak out, to protest, to be heard. It doesn\u2019t always work, sometimes the system fails those it was designed to protect, but at least that opportunity \u2013 the hope of it \u2013 exists.\u201d This was just one of many thought-provoking passages in this book \u2014 so many in fact that I found myself highlighting quite a bit and also stopping to reflect on some of the issues that were brought up.In terms of the writing, I am blown away by how well-written this book was \u2013 the skill with which the author was able to weave all the historical details into the narrative yet still present such a compelling, heartfelt story with wonderfully layered characters was, to me, beyond impressive. The writing was descriptive and beautiful, but most importantly, it was incredibly atmospheric, which I feel is one of the things that sets this book apart from some of the other works of historical fiction I\u2019ve read recently. The author Chanel Cleeton did a wonderful job of establishing a strong sense of place and time, so much so that I felt like I was transported to Havana myself and was truly able to get a feel for the city and Cuba as a whole, its inhabitants and their way of life. There were so many topics that the book touched on \u2013 social injustice, economic inequality and instability, political strife, love, family, sacrifice, etc. \u2013 but the parts that drew me in the most were the details about Cuba\u2019s history and culture, especially the emotions and conflict surrounding what it meant to be Cuban for those who fled the country and live in exile yet were still forever connected to their heritage versus those who stayed behind, whether willingly or unwillingly, and what they had to endure as a result. As mentioned in the book, much of Cuban history is political and so inevitably there were a lot of passages about politics throughout the story, yet not once did I feel that this book was trying to push a particular political message or viewpoint. To me, this is a testament to the author\u2019s skill as a writer, as she was able to incorporate the politics piece in a way that impartially presented both sides, allowing us as the readers to determine for ourselves which (if any) side we related more to. I also appreciated the fact that the author, who herself is Cuban-American, wove in elements of her own family history and experiences fleeing from Cuba after the revolution, as her passion for her heritage and her country\u2019s history truly did shine through. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this one and learned a lot from it.

The cover is breathtakingly beautiful and the blurb promised the reader an unforgettable story. I was very interested in Che Guevara in my early twenties, and I still find him to be a fascinating person. And the history of Cuba is also very interesting so guess my delight to get the chance of reading a historical fiction book set in Cuba.Next year in Havana has a dual storyline, with one story taking place in 1958 when Batista was driven from the country and Castro took control of the country and you either stayed and took your chance with the new government or you left like the Perez family did in this book. They hoped that they would one day return to Havana, but it will not be until 2017 before a member of the Perez family will return when Marisol Ferrera travels to her family's birth country.I particularly liked the contrast between now and then Cuba will reading the book. In many ways have time stood still in Cuba since Castro took power and through this book, one gets a glimpse both how it was during Batista's rule and the situations in the country after Castro's death. The most tragic thing is that the people just wanted to be free and they thought Castro would be the one to give back Cuba to its people. It didn't turn out that way instead they traded one terrible situation for another.The book also promotes the reader some passionate love stories, both Elisa and Marisol found themselves swept off their feet. I guarantee if you are looking for some great love stories, then you don't need to look any further!Next Year in Havana is a fantastic book with two equally interesting storylines.

Pain, loss, fear, anguish, and joy for the unknown is what will keep you wanting to know more. Told from dual pov\u2019s between 1958 and 2017 from two family members, this was the story of one family\u2019s turmoil and heartbreak and how they survived life after being exiled from Cuba. Now that decades have passed, one granddaughter is making it her mission to abide by her grandmother\u2019s wish to go back to Cuba and spread her ashes over the land that she loved and called home. But what Marisol was not expecting was to uncover a trail of secrets left by her family after their departure.\nWith a country like Cuba that was so restricted and run by a political force, you couldn\u2019t help but to be sucked in to everything that was going on around you.

I can't summarize it in a way that shows you just how wonderful this book was to read, you just have to read it yourself. Next Year in Havana is a beautiful, heart wrenching tale that brings Cuba and its inhabitants, and exiles, to life. It's one of the best Historical Fictions I have read in a very long time, with incredible, descriptive writing and a story that pulled so much emotion from me. I found myself entranced, enjoying the opulence of upper-class life with Elisa Perez as Chanel Cleeton took us back in time to 1959 and the magical, but increasingly dangerous streets of Havana. Told from the dual perspectives of Elisa in the past and her great-granddaughter, Marisol, in the present, readers get to visit the city frozen in time. It's about love, passion, history, freedom, and patriotism. \"I can't do this. I can't leave. I can't stay.\"Elisa and Marisol's time in Cuba mirror one anothers, with Marisol learning far more about the woman she called grandmother while on the streets she once roamed. I really appreciated how similar Elisa and Marisol were, yet their differences were distinct and profound when you consider the locations and politics that each grew up in. They each are strong, stubborn women who yearn for knowledge and adventure that their families do not understand. Marisol's knowledge of Cuba is from romantic stories of the past, an impossible dream that reality could never live up to, and so similar to the viewpoint that many young Americans still have. Her view is changed as she sees Cuba as it is today, crumbling, but still sparkling and strong. Elisa's view is from the viewpoint of a woman on the cusp of true adulthood, her place in the world not meant for politics and social injustice, but her love of a passionate, educated man challenges that. \"These are the stories of my childhood come to life, the spirit of my grandmother, my family, our legacy, everywhere i turn.\"Chanel Cleeton details the pre-revolution change and present day regime with extensive detail, bringing emotion and personal feelings into a story we only know from the pages of history books. Both secondary male characters, Pablo and Luis, open up the main character's eyes, their quiet insubordination and challenge of the power exerted on them shaking up the comfort each has had in their unenlightened lives. There is so much grace in how Elisa and Marisol accept the difficulties presented to them, with Elisa embracing the struggles of exile and Marisol adopting the same courage many Cubans do with seeking and sharing the realities and truths of life in Cuba. Then there's the many secondary characters, beginning with Ana and growing increasingly more interesting with each interaction with the people of Elisa's past, like Magda, and the new people in Marisol's present, like Luis, Cristina, and even her great-aunt Beatriz. Each shares their view on Cuba as it was and is today, their stories shaping Marisol and bringing her even closer to her grandmother and to the country that feels like home.\"It's raucous and beautiful, and more than anything, I want to belong here, want this city to become a part of me.\"Next Year in Havana was such a powerful story for me, with Cuba coming to life with Chanel Cleeton's imagery and the detail given to the injustices of life there so evocative. The novel came across as very authentic, with two equally important plots, the romance of the characters and the romance between the country and its people. I was so overcome with emotion, I cried at times that weren't truly sad moments in the story, but rather tugged at my heart as I pictured Cuba and its resilient people. It took this book from a historical romance to a literary masterpiece, the pages filled with culture and people devoted to a country that has let it down.\u201c \u2018Next Year in Havana. It\u2019s the toast we never stop saying, because the dream of it never comes true.\u2019 \u201dNext Year in Havana is a romantic, hopeful story with well-developed characters whose adventures parallel one another in past and present Cuba. I really fell in love with this novel and have so much compassion for the characters. It's a thoughtful novel, poignant and very relevant to the times. Historical Fiction fans will fall in love with Next Year in Havana and Chanel Cleeton's lyrical prose. You'll find yourself wandering the streets of Havana, admiring the vintage cars and the bright colors, and you won't regret a moment spent living in this book. If you're a sentimental girl like me, grab a pack of tissues for when you start your journey.ARC provided."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Leopold", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9004645-suzanne-leopold", "userReview": "Marisol Ferrara was raised by her late grandmother, Elisa, who immigrated from Cuba in the 1950\u2019s.

I have to admit that the beautiful cover of this book is what first caught my attention. Once I took a closer look, I decided to give it a try since the story sounded really interesting. The book ended up being more than interesting. I was swept away by the story and felt Cuba come alive within the pages. I am so glad that I decided to give this book a try.This story is told in two timelines. Marisol's story is set in 2017 shortly after her grandmother's death. She goes to Cuba to see the country where her grandmother grew up and find the right place to spread her ashes. Elisa is Marisol's grandmother. Her story is set in 1958 as Cuba is in crisis. I really enjoyed both of the timelines equally and loved how everything came together.I really liked the characters in this book. Elisa and her family were in a very difficult situation. The fact that Elisa and two of her sisters were young adults trying to find their place in the world only made things more difficult for them. Elisa was willing to following her emotions even when she knew it may not be the safe choice. I could really feel all of her struggle as she tries to figure out what to do.Marisol was very close to her grandmother and is eager to see the Cuba she has heard so much about. I liked Marisol right away. I liked how she took her responsibility to carry out her grandmother's wishes so seriously and wanted to learn more about her life in Cuba. I thought that all of the secondary characters were very well done in the story as well.I think that the setting of this book really helped it stand out. I have read very little of Cuba and am a bit ashamed by how little I really know of the country. I felt like Cuba came alive in the pages of this book. The setting really almost became a character in the book. The descriptions were so vivid that I really felt that I could close my eyes and see the things that the characters saw.The mystery of the story really kept my interest. I wanted to know what had happened to Elisa all those years ago and was eager to learn what Marisol would find. I was equally interested in seeing how the events in the book would impact Marisol's life. There were a few twists along the way and enough excitement to keep the pages turning.I would highly recommend this book to others. I thought that this book told a remarkable story that will stay with me for a long time. This was the first book by Chanel Cleeton that I have had the chance to read and I look forward to reading more of her work in the future.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Berkley Publishing Group via NetGalley.Initial ThoughtsThis really was a wonderful book. This is a story about family, hertiage, and love. It is told in two different time periods through the lives of Marisol and her grandmother, Elisa. I loved the way that this book brought Cuba to life along with the characters. The writing was just as beautiful as the cover of this delightful novel."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Anze", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze", "userReview": "Elisa Perez and her sisters enjoyed a privileged life in Cuba. Their father was in the sugar business which afforded them more liberties than most Cuban citizens. As the revolution against Batista (who at least outwardly, was supported by Elisa's father) grew, the political climate changed drastically. For the Perez clan that meant more than losing their comfortable life, it could cost them their life. In a act of self preservation, the Perez family left Cuba. About 60 years later, Marisol Ferrera (Elisa's granddaughter) is tasked with bringing her grandmother's ashes to Cuba, the place where she always longed to go back to. Marisol, having been extremely close with her grandmother, agrees and makes what will become a life changing trip.There are books that are beautifully written and convey a sensation of actually having been right next to the protagonists as the narrative unfolded. 'Next Year in Havana' is one of those books. With a rich description of Cuba's landscape and a heartbreaking telling of the political history, this is easily one of the best books I have read thus far this year. Marisol is a Cuban-American freelance journalist. Her upbringing (in Miami) was chock full of stories of the her family in Cuba. Elisa was always telling Marisol how she missed Cuba despite all the turmoil. While many relatives try to deter Marisol from going to Cuba, her allegiance to her grandmother compels her to go. Restrictions for travel may have lessened but trouble is still lurking so Marisol must be careful. Upon arrival Marisol is dazzled by the beauty of the scenery and culture. It is almost idyllic but the more somber and restrictive side of Cuba soon begins to show. As Marisol looks for the best place to spread her grandmother's ashes, she becomes acquainted with Luis and his family, the people with whom she is staying. As the narrative progresses, Marisol learns secrets her grandmother hid all her life and I love the parallels drawn between Elisa and Marisol. At turns profound and others chilling, this was an all around excellent read. Cuba is a country of contrasts. On one hand, its romantic and beautiful. On the other, its riddled with an ongoing struggle and pain. Cleeton blended the historical aspect with that of Marisol & Elisa masterfully (Cleeton drew inspiration from her personal family history). This book is a love story in more ways than one. The whole narrative is a love letter to Cuba. How their people love their island despite all the pain is has (and continues to) endure. That, for me, is the strongest aspect of the novel. Without a doubt, this book is going to stick with me for a while. Resonant, impactful, beautiful and touching, this is one book I would recommend to everyone."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18237582-zoe", "userReview": "Atmospheric, absorbing, and incredibly heartfelt!Next Year in Havana is a riveting tale that sweeps you into a country ravished by rebellion, oppression, economic instability, and political upheaval, and a populace that's confused, disappointed, angry and struggling with self-identity, patriotism, and a lack of freedom and rights.The story is set in Cuba during both the late 1950s, as well as present day and is full of mystique, familial drama, heartbreak, secrets, deception, history, culture, courage, loss, self-discovery, hope, and romance.The prose is eloquent and vivid.

It's the sound of firing squads that echo in the wind.As a fan of Cleeton's light, yet angsty, funny and sexy air force series, I was looking forward to -- and greatly curious as to -- how she would tackle a heavier more historical family saga which was nothing like what she had offered us before. NEXT YEAR IN HAVANA was so much more than I thought it would be and nothing like I expected. To be in exile is to have the things you love most in the world -- the air you breathe, the earth you walk upon -- taken from you.First of all, I have to bring attention to the best part : the author's writing. Cleeton's narrative is romantic, stark, hopeful, and devastating. Her prose is stunning and jawdropping, lyrical and brutal, and I was honestly blown away by some of the passages I encountered. Some needed to be read more than once and I was still left in awe. It's impossible to stand near the flame consuming everything around you and not have some of that fire catch the hem of your skirt, too.The history is the main focus of this story. The politics, the social climate of Cuba, the struggles and losses, the revolutions, the dreams of a better future even after countless broken promises.. it is so very real. This is the heart of Cleeton's novel. This is the novel. There is romance woven through, two different ones, separated by sixty years, and yet the love story feels stronger between the Cuban people and their country than it did the characters; at least in the case of the contemporary couple.\"I wish there wasn't such a sharp divide between those who have everything and those who simply yearn for a chance at more.\"I definitely felt more of a connection with Elisa's storyline -- one of four daughters of a wealthy and respected sugar baron -- in the '50s than I did with Marisol, Elisa's granddaughter who is journeying back to Cuba to scatter Elisa's ashes, in 2017. While there was hardly a moment that wasn't tied up in politics and history, I felt it overshadowed the present day story and timeline and made the romance between Marisol and Luis during their whirlwind adventures together even less believable. I understand the need for the history lesson, the politics, but it started to feel a little less like discussion and more like a textbook. But every moment with Elisa, her sisters, the whole dynamic, really moved me. Not to mention how her story ends.. It is a remarkably painful thing to have someone you care about and admire judge your existence, your very identity, the world you inhabit, and deem it rotten to the core.There were a few little throwaways near the end of the book that make me curious about a possible sequel/companion. It's probably way too early to be wondering about that as this book isn't even out yet, but I would be all over that. Beatriz was one of my favourite characters and I would absolutely love to hear her side of things and experience all the adventures she's surely had. Can you have a relationship where you exist in half measures, or does the very nature of love demand you throw yourself into it with gusto?I think a lot of fans of Cleeton's prior books will be really impressed with what she's offered here. And while I might have preferred more time spent on a more solid foundation for the romance and a teensy bit less rehashing of political debates, you can absolutely feel the love woven into the soul of this tale.3.75 \"why do people always seize on the spark that can peter out as the measure of a relationship\" stars** I received an ARC from NetGalley and the publisher (thank you!) in exchange for an honest review. **"}, {"userName": "Cora \u2615 Tea Party Princess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166936-cora-tea-party-princess", "userReview": "5 Words: Family, love, friendship, loyalty, memories.I am going to try to keep this spoiler free, so it will be brief.

Very much alike in character, it\u2019s a wonder to see the parallels in journeys their lives take. NEXT YEAR IN HAVANA is a triumph and testament to Chanel Cleeton\u2019s outstanding abilities as a writer. So beautifully written the novel is steeped in the history and vibrancy of Cuba. Much like an artist Cleeton paints a glorious picture which is enriched by her style and imagery. The heaviness of politics is balanced by the delicate relationships between family, and the hope that blooms with tentativeness of romantic ones.

With a setting like modern Cuba and the Cuba of the late fifties, I was well aware this would be a bittersweet story to savor.Next Year in Havana tells the tale of Elisa Perez in the waning years of 1950's Cuba and of her granddaughter, Marisol Ferrara in the present day. Their stories are told in first person point of view as the book flips back and forth between them. Elisa's story pulled me in more deeply, I admit. I think it was the danger of living daily with a revolution coming closer and closer and Elisa's family being on the wrong side of the wave's swell. During this time, she falls in love and with someone she should not. Pablo is a revolutionary and holds with ideology that she does not share and she definitely doesn't hold with the extreme ways the revolutionaries are willing to get what they want. And yet, they are in love in the stormy last days of Batista's corrupt government, the strengthening angry sounds and voices of revolution, and talk of her family fleeing to America. And, paralleling Elisa's story is Marisol seeing the result of Castro's revolution, the deprivations and fear most Cubans live with even after Castro's death, and her own first real encounter with love while she is following the trail of her grandmother's past. Marisol's story is gentler and more introspective. I liked it, but was not exactly riveted until after the half-way point when the twists happened and things got a whole lot more exciting for her.The historical and cultural setting along with the way the characters fit in these settings seemed quite authentic to me. It was my first real encounter with a book centered in Cuba and about Cubans and Cuban Americans. I felt it was balanced in how it looks on the present and the past by offering up more than one outlook which is my favorite way to experience historical fiction. It is a complex situation and not to be treated in stark black and white just as the characters were thinking and take actions that were not simple.There is romance- glorious, painful circumspect romance for both women. Both were a first encounter attraction. Elisa's was a gradual build to love after several fleeting encounters. Marisol fell hard and fast. I bought it because I think their family connections, her reason for the visit and similar interests made the quick transition to love easier to believe. I also think it all worked because in my mind, Marisol's romance with Luis was the second chance that her grandmother and Pablo never got.Though this was a bittersweet romantic story, I feel that the reader should think of it more along the lines of historical and modern women's fiction. It's the story of Cuba told from the lives of the cast of characters. It is introspective and thoughtful with a few moments of suspense. Its about discovery and growth. I felt this book's impact from page one. I was touched emotionally, but also it appealed to my mind. It's a book that will challenge its readers, but also deliver a beautiful story. I think historical fiction fans and those who enjoy reading about other people and cultures and times with a good dose of romance are the best matches.My thanks to Penguin-Random House for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Janelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20742472-janelle", "userReview": "NEXT YEAR IN HAVANA by Chanel Cleeton - Thank you so much to Berkley Publishing for providing my free copy - all opinions are my own.There are many reasons why I love this book but one very important one is Cuba. I have a dream to travel to many countries and I love when authors take you to a place you\u2019ve never been. Cleeton's vivid descriptions of the scenery and culture of Cuba are breathtaking. Also, I should mention the intense connection Cleeton has to Cuba as her own grandparents fled after Castro\u2019s revolution. Her background and historical knowledge are very apparent in the book and make you appreciate the story even more.This is a love story from Marisol to her grandmother, Elisa, and the discovery of the fascinating life she lived. Elisa left Cuba in 1959 with her family when she was nineteen. The story starts off with Marisol fulfilling her grandmother\u2019s wish to spread her ashes in Cuba after she passes away. The chapters alternate between Elisa in 1959 and Marisol in 2017. It is very interesting to learn about Elisa\u2019s life from both perspectives, and from different times. The writing is beautiful and flows at a pace that made me forget what was going on around me.At the brink of the revolution, Elisa meets and falls in love with a revolutionary and has to keep her relationship a secret. Chapter by chapter, details of Elisa\u2019s life unfold, not only from her perspective but from Marisol\u2019s eyes as well. I enjoyed both perspectives equally as they each offer something unique and I especially cherished seeing Cuba through Marisol as she puts together the pieces of her grandmother\u2019s past.This story is captivating, interesting, mysterious, romantic, and the imagery is just beautiful!

Their lives so different but so similar when they meet the love of their life. I can't get over how the author was able to bring both their stories to life in the way that she did. The struggles in Cuba that just seems so helpless in both times. The type of men they both fell in love with and their struggle with doing right by their country over personal wants. This book was more than a romance book. It was also a history lesson, a cultural lesson through the eyes of two very strong women and their men. Don't judge me but I'm not a fan of politics or history so the fact that the author had me mesmerized is no small feat. This book did not end on a cliffhanger but I also felt it wasn't over.

The story is a good one and very pertinent to our times since the US relationship with Cuba is still slowly changing under the new regime. As the book will tell us, however, the average Cuban lives in less than adequate housing with little money and/or access to enough food, clothing and the necessities of life. Those who rebel against the government are still in danger of imprisonment and even death.The novel is told from two points of view and takes place in the past and present. Ms. Cleeton\u2019s writing flows beautifully and I had no problem with the dual timeline.The first point of view is from Elisa who was one of four daughters and one brother in the Perez family whose money was gained through the sugar industry. The Perez family was one of the most prestigious families in Havana for many decades. They lived in a mansion filled with every luxury and the family enjoyed travel, parties, beautiful art and a life filled with parties, shopping and everything that wealth could buy in Cuba. During this period before 1950 there were many American and European families who were the elite society owning plantations, hotels, etc. who lived a life in the paradise that was Cuba while the average Cuban lived in poverty. There is romance in the book as well between Elisa and one of the rebels. However during the late 1950\u2019s the revolutionaries, let by Fidel Castro, were gaining more and more support to overthrow the government let by Batista. After Castro took power, many of the wealthy landowners were imprisoned and their land confiscated. Hundreds of rebels were executed. In 1967 the Perez family finally fled Cuba and settled in Miami.The second time line, in the present, is told through the thoughts and actions of Marisol who is Elisa\u2019s granddaughter. Elisa has recently passed away and her last request was that her ashes be spread in Cuba and they be carried there by Marisol, the granddaughter whom she was the closest to. When Marisol arrives in Cuba she finds that there is still a great divide between those that have money and influence and the poor. Castro promised democracy and freedom for all but in reality he governed with a fierce and bloody hand. The average Cuban was no better off in Castro\u2019s Cuba.While staying with a dear friend of her grandmother she discovers a secret life that her grandmother never shared with her. She finds a treasure of letters and after reading them decides to try to uncover the mystery that was Elisa\u2019s secret life. While there she meets Luis who writes a blog that uncovers Cuba as it really is. He is in a precarious situation but Elisa is determined to love him and get him out of Cuba.I won\u2019t disclose any more of the plot, that is for you to uncover and enjoy. The descriptions of the island, it\u2019s beautiful flora and fauna and the ocean surrounding it are very well written and I felt I could see the island in my mind\u2019s eye.The author is of Cuban heritage and she learned much about Cuba from her own family history. I think that anyone who loves historical fiction would enjoy this book. I came away with the feeling that we are so very lucky to live in the US and we take for granted our ability to speak out about the government without fear of imprisonment of worse. This would be a good book club book as it contains discussion questions and a reader\u2019s guide at the end of the book.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Lia Riley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23780338-lia-riley", "userReview": "My heart!
