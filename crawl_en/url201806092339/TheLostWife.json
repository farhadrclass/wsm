And yet... paradoxically, I loved this novel and it is, essentially, a love story, a story of first love, lost love, remembered love. This novel does not abound with all the hearts and flowers of the aforementioned publishers. And, it has quietly, stealthily crept up on me in the last five hours since I finished it, wending its way into my collective bookish affections.The story contains an impossible choice: faced with the encroaching threat of the Nazis, who would you choice \u2013 your family or your husband of one day? Two Czechoslovakian Jews, Lenka and Josef face this monumental situation and Lenka's decision is the basis of this novel. Her decision is forced by time, the die is cast, Lenka will stay with her family while her husband Josef will flee with his family to America. Germany invades Czechoslovakia as expected, the Czech government capitulates and Lenka and her family are sent to the work camp Terezin. Alyson Richman leads you through Josef's life in America with the sombre burden of what he has left behind and Lenka's harsh reality with her internment at Terezin. This novel is quite light in description but rich in dialogue and it is rendered beautifully with emotional scenery. With a deft hand, the author uses the riches of the palette to furnish images. I never underline passages in a book but here I sincerely wish I had so that I give some examples. Quite oddly, I found the rendition of Josef's life more emotive than Lenka's story tethered as he was in America and bound to lead a life he had little interest in. It was the beauty of his richly textured remembrances which moved me. The Lost Wife is a novel that I am very glad to have read. I suggest that you read it. Highly recommended 4.5\u2605"}, {"userName": "Fergie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2824860-fergie", "userReview": "One of the most beautifully written, moving historical fiction novels I have ever read. The book actually deserves 4 1/2 stars. Alyson Richman evokes magic in her telling of the love story of Lenka and Josef, two Czechoslovakian Jews whose fate is determined by forces beyond their control.  Richman effectively pulls the reader in by creating interesting characters and an equally compelling story. It is hard to fathom what the Jewish population in Europe had to endure during the reign of terror under the Third Reich, but Richman does a more than admirable job. Her research is flawless and serves as a true testament to what those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis endured. The spirit and courage that the Jews possessed is documented well in this book.  For anyone who loves historical fiction, especially set in the era of WWII, this book is for you. The added bonus is that the story is written beautifully and with such a depth of compassion that you will find yourself forever changed after having read it. If that is not the true mark of outstanding writing, then I don't know what is."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "If you don't cry when you read this book, I guess I feel sorry for you. From the stunning prologue to the very last page, this is a remarkable read.The first few pages of the prologue reveal that a man and a woman, married and then separated for 60 years by the Nazi invasion of Prague, and both thinking the other dead, meet at the wedding reception of the grandson of one and the granddaughter of the other. Now you might think that revealing this much in the very beginning of the book would reduce the emotional content of what follows. Not in the least. Knowing they will eventually meet makes each aspect of their separate stories even more poignant. At least to a romantic like me."}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "What an emotional book!

It was more than a love story, it was a love affair of words that show the beauty of our souls. With the verse \"I am my beloved and my beloved is mine. Song of Solomon 6:3, it is the main theme of this poetic love story. The verse also signifies the hope one can have having one as a beloved and being one of a beloved. The story is a loose historical fiction of actual events which makes it even more enjoyable to read. It starts in the year 2000 when the great grandfather of the groom and the great grand mother of the bride come upon each other and how it is that they know each other. Then the story goes back in time before the war in Prague. The main character of Joseph is a beloved that has found his beloved in Lenka. He is shown to have respect for the women in his life, his mother and sister and how he loves life. Lenka who has a younger sister; and who is loyal to her family. The loyality is tested when she stays in Prague right after her and Joseph are married. Joseph's family has obtained boat tickets to leave the country with his parents and his sister, however, Lenka will not leave without her family. You see the contrast of each one's story in the narration. The narration is told by each one and the longing for the other. The narration is seamless as you see the heartache of of Joseph and Lenka. It tears at your heart, however, it is good to see a love story so pure. I appreciate a love story without vulgarity because it gives a high view of a love relationship and everything else is gravy. And you get plenty of gravy.The story shows the plight of the Jews and it also touches on the loyality that Lenka's family remain together and not be separated in the concentration camps. Where so many of other families did not stay together. They were seperated by one being sent to another camp, or by death or worse turning on each other. Evil has a way of doing that. It also shows what is evil and when we loose hope which we are created to hope and how hope is the only way we can continue. Hope is the fuel for the soul. I cannot do the justice of the characters or the story of how two people in love continue thru so much heart ache. One thing I also appreciated in this story is the Jewish tradition and what soulful people they are. To be reminded what it means when God given rights are taken away from a certain group of people that they cannot live, cannot work and to live in fear. I am my beloved and my beloved is mine...to see that in the grandchildren of Lenka and Joseph gives hope."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "The Lost Wife by Alyson Richman.In Pre War Prague the hopes and dreams of two young lovers are shattered when they are separated by the Nazi Invasion.I listened to this novel as opposed to reading it and I really enjoyed the narrators as they were both eloquent and easy to listen to. This is s a story that explores the horrors of the beautiful city of Prague under the occupation of the Nazi's during World War Two. Having visited both Terezin and Prague many years ago I was very interested in reading this book and I was not disappointed with the images captured by Alyson Richman and her storytelling.I was amazed to learn that the story was inspired by true events similar to that of Lenka and Josef and the novels conclusion the author explains what events are true within the story and I found this really helpful.I did not find the Novel heavy or difficult reading in comparison to other Holocaust books that I have read.

I'm starting out with three, let's see where we end up, shall we?For as many things as I liked about this book, there are several things I disliked. I'll start with the negative. First, I didn't like the way the romance tried to blend in with the story. There were times when it felt like it shouldn't be there, and yet, I found myself only wanting to finish to see if Lenka and Josef ever found each other again. The beginning of the book revealed the answer, but I had hoped the ending would hold more. Sadly, it did not. Richman admitted that the story was originally going to just be about an artist who survived the Holocaust, but that she decided to weave the romance in. This shows as it was obvious she spent far more time on Lenka and her storyline than she did on Josef and his. An author shouldn't show preference for one character or storyline over another when the author has herself chosen to portray both. Either put your all into both storylines or leave one out. Don't try and pacify us with romance for the sake of sales. Richman's callous treatment of Josef made him seem like an afterthought, and that was unpalatable to me as he was probably my favorite character. Second, Lenka irritated the shit out of me, and her \"noble\" actions were, in my opinion, incorrectly portrayed. She has the choice to go with Josef and his family, to leave Prague and reach safety before the occupation reaches its fervor, but she insists on staying behind with her family, claiming she won't leave them because she loves them too much. I call bullshit. I don't deny that there are people who make rash decisions like this and wholeheartedly believe they're doing the right thing, but Lenka's refusal to leave with Josef was a decision based not in love or loyalty, but in fear. She was afraid to leave her family and her home. Had she possessed even a tenth of the courage we're supposed to believe she did, she would have gotten on that ship, set out for parts unknown, then fought like a bulldog to get her family out of Prague. As it was, she denied her parents some peace of mind, separated herself from her husband (causing him a lifetime of guilt), and abandoned any hope of getting her family out of Prague. Those are not the actions of a heroine, but of a selfish coward. Third, I thought this book was, at times, a bit heavy handed. Obviously, a book about surviving the Holocaust is going to be emotionally jarring, and I'm not ashamed to say it made me cry on more than one occasion. But there were points when it felt like it was trying too hard to be poignant. Still, the writing was beautifully lyrical, and this brings me to what I did like about the book.\n\"You hear in the person you're destined to love the sound of those yet to be born.\"\"Every person has an image or a memory that they hold secret. One that they unwrap, like a piece of hidden candy, at night. Pass through there and you will fall into the valley of dreams.\"\"One finds love in transparency. To see wholly and without question.\"\"There are two sensations of skin you will always remember in your lifetime: the first time you fall in love - and that person holds your hand - and the first time your child grasps your finger. In each of those times, you are sealed to the other for eternity.\"\"In my old age, I have come to believe that love is not a noun but a verb. An action. Like water, it flows to its own current, If you were to corner it in a dam, true love is so bountiful it would flow over. Even in separation, in death, it moves and changes. It lives within memory, in the haunting of a touch, the transience of a smell, or the nuance of a sigh. It seeks to leave a trace like a fossil in the sand, a leaf burned into baking asphalt.\"\"Inhale it. Breathe it. It will not leave you. If you place sunlight in your palms, it will turn to shadow. If you put fireflies in a jar, they will die. But if you love with wings on, you will always feel the exhilaration of being suspended in flight.\"\nStrangely, all but one of those is from Josef's perspective. I truly loved Josef as a character. I wish he could have been done more justice."}, {"userName": "Noeleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333773-noeleen", "userReview": "Rating 3.5 The Lost Wife by Alyson Richman appears to be on everyone\u2019s reading list at the moment and is receiving some great reviews, so I had to bump it up my \u2018to be read\u2019 list to see what all the \u2018hype\u2019 is about. It tells the story of Lenka and Josef who meet on the threshold of the start of WWII. It is a sad story of true love lost during a most awful time in history. The story alternates between Lenka\u2019s account of her time in the concentration camps and Josef\u2019s time in America. The structure of the narration works really well and whilst Lenka\u2019s story is most horrifying, I found myself more interested in those parts of the book when the story was being told from Josef\u2019s perspective.There are many themes explored throughout the book, lost love, separation, family love, family loyalty, survival not only during the terrible times of WWII but the survival of people in the marriages of both Lenka and Josef after the war. Art and colour also play a significant role throughout. I wasn\u2019t aware of the underground artist movement during the war, so it\u2019s great when a novel educates us on subjects we didn\u2019t know about before. I also liked the fact that some of the artist characters in the book were actual real characters, so this book was very well researched too.Overall, 3.5 stars is probably a more accurate rating of my enjoyment of this book. The story for me was very good and while I really did like the book, I didn\u2019t love it and it isn\u2019t a story that would stay with me. I wasn\u2019t eagerly waiting to find out what happens next. The real winner for me with this book was the writing. I think the writing was so good that it may have overshadowed the story somewhat.

I think this is the first Holocaust book I've read where I haven't cried, and I should have, especially reading the author's notes whereby she based a lot of the characters and storyline on actual events. Don't get me wrong, I did feel affected by it, but on reflection, it was actually my prior knowledge of the Holocaust and memories of other stories I've read and/or watched which stirred the emotions rather than this specific book. This book is essentially a love story, and a poor one at that, particularly considering it turned out to be such an anticlimax in the end. I wish there was less cheesy romance in the first half of the book (well actually Josef's entire storyline) and was written exclusively from Lenka's point of view. There was not enough dialogue, there were too many grammatical errors (one paragraph was written in past tense and the next in present tense) and the parallel storylines just didn't work, especially when they were set 50 or so years apart.

The basis of the book is, of course, a romance story, but the heart of the book takes place in Terezin where the Nazi's established a prison camp that was less of a death camp and more of an authentic work camp. Certainly the conditions were every bit as grueling and no less horrifying as Auschwitz and Birkenwald, but there were no ovens and while there prisoners produced an amazing amount of art work, much of which is now on display in various Holocaust memorials throughout the world.The book is a novel, but several real life people are mentioned, as well as the art work the children of Terezin produced which was made into an exceptionally beautiful book, I Never Saw Another Butterfly.

It was slightly different as those facts are right up front in the beginning of the novel, painting the scene for us of the previous story.

The main characters, Lenka, an aspiring art student, and her husband Josef, are fictional, but the events that are the backdrop of their story are true. We are introduced to the two former lovers at the rehearsal dinner of the grandchildren; Josef and Lenka had been separated due to the cruel twist of fate due to the events of the war, and each had presumed that the other had been killed. As the realization sets in that fate has mysteriously brought together what world events had broken apart, they, and we, are taken back in time to the world of prewar Czechoslovakia. The main characters describe in riveting and descriptive detail the challenges and hardships of the war in Europe, and how they are each forced into new relationships and families while mourning what was left behind. This is one of the better Holocaust novels that I have read, and I learned more about the Terezin camp, which at first was treated more as a work camp, and later was a mere stepping stone to the greater horrors of the concentration camps such as Auschwitz. Most interesting was the fact that there was an organized resistance of artists and musicians who utilized their talents to express their hatred of their wardens. Some paintings and drawings were smuggled to the outside world, and although many of the artists paid with their lives once they were discovered, their sacrifice was one of the lesser known of the war. Additionally, musicians and singers were sacrificed after regaling the inmates with music and song; the Nazis would stop at nothing to crush the spirit of the prisoners.

I skimmed the blurb at that time and added it to my list based on the time frame alone. World War II is sort of my thing after all. It wasn't until I noticed the book at the library that I actually absorbed the basic premise of the story and to be honest, my first thought was 'uh-oh.' I knew the minute I picked it up that it would be coming home with me, I couldn't say no, but I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the book as much as I have other war related fiction. The Holocaust is an important chapter of the war but it is far from my favorite sub topic. I was nervous. Two days later I finished the last page and came up for air. Alyson Richman's writing is nothing short of breathtaking. I've encountered plenty of authors with a gift for storytelling but only a handful have ever struck me as truly gifted in their ability to manipulate the written word. The Lost Wife is easily one of the most beautifully composed pieces I've ever picked up. As to the plot, Lenka and Josef experience great sadness in the course of their lives, each struggling with their own personal demons. Despite the somber tone of the book I really enjoyed the story Richman crafted for her characters from their first meeting in Prague to their reunion decades later in the United States. Personally I would have liked to see more of Josef's life during the war, more of Lenka's after it, maybe a scene or two after their reunion - I felt a little cheated there, but for the most part I was very satisfied with the piece. I even found aspects of the concentration camp interesting as I had never before studied life at Terezin. Richman didn't change my mind on Holocaust lit but she did craft an exquisite story of strength, love, faith and hope. On a side note I find it amusing that several of the reviews express surprise and/or disgust that the end of the story is given away in the opening pages of the book. It is true that we first meet our leading characters in their old age, but, quite frankly, that is disclosed in the blurb. I wonder if these individuals bothered to read the back cover or if they merely opened the title without much thought to the premise. Perhaps it is just me, but I don't think it is particularly fair to denounce a title for something so clearly stated in the description. This isn't a book about where a couple ended up, it is about how they get there. Go out, find a copy, and experience it for yourself.

Well written, but after many recollections about the strength of their love for each other, she barely recognizes him and we get no insight after the realization."}, {"userName": "Carla Geraldes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21693847-carla-geraldes", "userReview": "Mais uma vis\u00e3o sobre a II GG.

I had chills down my spine reading the ending, the characters were memorable, the story was unforgettable and the consistency was impeccable. If I can give this book 10 stars, It will deserve every star. Not only one of my favorites romances but one of the best books I ever read.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}, {"userName": "Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3615945-anne-booklady-molinarolo", "userReview": "Alyson Richman says in her Note that she wanted to tell the story of an artist surviving the Holocaust. Then she heard of a story in which an old couple that had married before WWII who lost each other, then again found the other one at their grand childrens' wedding. Thus began the stories of Lenka and Josef. The writing is exquisite, poetic at times. I smiled as they got married, angry when Lenka stayed in Czechoslovakia, and cried in different parts of both their stories. The ending was so beautiful - I was sobbing with joy. Not many of us get a second chance. Will Josef and Lenka take it? Read to find out.Just imagine you are at your grand daughter's reception. Your sleeve has risen a little, exposing a blue numbered tattoo. But the old man isn't seeing the blue ink, he's seeing your birthmark. He speaks softly, \"Lenka, you don't recognize your husband?\" Slowly you fill in the grey hair with black and soften the lines in his face, and you think back 60 years. This is how Lenka and Josef's story begins.It's so hard to describe the novel without giving much of the story away. So, I tease you with some of my favorite passages.JosefI am in love with a shadow. I look for her in the darkness of the hallway. I search for her in the eyes of the old women crossing the street...[Lenka] still haunts me like a lioness, a cat with piercing eyes. Over sixty years have past and her shadow still walks beside me. Her shadow stretching long and black - waiting for me to reach for her - waiting for me to extend my hand.\"LenkaBut in order to survive in this foreign world, I had to teach myself that love is very much like a painting. The negative space between people was just as important as the positive space we occupy. The air between our resting bodies, and the breath in between our conversations, were all like the white of the canvas, and the rest of our relationship - the laughter and the memories - were the brushstrokes applied over time"}, {"userName": "Hermien", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5930747-hermien", "userReview": "I have read many books dealing with the Holocaust, but found this one really disappointing. Josef and Lenka tell their story in the first person but it feels like it was written by a high school student using language and expressing feelings that people of Jozef and Lenka's age and era would never have used. There is no depth in the characters and even Lenka's description of life in Theresienstadt is rather bland. The interesting historical part of how the artists managed to let the outside world know what was really going on is mentioned but remains a mystery as Lenka does not get involved in it. My impression was that the publishers and/or the writer thought \"Let's do a book about a tragic love story set against the Holocaust, that'll sell!\"."}], "description": "Praga, 1938.
