In this story, she\u2019s really looking forward to spending the first weekend in four months with military police officer, Adam Barrett in the town where she first trained to be a PI. She\u2019s anticipating a relaxing reunion, but that all changes when she spots someone from one of her first cases. She later recognises him as the person who had been carrying a dirty bomb which explodes on the riverboat restaurant and casino on which they are cruising, killing many and so starts another action packed investigation. Adam is back on duty as part of the investigation team, leaving Jamie alone. Reconnecting with her old mentor, Ray and his wife, and Jamie\u2019s best friend, Corrine just add to the drama as these two become targets, too. When Special Agent Marc Sandoval of the Drug Enforcement Agency turns up after seeing Jamie on the news her love life is going to get complicated!So, prepare yourself for a brilliant read, with that dirty bomb, lingerie shops, military men galore, double dealers, friends who\u2019d like to be more, secrets and so many twists and turns - followed by an ending that I just didn\u2019t see coming!! There are plenty of detours, reroutes, dead ends and wrong turns along the way with danger around at every point. Just who is behind the dirty bomb? Who was the real target - and why? Hope do Ray and Corrine fit into all of this? Is Ray\u2019s new partner behind it all - just what is his role?This is a real page turner and a great addition to the series. This is one of those series where I don\u2019t think you need to have read the other books first as I believe this will work well as a standalone. Having said that, the whole series is brilliant so I have no hesitation in highly recommending this one and all the others to anyone who enjoys a fast paced, action packed mystery with well developed characters and an intricately devised plot. I can\u2019t wait to read more from this highly talented author!Many thanks to the publishers and NetGalley for gifting me an ARC of this novel with no obligation.

So when I was offered a chance to read an advance copy of this one (the fourth in a series featuring security specialist and private investigator Jamie Sinclair) in exchange for an honest review, I hesitated - but only for a moment. Simply put, the description just sounded too intriguing to pass it up.And happy to say, I made a good decision. I still stand by my general advice that it's better to get in on any series from the start, but I certainly didn't feel left out with this one, which stands on its own just fine. Jamie is an interesting character in and of herself; the daughter of a former military bigwig turned powerful state senator, she's got an ex-husband and in this book, two hunky guys falling all over her (reminiscent of Stephanie Plum, the Janet Evanovich character who, even after all these years, is torn between two lovers, as the old song goes). Truth is, that waffling back and forth - particularly since it's coming from an otherwise strong, extremely independent woman - never fails to get on my nerves in that series, and it does here as well. But a fast-moving plot loaded with knock-down, drag-out action made up for it by grabbing and holding my attention throughout.At the beginning, Jamie seems to have settled on one of the hunks - military police officer Adam Barrett. He's stationed in Beauville, Mississippi, where Ray Walther, who took a chance by hiring Jamie at his PI firm years ago, is located. Now, she's got her own investigative firm near Washington, D.C., but she's flying down to the coast in hopes of hooking up with Adam as well as seeing her mentor (and her close friend, Ray's pregnant wife, Corinne) again.To say things don't go as planned would be an understatement. At the git-go, as Jamie and Adam try to get away from a mandatory military party on a riverboat, a dirty bomb explodes. Because they had fled the boring party and headed for privacy on another deck, they escaped the brunt of the blast in which several were killed. But then, Jamie catches a glimpse of the bomber and recognizes him. Her desire to get to the bottom of things - and Adam's military responsibilities to that same end - put an instant kabosh on romance and set the pair on an investigation fraught with danger.Enter Marc - the other hunka-hunka who also is part of the investigation, and the romantic tension begins to build. As for the case, the more Jamie learns, the more she suspects some kind of connection between the bomb and her former mentor, his new partner and even his wife. Are their lives in danger? Or could any or all of them (gasp!) be involved in a more sinister way? The chase is on complete with wrong turns and dead ends, and Jamie, Adam and Marc find themselves fighting not only for the lives of her friends, but their own as well.Conclusion? Very enjoyable, and I've already put the next installment of this series on my to-watch-for list."}, {"userName": "Debbie Oxier", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21813445-debbie-oxier", "userReview": "Another winner from this author!I really enjoy the Jamie Sinclair stories. She's gritty, she's tough, and the word \"quit\" isn't in her vocabulary. When she gets a hold of a case she sinks her teeth into it like a dog with a bone. In this story, Jamie heads south for a weekend getaway with her military boyfriend Barrett. However, before they get the chance to spend time together, she's embroiled in a case. And it appears her mentor, Ray, the man who'd taught her everything she knows about being an investigator, is involved as well. Since Jamie last saw Ray he's taken on a partner, Bran, and his wife, Jamie's best friend, Corinne, is about to give birth to the couple's first child. Then, to complicate things for Jamie, federal agent, Marc Sandoval, shows up. He'd seen her on the news, learned she'd been on board the riverboat that blew up, the target of apparent domestic terrorists. He offered her his services. And that's not all. He has strong feelings for her. They'd previously worked a case together and in spite of Jamie's relationship with Barrett, Marc makes no secret of the fact he's out to get Jamie to dump Barrett and take up with him instead. This book was non-stop action from start to finish with plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested. I didn't want to put it down. I liked both Barrett and Marc and the fact they're at odds over Jamie adds another facet to the story. While she cared for both of them she wasn't ready to settle down, wasn't sure marriage and family was in the cards for her. This was especially hard for Barrett to hear since he's on the verge of proposing. Although this book can be read as a standalone, I would recommend you read the other books in the series first in order to get a good feel for where the characters are coming from. A big thumbs up for me."}, {"userName": "Sarah Joint", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19758811-sarah-joint", "userReview": "I didn't realize this was part of a series when I requested it, so this is my first Jamie Sinclair book. I think I would have benefited from starting at the beginning but I could still follow along fairly well. PI Jamie Sinclair is supposed to be on a romantic getaway. She's come to her old town in Mississippi to see her boyfriend for the first time in months. He's stationed there, and they plan to make the most of the brief time he has off. But first, they must attend the \"mandatory fun\" that is Dining Out. It seems to be an enjoyable evening at first... They'd rather be alone, of course, but the riverboat they're on is beautiful and they're surrounded by friends. That all changes in a blur. A bomb goes off, killing and injuring soldiers. Jamie and Barrett are okay, but shaken and determined to find the culprit. Having recognized a figure from her past as the owner of the bag with the bomb, Jamie sets off to find justice... by whatever means necessary. The story features many characters that I'm sure we're introduced in earlier books. While I didn't know their whole history, I could still get a feel of them. This is an action packed suspense with a bit of romance. I liked the unpredictability of the plot and enjoyed a lot of the characters. I could do with less of the love triangle, but I know a lot of people enjoy that and it probably features in the other books. I received an ARC of this book from Net Galley and Random House Publishing Group - Alibi, thank you!

The action in this one gets more intense the further you go. I was exhausted by the end. Jamie Sinclair is one of those female characters that I love. She can be gentle and caring with those she loves without sacrificing the toughness she needs for her job as a private detective turned security consultant. She needs all of her skills for this one. A nuclear bomb has exploded on a riverboat casino in Mississippi with Jamie, her boyfriend Adam Barrett, and much of Barrett\u2019s military unit on board. When Jamie realizes that someone from her past placed the bomb, she knows she can\u2019t rest till he is found. The riddle of this mystery involves Jamie\u2019s former boss and mentor Ray whose wife is pregnant, and also Jamie\u2019s best friend.This is book 4 in the Jamie Sinclair series but I didn\u2019t feel like I was missing anything. \u201cThe Kill Sign\u201d works very well as a stand-alone. That being said I enjoyed it so much that I think I will have to go back and read the first three. I felt an instant connection with Jamie and was as comfortable with her as I would be with an old friend, even though we just met.

The story has all the local color and intrigue a reader could wish, coupled with suspense and action. Aspiring writers should study this book as an example of how to get it right: a perfect level of detail, a growing sense of foreboding, an occasional red herring, and on-going action to keep the pages turning and the heart pounding.

I was under no obligation to review this book and my opinion is freely given.Jamie Sinclair has not looked forward to a weekend away more, especially considering the nostalgia of going home to where she got her start as a private investigator. Jamie hopes for perfect reunions with Adam Barrett, as well as her old mentor, Ray Walther, and his pregnant wife, Corinne, are soon dashed when a violent attack on a riverboat packed with military personnel brings the full force of the government to the area. As the investigation ramps up, questions from the past may have an important part to play. Will Jamie be able to help solve the case or will her involvement bring more issues to the surface?The biggest problem that I had with The Kill Sign was the love triangle, as it was not essential to the plot nor was it realistic. It just did not seem likely that Jamie Sinclair, who is focused and driven in her professional life, would lose all control in her personal one. The twists and turns do a good job of confusing the reader, but there are too many side plots and characters in which to focus. The end result is muddled, with a good premise gone awry. The Kill Sign would have been a much stronger book had the author focused on the situation at hand and left the personal relationships mainly out of it. Readers who are new to the series may have a few moments of confusion, as The Kill Sign hinges on interpersonal relationships that were forged in previous books."}, {"userName": "Breakaway Reviewers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22317001-breakaway-reviewers", "userReview": "Gung-ho private eye, Jaime Sinclair.When Jaime goes to Mississippi intending to have a romantic weekend, things don\u2019t quite turn out as she had planned.

I think I have hit the tipping point where they are now on my \"must read\" list. This book is a convoluted story where we can't be sure who is guilty and why. Christoff does a great job of keeping us guessing with misdirection. I have finally gotten used to the romance being stuck in the middle of my mystery book, which is present in all four books. Funny and somewhat frustrating ending. But really looking forward to the next one. There are some things that you may miss if you haven't read earlier installments. But Christoff does a great job of writing stand alone books. You should be able to fill in the blanks if you haven't read the others.Overall, a nice read.

I think that Christoff has tightened up her writing and some of my complaints about repetitive descriptions--primarily Jamie's \"square-framed glasses\" and Adam's \"boxer's build\" have been toned down. Although there were multiple mentions of eyeglasses, I think \"square-framed\" only came up 3 times (yes, I counted) and I only caught one \"boxer\" reference Adam's body shape. Picky, I am but it got to the point that repetition of those descriptions in previous books pulled me out of the story and bugged me. This book had Jamie visiting Adam at the military base on the Gulf of Mississippi that he was assigned to after going rogue for personal reasons in the previous book. Just when it finally seems like these two will get an actual weekend (night? few hours?) together romantically, the party they are attending on a riverboat gambling cruise literally blows up their plans when a dirty bomb goes off, killing multiple soldiers and civilians. Right before it goes off, Jamie sees an old perp, she helped her mentor Ray send to jail and she also sees Ray's new partner on the scene and he and Ray's wife Corinne are acting suspicious. Adam is pulled into the investigation of what looks to be a homegrown terror attack and Jamie jumps in to try to solve the case and protect her friends. Overall the action was well-paced and there were plenty of twists and turns in the story that kept me guessing throughout. There's also the appearance of DEA Agent Marc Sandoval, putting commitment-shy Jamie in the midst of a romance triangle--which isn't a bad thing because I just don't quite feel the passion between Adam and Jamie. Anyway... my usual recommendation is to start with the first book,\"The Kill List\" if new to the series.

Colonel Adam Barrett, who is now stationed at Ft. Donovan, Mississippi. Returning to the base where she lived many years ago with her now ex-husband stirs up a bittersweet mix of memories about her failed marriage and her unexpected career path as a private investigator. Happy to reconnect with her mentor Ray Walther and his wife pregnant Corinne, Jamie does not know what to think when she finds out Ray has taken Brandon \"Bran\" Laurent on as a partner in his investigation firm. Equally disquieting are her suspicions about Corinne's relationship with Bran. Trying to put these unpleasant thoughts out of her mind, she and Adam head to the riverboat for a military function but Jamie is surprised to see two familiar faces on board as well. After a stunning explosion leaves forty one people dead and several others wounded, Jamie decides to investigate the case on her own after Adam is assigned to the federal investigation.Jamie immediately recognizes the bomber as Eddie Jepson, a man she knows from her time working with Ray. She cannot help but wonder how on earth a self-serving scam artist like Eddie could pull off such a well-thought out attack. She is also rather puzzled by Eddie's apparent connection to Ray's new partner, Bran. And she is also quite curious about the reason both men were so interested in live lingerie model Monique Wells right before the bomb exploded. The deeper Jamie digs into the case, the less things add up and as her investigation takes one shocking turn after another, she is thrust into the dangerous world of high stakes gambling, homegrown terrorist plots and a search for a missing stripper. Jamie becomes even more confused once Corinne goes missing but she is determined to find her friend before it is too late.The investigation into the bombing moves at a breakneck speed, but Jamie has a great deal of difficulty figuring out how the pieces of the puzzle fit together. Jepson is an unlikely terrorist and Jamie wants to talk to him before the feds take him into custody. She is also deeply suspicious about Bran and the information she uncovers does little to dispel her misgivings about him. Jamie is also quite shocked about some of the changes in Ray but she is even more concerned about what is going on with Corinne. Another murder on the heels of Corinne's disappearance makes it imperative that Jamie get answers to her very troubling questions, but will she discover the truth in time to save her friend?Jamie has barely begun tracking down leads when DEA Agent Marc Sandoval arrives in town. While his assistance on the case is appreciated, he further complicates her already confusing relationship with Adam. Not one for long term commitments, Jamie is spooked by the direction Adam seems to want to take their romance. Marc is not at all shy about letting Jamie know his interest in her runs much deeper than friendship. Jamie is conflicted by her attraction to Marc but she is in love with Adam. Isn't she? Hmm, an interesting love triangle but which man will Jamie choose?The Kill Sign is a suspense-laden, action-packed mystery that will keep readers on the edge of their seats as Jamie's investigation takes some very unexpected detours. With plenty of plot twists, red herrings and clever misdirects, Nichole Christoff adroitly conceal the truth about the incongruous crimes right up until the novel's pulse-pounding adrenaline-filled conclusion.

This is the first book I have read by this author and since this is the fourth book in the series I will be reading the other books in the series in the future."}, {"userName": "John Johnstone", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17231422-john-johnstone", "userReview": "Jamie Sinclair is visiting in Mississippi where she has a new boyfriend who is stationed at Fort Donovan. Adam Barrett is a Colonel in the military police and on a temporary posting. Intent on a romantic night out they attend a function on a paddle steamer which is attacked by bombers killing and maiming many servicemen on board. Jamie recognises a couple of people on the steamer, could they be involved, or do you believe your instincts and assume extremist terrorists are to blame. Jamie needs to help and investigate who is responsible. This is a fast moving action thriller full of little twists and turns, with few clues to the final outcome. Nichole Christoff has written a very good follow up to the excellent The Kill Box full of the same First entertaining action but in a totally different scenario. This series could be easily read one after the other without getting boring. Recommended."}, {"userName": "P Bernhardt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45417773-p-bernhardt", "userReview": "Jamie Sinclair is back in Mississippi where her life as a detective began. Her adventure this trip will involve two men of action who are chasing her heart and several bad guys who like to kill people and break things. One of her gentlemen is a soldier, an officer, who is serving out duty in a penalty box for being a hero but not following Army regulations. Her other beau is a DEA agent who almost always seems to be in the right place at the right time to bail her out of trouble. Adventures abound that include an explosion on a riverboat, a melee at a gambling establishment and several old relationships that become strained during the trip. The author's writing put me in the heat and humidity of Mississippi and her love affairs. I felt I was there with the action and kept reading this romantic-action thriller to the end. The author's writing seems to get better with each Jamie Sinclair adventure. This is a good series to look forward to."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7070211-sue", "userReview": "I was reluctant to start this book. - a free copy received. My reluctance was that it is a later book in the series and I strongly prefer to read in order. And, in the end, that turned out to be a factor in my enjoyment of the book. I really liked the heroine and the plot moved along well while keeping me engaged and interested. My only issue was that some of the choices the characters made seemed a bit far fetched and unrealistic. So, I thought, if I had read the earlier books it might shed some light on Jamie's proclivities and style and make those choices more believable. It also might have made more sense of her relationship to the male characters and their relationship with her and with each other. Over all- an enjoyable read, a fun heroine and lots of action. Thank you for the copy."}, {"userName": "Linda Quick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333931-linda-quick", "userReview": "LOVED this book!!!
