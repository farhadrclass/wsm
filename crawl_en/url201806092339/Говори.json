Your locker combination is private.10. These will be the years you will look back on fondly.\"I'm trying to think of ways to go about describing this book, and I'm not really sure how to start. It's dark, depressing, terrifying, and amazing. Everyone should read it. You might hate it (and I'll get to you), but you must read it. The story starts with Melinda, the narrator, starting 9th grade. Everyone, even her old friends, won't talk to her. It's revealed that during the summer Melinda called the cops on a party and it got busted - a few people got arrested, and now everyone hates her. Something happened to Melinda at that party, something she hasn't told anyone about. She retreats into herself, withdrawing from school, her family, and any possibility of friendship. It isn't until the middle of the story that we learn what really happened at the party, but Anderson gives us a big fat hint in this scene where Melinda and her lab partner dissect a frog in biology class:\"Our frog lies on her back. Waiting for a prince to come and princessify her with a smooch? I stand over her with my knife. Ms. Keen's voice fades to a mosquito whine. My throat closes off. It's hard to breathe. I put out my hand to steady myself against the table. David pins her froggy hands to the dissection tray. He spreads her froggy legs and pins her froggy feet. I have to slice open her belly. She doesn't say a word. She is already dead. A scream starts in my gut - I can feel the cut, smell the dirt, leaves in my hair.\"Holy god. Remember what I said about the terrifying stuff? The main reason I loved this book is because I was very, very similar to Melinda in high school. Her attitude about school, her cynicism towards the whole \"high school is the best time of your life\" crap, her opinions about classes and teachers and the uselessness of guidance counselors...that was me. I kind of wished I could transport myself into the story, so Melinda and I could sneer at pep rallies together. And then I felt bad, because nothing bad happened to me in high school. Nothing like the stuff Melinda went through. She had a reason for being so withdrawn and unhappy and angry about everything. I didn't. It's sort of an unpleasant realization - wow, I was a total snot for absolutely no reason. I was okay with this eventually, but some people might not be. I can imagine someone criticizing this story for being too emo, or saying that Melinda was too much of a downer. (Okay, I didn't want to give away spoilers, but I can't talk about my next point without revealing some stuff. So, just to be clear...HERE BE SPOILERS, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED:)Then again, they could be like a certain reviewer YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE who wrote, and I quote, \"I'm so sick of this [sic:] stories about girls who got raped and spend the entire book pitying themselves.\"*takes breath, counts to ten.*Apparently Laurie Halse Anderson gets this a lot. My edition of the book has an interview with her, and she said, \"I have gotten one question repeatedly from young men. These are guys who liked the book, but they are honestly confused. They ask me why Melinda was so upset about being raped.\" I'm...they...why...what the fuck. I think I need to go sit in a corner and do some yoga breaths, be back later.

Original Review: I've owned this book for years and never got around to reading it until yesterday. I'm happy I did because this was one of the best books that I have read lately.

I think this is a really powerful novel that should be read by so many, especially teens. Speak is a fascinating tale of learning to use your voice when you previously believed it did not matter. The message is one I think all can benefit from and I\u2019m so glad I finally read it.Trigger warning: rapeLaurie Halse Anderson is a fabulous writer. She has a very distinctive writing style; It\u2019s an unfiltered stream of consciousness that feels so real. I previously read Wintergirls and found them to be written very similarly. Melinda\u2019s narration is authentic and raw \u2013 she\u2019s not here to make you love her or hate here, she\u2019s here to tell her story as is. Her humor is dry and loveable which creates an interesting dynamic with the rest of her character.I will say, there really isn\u2019t a plot, which is usually a letdown for me. The entire book is essentially Melissa navigating her freshman year with a heavy weight on her shoulders and few people in her company. There is definitely a large amount of character development which was executed well and I understand that is the intention of the story, so I\u2019m not going to complain that it didn\u2019t feed into my reading preferences. The novel didn\u2019t need a large plot because the story is of personal growth and strength, not high school drama or romance.I will say, the ending felt a little abrupt. I would have loved even just an epilogue to have a more concrete ending (and justice), though many people in Melinda\u2019s situation do not get closure, so maybe that was the author\u2019s intent.What\u2019s interesting is that this book was always described to me as a revolutionary story about sexual assault, but I only found out in the middle of reading that this aspect of the story is not commonly known before reading? Apparently, the point of the story is to find out WHY Melinda cannot speak, though I went into this story already knowing the reason. I definitely don\u2019t think my knowledge of the events of this story affected my reading experience at all. If anything, I think I got more out of the story because I was able to read into details as they were being revealed instead of having to decode them later. I really wish the content of this story was more widespread (though I do seem to be a little late in reading this one) because I think it\u2019s so important people know the sensitive topics they are reading about. Sexual assault is not a plot twist (and I am  not  suggesting Speak feeds into this because I think the topic was handled with accuracy and respect in this case, I\u2019m making a general statement) and I would love for us to not have to silence discussion on its inclusion in the book in fear of ~*s p o i l e r s*~. I think people should know the content of this book before reading, if only to help protect those who may be deeply affected by the events of this novel, where reading unprepared could cause a lot of harm.I really loved this book and would definitely recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "Once I finished reading the last word I  knew  I was going to reread it. Yes that profound.Honest. Authentic. Real. Use all those words and their synonyms and you have this book. I literally wanted to hop into the sea of words and tell Melinda Sordino \" I'll be your friend! Don't despair !\" Alas I couldn't do that though. I had to see her struggle. It's painful but since I watched the movie (which was done well by the way) first before reading the book I knew where she was coming from. Melinda's voice was so...normal. She wasn't there to make you like her or hate her. She just who she really was. I liked her immensely though and in real life think would have been friends with her. Her whole take on high school was hilarious and kind of scarily accurate. I totally love the character of David Petrakis. He would have been my hero in ninth grade. No joke. The cover fits the story like a glove. Not all book jackets can boast that, so let's give the jacket cover artist a round of applause!!! Ok I need stop raving about the cover so much but I couldn't help it. The visual person inside of me had to let it out.Melinda is never really described in detail of how she look likes, so you get the sense the author wanted to make her as relatable as possible, and that she is. We all might not have had to go through the same demons she has, but I know we all have felt alone and without help and that is what makes her the perfect narrator. The ending was done so utterly well I'm not sure I can say anything about it. I'd probably give it away if I try. Let's just say getting back at people is very rewarding.It is getting added to my all time favorites. If you like this book read You Don't Know Me. Not quite the same style but definitely the same feel."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "Well, I can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. I mean, the summary doesn\u2019t reveal much (kind of like Melinda herself) and so, obviously, I made my own assumptions of the plot. Turns out, there\u2019s no killing involved. It\u2019s not a mystery or a thriller; it\u2019s a psychological story. If I had known before, I think I might have enjoyed this a tiny bit more.So, Melinda. She\u2019s confused, scared\u2014terrified\u2014and convinced that she\u2019s alone in this wide, animalistic world. Things are somewhat bearable, but that is prior to her losing her only friend at school and seeing IT. We witness her trying her best to shut down everything around her and take nest in her own mind. It\u2019s not pretty to see and it does make for tragic moments, but they\u2019re all part of the process she creates to survive high school.I really think that the outline of the book is fairly original. It\u2019s feels like it\u2019s written in journal entries, which gives such an authentic atmosphere to the story. It makes us believe in Melinda and hope that everything turns out for the best for her. The writing makes the story flow in a perfect rhythm for this type of story\u2026 lent, that\u2019s for sure, but deep and reflective.A couple of things that could have been better: the secondary characters, Melinda\u2019s parents and the tragedy around IT itself. Basically, this is a Melinda\u2019s world: we\u2019re in her head\u2026 and since she\u2019s not the most popular girl in school, there aren\u2019t many interactions between her and other kids. This equals scarcely any secondary characters. There\u2019s David, the headstrong and could-not-be-more-different-than-Melinda David. But what about him? We only get to know him a little through short \u2018\u2018journal entries\u2019\u2019 of Melinda\u2019s.Melinda\u2019s parents are puzzling... At least, to me. For most of the book, they\u2019re extremely mad and annoyed at her, especially the mother. She never tries to actually ask Melinda what\u2019s wrong. No wonder Melinda can\u2019t muster the force to do so. But then, at end of the story, we see the dad showing such benevolence and I\u2019m there squinting my eyes, like why is this the first time we see this facet of his personality? Surely because Melinda prefers limiting her interactions with her parents.And the last thing that let me down is the details around IT. Or, shall I say, the lack of them. We don\u2019t know his past, why he does what he does or, even, what will happen to him. Alright, so the last part is easy to imagine, BUT STILL. The ending is very open, so that\u2019s something to remember. I find it sad that we don\u2019t get any kind of info on IT\u2026 I wish we knew what his life at home looks like, just so we can understand his motives for doing what he does better.This book didn\u2019t take me by surprise, as I have read a panoply of novels with similar (if not exact same) themes. But I can guess that, when it was first published, there were reasons to fuss about it. I am still recommending it, seeing that it\u2019s so profound and realistic and I grew quite attached to Melinda.

Heather, the temporary friend who's only waiting to be snapped up my a cooler clique... and, of course, the protagonist who doesn't quite fit in anywhere.The beauty of this novel is that it could have survived alone without the much more sinister story behind it.

I was particularly disappointed with the ending and felt that there was an element of glorification in this novel that I didn't appreciate. Let me explain:Although I loved the fact that Melinda finally finds her voice and a way to express herself, I felt as if the story was wrapped up a little too quickly and too neatly. Let's be honest, that ending was more than a little unrealistic. You can't simply put a pretty bow on the end of this novel, otherwise the entire tale becomes trite. Having been through this myself and sadly listened to countless stories similar (and worse) than mine, I can say that 9 times out of 10 you don't get closure, let alone retribution. And having someone swoop in to save you is pretty much unheard of, otherwise we wouldn't have such a thing as \"rape culture\" which tragically pervades our country. I think this particular ending potentially puts across the wrong message to girls who might find themselves in a similar situation or who are in this situation. Nevertheless, it's an important story to be told and there were scenes and emotions that were absolutely right on and very relatable."}, {"userName": "Jessica Abarquez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/852534-jessica-abarquez", "userReview": "Reference information: Title: SpeakAuthor: Laurie Halse AndersonPublisher: Penguin Group\tYear: 1999# of pages: 198\tGenre: intense read\tReading level: 9th grade\tInterest level: late high schoolPotential hot lava: Thoughts of suicide and rape.General response/reaction:This book was so moving. Yes, it was difficult to read and very intense, but it was extremely good! I sort of knew how it was going to end because I cheated and looked it up, but it was still so good to read this book. I was glad that Anderson did not go into detail about the rape because that would have been too intense for me. I liked the way she kept the narration in Melinda\u2019s head. The dialogue in her head remained realistic because no girl would want to replay the details over and over again. This novel was amazing because Melinda grew through her tragedy.

She is an outcast because she is \u201cweird,\u201d her friends from middle school don\u2019t want to associate with her because she called the police that broke up a party, and the teachers are \u201cout to get her.\u201d At first, she befriends a girl who is new to the school, Heather. For a while, things seem to work out between the two. Unfortunately, Melinda keeps to herself all the time and barely speaks. She has a secret inside of her that torments all the words. Most of the school thinks she is weird and her parents and teachers think something is wrong with her. They think she is just being a delinquent, but there is more to the story than what Melinda lets on.Melinda goes through the motions of school and barely passes. She makes some friends, but she is so scarred from the summer that she is still uncomfortable getting too close to anyone. Melinda does not trust anyone, nor can she trust herself. The only thing in school Melinda enjoys is her art class. She works hard all year by creating and letting her emotions flow through her art (although she does not know it at the time).As the year goes on, she encounters the boy who raped her. He knows that he still has the power over her and continues to use it to scare her into silence. However, when Andy starts dating Rachel, Melinda cannot stand back and let Andy do the same thing to her former best friend. It takes a while for Melinda to get the courage to tell Rachel, but she finally does. Of course Rachel does not believe Melinda and she thinks that Melinda is just jealous, but Melinda at least tried. When Rachel breaks up with Andy (because he was trying to do the same thing to her as he did to Melinda), Andy becomes furious and goes after Melinda. She fights him and makes enough commotion for her friends to come back to find out what was going on and Andy gets exposed for who he really is.

Sometimes it\u2019s absolutely impossible, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes you are so filled with anxiety and fear, you can\u2019t even think of the words, let alone spit them out. And sometimes, life itself is crippling. You will undergo something that overtakes you, that consumes every waking thought, that fills you with fear and changes every aspect of your life and still you cannot talk about it. To anyone, whether you have someone to confide in or not. Melinda is that girl. She is a misfit. A pariah. A freshman, who everyone in her class hates. No one talks to her, except to make fun of her. She wasn\u2019t always this way though. Not until she called the cops at the end of a summer party and got caught doing so by her former best friend who now hates her for it. And that was what did it. That party changed everything for Melinda. That one night. And now, she doesn\u2019t talk to anyone. Not even her parents. Her grades are sinking and her parents are furious over it and she can\u2019t explain why. And except for caring about her grades, her parents aren\u2019t all that concerned about their daughter. No wonder she decided to keep quiet. At some point, Melinda finds herself in a situation wherein she realizes that must find her voice. She then discovers a resilience that she never knew she had and then she SPEAKS. Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is full of emotion. It is captivating yet devastating. I was overwhelmed by the honesty that was portrayed by Melinda thought out. Laurie Halse Anderson did an incredible job of capturing Melinda\u2019s feelings and describing the awkwardness of High School, being an outcast and feeling completely alone during the most desperate of times.

Everyone got busted. Her parents aren't much help either, always fighting about what's best for Melinda and communicating through post-it notes on the refrigerator wall. These are only a few of the things that have Melinda depressed. When what really happened at the senior party is revealed, it will be easy, although painful, to understand Melinda's unbreakable silence.I just finished my second read through of the book, and I still loved it. I actually had to read this for school, which surprised me because of the subject matter. Anyway, \"Speak\" is a novel I think all teenagers should read. Melinda's voice, although cynical and outspoken, was dead-on and as a teenager I felt like I totally connected with her through the entire book. I also loved the \"tree\" symbolism in Melinda's art class, subtle enough to not be cliche but powerful enough to make me feel growth. Some YA authors don't really understand how cliques and stuff work nowadays, but Anderson hit the nail on the head, which made me like the book even more.

It is dangerously, fantastically gripping, not necessarily because the plot is so amazing, but because Anderson gets Melinda's voice so very, very right.

A recent traumatic experience that led to a very complicated misunderstanding sent a sudden collapse on her being. Aside from being completely mute in public, Melinda\u2019s private and social life is in ruins. Slowly, she began to lose interest in everything, including her family and school. If possible, she also wants to lose the memory of that traumatic night. Abandoned and confused, Melinda longs for someone to comfort her. And so, since no one seems to care and listen, she privately engages in these heartbreaking monologues.\n\"My face becomes a Picasso sketch, my body slicing into pieces.\"\nSocial stigmatization is not just cultural. It happens everywhere. It is most difficult when uninformed perceptions push a person into self-ostracism. Secrets and stigma are the most prominent theme on Melinda\u2019s account of her freshman year. The first person narration of Speak is its best character. And Melinda\u2019s monologues drove a great impact, making it very personal for every reader.\n\"You have to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against.\"\nStrongly, this book stressed how important family relationship is. Harmony within our home is the best comfort and security for our children, they become more open. Encouraging our children to speak up boldly (but respectful) without fear of being punished or humiliated may be their best way to survive and lead a healthy life."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-elizabeth", "userReview": "Bleak YA novel that reads as a cautionary tale. This was assigned reading for our #1 in her Language Arts class. Students were asked to read this book for a bullying unit though it is more about the injustice of rape (it does not address the particular damage of rape). It is the story of a young girl who is so disconnected from everyone that she is unable to speak after being assaulted until her rapist targets her ex best friend. She tells no one about her own assault and though she is much changed after being raped (and continues to be harassed by her rapist) no one notices or cares enough to take the time to figure out what caused her to quit talking. Not her friends, not her parents, not the high school counselor, principal, or her teachers. It is not an example of how to protect oneself and probably not a book that lends itself to class discussion in middle school. I am trying to imagine 12/13 year old students discussing rape and ambivalent parents & teachers.

I remembered it being a harder read this time than it was the first time. I'm not sure if knowledge of the big reveal made the tension bigger for me this time, but I still have to say this is a smashing read.Melinda called the cops on a wild end-of-summer party before she started ninth grade, and now she doesn't have a friend in the world except new girl Heather, who has plans for getting to the top social ranks in high school and doesn't yet realize that friendship with Melinda will ensure that she never achieves them. Melinda, who can barely speak anymore, can't tell her. She can only endure the spitballs, thrown food, whispers, and turned backs--and the whispered taunts of a handsome senior who terrifies her. Even her former best friend Rachel, eager to be popular, has abandoned her completely without ever trying to learn why Melinda made that call. And Melinda's parents seem to regard everything she doesn in this year as deliberately generated disappointments.The story is that of Melinda finding her way back to herself over the year, from sliding downhill into total apathy to fighting her way to her voice and to justice. Like nearly all of Laurie Halse Anderson's work, this is a story about justice. It's also a story about voice and its power, about how voices speaking out are our most positive weapon. This book, its growing power since its publication, and the number of lives it has influenced, is living proof of the power of one writer's voice to set her readers free and to feed their idealism so it will never burn out."}, {"userName": "Mon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1647568-mon", "userReview": "Maybe I'm being too cynical, and that the protagonist (I forgot her name already, so I'm just going to call her Jane) did go through something worth lamenting for 200 pages.

LOOK MY HEART IS BLEEDING AND YOU CAN HEAR MY SCREAMS BECAUSE IM LITERALLY TALKING LIKE THIS!!!!! This has to be the worst psychological portrayal of selective mute I've ever read. Ms. Anderson, please don't ever consider a career in counseling. Also, if you're writing about contemporary art, please have the decency to at least read about postmodernism. Look, I'm not saying sketches, oil and print making can't be cutting edge, but Jane's A+ art works make me want to throw up. Her art teacher is meant to be a bohemian liberal artist, but I can see why he ended up teaching high school. To be fair you can't judge a work by reading vague descriptions of its visual composition, but drawing a depressed tree is not conceptual art, and whining about corporate fascism doesn't make you an artist either. Jane is utterly talentless. I wish my current art critic tutor is as forgiving as her art class. The snail pace monologues are full of anguish, you half expect it to boil down to some psycho sadistic plot twist but your common sense tells you this is a book marketed towards teenagers.

Lol. ^^ The title of this book intrigued me and somehow demanded me to read the book. My intuition that I will not regret reading this book did not fail me because this book tells of an inspiring and touching story of a young girl, Melinda who lost herself, her confidence and her ability to speak after she was raped by the most popular senior a year ago. Because of her inability to speak, Melinda loses her best friend who thought that she was betrayed by Melinda during her best friend's party when Melinda called 911 but was unable to tell what really happened. For the whole year, Melinda lives her life in fear, silence and isolation, embarrassed of what happened to her. Even her own parents couldn't understand what she's going through. Her only hope lies on her art and on her art teacher, Mr. Freeman, the only person who seems to get her even just a bit. By allowing Melinda to express herself through art, Mr. Freeman sort of helped Melinda to learn to speak, really speak again until she finally finds her voice to speak out the truth that she was raped and that there is nothing to be ashamed of which also saved her best friend from the same ill fate (because her best friend was dating the rapist).Melinda starts getting back pieces of her life together and the story perfectly ends at Melinda's art class as she finishes her final requirement on which she earns an A+ and when Mr. Freeman asks her, \"You've been through a lot, haven't you?,\" Melinda answers, \"Let me tell you about it.\""}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "I read this in high school.

Speak is a challenging novel to read as it tackles sexual abuse, depression, censorship and bullying. Here are the characters and their significance in the story: Melinda Sordino: The story is told in her perspective. She's aloof, timid and guarded. She's a freshmen high school student treated like an outcast in her school. They are furious when she called the cops during a party but there's a reason behind it and she's dying to tell the truth. Sadly, her friends distanced themselves from her and no one is willing to listen to her story. Melinda is a rape victim. She's afraid of being judged by her traumatizing experience. Instead, she remains silent and the pain consumes her. It's difficult to read the passages wherein her rapist freely walks in their school and she's paralyzed by fear. It makes her feel powerless and depressive. I sympathized with her throughout the novel.David Petrakis: He's Melinda's lab partner and she thought he's snob. I'm thankful for someone like him because he helped Melinda find the strength and courage to speak up. Giving her assurance that he's on her side when Mr. Neck tried to silence them. Mr. Freeman: Aside from David, he's another person I'm thankful for. He's an art teacher who guided Melinda working on her project. Melinda may not express herself verbally but she did through an artwork and Mr. Freeman recognized her feelings. He's definitely Mr. Neck's polar opposite. Mr. Neck: He's a character who represents censorship. He only values his opinion and those people who agreed with him. He's a close-minded, prideful and awful person. Rachel, Iris, Nicole and Heather: Out of these four girls, I only paid close attention to Rachel, Iris and Heather. As we grow up, we meet a lot of people. Friendships were formed and fell apart at one point while only few are considered true to you. Rachel was the former best friend and I crossed my fingers that one day she and Melinda mend the gap between them (the ending of this book is one step). We all have that one friend who is a social climber and reaches you out when you're needed Heather is a primary example. Lastly, Iris whom I think is a good listener. She may be wary at first but I have a strong feeling she's a keeper.Overall, this is a good realistic story. However, I find the premise really dull and I keep waiting for something important to happen. My pace started to pick up by the end of third marking period till the last part and I just wish there's a closure. Despite of it, I like the message of this book: Never be afraid to speak up. It's important and it leaves an impact to its readers.
