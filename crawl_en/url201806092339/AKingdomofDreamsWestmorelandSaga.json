This book has two major \"pet peeves\" of mine (#1- at the beginning, the hero beats the heroine not only once, but twice; #2- somewhere down the road, the hero and the heroine are torn apart by a Big Misunderstanding), but who cares? I don't know why, I don't know how, but I ended up loving this book! :)Royce turned out to be a wonderful hero. After a less-than-thrilling introduction, he slowly (but steadily) started to grow on me, up to the point where I understood and forgave everything he'd done. That's not to be taken lightly, because I never - or should I say, almost never - forgive a hero who raises his hand against the heroine.As for Jennifer, I had mixed feelings about her throughout the book - sometimes I wanted to hug her, sometimes I wanted to scream at her - but I ended up understanding and loving her too. (BTW, I think \"Jennifer\" is an unusual name for a medieval heroine but I'm not an expert in History, so I'm not sure it isn't appropriate.)As for the story, what an emotional roller-coaster! When I become so involved in a book that I find myself laughing, crying and even \"talking\" to the characters, I know I have a winner in my hands. I didn't always agree with everything Royce and Jennifer did but, in a sense, their actions were consistent and \"right\". And what they did in the end... What a scene! I still feel a tug in my heart remembering it. *sighs*"}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "I am at a loss for words \u2013 I seriously don\u2019t know how to review this book \u2013 which words to use to do it justice. Kingdom of Dreams is my first read by this author and it will not be my last. I was instantly captivated by the characters who are deeply complex, wonderful people trying to make their way through a rough, and oft times unfair world \u2013 and do it while keeping their honor and integrity intact. The storyline with its twists and turns fascinated me from the first page and held my attention to the last. I was rendered speechless by the Merrick family/clan dynamic and while yes, I know it is just a story, thier motives and reasonings were written so well that there was no doubt in my mind all of those underhanded, deceitful things could really have taken place.Royce is an amazing man. He\u2019s deadly on the battlefield, a warrior willing and able to do whatever he has to do to win, accepting nothing less than victory, no excuses for failure, but off the battlefield he is compassionate, fair and honorable. He admits his faults and is willing to do what he must to be a better man. In my eyes, he is the perfect hero.Jenny annoyed the hell out of me from the very beginning with her lack of loyalty to Royce, and her terribly misplaced devotion and trust in her clan and family. I couldn\u2019t imagine that there was any way she could change my poor opinion of her, but there at the end she did just that in such a way that allowed me to look past all her faults, all of her poor choices \u2013 and I wept as I came to forgive her.What an emotional rollercoaster ride we take with Jenny and Royce who, though they don\u2019t know it at the time, are perfectly matched. What one lacks in strength, the other makes up for. What one can\u2019t grasp, the other understands with crystal clarity. While Royce and Jenny believe their lives full and complete, they discover that apart they can exist, but only together do they truly live.In all honesty, there are no words to describe how much I love Kingdom of Dreams. It\u2019s been several days since I finished it and I\u2019m still recalling events and conversations, still laughing out loud and still struggling to hold back the tears.My only regret is that we didn't learn more about Arik, that quiet, giant of a man. I am certain that his untold story is one of sadness, loss and the need of his own Happily Ever After. (Are you listening Ms. McNaught?

Leaning back slightly against his arm, her melting blue eyes gazing deeply into his, his wife replied in a shaky voice, \"I think, my lord, I love you more.\u201d\n\"You are mad!\" she snapped, her chest heaving. \"And you are a devil.\"\"And you, my dear, \u2026are a bitch.\"\n\n\"Behold your new mistress, my wife.

I don\u2019t really have a choice. Before cracking open, A Kingdom of Dreams, I read Teresa Denys\u2019 masterpiece, *The Silver Devil, and in a Medieval romance face-off; McNaught\u2019s version loses hands down. To be fair, the two authors have very different writing styles: The Silver Devil, is dark, gritty, and authentic to the time period; while, A Kingdom of Dreams, is modish, amusing, and fantastical. In television terms, The Silver Devil, is The Tudors; whereas, A Kingdom of Dreams, is Galavant. Though, both shows are, indeed, set in Medieval times, only one of them has knights that act like this: \n\n But, hey! What do I know? I\u2019ve never met a Medieval knight. If they truly do dance like lunatics whilst pillaging and plundering, then I apologize. My bad! MOVING ON\u2026 \n\n In the midst of war torn Scotland, Jennifer Merrik \u2013 the 17 year old Countess of Rockburn - is kidnapped and forced to marry her mortal enemy: Royce Westmoreland, The Duke of Claymore, a.k.a: \u201cThe Wolf\u201d. Upon joining together in unholy matrimony, Royce and Jenny view their alliance as more battle than bliss. Thus, the two headstrong individuals commence upon a long, hard journey toward happily ever after. \n\n Between you, me, and the jousting post, I could have done without the 10,000 times Royce admired Jenny\u2019s \u201cindomitable spirit\u201d and \u201cunbelievable courage\u201d; referred to her as a \u201cfiery temptress\u201d and a \u201ccharming wood nymph\u201d; and gushed over her \u201clyrical laughter\u201d and \u201cjaunty grin\u201d. Had Royce suddenly waxed poetic about Jenny\u2019s ability to converse with blue jays and befriend baby skunks, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. As for Royce being \u201cThe Wolf\u201d, well, that\u2019s a misnomer. When he wasn\u2019t dwelling on the \u201cwet velvet\u201d of Jenny\u2019s eyes, or mentally referring to her as a \u201cgolden haired temptress\u201d; he was getting his metaphorical panties in wad because she had the gall to escape him. Seriously? The guy kidnaps an innocent girl, holds her captive, deflowers her, and plans to dump her for a \u201cbiddable, blonde wife\u201d; and she\u2019s supposed to thank him for soiling her reputation and rendering her unmarriageable? With squishy thinking like that, he should be called, \u201cThe Marshmallow\u201d. Girlish musings and childish snits aside, The Marshmallow still manages to be pretty swoon worthy. His lovemaking is worshipful, his groveling darn right legendary, and his wooing; well, judge for yourself: \" 'You have the bluest eyes on earth,' he added with a low, appreciative chuckle. 'When you're angry, they're the color of wet blue velvet.' Jenny rolled her eyes in disgust. 'Wet velvet?' she repeated wryly, wrinkling her nose. 'Wet velvet.' His white teeth flashed in a devastating grin. 'No? What should I have said?' His smile was irresistible, and Jenny fell in with his teasing mood, 'Well, you might have said they're the color of\u2014' she glanced at the large sapphire in the center of the crucifix '\u2014of sapphires,' she provided. 'That has a nice ring to it.' 'Ah, but sapphires are cold, and your eyes are warm and expressive. Am I doing better?' he chuckled when she voiced no further argument to wet velvet. 'Much,' she agreed readily.\u201d ~Royce & Jenny \n\n Like Galavant, A Kingdom of Dreams, is Medieval light: a place where indomitably spirited, unbelievably courageous maidens, get kidnapped by swoony (but marshmallowy) knights in shining armor; and they ride off into the sunset, and live happily ever after, in their Disneyesque castles; with their army of loyal protectors, 2.5 male heirs, 3 mythically named horses, a sky full of talking blue jays, and a BFF baby skunk.If that\u2019s the type of Medieval romance you enjoy, then Judith McNaught\u2019s, A Kingdom of Dreams, is the book for you. \n\n TO READ MY REVIEW OF BOOK 2, click link below:Whitney, My Love (Westmoreland #2): Click Me Baby!*Galavant, ABC. 2015-Present.

No? Too harsh? How about this:\nWell this sucks. Another McNaught favorite among many that I did not love. I feel like I should put out a disclaimer or apologize to my GR friends for clogging up your feeds with my negative reviews & low ratings as of late. I promise you I'm NOT doing it on purpose. I\u2019m not one of those reviewers. I\u2019ve been in a serious book funk that seems to have no end. Nothing is working for me. I pulled this out of my \u2018emergency\u2019 pile in hopes it would pull me out of it but no such luck. *sigh* Go figure.This started out promising. The hero Royce Westmoreland was everything fierce, aggressive, alpha and intimidating that I enjoy. I was not a fan of the slapping incident but he slowly redeemed himself. The whole \"falling in love with my captured enemy\" was right down my alley of fun. But the heroine Jennifer Merrick and staggered plot made the whole experience quite torturous. \nOh Moses this girl holds a grudge like a dog with a bone. Jesus. I kept having to remind myself that Jenny is only a 17 year-old sheltered girl but still, with that age and her attitude...she took a lot of arrogant liberties and quick to believe misassumptions that made me wish someone would slap some sense and humility into her. And by the way, what woman in 1400s Scotland would have a modern English name like Jennifer? I mean..Jennifer? Come on. I googled it and it dates back only to the 20th Century. So uh...WTH? This was a huge gaffe and made me wish the author picked another more accurate name appropriate to the time period. Or one that isn't so ridiculously out of place. It stuck out like a sore thumb. Moving on...This was literally a Tudor version of Paradise, just switch out the names, setting and era. I've noticed that Judith McNaught likes to stick to a certain formula and plug it into every story no matter the genre. That's fine since she exceeds at writing tortured conflicted multi-layered characters I can overlook it but I'd like a little more variety is all I'm saying. Do both leads HAVE to be strong willed and obsessively obstinate? The endless misunderstandings, arguing, vicious hate just piled on top of each other like an angry agitated ant hill. Here emotions and feelings swing like a pendulum and are so mercurial that you never know what you are going to get in the next 5 pages. \nYou literally are holding your breath waiting for the next explosion and the small baby steps the couple have taken just disintegrate and we are back at square one. Where's the actual relationship development? The character growth? If you are constantly hurdling obstacles at the couple every few pages there is little room for actual growth and development. For me at least that's what it felt like here. Jenny's surprise revelation that she loves Royce came out of nowhere considering she tried everything to get away from him but the minute she finds out he did in fact want to marry her *gasp* She loves him!!!......Huh? The momentum and pacing is complete crap IMO. The couple do get a few moments of levity but it was all surface because both the reader and characters are fully aware that it will all fall apart very soon. The number of times and dramatic shifts from hate to love to hate again is just crazy.\n\nI just wished Judith would have let this couple be for a little while. Same grievances I had with Paradise I ran into in here, the amount of anxiety, anger, and frustration I experienced while reading this just colored my opinion of the whole story and unfortunately the characters too. When the couple finally reached their HEA I felt totally indifferent and not really caring. I mean it was nice and sure Jenny's gesture was sweet but it didn't wow me, I just felt numb. Like 100 pages too late honey...I kept questioning was the payoff worth it? Jury\u2019s still out. I\u2019m not sure if the heroine\u2019s groveling and humbling herself in the VERY last chapter was worth the ridiculous amount of strife and misery the hero, the couple and the readers are put through. It wasn't worth it for me. I mean it wasn't enough for Royce and Jenny to endlessly run into problems and constant misunderstandings and manipulations by outside forces, but the needless death of Jenny's stepbrother William in the last 100 pages used as another source of contention between the two was just too much. Was this really necessary? The knife incident just threw me over the edge and I checked out mentally after that. Jenny crucifying Royce and refusing to believe his innocence was the final straw that broke the camel's back for me. This made my blood boil and stressed me the HELL out. I mean she pulled a damn knife on him. And this is just mere days after discovering she loves her husband and claiming to trust him. Yet she draws a knife on him in vengeance? Really?! That's not love. Not my definition of it at least. I can\u2019t and won't overlook that. This had too many shades of an unhealthy, unstable, volatile relationship that won't last long. What got under my skin was that Jennifer didn\u2019t even hesitate or bother to ask Royce what happened. Instead she\u2019s quick to pounce on the man she supposedly \"loves\" and attacks him with a knife with zero hesitation. \nBitch GOODBYE. I don\u2019t care if it was a family member she was grieving over you don\u2019t attack or try to kill a person you love without demanding an explanation first. It's disgusting, needless and not my cup of tea. And if that wasn't enough brutal misery, her choosing to publicly humiliate her husband and turn her back on her new countrymen to sit with her manipulative scheming family and clansmen made me seethe. The amount of prideful arrogance this girl has is enough to choke a horse. It wasn't enough to publicly scorn Royce as a murderer but you have to cut him at the knees too in front of 2 countries because you think it's your duty?\nThe amount of times this girl continuously martyrs herself for her heartless vile selfish father and hateful clansmen was unbearable. I get why she was always looking for her father's love and approval but her blindness to his shortcomings and refusing to believe her people were capable of any wrong doing was so naive it just veered into TSTL in some instances. Especially when Royce gingerly brought up the truth about her father\u2019s underhanded scheme to secretly take her away to an Abbey after the marriage without asking Jenny. She doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of it, oh no her father would NEVER take her choices away from her.\nThe same man who carted her butt off to an Abbey for 2 years straight to cure her \u2018hellion\u2019 ways and didn\u2019t bother to visit her isn\u2019t capable of this? Really? RME. Okie dokie. I tried to sympathize with her but there was little room for me to even do that because of her prideful attitude & stubborn idiotic ways. And the stunt her father and Malcolm pull at the tournament just made me wish they would all get trampled. This was the first book where I loathed the Scottish characters and was rooting for the English, pillaging and snobbery and all. Usually the roles of hero and villain are reverse when it comes to this historic rivalry. I appreciated that JM went a different route. There are villains on both sides and a lot of animonsity which I found accurate. I just was hoping to get something a little more along the lines of The Raider or Perfect same idea of captive falls in love with his captor and sworn enemies thing. But the balances in there were way better. I guess I am a little softhearted when it comes to angsty stories after all, and I love angst! But not this kind. I just can\u2019t stand a book packed with vicious attacks, name calling and scathing retorts. That can only go so far. The thing about McNaught I\u2019m coming to realize is that she likes to test emotional boundaries and put readers in an uneasy mindset with the constant ups and downs all the way to the very end. I can appreciate that..up to a certain point. I had a handful of her HR on my TR list but now...if it's the same dynamic & same outcome in every book I'm not sure it's for me. I need more satisfaction, conviction and payoff in my readings. And ones that don't make me feel like absolute shit while reading it. And most importantly characters I don't want to physically strangle. Life is stressful enough yo. My dear Goodreads friend who are avid JM fans: help me out! Is this pretty much what we get as far as characterizations in all her books?

Sometimes I think that when I see all of my friends have given a book 5-stars, I go in with my expectations way too high. Or, it could be that I just like to be a jerk.The problem I had with this is book is that I didn't like the heroine, Jennifer. It started out well. I liked that she was figuring out ways to escape her kidnappers. I liked how hard she fought. But, after a while, she got real old real fast.I get that she didn't like her kidnapper, Royce. I mean who would like their kidnapper? And, I get that she ran away from him. Who wouldn't run away? But, let's be real for a minute. She was going to marry an old leach because her father wanted the alliance. A man that she said made her skin crawl. And, she was totally attracted to Royce, flirted with him, and then she slept with him. And Royce was like the sweetest thing ever to her. He was nicknamed \"The Wolf\", but as far as I could see, this guy was more like a wolf puppy who was eating out the palm of her hand. He treated her like his first crush, not a prisoner. I think she was actually better off with him than the old creeper she was going to be forced into marrying by her father. Considering how women were treated back then, it was like she won the lottery or something.So, she ends up having to marry Royce (not a spoiler, happens first page of the book) and she acts like it's a death sentence. Oh no, I have to marry the guy that is rich, adores me, has treated me like a princess, and is great in the sack! What torture! And then, when \"stuff happens\", she won't give him the benefit of the doubt at all. She automatically hates his guts and tells him so at every opportunity. She even goes out of her way to publicly humiliate him.

I'll admit that this isn't my favorite by JM, but it's certainly one of the best historicals I've read. It's up there near Prisoner of My Desire; pretty close to the rapey books in my heart. Bad ass heroine meets bad ass hero. And it was delightful. The heroine was sent to an abbey, although she isn't nun quality in the least. She gets captured and taken to Royce's camp.

Several people recommended this book to me (thank you!) and I can see why! Who doesn't love an enemies to lover story especially with someone as yummy as Royce. Royce is known as The Wolf and is the King of England's best warrior. He has a ferocious reputation but I loved getting to know the real Royce...almost as much as Jennifer did. Jennifer is definitely a more modern woman. She doesn't take to being pushed in a corner and she freely speaks her mind. It's a good thing Royce likes this...in fact, he's really drawn to it. It was wonderful reading about Royce and Jennifer falling for each other and all the conflicting emotions going on definitely made things more interesting. My heart did go out to Jennifer as I felt she had the hardest time deciding between Royce and her family. It was even better reading their steamy scenes even if sometimes things were a bit too perfect. It always made me laugh how all Royce had to do was start kissing her and she melted especially considering some of the harsh things he said to her!I got a big kick out of all the escapes in the beginning and all the little pranks Jennifer did. The part about Thor was a killer. :( There are some great characters in the story. Jennifer's Aunt Elinor was hilarious and I loved how she was with Arik. Brenna and Stefan were great to read about, as well as several of Royce's knights. The one thing that sort of bothered me was what happened with William. It seemed a bit anti-climatic as to the \"how\" things happened. I did love the part where she ran out to the field...thank goodness for Stefan but it killed me that it took her so long! And the ending? Sooo perfect...her dream kingdom.

They both know of each by reputation only and each have already strong preconceived ideas of one another's character. And these ideas are not Favourable to say the least.Jenny is frighten but she is strong. Her family motto is:\"If it's the Lords will that you die at the hand of your enemy, then do it bravely.

They share a very volatile relationship. One that would set the foundation for many generations to come. This story was an riveting thrill ride of historical proportions. Every scene in this book was captivating and engaging. From fighting to making love, this book has a little of everything. The scene that will always stand out for me is when her family fight Royce in a type of mock battle. I will never forget what took place that day! It was so well written, I felt so many emotions in those moments, it was tangible vivid and real to me!That scene, those words....OH MY GOD! \"Royce is letting them kill him...he is out there on that field, dying for you.

I physically couldn't stop myself from devouring every word written. Not to add any updates or even add this book to my CR list. My eyes were drying out (seriously, I used eyes drops) from not blinking enough and lack of sleep. It wasn't a pretty sight... This historical romance sure didn't feel historical to me. It was so easy to read. I wasn't bored with politics and wars. There was enough to help me understand but not hate the book. The story and characters are hilarious, charming and an all round joy to read about.  _________________________Jennifer Merrick aka Jenny, is a stubborn redheaded witch lass, known for her bravery and skill at aggravating and challenging a certain warrior to the point of no return.Royce Westmoreland aka The Wolf, is a handsome fierce warrior, known for his murderous and barbarian ways. He's feared by all...except for the stubborn and exasperating Jenny.  _________________________When Jenny and her sister are kidnapped and brought before the feared 'Wolf', Jenny knows there is little hope they'll survive the night. So being a headstrong 'Merrick' lass, Jenny lifts her chin with pride as she bites the Wolf, then knees him in the balls.Who could blame her for all the trouble and amusement Royce endures during her captivity. All she wanted...When that wasn't granted, she was left with no other choice but to attempt escape...with Royce's prized horse of course. And that was just the being of the adventure... __________________________A heartfelt love story between two enemies. Jenny bound to honor her family. And Royce's sworn loyalty to his king. An impossible union that may destroy them, or bring peace to all. I guess you'll have to read it to find out...hehehehe!Filled with drama, sadness at times and sweet love.

I loved the family/clan dynamics, court politics, and the depth the author portrayed these complex characters. This story was exactly what I needed to get away from all the terrible contemporary romance I've been reading. What made it a 4? That would be Jenny. Her clan loyalty was admirable, but terribly misguided! How could she be so clever when it came to escaping, tricking Royce again and again, but not see that her father and family didn't care about her, just the value she could bring to them?? What a TWAT!

I read this book many years ago, and I had this on my list to re read, and since my library didn't have it any longer, I decided I would need to buy it and well worth it in the end!! I loved everything about this book. At first it started out a bit slow, and I was a bit worried that I wouldn't love it as much as I did when I read it the first time. But wow, suddenly I was drawn in so completely I couldn't put it down and I realized what a fabulous couple these two are. Jennifer and Royce are enemies of a sort. Royce is English and Jennifer is a Scot. Jennifer for the past two years has been stuck in a convent as punishment for something she did not do, but cruel machinations from her step brother. Then she finds herself kidnapped along with her sister by Royce and his men. But through the course of events, they end up falling in love.Oh Man there is so much love that I have for this story, and honestly I can't even begin to express how much I adored these two and what conflict that drives them together...drives them apart and then together again. There are a few misunderstandings that happen between them. And some granted...I can understand why it would cause mistrust. But what was most compelling about this couple, is seeing the way they work through things. It isn't always easy for them, but they don't block out their true feelings for each other. And the emotion that is portrayed is very compelling. From beginning to end I wanted more of these two. I wanted to see what drives them to be together despite what tends to tear them apart on occasion. Kingdom of Dreams is a story that draws two people together, that build a kingdom of their own...a Kingdom of Dreams---full of life, love and laughter.A Compelling and Riveting romance to keep you on your toes and make every nerve ending come alive!! \u00a0If you have yet to read this book....grab it up NOW and you won't regret it.

I was wrong. I'm realizing that I lusted after them, not truly loved. This book is love. The way I wrote my review for Whitney, My Love, is going to be the same way I write my review for this book. There isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said about this book. It is a phenomenal book and everyone should read it regardless if you like Historical Romance or not. I guarantee you will love it after you read it and it will most likely render you speechless. \"You're so cold, you're fighting back tears?\" he uttered in disbelief, trying to see her face with only the dying embers of the little fire in the center of the tent for illumination. \"No,\" she said hoarsely. \"Then why?\" he demanded, completely at a loss as to what could have finally battered down her stubborn pride and made her cry. \"The thrashing I gave you?\" \"No,\" she whispered achingly, her eyes locked with his. \"Your horse.\"Of all the things she could have said, that answer was the one he least expected and most wanted to hear. Somehow knowing that she regretted the senseless loss of his horse made it seem somehow less painful. \"He was the most beautiful animal I've ever seen,\" she added hoarsely. \"If I'd know that taking him this morning might have led to his death, I'd have stayed her until I could-could find some other way.\" Staring up into the earl's hooded eyes, Jenny saw him wince as he pulled his hand away from her face. \"It's a miracle you fell off or you'd both have died,\" he said gruffly. Turning to her side she buried her face in the furs. \"I didn't fall,\" she whispered brokenly, \"he threw me. I'd ridden higher over obstacles all day. I knew could clear that tree with ease, but when he jumped, he reared up at the same time, for no reason at all, and I fell backward. He shook me off before he jumped.\" \"Thor sired two sons, Jennifer,\" Royce said with rough gentleness, \"in his exact likeness. One of the is here, the other at Claymore being trained. He isn't completely lost to me.\" His captive drew a shattered breath, and in the darkness, she said simply, \"Thank you.\"-Jennifer to RoyceJenny's huge, feared-widened eyes were riveted to his face. \"Please,\" she whispered, mistaking his silence for refusal. \"I'll do anything. I'll kneel to you. Please, you have only to tell me what you want.\" He finally spoke and Jenny tensed with hope, too overwrought to notice the odd meaningful note in his voice as he said, \"Anything?\" She nodded, vigorously. \"Anything-I'll have this castle set to rights and ready to receive a king within a few weeks, I'll say prayers for each of you-\" \"'Tis not prayers I want,\" he interrupted. Desperate to reach an agreement before he changes his mind, she said, \"Then, tell me what it is what you want?\" Implacably he stated, \"You.\" Jennifer's hand fell away from his tunic as he continued without emotion, \"I do not want you on your knees, I want you in my bed. Willingly.\" Her relief that he was willing to let Brenna leave was temporarily overwhelmed by blazing animosity at what he was demanding.  He was sacrificing nothing by releasing Brenna, for he would still have Jenny as a hostage, yet he was requiring that she sacrifice everything. In willingly surrendering her honor to him, she would become a harlot; a disgrace to herself, her family, and all she held dear.-Jennifer pleading to Royce to free her sister, Brenna, who fell ill at the castle.\"Do we have a bargain?\" he asked calmly. Jenny lifted her small chin, looking like a proud young queen who'd just been stabbed by someone she trusted. \"I was mistaken in you, my lord,\" she said bitterly. \"I credited you with honor when you said me nay two days ago-for you could have promised me what I asked for, taken what I offered, and then attacked Merrick anyway. Now I see 'twasn't honor, but arrogance. A barbarian has no honor.\" Even when she knew she was vanquished, she was splendid, Royce thought, suppressing an admiring smile as he looked into her stormy blue eyes. \"Is the bargain I offer you so loathsome?\" he asked quietly, putting his hands on her stiff arms. \"In truth, I have no need to bargain with you at all, Jennifer, and you know it. I could have taken you by force any time these past days.\" Jennifer knew that, and although her resentment remained, she had to fight against falling under the deep spell of his voice as he continued, \"I want you, and if that makes me a barbarian in your eyes, so be it, but it doesn't have to be that way. If you let me, I'll make it good between us. There'll be no shame nor pain for you in my bed,-except for the pain I must cause you the first time. After that, there will be only pleasure.\"\"Because I doubt your sister has paid enough heed to Hardin's defenses to tell your father anything. You, however,\" he added in a voice of amused irony, \"were calculating the thickness of its walls and counting my sentries as we rode across the drawbridge.\"\"You are mad!\" she snapped, her chest heaving.\"And you are a devil!\" \"And you, my dear,\" Royce imperturbably replied, \"are a bitch.\" With that, he turned to the horrified friar and unhesitatingly announced, \"The lady and I wish to be wed.\"\"I hate you,\" she said with deadly calm.\"A perfect basis for the perfect marriage,\" Royce said sarcastically.\"Your home,\" he interrupted, and to her complete confusion, he grinned suddenly. \"You have the bluest eyes on earth,\" he added with a low, appreciative chuckle. \"When you're angry, they're the color of wet blue velvet.\" Jenny rolled her eyes in disgust, momentarily pacified by his answer that this was her home. \"Wet velvet?\" she repeated wryly, wrinkling her nose. \"Wet velvet.\" His white teeth flashed in a devastating grin. \"No? What should I have said?\" His smile was irresistible, and Jenny fell in with his teasing mood, \"Well, you might have said they're the color of-\" she glanced at the large sapphire in the center of the crucifix\"-of sapphires, she provided.\"That has a nice ring to it.\" \"Ah, but sapphires are cold, and your eyes are warm and expressive. Am I doing better? he chuckled when she voiced no further argument to wet velvet. \"Much,\" she agrees readily. \"would you care to go on?\" \"Fetching for compliments? \"Certainly.\"His lips twitched with laughter. \"Very well. Your eyelashes remind me of sooty brooms.\" Jenny's mirth exploded in a peal of musical laughter. \"A broom!\" she chuckled merrily, shaking her head at him.  \"Exactly. And your skin is white and soft and smooth. It reminds me of....\" \"Yes?\" she prompted, chuckling. \"An egg.

Being a non-romance reader (my interest waned by the age of about 15 when I'd read all possible feisty wench/dangerous rogue scenarios), I can't be a fair judge of the book, but here is my review nevertheless. This book had some decent, at times funny dialog between 2 main characters, the bedroom scenes were fairly steamy without being graphic, but other than that, it was a typical historical romance novel with a very formulaic story line. You have a feisty smart heroine who is beautiful in an unconventional way. She gets kidnapped by an enemy clan headed by a fierce, dangerous but ultimately tender-hearted and loyal hero. The two gradually fall in love. The hero naturally takes the heroine's virginity, and she is too willing to give it up, even though they are not married and he is her enemy. At some point the 2 are forced to marry as it always is in romance novels. As they are married, there are still some circumstances that keep our couple apart from openly loving each other. (Don't ask me what circumstances, because the only thing I remember about them is that they were contrived.) These misunderstandings however don't stop them from making sweet love to each other. The story naturally ends with HEA, when all difficulties are resolved and a baby is born.The bottom line is, if you are a romance fan, I expect you will enjoy this book very much. If you are not, you can easily skip it."}, {"userName": "Jan130", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57282794-jan130", "userReview": "3.5 to 4 stars. It took me a little while to finish this reread of a book that was a fav for me when I first started out reading HRs, years ago. But times have changed, and HRs today have a different feel. It was interesting to find this one still stands up pretty well. I read this for the 2018 Romance Across The Ages challenge for the Historical Romance Book Club group on GR. January theme: Scottish. It was also a rare (for me) medieval read, being set in the late 1400s.Royce, Earl of Claymore, is an English warrior known as \"The Wolf'. Known for his prowess in battle, his fearsome reputation precedes him. Jennifer is the seventeen-year-old daughter of a Scottish noble. The enemy..... Jennifer and her younger half-sister Brenna are kidnapped by Royce's men, with the intention of using them for ransom or as leverage. Ironically, Jenny is reputed to be the 'plain one' of the two sisters, but now she is a woman and has come into her beauty. A sensual-looking redhead. Young, immature in some ways, certainly naive, and having no idea of her own beauty. But also clever, courageous, cunning, and incredibly loyal to her father and to Scotland. Let the adventure begin!This book is full of battles, castles, tournaments, feasts, knights in armour, ladies in beautiful medieval clothing, royal decrees etc etc. Lots of fun to read. Royce and Jenny fall in love fairly early on, but they are torn apart by various misunderstandings and events. A lot of it is related to Jenny's incredible loyalty to her father. She is torn between this, and her love of Royce, the 'enemy' Englishman. The reader is pretty quickly made aware that Jenny's loyalty is misplaced, as her father and stepbrothers are actually quite dastardly, and use Jenny for their own wicked ends with no care for her at all. But she is young and idealistic, and in a way you have to admire her actions, even when they are also incredibly frustrating. It's not till quite late in the book that the scales fall from Jennifer's eyes. The climactic scenes are dramatic and colourful. The ending is satisfying. As a reader, a certain amount of tolerance is required in regards to the character of Jenny. Although I wanted to roll my eyes a few times, I kept reminding myself, she is young, naive, and through no fault of her own has misplaced loyalties. Royce on the other hand is easier to like, in spite of some violent acts. He is a man of his times, and in fact a respected hero. He also has a tender (and sexy) side, which few apart from Jenny see. I loved the title of this book, and the moments in the book where it is referenced are very sweet. Overall, for a book first published in 1989, it still stands up surprisingly well."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "This is a fantastic medieval romance.

Unmoving, he watched her, noting that tears were pouring down her beautiful face as she slowly bent down. But instead of reaching for his lance or her dagger, she took his hand between both of hers and pressed her lips to it. Through his daze of pain and confusion, Royce finally understood that she was kneeling to him, and a groan tore from his chest: \"Darling,\" he said brokenly, tightening his hand, trying to make her stand, \"don't do this\u2026\"But his wife wouldn't listen. In front of seven thousand onlookers, Jennifer Merrick Westmoreland, countess of Rockbourn, knelt before her husband in a public act of humble obedience, her face pressed to his hand, her shoulders wrenched with violent sobs. By the time she finally arose, there could not have been many among the spectators who had not seen what she had done. Standing up, she stepped back, lifted her tear-streaked face to his, and squared her shoulders.Pride exploded in Royce's battered being\u2014because, somehow, she was managing to stand as proudly\u2014as defiantly\u2014as if she had just been knighted by a king.\u201d \n*Swoon*\nFor those of you who have already read this book, I want to say that when I got up to the part when Royce is on the field being challenged by the Merricks in the tournament (who are all asses by the way) I was actually clutching my heart and having heart palpitations. It was horribly, horribly frightening but bitterly beautiful, I couldn't help thinking that if Jennifer hadn't froze Royce out of her heart, Royce never would have been hurt like that. Then again, the battle scene was such a stunning climax that I could almost see it was all worth it in the end.A Kingdom of Dreams is the first book in the Westmoreland series. It's actually the prequel to Whitney, My Love and it tells the story of Royce Westmoreland and the proud Scottish beauty, Jennifer Merrick (yes, another proud heroine). Judith McNaught sets this novel in the 15th century which gives it a different sort of flavour to the usual historical romance novels which tend to be set in much later time periods. I loved it though. It was so far removed from the modern world, it made the story so much more captivating and dream-like. Sometimes I dream of living in world of knights and warriors and beautiful gowns.There's definitely not much to critique about this book. Although I would have loved to see a side story of Stefan and Brenna... That's probably asking too much, but still, there was so much potential! I also was hoping for a little more of Arik who seemed to be an intriguing mystery. Damn it would've been nice to learn more about the intriguing, abrupt giant.Although I can no longer say all of Judith McNaught's books are for sure five-star reads after reading Someone to Watch Over Me, I think I can still say that her historical romances are in a class of their own.Rate: 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "Review from July 31, 2009 A Kingdom of Dreams, by Judith McNaught, is probably my favorite love story of all times. Romance is not my preferred genre, but this book definitely has all the magical elements to make you believe in fairy tale love and a knight in shining armor. I love the two main characters of this novel, and when they meet, you become captivated by their fierce battle of wills and ultimately their undying love for each other. This story is filled with a perfect blend of romance, adventure, struggle and devotion.Jennifer Merrick is the daughter of a Scottish chieftain and is abducted from her convent school by her father\u2019s sworn enemy, Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore. Jennifer fights Royce at every turn in an effort to escape the clutches of her English enemy. As the story progresses, these two characters find themselves caught in a web of misguided lies deceit and betrayal. Despite these opposing forces, Royce and Jennifer develop an overwhelming love for each other wrapped with passion and loyalty that should never exist between enemies.Royce is the perfect chivalrous character that you can easily fall in love with. He\u2019s strong, loyal, fierce and brave. Jennifer is creatively developed as a proud, courageous and willful character that is the perfect opposition to Royce.

She's not so steel-spined that she's unrealistic, and I enjoyed being in her head for this storyline after I got over her annoying loyalty to a clan that didn't necessarily deserve it. The \"hero\" Royce was likable enough, even if I wanted to throttle him sometimes for his stubbornness. I enjoyed the small gang that accompanied everyone, from the brother-mother-drama to the loyal compadres standing by the side. Without the side characters, Kingdom of Dreams wouldn't have fared nearly as well.Instead of a simple let's mesh them together and mold them into a romantic couple, the storyline holds layers to keep it interesting and more complex than the norm. Besides family drama on the side of the hero, there is the background of cruelty Jennifer faced and why she ended up in this situation in the first place. Most historical romances stand above the rest if they have humor, which this one introduced through fun dialogue and banter between the mains and others. Sure there's some cheesy stuff, but the genuine chemistry between the two keeps the flames smoldering enough to overlook that. If you're a fan of Historical Romance, you should dig this once since it stays interesting through the storyline, holds up the pacing, has sarcastic and humorous main characters who feel genuine enough to carry their story, complimentary side characters, a castle (yays) and satisfying ending.Look forward to checking out more of this author."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7278451-maria", "userReview": "No g\u00e9nero de romance at\u00e9 gostei deste livro.
