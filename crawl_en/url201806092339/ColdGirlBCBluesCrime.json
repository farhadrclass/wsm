Greenaway is a strong mystery set in BC and revolves around an interesting group of RCMP officers. The book is this author\u2019s first and was the winner of the 2014 Arthur Ellis Unhanged award. It is a character driven crime mystery and the writing style is a little different, but once you get into the story it becomes smoother. The story starts with the disappearance of a rockabilly singer and brings together Detective Leith and Constable Dion. The two are extremely different in their styles, throw in the local law, the suspects and local characters, you have a plot that isn\u2019t high intensity, but very intriguing and keeps you reading.The characters are all very interesting. The area is described in a way that you always feel the cold and sense the ruggedness of the area. It was a well done ending that satisfied. A great start to a hopefully new series.Thanks to Dundurn and Net Galley for allowing me to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean", "userReview": "First of all, I want to express my thanks to R.M. Greenway, Dundurn Publishing, and NetGalley for providing me with a digital copy of Cold Girl: A BC Blues crime novel in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.A popular young singer goes missing in the Hazelton Mountains in northwest British Columbia. The RCMP, led by investigator Dave Leith, must contend with cold, wet, snowy conditions and a small town police force headed by Renee, Giroux, a strong-willed sergeant. To complicate matters even further, a young constable named Dion on the mend from a devastating accident is assigned to the case as well, and he seems to get in his own way, not to mention mucking up his simple assignments on the investigation.This scenario seemed to have all the makings of a fascinating plot, and I did find myself drawn in. As time goes on, it becomes less likely, of course, that the missing woman, Kiera, will be found alive. Will she be found at all? Her boyfriend, fellow Fling band member Frank Law, his brothers, other band members, their agent, and townsfolk are all questioned. Someone is lying. Who? Was this a crime of passion, or was it pre-meditated murder?This is a police procedural, and it\u2019s confusing at times as the RCMP and the local cops seem to have different ideas about how to go about the investigation. Giroux knows \u201cher\u201d people; Leith sometimes lacks confidence in how to approach witnesses he brings in for questioning. Then there\u2019s Constable Dion. For most of the story, fellow officers are unaware of his background and simply think of him as a doofus. He\u2019s referred to several times as \u201cDudley Do-right.\u201d I got the idea that this assignment was supposed to be a test to see if he was ready to go back to his position as a homicide detective, and there are some indications that he has the instincts, but man, oh man, he also makes some mistakes that had me scratching my head, wondering what his superior was thinking assigning him to this job. Dion seems willing to take on menial tasks, but he often goes off on a tangent, and then he\u2019s like a loose cannon. Dion, there is no \u201cI\u201d in \u201cteam.\u201dIf you like a whodunit filled with lies and half-truths, you just might really love Cold Girl. It kept me guessing, that\u2019s for sure. It was a little too long in that some of the details just didn\u2019t pan out, and not all of them were red herrings. At the same time, I wanted to know more about some of the characters, particularly Dion. His part of the story jumped around too much for me, and then\u2026well, no spoiler from me. Granted, there are too many instances in the real world where there are loose ends, but I found the finale of this one rather unsatisfactory. It\u2019s not exactly unsolved, but it felt like a letdown all the same.Despite the things that bothered me about this book, I think that Ms. Greenway shows much promise as a writer, and I do think that this could be a very readable series. Her career is off to a worthy start with Cold Girl: A BC Blues crime novel, which will be published March 26, 2016.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Being from a law enforcement family, I know that not all crime stories I read are going to be anywhere near how an investigation is conducted. This one was almost too much for me.The lead singer of a musical group goes missing. There is some talk of a serial killer loose in the area, so cops from all over the region congregate on this small town where she vanished.Constable Dion is one such cop. He used to be a homicide detective but a car crash, in which his partner was killed, left him brain damaged. Now, here is where I lost any sense of realness. The man cannot remember things. He has a notebook where he keeps descriptions and names of the people he works with... because he doesn't seem to retain information. He even has a video to show him how to tie a tie. Now here is where I shook my head ... even though he's downgraded from detective, he's still a gun-toting cop.There are lots of suspects, but everyone is lying to cover someone else ..even if it had nothing to do with the missing singer.The premise wasn't bad but the characters just left me ... cold. There were so many suspects telling different stories at different times. It became very confusing and hard to follow. Not one of my favorite reads. 3 Stars.My thanks to the author / Dundurn Publishing / NetGalley who furnished a digital copy in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

Blog Rating: 4.5/5Plot/Story:Cold Girl is one of those books that you can either love or hate. And for me, fortunately, it's the first one. I really enjoyed the story and relished the way it ended. The plot is not only outright gripping but quite unique as well but in its own subtle way. Cold Girl has a character driven plotline and the author successfully pulls it off. The plot line is simple enough, but the twists and the turns scattered throughout the book makes it a fairly complicated one but in a good way.The writing is a little different, which took me a fair amount of time to get used to, but by the end I got the hang of it. The story flowed well and the pace of the story was also good. But, in spite of everything being great, I thought that the book was exceptionally lengthy. In my opinion, it can be reduced to 3/4th of its length and still have the same impact. This little fact bugged me to no end because it was a really, really time-consuming read.So, if you have enough time on your hands, then go ahead and read Cold Girl, as it's a superb detective fiction.Characters:As I just said Cold Girl is a character-driven book and the author has managed to create something that I call as \"awesomeness.\" The main characters, Leith and Dion, are the life of this book and I can still picture them moving around and doing stuff in their daily lives - that's how powerful the characterization in this book is. I was totally able to connect with them and the bond that formed is a really strong one.When we have two male leads who hate each other there is bound to a favorite. Mine is Dion. His vulnerability is what draws me to him and I'm sure in the coming books he'll emerge as a really strong lead, even more than Leith.The other characters such as the Law brothers, other constables and DCs, the victims and the suspects, each and everyone had a unique personality and surprisingly I was able to relate to them all. Full marks for characterization!Romance/Kills:There is no romance as such, but a major part of the investigation revolves around the relationship of the deceased and the suspect. There is also a considerable number of killings prior to the main case which involves a serial killer. It serves as a great diversion initially and later on connects beautifully to the case-at-hand.Writing:The writing in this book is a little different than what I'm normally used to. Some of the sentences felt a little awkward at times but later I realized that it had more to do with the author's style of writing than glitches. Fortunately, after reading half of the book I found myself getting used to it.Having said that I would have definitely enjoyed the book more if the editor had straightened out those awkward sentences and made them a little less painful to read.Still, I enjoyed the book and the amazing characterization totally made up for whatever problems I had with the writing in the first half of the book.Beginning:The book started off perfectly well with an intriguing prologue and then continued on a high note that kept me engaged the entire time. I enjoyed the detailed insight into the police procedurals and enjoyed the overall suspense that kept on building till the end.Ending:The ending of the book was perfect considering that it's a part of a series. In fact, I'm really looking forward to how things are going to shape up in the next part. The mystery also ended well. A classic example of a simple situation going out of hands.Blurb:The blurb is apt and gives a really clear idea about what to expect from the book. If I had come across this book in a bookstore then I would have definitely grabbed it after reading the blurb.Cover Art:The cover art is good but not excellent. It could have a been a lot better.You can also read this review at \nThe Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Krystin Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15477771-krystin-rachel", "userReview": "It wasn't terrible. But it wasn't great. It was just the most okayest crime novel. Still, I guess that leaves room for improvement with the next one. *Disclaimer: Extra points have been awarded because of my bias towards anything Canadian. The overall concept was good. A former star in the RCMP, Constable Dion, was in a terrible car accident that killed his partner and left him recovering from brain damage. After recovery, his memory is shoddy, his sense of direction is for crap, he has some anger issues and has pushed away everyone he loves making him miserable to be around. All he really wants for his life is to get back to the job he loves. So the RCMP decides to test drive him, so to speak, to see how (and if) he can still be a cop after everything that's happened (I'm ignoring how unlikely that would be.) So, they send him to Buttfuck Nowhere, B.C., the cold and wet Canadian Northwest, to help investigate the disappearance of a local music celebrity. Also on the case is Det. Leith, who has been tracking a serial killer for so long, the open cases haunt him. He thinks there could be a connection between the missing musician and the other victims he's been trying to find justice for so he leaves his wife and baby at home to join the hunt. Leith, unaware of Dion's background, locks horns with Dion as they work together. He, and the rest of the department, basically just think he's an idiot. (And honestly, what cop wouldn't? Like, just tell people you're recovering from a head injury. I didn't understand why this had to be kept a secret, but I digress...) So to recap, the concept = thumbs up. The setting = decent. The execution = not so much. This needed to be edited down desperately. Sentence structure and description was brutal to read through. It seemed to be a case of the first time authors' curse - the need to over explain everything - combined with a lack of efficient writing. The things that didn't matter to the story needed to be cut completely. And everything else needed to be tightened up. The author seemed to have a habit of writing too heavy handed about the things that didn't matter, and being too discreet and subtle about the things that did. I was beat over the head with the details of action and scenery, but when it came to things like a character getting shot, considering suicide or finding a dead body, I literally did not know how we got from point A to point B. I found myself saying, Wait,what? a number of times. Personal story lines were treated the same - I could have cared about Constable Dion, but it took too long to divulge his history. It wasn't until 70% through the book that the thing I read at 20% resonated with me like, \"oh I guess that stupid watch did have meaning.\" The overtones of important plot devices needed work. Plot milestones needed to be rethought in order to keep the story moving, instead of feeling stagnant and repetitive. And to say it was lacking tension and suspense would be an understatement. Overall it was too long and too confusing. With better editing most of these things could have been fixed, creating something a little more enjoyable to read that would take less than the 3 weeks it took me. (3 weeks is just ridiculous for me!) There were a lot of red herrings and lot of suspects with a lot of lies to tell, but at some point it just became overwrought. I couldn't keep track of every alibi, every lie, every story or every character - leaving me more frustrated then interested in what the outcome was. The serial killer story line was wrapped up too nonchalantly and too quickly. Det. Leith had been hunting this guy for more than a year of his life and it's treated like an afterthought halfway through the book with Leith showing no real emotion about it. Missed character development oppurtunity #1000. I really felt the serial killer should have been the point of the story, instead of a vehicle to find one missing singer. Because it's not like that led to anything profound or anything shocking. It was all rather ho-hum. A serial killer could have added a much needed punch of spice. There were things thrown in that open the story up for a sequel, obviously with Dion and Leith working together again. But in order to make it a worthwhile read, Greenaway needs to work on her character development, the art of overtones and suspense, and how to create a mystery that doesn't become frustrating to follow along with. 2.5 stars. *I was given a copy of this novel by Dundurn Press through NetGalley*"}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is an absorbing multilayered murder mystery. It begins with a Constable Dion spotting a stalker following a native girl at a Fling concert. He fails to catch up with the stalker or the girl and feels guilt. Leith, another copper, is called into a small community where there is missing girl, where there is some evidence to suggest connections with the pick up truck serial murderer. Keira, the lead singer in the group Fling, went missing after leaving her boyfriend Frank's home. Other cops like Bosko and Constable Dion join local law enforcement people to track down what happened. There is great character development and complexity within all the individuals. No-one is as they seem, not the outsiders who come to investigate, and not the members of the band, their promoter and not the community. Secrets and rumours abound. Leith proves to be a doggedly determined cop willing to follow all leads.The landscape and location proves to be a major part of the story.

This book takes place during the brutal winter in northern British Columbia along the Skeena river, centered in the town of Hazelton. I recently rode the Skeena train from Prince George to Prince Rupert, which is why this book interested me. Two policemen are the central characters in this book, Detective David Leith and RCMP Constable Cal Dion. Dion was a detective but has been demoted after an accident that killed his partner and left him seriously injured. They are on the trail of a serial killer, but they don't get along. The book is a solid police procedural, showing how a whole team of police officers pursue leads in a slow tedious process. I did not know for sure how it would end. I read it in two days, finding that I could not put it down once I was half way through.This is book 1 in a promising new series.

M. Greenaway introduces us to two detectives with the RCMP in Northern BC, Cal Dion and Dave Leith. Greenaway does a fantastic job of setting up not only the antagonism that develops between these two officers, but also the competitiveness that arises between many of the officers involved in hunting down a serial killer. Cal Dion has returned to work after a year\u2019s sick leave and attempts to hide the fact that he had a pretty stellar ten year career prior to sustaining a traumatic brain injury in a car crash. He desperately tries to develop coping strategies and fails more often than not. His colleagues also fail to understand what he\u2019s going through and mostly react negatively to his behaviour. When another girl goes missing, Dion and Leith are drawn into each other\u2019s lives as they seek to uncover why this popular member of a local folk/rock band has seemingly walked away. Intrigues between the band\u2019s circle of friends, the locals and the police officers cause mis-steps in both the cases. Greenaway\u2019s depiction of quirky small town Northern BC together with the effect of a long winter is excellent. I would have given the book 5 stars but for me, Dion and Leith were just too moody to really empathize with."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24770184-sandy", "userReview": "This police procedural set in northern BC tells the story of 2 RCMP officers involved in the search for a serial killer.Cal Dion used to be a highly regarded detective in Vancouver. That was before the accident that left him with a scrambled brain & a dead partner. Now he's starting over in Smithers, quietly hiding the extent of his disability.David Leith is a detective in Prince Rupert who's spent the last 2 years tracking the \"Pickup Killer\". Leads have been hard to come by & the case is in danger of going cold. Then a young, well known singer named Kiera goes missing from a small town in northern BC.Dion & Leith are among the team sent to assist Renee Giroux, the no nonsense head of the local RCMP detachment. Along for the ride is Mike Bosko, a high flying cop from the big city. Somehow he insinuated himself into the investigation but no one is sure why.The rest of the cast is composed of local residents & friends of the missing woman. And while they want Kiera found, many are strangely reluctant to cooperate & getting straight answers is like pulling teeth.The search for Kiera takes up the bulk of the book. But it's also the story of 2 very different men forced to work together in a tense, claustrophobic environment. They alternate as narrators so the reader is privy to their theories & thoughts. Leith is a cop's cop, determined to find the truth. He's been mostly happy in Prince Rupert but every now & then he wonders what it would be like to join the special crimes units in Vancouver. He's unaware of Dion's background & quickly labels him a \"dumbass rookie\" after multiple errors. And he's not the only one.Dion's traumatic brain injury has left him with a spotty memory & cognitive gaps. Reading & writing clearly is difficult & he often loses time. Unfortunately, he does remember what it was like to be an effective & respected detective & this adds to his mounting frustration. Despite the time we spend in his head, there's an ambiguity to Dion's character & the feeling we're not getting the whole story. But you can't help but empathize as he struggles while colleagues quickly write him off as a screw-up.The strong sense of place turns the setting into another character. Rugged landscapes & weather conditions frequently affect the actions of all the players. It lends the story a dark & moody atmosphere that adds to the tension as the plot progresses.Several surprising twists & misdirection are employed to keep us guessing right up to he conclusion. Even then, not everything is tied up with a neat bow & some questions remain unanswered. This is not a flashy thriller. It's a subtle thinking man's mystery & you have to pay attention to dialogue. I particularly enjoyed following Dion. His enigmatic character is a perfect foil for the straightforward Leith & there's huge potential for the future of their relationship.By the end, the case is resolved & both cops are safely back in their respective precincts. But it's clear there are some changes in store & you get the feeling their paths will cross again."}, {"userName": "Marjolein", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein", "userReview": "3.5 Stars  Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com  A coming singer goes missing.

It features RCMP Detectives Leith and Dion, two lead characters who hate each other and are the driving force in this story. It is also the story of Dion\u2019s struggle to recuperate from an accident, a car crash that has left him a stranger in his own body. Told from the point of views of several characters based on what is going on at the moment, this character driving mystery populated with many players can be a challenge to keep track of. Unfortunately, most characters left me ice cold, I was distracted by Dion\u2019s condition and wondered throughout this drama why would an unhealthy RCMP officer be on the job not fully rehabilitated and working in snowbound Hazeltons. The plot line is simple enough but the action is so scattered I admit to have needed a fair amount of concentration to keep up with all that was going on and stay with it. Indeed, the style is a little different and quite unique and the scenario had all the attributes to make it fascinating. I was drawn to the story at first but it soon became confusing and brutal to read through. Frivolities should have been edited or simply cut out, too much said about food and office chit-chat making one of those exceptionally lengthy books. Cutting the nonsense would have made everything less heavy and kept the story moving at a good pace.

David Leith is a dogged detective who has been tracking a serial killer labeled the \"Pickup Killer\" for the last couple of years. Cal Dion suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car crash ending his promising career as a detective in Vancouver. His cognitive abilities still fairly limited, he is now starting over but is keeping his past a secret. Don't ask me why I still don't understand that bit.Cold Girl is a character driven police procedural with a whodunit mystery that is a little slow to unfold. There is a lot of emphasis on the icy locale, the grim atmosphere, the locals and their way of living. I found it quite interesting, but it felt overly long. I couldn't really warm up to any of the characters either. The most exciting one was Dion because of his unique set of circumstances. But then I felt I didn't really get him. On the one hand, he has terrible short-term memory, he also needs to be reminded of how to tie a tie (something from his long-term memory) and then, on the other hand, he is able to remember precise details of events that happened months ago. It was all a bit conflicting. When the mystery was finally revealed it felt a bit anticlimactic, and finally right at the end, there were a couple of details mentioned about Dion that really confused me.

Greenaway is definitely a story a read will either love or hate as the writing style is very unique and something you need to get used to. I put this title ahead of others as I noticed it was going to be archived well in advance of it publication date. What I enjoyed most in reading this title is the plot twists and turns that flowed throughout the book. The author did an amazing job with creating them and kept me engaged and fascinated to the very end.As this story is very character driven I given this title 5 stars for creating such interesting characters that were fun to read. There are 2 main characters Leith and Dion and they are so well developed and realistic with their own problems. The rest of the characters are also very well done and bring a lot to the storyline. As Leith and Dion form a working hate relationship in trying to solve the mystery they are both there to help solve, I found myself liking Dion more. Dion is a young man that was severely injured in an accident that killed his partner and left him with brain trauma. He is back to a limited work detail and struggles with his memory throughout his day. As I said in my opening the writing style is very different and I will admit to having issues in the beginning as the flow seemed so awkward. I was about halfway through the book before I could follow the flow of the story with more ease. I do feel, however, that the author should rework some of the awkward sentences to improve the flow so it will be less confusing.The beginning of the story started with a prologue and caught my interest and though the sentences were awkward kept me interested in continuing to the first chapter.The ending was very well done and left just enough of a question as to what will happen in the next book of this series to make you want to read it.Overall, I truly enjoyed reading \u201cCold Girl\u201d and looking forward to reading the next book in this series. \u201cCold Girl\u201d is Greenaway\u2019s first novel and though I found the sentence structure awkward this author shows so much skill in crafting an interesting and engaging story full of memorable characters.

This is the kind of place that attracts and/or creates oddballs and loners, people with secrets.When a promising young singer disappears from a band rehearsal, there are so many suspects that the RCMP have to weed out their stories just to narrow the search. The police officers themselves are a mixed bag of issues. One is a dissatisfied inspector brought in from a nearby city who longs for bigger things. Another is a snarky female officer who cannot separate her emotional life from her interactions with others. The third interesting one is a veteran recovering from a serious brain injury who has been transferred north as a test of his ability to work again. This last character, Calvin Dion, is the most interesting, as he struggles with basic tasks such as writing and concentrating on conversations, but has an instinctive ability to sense subconscious signals from other people. The solution to the crime was poignant and disturbing, and brutal in its own way. What a tragic waste. I found the ending so very sad, based as it must be on the real life tragedy of the Highway of Tears. If only the real story could find a resolution. I liked so much about this book. I'm really looking forward to her next one."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "I have many thoughts about this one. The first thing that comes to mind is that it seemed to have been longer than necessary. The second is that I felt for that Dion guy. He should not have been out there that soon. His co-workers should have been notified of his disability. Third, I should have put it down and went on to the next book. It was definitely too long and monotonous. I definitely did not need to know what they ate at every meal. \"Ate breakfast\" would have sufficed for me.

At first, it was Enid Blyton and her The Famous Five, Russian author Ekaterina Vilmont and her stories about Dasha and her friends, Carolyn Keen\u0443 and her Nancy Drew. I had so much fun reading the books and trying to solve the cases with the main characters.When I was 7 years old I decided that it was time to read something more serious \u2013 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, James Hadley Chase, Arthur Hailey, Rex Stout, Georges Simenon and many others. These cases were way harder to solve, but once in a while I guessed who the killer was before the main character did it.Nowadays it is getting harder and harder to find some good mystery to read. Last year I found Louise Phillips \u2013 a very talented author from Dublin \u2013 and her crime thrillers about a criminal psychologist Dr. Kate Pearson. I devoured her books in one sitting \u2013 they had everything that a good mystery needs.This year \u2013 thanks to NetGalley and Dundurn publishing \u2013 I have found RM Greenaway and her Cold Girl. I shall be honest with you \u2013 I wanted to stop reading this book after the second or third chapter. One of the main characters \u2013 David Leith \u2013 made me angry. Right from the beginning he started to whine. Everything irritated him: snow, his wife and their daughter, his work. I wondered, why was he just complaining and didn\u2019t do anything to change the situation. I put the book aside for a few days. In that few days something happened that made me understood David Leith and all his complaints \u2013 we\u2019re all like him. There are not many people in the world that are satisfied with everything in their lives. You can\u2019t be happy when everything is good, having ups and downs in our lives that makes us happy.Another main character of the book is Constable Dion. He used to be a homicide detective but a car crash, in which his partner was killed, left him brain damaged. He can\u2019t remember things. He is unstable and dangerous for everyone, especially for himself. You can\u2019t help but empathize with how he struggles to return to his previous self. He remembers what it was to be a good detective with the promising future, and he wants it back even though he is hiding something that will destroy him completely.You can\u2019t tell that this book has the happy ending, but the case (i.e. two cases) is closed, both Leith and Dion has some perspectives in their lives and it makes me wait for the second book. I hope that there WILL BE the second where we can find more about Constable Dion\u2019s past."}, {"userName": "Diana Francis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1150123-diana-francis", "userReview": "Received from NetgalleyI just finished R.M. Greenaway's Cold Girl. This is a mystery and a police procedural. It revolves around a disappearance--what happened to the pretty singer of a local up-and-coming Canadian band? The main characters are Constable Dion, who has survived a terrible car crash and a year later, is still not able to think the way he once did. Once a hot-shot detective, he's now relegated to the backwaters of Canada doing scut work. The other main character is Leith, a detective who has been pursuing a particular serial killer and thinks that maybe this case is related.What unfolds is a picture of a place--the cold remote back country of Canada where people eke out a living. It's isolated and unrelenting and oh, so cold. In this tiny town, there are too many suspects. Pinning down motives and who did what and when is a difficult task. Worse, Dion has a terrible time articulating himself and he begins to perceive patterns and clues, but his memory and mind won't work properly. He's frustrated. Everybody is frustrated with him. He's hidden his past, not wanting pity, so everyone sees him as inept at best, incompetent at worst. He quickly finds himself at odds with the other local law enforcement cold girlofficers and scrutinized by his higher-ups.Leith is feeling burned out, angry, and left behind. Even when he solves one major mystery, he's left with more piling up. He's not sure he's happy in his marriage or his job, and he's not sure what he wants or where he wants to be. But soon, the missing girl becomes important to him and he finds it imperative that he solves the case.At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this book. Neither Dion nor Leith are particularly likable. But they are fascinating. And watching Dion both fall apart and pull himself together at the same time is agonizing and yet I kept hoping for him. The mystery was somewhat slow to unfold, but then, while this book is about the whodunnit, it's more about the characters searching and the place and the local world.The mysteries (they build as you go) are tied up and a satisfying way. Less so are the characters. The ending is slightly muddy for me and I wish it was a little clearer. Two small things are dropped in and I just don't know quite what to make of them. Also, a lot is made of Dion looking native, and yet nothing comes of it. I kept waiting for it to matter.I do think this is a really good book and I enjoyed it.
