Nothing to do? Have you a cold beer and a double banana moon pie. Slip your pistol under the seat, roll the window down and cruise through a hot Mississippi night in your dented pick-up.Ants, bees, the bugs of summer, keyed-up guard dogs, coons, snakes, are all characters as vivid as the humans in this beautifully written novel. The major characters are inanimate: liquor and firearms.Rambunctiousness is one thing, pure evil another.There is a caste-system in this country. Those that have no vehicle are on the bottom rung, invisible. You get a view here of destitution so extreme that one family shown here has dropped through a crack and they live in another ( non driving ) dimension.the view from a bench seat at 60 miles an hour is quite different from a muddy high-way shoulder among discarded beer cans miles from nothing.All the men in this novel drink heavily even as they simultaneously piss it out the other end. Joe digs out a bullet from his own biceps, puts band-aids on his 4 bullet wounds, then goes out gambling. I have to admire that optimism.The soul of this novel is the growing relationship between Joe, a 44 year old seasoned, hard working, hard fighting, hard drinking man who has seen the inside of the slammer more than once and Gary, a 15 year old painfully innocent and honest boy intent on improving his situation, who has never seen a toothbrush.Sometimes it seemed that the boy didn't know a lot of things a boy his age should know. They'd been driving by the Rock Ridge Colored Church one day back in the spring and the boy had asked him who lived in that big white house.I enjoyed the peripherals: the war veteran John Coleman and his gas station and general store, his itchy scalp where the shrapnel still lies and his unspoken desire to have had children.You might think these walking wounded are out looking for a war to fight. They might fight each other over various grievances or money but I don't think they fight out of boredom or for no reason.They reach their potential when they take on evil in the form of a selfish greedy snake-like daddy that shoplifts, murders, steals food from the mouths of his family, stinks like dead chickens and abuses children.Like you another beer?"}, {"userName": "Horace Derwent", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent", "userReview": "Yes, Larry Brown at his best, and the best book of 1991(awarded by Publisher's Weekly and National Book Association)The author no more told us a simple story about simple people with a matter of how good defeats evilThat man and that boy, them meets at a cross-road somewhere in Deep South.

Everything serves the bottle, every penny earned from Gary's sweat and toil to serve his bottle, the family to starve and drift so that his bottle be served. This man has no limits to what he would do to see the emptying of a bottle, he is the real bad guy of the tale, the wicked heart.The main character Gary, is what has you in the story.The author has you wanting to know of what his becoming will be and hooked in the narrative.The great writing has you immersed in the momentum and has you seeing great words in motion, scenes unfolding like you are there in visceral pace at times.This my first to read of Larry Brown\u2019s and did so now due to the movie adaption, that was longer than i had planned considering Frank Bill\u2019s recommendation to this novel back when i hosted in an interview with him here>>http://more2read.com/review/interview-with-frank-billLarry Brown in my mind can be considered a writer up there with writers who have crafted memorable and likeable southern characters like that of the great William Faulkner and the living Cormac McCarthy, alongside writers like Daniel Woodrell, Frank Bill, Donald Ray Pollock, and many others.Some excerpts that show you his skill.\u201cIt was that part of the evening when the sun has gone but daylight still remains. the whippoorwills called to each other and moved about, and the choir of frogs had assembled in the ditches to sing their melancholy songs. bats scurried overhead, swift and gone in the gathering dusk. the boy didn\u2019t know where he and his family were, other than one name: Mississippi. \u201d\u2018Late that night the rain fell thinly in the streets around the square, slashes of water streaming diagonally in the air above the wet sidewalks. passing cars sprayed it up from their wheels, and the blooming taillights spread a weak red glow across the pavement as the hum of their engines quietly receded into a night no lonelier than any other. The stained marble solider raised in tribute to a long dead and vanquished army went on with his charge, the tip of his bayonet broken off by tree primers, his epaulets covered with pigeon droppings. Easing up to the square in uncertain caution came a junk mobile, replete with inner-tube strips hung from the bumpers and decals on the fenders and wired dogs\u2019 heads wagging on the back shelf, the windows rolled tightly on the skull-bursting music screaming to be loosed from within. Untagged, un-inspected, unmuffled, its gutted iron bowels hung low and scraped upon the street, un-pinioned at last by rusty coat hangers, a dying shower of sparks flowing in brilliant orange bits. No tail-lights glimmered from this derelict vehicle, no red flash of brakes as it pulled to a stop. It inched forward in jerks, low on transmission fluid. the old man watched these things. later that night he was thrown in jail.\"The movie was not able to capture what Joe was feeling in this moment.\"As she put it in a drawer under the counter, the Doberman (in the movie an Alsatian) walked out of the hall and stood looking at him. Coal black, a chain of silver, sleek and lithely muscled, and the lips lifting ever so slowly from the white teeth that lined his mouth. The dog hate him, had always hated him, ever since he was a puppy. He wished for the pistol under the seat with a slight chilling of his blood and felt that something that hated so strongly for so little ought not be allowed to hate anymore. The dog stood ravenous and slobbering on the bright yellow linoleum, the flanks tense and the brown eyes not blinking. Joe looked into the animal\u2019s eyes and the eyes looked back with a deep and yearning hatred.\""}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "You might be a redneck if you read this novel, and you feel as though you\u2019ve met a few of your kin.

It is a dark, violent, painful book centered on poor, white, trailer-dwelling people in contemporary, rural Mississippi. One of the main characters, Gary, is fifteen years old and has to be taught how to brush his teeth by a whore who has been bought for him by Joe, other main character, who makes a living by driving a team of black men to poison first growth scrub trees in isolated woods. Joe drinks whiskey for breakfast, chain smokes, keeps a gun beneath the front seat of his pick up, gets in fist fights with police officers on a regular basis, has spent three years in a penitentiary, and becomes the only caring adult in Gary\u2019s young life. Gary has never been to school, does not know how to read, has wandered with his family across the poorest states of the south picking crops, while losing three siblings to careless death or even more careless abandonment. Gary\u2019s father beats him regularly, takes whatever money Gary is able to make, and ends by selling his own daughter to two men for $30 each. Taken together, the characters make Faulkner\u2019s Snopes family look like the Cleavers, and I would understand if readers pulled away from the book after 20 or 30 pages simply because the stench and the naked, ragged lives of the people Brown shows us are almost too much to bear. And yet. There is an austere dignity, na\u00efve courage, and a shy tenderness about the relationship between Joe and Gary. Though we would be sorely tempted to turn away from them if we met them in real life, Brown makes us turn toward them, with a language like raw blues and a sympathy that makes them something much more than wrong. We find parts of ourselves in them, despite our best efforts to deny it, and the experience of identifying with characters so alien to us may be the most powerful effect a story can provide. There are traces of Faulkner and Jim Harrison and Cormac McCarthy here, and the brutal naturalism of the landscape would make Frank Norris and Stephen Crane sit up and take notice. It wasn\u2019t an easy or comfortable read, but it\u2019s not one I\u2019m likely to forget."}, {"userName": "Robert Blumenthal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10110896-robert-blumenthal", "userReview": "This is a book of Southern literature. I have seen many comparisons between this author and William Faulkner. I have read but a short story of Faulkner's, so I am not that aware of his writing. This book is a gritty, character-driven story of an alcoholic ex-con and the 15-year old boy he somewhat takes under his wing. The boy is living with a total bastard of a father, also an alcoholic, along with his mother and two sisters in a decrepit, abandoned shack in the woods of Mississippi. He meets Joe by convincing him to give him a job, showing himself to be a hard worker and responsible individual, amazing considering where he came from.What makes this book so fascinating to me is the central character Joe. He is both a unapologetic drunk, somewhat violent with very little tolerance for the law. And yet, there is a side to him that is about as good as a person can be. His concern for the boy and his family, as well as the rest of his workers, is beyond reproach. And he has a basic moral code that he sticks very closely to, even if it involves murder and assault. The author clearly distinguishes between a good murder and a bad one. To sum him up, his ex-wife has a deep seated love and respect for him, but she surely cannot live with him.There's not a compelling plot, though there are some exciting moments. It is more of a character study, most of them being crusty, rural southerners. There's a lot of drinking, gambling, uncommitted sexual encounters. And yet there is a real sense of right and wrong and distinguishing between the two."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "I thought this was good, but not as good as Father and Son.Brown is/was a talented writer, whose strength seems to be in the simplicity of his language and the powerful images his writing elicits in the reader's mind. It just goes to show, a really good writer can throw away his thesaurus and still create beautiful and literary prose.Brown is also a master at creating a subtle sense of tension and feeling of hopelessness, which is a hallmark of Southern Gothic Fiction...the life sucks and then you die view of the world. I think what draws fans of the genre, though, is the knowledge that life sucks a lot more for some than others. There's something sobering and, at times, strangely satisfying about confronting just how unfair and cruel life can be.Would recommend this to fans of the genre.

I see his flaws (though they be of the sort I wish I could cultivate in my own work) and I don't mindthat the descriptions are sometimes overlong, the sentiment sometimes just a tad old fashioned. This was a writer with a heart as huge as the world. His authority to tell it like he sees it, and hang the consequences, makes for the cleanest and most heart rending prose I can think of. I get lost in his realities of poor, country people, drunks and laborers, the small town, woodsy characters who have all of mankind's quirks and depths, even when they don't have a clue about how to live their lives.

OMG, my admiration for the man is boundless. He is lost to us at far too young an age, but his books remain, and if I do not suffer a similar fate, I will read them all before I pass.There are a number of very good reviews of JOE available and maybe I will add my superfluous effort to them in the future, but time does not permit now. I can only say, if you've read JOE and did not find it exceptional, you probably needn't bother with anything else I have to say . . . EVER.

In a rural Mississippi town men drive old pickup trucks drinking warm beer and whiskey while chain smoking. Coons, wasps nests, opossums, copperheads and bugs are in abundance. The air is hot and there is little relief from the glaring sun. The story centers around the unlikely friendship between Joe and Gary, but the character who really caught my attention was Gary\u2019s father Wade who is probably the most vile and disgusting man I have read in some time. There is not one ounce of good inside of him and he is rotten to the core. I felt Larry Brown did a wonderful job bringing this character to life in all his non glory.

Challenging, not in the difficulty of its prose, but in the stark reality portrayed by its elegantly simple prose. Excruciatingly painful to see how hard some people strive to do right and how effortlessly other people slip into total depravity. Also poignantly portrays people's perceived powerlessness to alter what appears to be their pre-ordained path.

One point deducted, credit given for flawless spare style.  Reading this, some of the better parts were the descriptions that would appeal to anyone with some rural background. The rich earth smell of dirt turned behind a plow. The surprising amount of powder dry dust that collects in a house abandoned for fifty years. A teaming wasps nest in a sun baked attic. There are hundreds of those experiences both good and bad that will take you to the country. Grifter families and the dirt poor. A few in this book lived better than just surviving. Joe exhibited admirable traits with his inclination to help and foster the less fortunate that cross his path. And Joe, unlike many in Southern literature holds a job. While I enjoyed riding with Joe, working hard by day, drinking hard both day and night, and generally being an easy target for local law enforcement, I kept looking for anything to shock me, to move me, or to lead me to hope for real change. Joe makes me uncomfortable, he is my neighbor, or my cousin, and Brown made him a little too real. Oh, and I guess Joe never heard that alcohol is a depressant. So slip me some self-deprecating humor, make me laugh or make me cry, disgust me maybe, but please don't wake me for another hungover day working to barely survive.

If you haven't read any of Brown's work, Joe is a great place to start. Depressing as hell, sure, but, like a great sad song (Mark Lanegan, anyone?), tanscendently moving, indelibly affecting and ultimately uplifing through the sheer power of artful storytelling.

Who is Joe? Joe Ransom is a 43 yr old good ol boy who lives and works just south of Oxford, MS. He drinks, gambles and chases women but he also works, he makes his own way in the world. Joe is not gonna have a 401(k) or a health care plan, and he's not gonna be in church on Sunday morning. He makes a little extra money gambling and he's a bookie or collects for one. He also does contract work for Weyerhaeuser by \"deadnin timber.\" He and his work crew poison and kill unwanted trees and replace same with pine sprouts. (I assume it's legal.) Joe starts early in the morning (4:30am) with coffee (maybe a little whiskey too) and is on the phone first thing trying to round up his workers. Joe did about two yrs in the state pen for assault and is recently divorced. He still cares much for his ex. He keeps iced-down beer in a cooler in his truck and a bottle of whiskey and a .25 cal. pistol under his front seat. Joe is one of these guys with tons of energy and pretty much works/plays nonstop. He is the kind of man you find in small towns all across America, not just Mississippi. On the other hand, we have Wade Jones, a complete reprobate who drifts from state to state with his family (wife and three children). They find and squat in an old and abandoned cabin near where Joe is working. Wade's 15-16 yr old son, Gary, wants to work and he gets a job with Joe's crew. A friendship develops between Joe and Gary. There are a lot of interesting and entertaining scenes woven into the story. There is a real nice old man (Coleman, a WW II vet full of shrapnel) who runs the general store where the work crews, the Wade family and others re-supply with vienna sausages, sardines, crackers, moon-pies, Coca-Cola and Old Milwaukee. One of the most enjoyable things about the book is the HUMOR. One of Joe's buddies has his boat about 3/4 full of empty beer cans, Joe's gambling buddies (3 brothers) are clueless on how to dress out a deer, Joe gets into a gunfight early on with some fool (like the Wild West), Joe's dog (named just \"dog\") has an encounter with a Doberman at a sleazy whorehouse and on and on. Warning: You will not like Wade Jones, a Bob Ewell type. He is about as despicable of a human being that you'll ever find in a book. He beats his wife and children, he pimps out his daughters, he's a thief, he's a murderer (past & present) and he is a belligerent and hateful drunk. You can smell him coming and he always seems to slink away from trouble. The writer of this book is Larry Brown (1951-2004). Brown was from the Oxford area himself. He read Faulkner, McCarthy, O'Connor, Bukowski and many others. However, one of the smartest things he did as a writer (other than working hard at it) was to stay clear of imitation. He wrote about what he knew in clear, declarative sentences, however, I think it is very good prose and his descriptions are complete w/o being flowery. He captures the local dialect perfectly and he knows his subject matter well. He keeps you interested in his characters and he tells a good story. This book might not be for the faint of heart, but if you don't mind some rather gritty scenes I think you'll enjoy it. I now understand why Larry Brown has been a big hit down south. Brown and the folks he wrote about were the kind of people who \"were raised on shotgun\" and Brown captures the color of these people. It's too bad we lost him so soon."}, {"userName": "James Aura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25078753-james-aura", "userReview": "'Joe' was a memorable, tough, earthy tale, told by a author who had a remarkable handle on the human condition.

Larry Brown's Joe Ransom is captured as a hard edged, ex-convict who drinks, (and drives!!), smokes way too much, is his own man, who doesn't like to be told what to do. A man's man is the way I saw him. The way Brown writes the story is almost like a series of little vignettes, but if you keep going (and you can't help but turn the pages) you'll see how it all ties together. There are some incidents that I think could have been excluded - where Joe gets shot and operates on himself to remove the slugs. Um, now, I know he'd been drinking and all, but cutting into muscle? That required just a bit too much suspension of belief, but that's okay, I forgive LB anyway b/c I do love his writing. Gary Jones is \"the boy\" referenced sometimes as Gary, sometimes as \"the boy\" that Joe Ransom takes under his wing. Every single thing about Gary Jones is believable, as well as the life his parents live along with his two sisters - who are smaller characters in the story, although there is one incident with the younger sister towards the end.The \"old man\" or Wade Jones is also a very believable character, and LB wrote about him in such a way that I wished I could have reached into the pages at different points in time just to slap him for the way he treated his family. He was the epitome of a real loser.The book was published about 20 years ago, but in my opinion it is a story that still resonates today. Don't expect sweet with this story. Expect to meet dirt poor, real people who are only trying to survive."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5838802-laura", "userReview": "Amazing Writing, Frustrating Story!I will read this book again. Someday. The writing is beautiful and descriptive, the characters are raw and real, but right now I am reeling from the ending!Amazon.com summarizes Joe in this way: \"Nearing fifty, Joe Ransom won't slow down....But all the fast living in Mississippi won't fill the hunger Joe can't name. At fifteen, Gary Jones is already slipping through the cracks. Part of a hopeless, homeless wandering family, he's desperate for a way out. He finds it in Joe. Together they follow a twisting map to redemption-or ruin....\"After reading this blurb, perhaps I focused too much on the word \"redemption.\" My mistake.I will definitely read this book again and encourage others to read it. First, I want to discuss this novel with someone. Second, I enjoyed reading about familiar Mississippi towns and reading Southern dialect. Finally, Brown's writing is lovely and real. I thought I would be ill while I read about Joe removing a bullet fragment from his arm, for instance. I read through this novel so quickly; I would like to read it a second time and really think about it. And I will definitely read other books by this author in the future. after I get over this one.

It was beyond sad how most of the characters in it lived. The majority of them were not looking to rise above their squalid circumstances since there didn't seem to be any hope of them doing so for one reason or another, their problems beyond their control due to things such as alcoholism, despair, lack of education, and family history. But the fact is, all the ugliness in this book was made nearly beautiful by the simple and elegant prose that turned mud, puke, piss, and depravity into something poetic, just another part of the natural landscape these characters traversed. This book was a quick read due to the quality of the writing which was highly descriptive, but never overwhelmingly so. It truly engaged my senses. And it kept me turning the pages, wondering what would happen to these characters by the end, the ending surprisingly vague and somewhat ambiguous, depending upon whether or not you are an optimist. I would recommend it as a book club selection and for any reader in need of appreciating his own set of circumstances."}, {"userName": "Angi Hurst", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158328-angi-hurst", "userReview": "I flew through this book. I couldn't stop reading. I missed important details because I couldn't freaking wait to read the next part. Larry Brown's character development is spectacular. I couldn't believe how much I hated Wade as I was reading it, and how much I loved Gary and Joe. I was getting really close to the end, and I actually started getting worried because I thought that there was no way he was going to be able wrap the story up so that I felt satisfied by the end...there was so much going on. Yet he totally pulled it off. I loved it. My scale (since the speed of my reading is directly proportional to how well I like the book): 1 - couldn't get through it 2 - actually got through it but it took months 3 - read it fairly consistently on the train (took a couple of months) 4 - felt compelled to read while on vacation (and/or took about a month) 5 - read every chance I got (two weeks or less)"}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10773168-josh", "userReview": "What a great little messed up tale. If you've ever felt like you were taking one step forward to take three steps back then you have only a taste of what this book is all about. At several points, you catch yourself thinking things are looking up for the folks that need to catch a break......not so fast; only a brief respite to allow reality an opportunity to recharge its batteries. Character development is outstanding, reads quickly, and the wonderful flow that avoids the pitfalls often spliced into simple plots like this one. Brown does a great job doling out bits of the past life and background a little at a time, saving some of the most riveting pieces of the puzzle until the very end.
