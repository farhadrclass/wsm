Frankly, I\u2019ve been scared of it. Simmons has been mashing up horror, sci-fi, hard boiled crime novels, thrillers, and historical fiction while often stuffing his books with so many ideas that it was all I could do to keep up so this seemed like it could be a bit more than I could comfortably chew. Just as I feared, while I was reading and nearing the end, Simmons crept into my house like a ninja and rammed a funnel into my skull. Then he poured his wild sci-fi ideas and concepts into my brain pan like a frat boy pouring the suds in a beer bong. My mind overloaded, and I gibbered like a monkey on meth for fifteen seconds before passing out. When I woke up an hour later with a wicked headache and cerebrospinal fluid leaking out my ears and nose, Simmons was gone, but he\u2019d left a note saying \u201cDon\u2019t you ever learn? Keep reading and one of these days, I will END you!\u201dSo now I\u2019m typing this with cotton balls stuck in my nostrils and ears while I\u2019m waiting to get my MRI scan, and I\u2019m once again left in awe of just how many wildly original ideas Simmons can cram into one story. Simmons borrows the structure of The Canterbury Tales here. In the distant future, humanity has spread out among the stars, and one of the planets they\u2019ve inhabited is Hyperion which has the mysterious Time Tombs and a deadly entity known as the Shrike which protects the area around them. A powerful religion has grown around the Shrike and many make pilgrimages to try and see him from which almost no one ever returns.A former Consul of Hyperion is contacted by the Hegemony government and told that he must join a pilgrimage to see the Shrike with six others. The Ousters, a faction of humanity mutated by centuries of living in deep space, has been making aggressive moves against Hegemony worlds and now they\u2019re targeting Hyperion just as there are signs that the empty Time Tombs are about to stop moving backwards in time and finally reveal their secrets. The Consul meets the other pilgrims which include a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a detective and the captain of a rare giant tree capable of space travel. (Yes, a giant tree moving through space. Ask Simmons. I\u2019m just reporting the news here, folks.) Realizing that they must have been chosen to make the journey for a reason, they take turns telling the stories of their connections to Hyperion and the Shrike as they make their way towards the Time Tombs.I struggled with this book at first because Simmons throws the readers into the deep end of the pool with little explanation of the universe he\u2019s created, and I don\u2019t do well with books that start like: \u201cCaptain Manly Squarejaw woke up on his Confederated star potato and drank a glass of strained purplepiss juice while checking his com unit thingie to get the lastest news on the crisis involving the Whogivesashitsus.\u201cFortunately, Simmons gets the plot up and moving quickly, and then uses the stories of each of the pilgrims to fill us in on the history and setting. By using the different story tellers, Simmons gives different perspectives for tales as diverse as an interstellar war to a future detective story with big sci-fi action to quieter personal tragedies like a father losing his daughter to a horrible fate. All of these stories eventually come back around to Hyperion and the Shrike. I was also impressed how Simmons writing this in 1989 foresaw a computer network linking people, but also turning them into information overloaded cyber junkies who confuse accumulating news with taking action. There\u2019s so many different big sci-fi ideas in here that many writers probably would have been content to make an entire career out them, but Simmons uses them all deftly to create one unified story. Oh, and memo to George Lucas: the next time you want to make a sci-fi movie with interplanetary politics being a primary driver to your plot, read this first. Or just hire Simmons to write the damn thing for you .My only gripe is that while I knew there were sequels to this, I thought I was getting a complete story, and it definitely leaves a lot hanging for the next book. And there\u2019s a Wizard of Oz thing near the end, and I hate the goddamn Wizard of Oz. It\u2019s a Kansas thing."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5611008-kay", "userReview": "WHAT THE SHRIKE!\nWhat in the world did I just read, and why didn't I read it sooner? This book is so superbly written and crafted\u2014it's easily one of the best modern books I've read, one that excels in storytelling and writing!If I could give this book more than five stars, I definitely, definitely would. The scope of imagination, wordplay, and critical analysis of humankind is astounding. I do think that the \"frame\" structure of the story, in which each character's tale slowly unfurls the plot, is superbly done. Each following story added a significant layer of depth to the book. I don't know if I can contribute any more than what has already been said about this book, so here are some of my reactions for each tale.[MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON END, though nothing that would devastate many expectations. Unless you like to jump into a story blind and can\u2019t stand to have anything spoiled. In that case, stop reading now\u2026]------1. \nThe Priest's Tale\n: I am of the cruciform. I never really thought a series of a few words would ever cause me to break out in goose bumps. Not even \"Come play with us, Danny\" or \"Hello, Clarice\" or even \"We know how monetary policy works\" has elicited such a reaction. The priest's tale was powerful\u2014a delicate mixture of horror and cleansing salvation. Even after finishing the book, I feel that the other stories don't match up to the urgency and suspense of the priest's tale. Welcome to the rabbit hole that is Hyperion.2. \nThe Soldier's Tale\n: This tale reached impressive heights in the beauty of its prose, and the irony of its conclusion. To put it crudely, the twist at the end of this story would probably top the episode charts of Punk'd, if Ashton Kutcher survived till the rise of the Hegemony. The story alternated between beautiful\u2014especially when Kassad meets his special someone for the first time in person\u2014and what I can only describe with a very impassioned and dizzied WTFJUSTHAPPENED. I listened to Kassad's entire story on audiobook. The narrator had the perfect voice for a hard military man like Kassad who is lost in love. 3. \nThe Poet's Tale\n: Ah, this was probably my favorite story of them all. The potty-mouthed, frat house humor of this story, especially after Kassad's nostalgic and passionate tale, was a refreshing change. In my mind, M. Silenus was one of the most developed characters of the book, with the exception of Sol Weintraub. Seriously, some days, I wish I could respond to queries M. Silenus-style: \"Goddamn poopoo.\" The winding yet always focused narrative of M. Silenus was perfect in its execution\u2014just circuitous enough to get into the \"mad poet\" mindset, but told with enough purpose to direct us along in its torrential journey to the final conclusion.4. \nThe Scholar's Tale\n: This was a well told, emotional story. It didn't affect me as much as it did other people, probably because I was more in the position of Rachel than Sol. Still, this story was the most approachable in plot and superbly crafted.5. \nThe Detective's Tale\n: I haven't read many \"whodunit\" type of novels, and have never read any PI novels. You know, the ones where the PI is some grizzled chain-smoking guy that sports a thick trench coat and a tattered pork pie hat. [I'm aware I am massively stereotyping, or that I may have gotten the stereotype wrong... Please don't hurt me, I'm sorry!] The twist in this one is that the PI is a woman, and the person who steps into her office is a young, beautiful man with a very unusual secret. It took me a while to get into the story; Brawne Lamia isn't my favorite character. But it took off after a while, and the ending was satisfying, if not a little confusing.6. \nThe Consul's Tale\n: Well, that came out of nowhere. But in a good way!------As a sci-fi newbie, I had some trouble swallowing down the futuristic elements, especially since the story throws you right into the heat of things. Unfamiliar terms made me nervous (Time debt? Fatline? Senate CEO? Huh?!) and may have pushed me into early retirement from the book if not for the rave reviews. To be honest, I still don\u2019t completely understand this new world that we\u2019re thrust into. But this is a story-driven narrative, and the stories that we\u2019re given are well worth the entry into a brave, new, unfamiliar world. FIVE EIGHT BAZILLION STARS AND THE HIGHEST OF RECOMMENDATIONS!"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "First of all, let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed reading Hyperion by Dan Simmons. The depth, variety and scope of his imagination is a joy for any science fiction fan. Having said that, there were some flaws that must be addressed. The dialogue is frequently flat and there are some corny stereotypes that were fun but also distracting when the writer is trying to create a serious work. The pace is also a problem. I had to invoke my rule to give any book at least 100 pages before I set it aside. It was not just that the narrative was slow, but Simmons takes the reader for granted in the first quarter of the book, trusting that he will be able to keep the reader\u2019s attention. It was not until the halfway mark that I really began to buy what Simmons was selling. Also frustrating is the thematic trend of science fiction and fantasy writers to write a series, to which Simmons subscribes. This book is entertaining and enjoyable but is clearly meant to begin a series, the denouement is posted somewhere after the back cover. This is not necessarily wrong or a problem all by itself, but I do think it adds to a book to stand on its own. Certainly there are great series and books that are meant to be a part of a series, but as an artistic achievement and for literary significance, a novel should be able to be its own story, even if it is a part of a larger chronicle.That said, Hyperion is a fun, smart book. Structured along the lines of Chaucer\u2019s The Canterbury Tales and with frequent literary references, especially to John Keats, this is well written and compelling. Another fundamental aspect of a good science fiction book is the ability to illustrate a future setting. Simmons use of the Chaucer template allows him to explore several different settings in the future universe he has created, and it is a very good universe, reminiscent of Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein in its detail. And I will read the next book in the series, Sam I Am, with a fox and in a box, because Simmons has created a very good book in Hyperion that will probably continue to be good as a series.** A year later and I still have not read the second book, still mad about the ending** Years later and I still have not read more, still mad about the ending"}, {"userName": "Kevin Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey", "userReview": "Posted at Heradas ReviewThis is another one of those classics of SF literature that I have somehow missed reading over the years. Had I been more of an active reader in the nineties, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve come to it much sooner. Thankfully, I finally got there, and Hyperion was not what I expected, in the best way possible. It\u2019s most often compared to Dune, The Book of the New Sun, or other great works of Science Fantasy. Obviously, coming into the novel my expectations were high, and I knew the most basic gist of the plot: a pilgrimage across a world to meet an unimaginable being. What I got was partly what I anticipated, but in a very left-field form, which was such a refreshing subversion of my what I thought I was getting myself into. It delivered on what I thought it was, but in a way I never imagined, and it was fantastic.Instead of straight-forward narrative momentum, Hyperion is almost entirely the backstories of these pilgrims. It\u2019s heavily character based, and the only book I can honestly say is 100% both a novel, and a story collection. These stories are more technically novellas, because of their length, but you get what I\u2019m saying. Each story genuinely adds to the forward narrative, by going backward. It\u2019s really quite breathtaking to see this done so well. I\u2019ve read other collections that are also novels, but they\u2019re always more one or the other. This is equally both.Each tale feels like a slightly different genre married to science fiction, and the interstitial sections weave them together tightly. Only one of them fell slightly flat for me. Mostly because it was more akin to cyberpunk than anything else, and I have a real love/hate affair with cyberpunk. I tend to judge the genre entirely too harshly at times, mostly because if I have any sort of professional knowledge, it\u2019s in the Information Technology arena, and I have a difficult time suspending my disbelief about the realities of virtual worlds in regards to how they\u2019re represented in cyberpunk. That\u2019s a topic for another day.Hyperion has that indescribable, almost lovecraftian terror, dread and brooding present throughout, and one tale in particular left me unbearably heartbroken. There\u2019s honestly only one thing I can objectively complain about here, and it\u2019s more endemic to the genre during the time period this was written in than anything else: the way the narrator spends an inordinate amount of time describing women\u2019s bodies, broken down into parts, particularly breasts and nipples. It\u2019s just kind of eye-roll pervy, but it\u2019s my only real gripe. Thankfully, it\u2019s not quite at a Haruki Murakami level, and this doesn\u2019t much happen anymore in the really well written stuff of the genre, but I\u2019m more embarrassed for the author than anything else, award winning fiction like this is fairly written in stone for future generations to examine.I was torn whether or not to dig straight into The Fall of Hyperion after finishing this, but ultimately I decided not to just yet. I want to let this percolate and grow in my mind, but mostly I\u2019m one of those anti-bingeing types that prefers to spread great stories out over a long period of time, to elongate my enjoyment of them, and better unpack their themes. I think it\u2019s time for a non-genre novel, and then I\u2019ll dig back in when the time is right. That being said, I can\u2019t wait to come back to the world of Hyperion, and see what new terrors await these fantastic characters."}, {"userName": "Markus", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus", "userReview": "Deep in the shady sadness of a vale\tFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn.Hyperion...Imagine a universe where the Earth has been destroyed and humanity is spread out across hundreds of planets. Combine the artful poetry of John Keats with a science fiction retelling of the Canterbury Tales. Add tons of references to the myths and legends of the three Abrahamic religions, and what you have is Hyperion. A masterpiece of literature.Seven pilgrims come together aboard the treeship Yggdrasil to make a journey to the remote planet Hyperion, outside the authority and jurisdiction of the Hegemony of Man. Each and every one of them has been specifically chosen by the Church of Final Atonement to undertake a pilgrimage to the enigmatic creature known only as the Shrike. And each and every one of them has been chosen because of a personal connection with the planet itself. Thus begins a quest to uncover the lost secrets hidden within the Valley of the Time Tombs, a place from which no pilgrim has ever come back alive.This book deserves to be hailed alongside the greatest works of science fiction. While Dan Simmons\u2019 writing is not something memorable in itself, he certainly makes up for it with the creation of his characters, his setting and most importantly his story.The most fascinating part of the book is definitely the mystery of the Time Tombs themselves, huge structures that supposedly move backwards through time, originating in a distant future. Thus the book explores the concept of time itself, and the unforeseen consequences the effects of the Tombs have had and will have on the pilgrims' lives and the universe as a whole.Hyperion is more a collection of short stories with an overarching frame story than an actual novel. That structure is part of what makes the book so much of a joy to read. Every chapter has one of the pilgrims tell his or her tale to the others in order to share information that will be vital for their survival and the success of their mission. And each tale brings the group closer to the Valley of the Time Tombs, where the Shrike is waiting for them.The Priest, the Soldier, the Poet, the Scholar, the Detective, the Consul and the Templar.

One pilgrim will have his wish granted and the others will be impaled on the Shrike's Tree of Pain. Only one or more of the pilgrims isn't what he appears to be...I first read Hyperion almost seven years ago as part of the The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion / The Fall of Hyperion. When I found the ebook on the cheap, I decided it was time for a reread.Hyperion is an epic tale that's hard to quantify. Borrowing its structure from the Canterbury tales, Hyperion is a literary sf tour de force, encompassing much of what I love about reading in the first place. There are literary references, far away places with strange sounding names, three dimensional characters, and a universe that is anything but black and white. There is also artificial intelligence, faster than light travel, robots, lasers, and many other spectacular sf concoctions.As I said before, Hyperion is really a multitude of tales in one. Seven people have been selected to go on what is possibly the final Shrike pilgrimage. Along the way, they tell their stories, stories which run the gamut of genre tales. There's romance, humor, action, adventure, sex, and violence, everything I love about genre fiction. Simmons really flexes his writing chops in this, from Martin Silenus' verbose tale of being a writer to Brawne Lamia's Raymond Chandler homage. World-building is often intrusive and wielded like a club but Simmons' world-building is more like a massage, doled out in bite-sized chunks during each of the characters' tales.While the world-building is staggeringly interesting, it's the characters that really fuel this fire. A repentent soldier, a conflicted diplomat, an old man with a child aging in reverse, the captain of a treeship, a burden-carrying priest, a detective in love with a poet, and a poet in love with the past.There isn't enough space to write down everything I loved about this book. The only gripe I have is that it ends abruptly once the Consul's tale is told and the real ending is in the second volume, The Fall of Hyperion. For my money, Hyperion stands alongside The Dark Tower as on of my favorite fantasy/sf works of all time.I originally read this way back in 2011 and it was one of those wonderful books that eclipsed many of the books before it. On the second read, it still is. Five out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Kane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4715802-kane", "userReview": "I'm frankly terrified to review Dan Simmons' masterpiece Hyperion. It is too good and too big for me to do this right. So...if I'm going to do it wrong, I might as well have fun. I thought I would mirror both Chaucer's and Simmons' use of the frame story in my review:(The opening bit of Keats poetry)He enter\u2019d, but he enter\u2019d full of wrath; His flaming robes stream\u2019d out beyond his heels, And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,That scar\u2019d away the meek ethereal Hours The Overarching FrameThis may be one of my favourite books, ever. The Pilgrimage is the perfect literary tool for bringing together a bunch of characters who appear to have little in common but soon all share the same goal. Simmons does a masterful job at telling each story in different styles. The feel is unique each time. The structure of Hyperion offers something for everyone, even readers unfamiliar with sci-fi. Horror fans will be drawn to the legend of the Shrike, and the Priest's story, while perhaps the slowest to develop, reminded me of Stephen King. There's plenty to love for space opera junkies, and there's mystery, intrigue and deceit. There's also the exploration of the depth of a parent's love for their child. Oh and people get sliced and diced, nah huh.I'm not at home in a sci-fi or fantasy book unless I'm confused for at least the first few pages, if not longer. The opening scene confronts us with new words (\"time-debt\"?), odd requests and tantalizing bits of interesting information. Read in retrospect, we feel very comfortable in this scene (which is one I particularly like). That's good, and means we've integrated ourselves into Simmon's freaky world. Although the overarching story is definitely odd, by the end of it you've bought what Simmons is selling; at full price. It's just odd enough for you to be curious, and there's just enough information revealed to encourage you to fly through the pages. Strange can be good, and in Hyperion, it's incredible.Story Within a Story # 1: \"The Freaking Shrike\"I loved the freaking Shrike! I was delighted to learn that its (his?, her?) name comes from a bird that skewers its insect prey on plant thorns. Yeesh! We can certainly discuss it, but word for word (or lack thereof), the Lord of Pain is one of sci-fi's best villains/protagonists. Mind you, I've only read the Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion duology, so who knows, perhaps it's not a really villain. The Shrike reminds me of Darth Vader on a few levels. It's Vader, like the Shrike, that dictates how the story progresses. The actions of all of the other characters are only in reaction to the Shrike. The protagonist in Hyperion is the Shrike; and it never says a word. However, I wouldn't classify it as an anti-hero because it certainly doesn't elicit any sympathy or other positive feelings. One difference: when the Shrike is around, instead of a haunting John Williams score, I hear the crazy part of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\". Actually, the opening lyrics to that song make a great pilgrimage tune for the Consul et al.:\"If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see\"Ehem. I digress. The physical description of the Shrike is cool to mull over: three meters tall, made of razor wire, thorns, blades, and cutting edges, with four multi-jointed arms, and scalpel-like fingers and toes. It's metallic, but it's also organic. Don't forget the ruby red eyes. When I first read that, I was like, \"WTF is this thing?\", and I'm still kind of wondering that. Definitely makes it on my list of Literary Badasses, perhaps sandwiched between Coltaine, the Wickan Fist of the 7th Army and the Gunslinger Roland Deschaine of Gilead. Come, come, commala Lord of Pain, come, commala.Story Within a Story # 2: \"The Nine Words You Can't Say on Hyperion\"The alcoholic satyr-like poet Martin Sileneus is the scene-stealer of this book, although his best line comes in Fall of Hyperion (in an abundance of caution I'll leave that comment to the review of the sequel). I have to admit that in a potty humour kind of way, I liked Martin's somewhat limited yet colourful vocabulary during his brain-damaged period. Simmon's homage to George Carlin was pretty funny and reminded me of a scene in Iain M. Bank's Use of Weapons when a cab driver who uses a voice box to speak gets the crap kicked out of him and the voice box keeps saying things like \"thank you\", \"where would you like to go\" and \"I'd like another please\".Through Martin we get a glimpse of what happened to Old Earth. It was a creative method of exposition and obviated the need to have a character suddenly give a misplaced history lesson. Martin gives Simmons an excuse to answer the reader's natural curiosity.Story Within a Story # 3: \"A Parent's Nightmare\"Sol's story, all by its lonesome, is worth the price of admission to Hyperion. Dan Simmons has proven that he can not only tackle tech and space opera with aplomb, but that he can also create vivid characters with whom we no doubt identify. I'm a new father and I found Sol's story to be extremely moving. Plus the freaking Shrike reaching for me in the dark would turn my shorts brown. Sol deserved the cover spot on my edition of The Fall of Hyperion. Don't doooooo iiitttttt!!!!Story Within a Story # 4: \"Farcasters and Farcaster Houses\"Was it me or was the idea of Martin's house where each room is on a different planet completely awesome? If this was real, people like Britney Spears would have enough money for two such houses AND be stupid enough to actually own two. Simmons does something with tech that I think a lot of authors fail to take advantage of: he ensures that the technology he creates and uses in his story does not exist in a vacuum (no pun intended) but that it impacts how society functions. In the opening scene of Hyperion, we're aboard the Consul's ship with his piano. At some point in the story we're told that private ownership of space vessels is extremely rare. I found this fact odd until we were introduced to farcasters and their relatively ubiquitous use. Who the hell would own an expensive space ship when you can go to a multitude of planets in your PJs? I also liked that with power comes increased access to farcaster technology. The fact that the President has a private farcaster makes sense.Story Within a Story # 5: \"The Freaking Shrike\u2026again\"I make use of the Shrike's time-travel abilities to make a second comment here. The scene with Kassad and the Shrike was a very interesting concept of time as a weapon. That cool fight was also a nice little exemplar of how nobody has a chance against the Lord of Pain...Story Within a Story # 6: \"I am of the cruciform\"After reading the Priest's story I wondered how this one could be topped. Reading journal entries is always an interesting way of being exposed to facts because there is a suddenness to each revelation. Things happen while the journal's author is not jotting down his thoughts. Weird things. The opening lines of Father Paul Dur\u00e9's later journal entries become tensely anticipated.The Return to the Overarching StoryI was very impressed with Dan Simmons' tale. It rocketed him to the top of my favourite authors list and cemented him as one of my must-reads for years to come. I've since checked out his online writing course and have gained even more appreciation for the structure of Hyperion, the exposition and the prose. Most highly recommended.The Unsatisfying Wrap-upYou'll have to read my Fall of Hyperion review..."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "Hyperion is generally regarded as a science fiction classic, it tends to be included in most \"Best SF Novels of All-Time\" lists. I first read it when it was first published in paperback, at the time I had no idea I was reading a book that is destined to become a classic in the genre. When I began to participate in online sf books discussion groups not so long ago (primarily PrintSF these days) I noticed how often Hyperion is mentioned, usually reverent tones. A reread is then in order because I have entirely forgotten what is so good about it, besides I have not read the subsequent books in the Hyperion Cantos. If I remember correctly I could not get my mitts on a copy of The Fall of Hyperion at the time. Anybody who is familiar with the works on Dan Simmons will know how versatile he is. Simmons has published books in several genres including, sf, fantasy, horror, crime, and non-fiction. I can not say that he excels in all of them because I have only read his sf and horror novels but it would not surprise me if he does.Hyperion is beautifully structured and skillfully built up from gradually introducing the reader to the universe of the book to taking the readers through the adventures of the seven protagonists. It is one of those rare books that is highly readable from start to finish, yet its accessibility belies its complexity. The novel is comprised of brilliant six distinct novella length stories wrapped within a frame story (a la The Canterbury Tales). This book encompasses several different styles or sf sub-genres including space opera, hard sf, soft sf, military sf, cyberpunk, horror, and even literary fiction, each story even manage to encompass multiple subgenres. The different parts combine into a cohesive excellent volume, Simmons' wonderful versatility is amply showcased by the different narrative voice and tone he adopts for each part. My favorite is Part 5, The Detective's Tale: \"The Long Good-Bye\" which begins as a noir crime fiction then transform into a cyberpunk story with a ton of action with a touch of martial arts and even romance. The difference in narrative voice is particularly noticeable here, Brawne Lamia is the only female protagonist but kicks more asses than all the males put together yet still comes across as feminine. It is a sort of The Long Goodbye in reverse with the woman as the private eye. Part 4, The Scholar's Tale: \"The River Lethe's Taste is Bitter\" also deserves a special mention as the saddest, most poignant story here, somewhat reminiscent of Flowers for Algernon crossed with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. All the parts are great, though, these two are just my personal highlights. An earlier story even reminds me of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness before things take a left turn into Twilight Zone-ish weirdness.Characterization is certainly a strong point of this book, all the characters are complex and believable, moments of humor and irony are discreetly slipped in to prevent the book from becoming leaden. The prose style, as mentioned previously, changes in accordance with the setting and character, as a whole the book is beautifully written. I also love that the book ends on a surprisingly cheerful musical note (though not quite a song and dance number) which is also something of a cliffhanger, and our \"heroes\" are far from safe.If you count yourself an sf fan you need to read this.

So I just reminded myself that this book was about the journey, and not the destination.I almost wish they'd left the entire Ouster/Spy/Galaxy-is-on-the-edge-of-Armageddon story out, and simply focused on the pilgrims and their story, letting their individual tales hint at the wider galaxy and its various conflicts. I guess the Consul's story wouldn't have been as meaningful without the greater understanding we got about the Hegemony and the Ousters, but if not knowing that meant not having this disappointing unresolved feeling that I have right now (I just finished the book a few minutes ago), I think it would have been a fair trade. If the whole thing is telling us about these people going to see The Shrike, fading out just before they do is like dropping Luke into the trench on the Death Star, and never letting us know what happens next.I understand that much of the resolution I currently find lacking is provided in [Book: Fall of Hyperion], but every book, even those that are part of a series, should provide an entirely satisfying experience to someone who reads them in isolation of the other volumes. To that end, Hyperion succeeds, I think, even if it doesn't tell us what happens when they finally get to the Shrike (or if they even do) as long as we accept that it is about the journey, and not the destination.I still loved it. I still thought it was a wonderfully-written novel that absolutely deserved the Hugo.

By the end of the first page I was hooked. By the conclusion of chapter one I was a craven addict, my Hyperion-obsessed mind now fit for a series of cautionary posters titled \"This is your brain on genre-defining science fiction\".Hyperion is Sci-Fi to make your breath quicken, to pull you from excitement to sadness to awe in the space of a single chapter. This is genre done as well as the best capital-L literary fiction- the grand scale and imagination of SF wedded to intelligent and ambitious plotting and writing. Simmons sets up a vast and convincing 27th century tableau. Humanity has spread across the galaxy, forming an empire known as The Hegemony, which is ruled ostensibly via democratic process with a CEO at its head. Allied to this leadership is an amorphous grouping of massively powerful AIs known as the Technocore.The major worlds of The Hegemony are linked with instantaneous travel portals called farcasters, allowing people and armies to step from one world to another, and for wonders such as the River Tethys, which flows through multiple different planets. Outside this network are fringe worlds, isolated from The Hegemony proper and reachable only via slower ships. One of these worlds, Hyperion, is the home of a series of mysterious structures, known as Time Tombs, which are travelling backwards through time from the future. Guarding these relics is a murderous creature of inestimable power and unknown capability called The Shrike.The tombs and the Shrike have been known of for many years, but strange things are now occurring. The Shrike is ranging further from its usual hunting grounds. The Time Tombs appear to be on the verge of opening, and Hyperion is threatened by an invasion force of \u2018Ousters\u2019 - humans who live outside The Hegemony\u2019s control. The Hegemony decides to send both a force and a group of pilgrims to Hyperion, several individuals who are drawn towards the world, their lives somehow linked to this strange, distant planet.Simmons apparently used the structure of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales as his inspiration for the way he structured the stories that make up the threads of Hyperion\u2019s scintillating narrative. The protagonists range from a tortured priest to a semi-retired diplomat, and their journeys will pull you in and leave you sleep-deprived from late night page-turning.This is a book to fire your imagination. There are hundreds of great ideas in Hyperion, and I found myself musing on them for weeks after reading it (even now I still daydream about having a portal in my house that leads to a bathroom platform floating peacefully on the endless waters of an ocean planet - a luxury enjoyed by one of the characters).In my opinion this is Simmons\u2019 greatest work. Illium and Olympos are great reads, and Carrion Comfort is pretty cool (let\u2019s try to forget about Flashback) but Hyperion is his opus, and I have given this book as a gift several times, knowing that it will be loved by anyone with even a passing interest in SF. Each friend who has read it has come back with the same wide-eyed wonder I had when I first read the novel, eager to discuss what they have discovered.The only criticism I have of Hyperion is that Simmons leaves the story unresolved, setting things up for the sequel - The Fall of Hyperion. As a result, I suggest that you buy both books at once, cancel your appointments, close the blinds and settle in for two days of pure reading pleasure - this is science fiction at its absolute best."}, {"userName": "Wilier", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59044847-wilier", "userReview": "Lo dir\u00e9 de forma sencilla. Hyperion entra en el top 3 de mis mejores lecturas del a\u00f1o.Simplemente no creo que se haya escrito mejor libro de ciencia ficci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de este. \u00a1Lo tiene absolutamente todo! Es un deleite.Se ha hablado mucho y muy bien de esta novela y no quiero alargarme con la trama demasiado porque lo verdaderamente importante de la obra es el juego de informaci\u00f3n que Simmons nos va entregando de forma magistral. Puede parecer en un principio que la informaci\u00f3n es un bombardeo, pero trascurridas unas pocas decenas de p\u00e1ginas, el shock del inicio desaparece y lo que queda es un poso sutil en el que Simmons construye su mundo. \u00a1Y qu\u00e9 mundo! La humanidad se ha expandido fuera del sistema solar, ha colonizada cientos de planetas, ha superado guerras, sistemas pol\u00edticos y religiones por igual, hasta ha logrado sobrevivir a la independencia de la inteligencias artificiales, que ahora viven al margen, como aliadas de la humanidad, en algo llamado N\u00facleo. Todo esto lo averiguamos sin muchos problemas al principio y es entonces cuando llega el genio de Simmons y empieza a soltar peque\u00f1as p\u00edldoras de informaci\u00f3n por aqu\u00ed y por all\u00e1 y antes de darte cuenta tu mente ha unido esos puntos reconstruyendo el universo de la obra. Sin muchos aspavientos, Simmons logra superar con un sobresaliente el fallo que destroza muchas obras de ciencia ficci\u00f3n: crear un mundo en apariencia sencillo pero dotado de una enorme complejidad. Algo as\u00ed es dif\u00edcil de lograr y m\u00e1s en la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, donde todos los conceptos suenan extra\u00f1os y los t\u00e9rminos parecen surrealistas. Simmons logra que terminolog\u00eda de motores, armas o vectores parecen totalmente veros\u00edmiles hasta el punto de que acabas d\u00e1ndolo por sentado al poco tiempo. En mi opini\u00f3n es el gran pilar sobre el que sustenta de la obra y lo que hace que sea tan buena.La historia se refresca a s\u00ed misma debido a los relatos de los peregrinos, aquellos escogidos por la iglesia el alcaudon para la expiaci\u00f3n final. Cuenta la leyenda que a s\u00f3lo uno de ellos les conceder\u00e1 su deseo y luego de conocer todos los relatos no tienes ni puta idea de quien merezca mas que se lo otorgue dicho deseo. Todos los relatos son impresionantes.Como en cualquier recopilaci\u00f3n de relatos, los hay de muchos tipos y algunos son m\u00e1s atractivos que otros dependiendo el gusto, pero Simmons logra que cada uno tenga una voz individual y propia seg\u00fan el peso narrativo recae en los distintos personajes. Por ejemplo, la historia del poeta est\u00e1 llena de giros del lenguaje, recursos l\u00edricos y t\u00e9rminos prosaicos y arcaicos, mientras que la del militar es concisa, directa y parca en descripciones, muy al estilo del ej\u00e9rcito.El final es un corte abrupto hecho por la editorial. En realidad los dos primeros libros son en realidad uno s\u00f3lo.

I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That\u2019s 35 books, 6 of which I\u2019d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became a father. As such these stories became imprinted on my memory as the soundtrack to the happiest period in my life (so far).Of the six award winning novels that I had already read before I began my Locus Quest, four were written by the maestro, Dan Simmons. It was the 2004 winner, \nIlium\n, which converted me into a Simmons fan-boy (and ultimately inspired the Locus Quest itself), but the other three winners (1990 \u2013 \n\nHyperion\n\n, 1991 \u2013 \nThe Fall of Hyperion\n, 1998 \u2013 \nThe Rise of Endymion\n) are all parts of his Hyperion Cantos, a masterwork which cemented his place in the sci-fi Pantheon over a decade earlier.I\u2019m going to pluck a few choice phrases from other reviews to give you sense of what lurks inside these pages:\u201cThe sheer number of awesome science fiction ideas touched on in this book is mind boggling.\u201d \u2013 Ed\u201dIt is an intense read, and I found the 500 pages fairly flew by\u201d - Nicholas Whyte\u201cWhat in the world did I just read, and why didn't I read it sooner?\u201d - Kay\u201cI'm frankly terrified to review Dan Simmons' masterpiece Hyperion. It is too good and too big for me to do this right.\u201d \u2013 Jonathan CullenIt\u2019s that last quote from JC that rings truest \u2013 this is a complex, inspired and unique vision of a sci-fi epic. Mashing structure and tropes from Chaucer and Keats into a universe of galaxy-spanning, time-travelling, visceral conflict takes an imagination and literary love above and beyond the call of normal storytelling duty.There are characters and images here that have been reverberating within the walls of my skull ever since I encountered them. The brain damaged poet. The cruciform adorned priest. The utterly badass shrike monster him/her/itself! Simmons does it all by turns \u2013 adventure, mystery, thriller, horror, romance, erotica, philosophy, high-concept, etc. It\u2019s a tour-de-force that pounds you into submission. There are two complaints regularly levelled at this book, so let\u2019s get them out the way, shall we?1)The book ends abruptly.To call it a cliff-hanger would be generous. \n\nHyperion\n\n and \nFall of Hyperion\n were written as a single volume and split into two for the sake of publishing. Honestly, it reads like the editor just found the mid point and took a cleaver to the original manuscript \u2013 there is no effort made to make the first instalment stand alone.The simple solution? Read the two halves together and judge them as a single unit. How hard it that? It makes me rather irate when people moan about the ending, because it\u2019s not an ending! It\u2019s a mid-point! Get to the end of \nFall\n and THEN try and tell me that the ending didn\u2019t blow your mind surer than sucking on the business end of a bazooka. I dares ya!2)There\u2019s too much jargon and not enough explaining.I don\u2019t argue this one \u2013 it\u2019s a fair complaint (if this is an issue for you). This is high-brow space-opera, so there\u2019s a lot of tech, a lot of acronyms, a lot of made-up words and not a whole bunch of layman\u2019s-terms. For me, this is part of the appeal of what\u2019s often called \u2018hard sci-fi\u2019. Everything is dropped on you \u2018as-is\u2019, and the audience is credited with enough wits (and genre experience) to pick it up and run with it. Simmons doesn\u2019t waste any words making it easier for you.I don\u2019t mind this in the slightest. But if you\u2019ve found it to be a turn-off in the past, then take due warning: this may not be the series for you!but IF you cana)endure a bit of hard sci-fi jargon AND b)are willing to put in the effort to read part-two before you reach a conclusionTHEN \u2013 order a copy immediatelyAnd begin your own pilgrimage to meet The Shrike!You owe it to yourself.(happy hunting) After this I read: The Fall of Hyperion"}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165256-penny", "userReview": "When people rave about this book they should really mention that it doesn't have a real ending! Sure it was an enjoyable bunch of stories and all, but I was reading them in the context of learning about the characters before the big showdown at the end of the book. I guess that only happens in the next book.I also found the description of the settings overdone and a bit indulgent. These sections became very easy to spot as they tend to be at the beginning of a chapter or new story. I found myself skimming over them. That said I did enjoy the majority of this book. I liked the characters and their stories. I'm not sure the first story made for a good introduction since in my mind it is the least interesting and felt the longest. So for anyone who picks this up and finds it a bit slow to get going I'd recommend getting past the priest's tale before you make a judgement. I'm keen to read the next in the series since the confrontation at the \"end\" of this book was what I was so looking forward to.

It\u2019s one of those books that gradually reveals its purposes as the plot progresses. In a nutshell, a handful of POV characters journey to Hyperion \u2013 an enigma of a world made even more mysterious by the presence of the Shrike (see cover for visual \u2013 it\u2019s the big metallic being). As each character expands on their connection to this world, you start to get a sense of what\u2019s really going on.\u201cHyperion\u201d is definitely a thought-provoking book. Although it started out with heavy religious overtones (the first perspective being the religious POV), it soon captured my imagination with a complex mystery and only got more engaging from there. It was not a feel-good story. It was the kind of gritty, morbid tale that kept me page-turning well into the night despite the ever growing knot in my stomach. Then it kept me up even longer as my brain tried to sort out all the information learned about this world, the Shrike, and their effects on time itself. It\u2019s ironically exhausting\u2026 and kind of brilliant.Time manipulation in stories is a tricky thing. It can go from a clever idea to convoluted in a heartbeat. I often find myself finishing such books or shows slightly confused, wondering if I missed a critical detail somewhere or if the author just failed to communicate it clearly (it\u2019s usually a bit of both). In \u201cHyperion,\u201d Simmons did a decent job of presenting his concept in segments which were easier to digest. In fact, his overall presentation of all pertinent information was very carefully placed and effective. It allowed me to build my own theories alongside the characters based on every new revelation. That\u2019s the sort of engaging interaction I always enjoy within books. Overall, it\u2019s one of the better conceptual time-manipulation novels I\u2019ve ever read.Another note in \u201cHyperion\u2019s\u201d favor was its timelessness. It was written when I was 4 years old (O_o) yet read as though it was written within the last couple of years (and will likely do so for many to come). It illustrated just how smart Dan Simmons is at story construction. Surmising from just the text, Simmons comes across as a very well read, intelligent person. It was awesome to pick up on all the literary references throughout the plot, and I\u2019ve always been impressed with authors who can present POV characters with such integral differences in perspective on complex issues such as religion and politics, and do so convincingly. I have no idea where the author\u2019s personal stances are on these issues, and that something I oddly love about his writing.I can easily see why classic sci-fi lovers rave about this book and defend their 5 star ratings to the ends of the earth. My conservative 3 star rating, however, hopefully conveys appreciation for the book while acknowledging that it didn\u2019t quite blow me away on all accounts. I think the culprit might be the fact that there\u2019s no silver lining or hope in this book. It definitely doesn\u2019t leave you with anything but gloom and that aforementioned knot in your stomach. Now, I don\u2019t need books to be about butterflies and rainbows to enjoy them, but I do need at least a tiny ray of sunshine to give me hope that the story could end well and that the characters are working towards something meaningful. Part of this can be attributed to the format of this first book \u2013 the multiple POVs were presented in a reflectional format where all the focus was on what came before. While interesting, it didn\u2019t leave a lot of room for plot advancement, and in fact made most of the book read like a collection of prequel novellas leading up to the actual beginning of the story.Overall, I liked \u201cHyperion\u201d but it didn\u2019t land among my favorites. It is still an awesome contribution to classic sci-fi and worth your time if you like the genre.Via The Obsessive Bookseller at www.nikihawkes.com"}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "Alas, another hard Science Fiction book that doesn't mesh well with me in audio format.

I am a sucker for literary intertextuality and pop intertextuality. Mostly though, I am a sucker for a good tale, and that is what Hyperion is, but when I read this story ten years ago I found that it left me a bit cold. I think I finally know why. But before I get to that, here\u2019s what I thought of each story that makes up Dan Simmons\u2019 award winning novel. The Priest\u2019s Tale -- \u201cThe Man Who Cried God\u201d: A wonderfully creepy story to kick things off. Simmons creates a strange paradise, maybe even a \u201cheaven,\u201d a place of immortality where there are no needs, no cares, no desires, no worries. And isn\u2019t that what we\u2019ve always been told heaven is all about? I know it was what I learned from Sunday school and Catholic church. Yet the Bikura live a life that Father Dure sees as hellish or purgatorial, a dead life, a useless life, but we must remember that he is not one of the Bikura, so he sees their life through the eyes of a man -- not as they see life. Perhaps if he had spent centuries dying and being reborn, if his mind had been erased and he\u2019d slowly become a mongoloid, perhaps then he\u2019d not disdain their life, perhaps then he would find himself in heaven. Whatever the case for the Bikura and Dure, Simmons seems to be making another suggestion entirely: that there is not much to separate our conceptions (or even the reality?) of heaven, hell or purgatory.And that should be damn creepy for any believer. Even creepier than the sad undeath of Father Dure and the double crosses that infect Father Hoyt. The Soldier\u2019s Tale -- \u201cThe War Lovers\u201d: What begins as a classic, albeit exciting, episode of Shrike connected space opera becomes a wildly sexual and violent orgy of erotic sensation that fully embraces one of Simmons\u2019 favourite themes -- that the cost of life is death (which is why I love him so). This may be my favourite of the stories.The Poet\u2019s Tale -- \u201cThe Hyperion Cantos\u201d: The telling of this story makes Martin Silenus one of the most fully realized characters in Sci-Fi. I believe in him. I believe in him so much I actually want to believe his story, which could be a giant pack of lies being sold by a madman, or the skewed, confused, addled personal truth of an egoistical, arrogant fool, or a completely true story from a tortured soul who knows he won\u2019t be taken as seriously as he should be (And truth, of course, can only be so true in Simmons\u2019 fictional universe).Silenus\u2019 story, however, is a bit of a conundrum as far as Simmons\u2019 own writing goes. It is an exemplar of Simmons authorial brilliance, but it also reveals his occasional sloppiness of voice and his literary snobbishness. The brilliance is in every frightening metaphor, every laugh-out-loud moment of comedic vulgarity, every molecule that makes up the Martin Silenus we come to know and love or hate. But then comes the sloppiness of voice and literary snobbishness. Simmons has Silenus, in the midst of his myriad literary references, describe the Shrike as Grendel, and then extend the Beowulf analogy throughout his tale. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem, if not for the fact that Colonel Fedmahn Kassad made this connection himself -- only hours before Silenus started telling his story. Now, Silenus\u2019 natural arrogance and pride in his intelligence wouldn\u2019t allow him to rehash the observances of another so quickly, particularly when there are other metaphors and similes to choose from and when the entire history of literature is at his fingertips. It is an unfortunate moment that mars this third story (although it doesn\u2019t come anywhere near wrecking it for me). Still, it makes me painfully aware of Simmons\u2019 literary references and that conscious awareness aggravates me. From the second Beowulf reference on, I find myself implicated in Simmons\u2019 literary know-it-allness (which could have been his point), but I am not able to have fun with it anymore.Another thought: is there anyone else out there who would love to read Silenus\u2019 \u201cHyperion Cantos\u201d? It is one of those great works of fictional fiction that I would love to see. The Scholar\u2019s Tale -- \u201cThe River Lethe\u2019s Taste is Bitter\u201d: Make no mistake, this is as frightening a chapter as any of those that precede it. There may be no Twilight Zone parasite creating inescapable immortality, no ultra-violent orgy of death, no serial killer-esque muse in metal skin and razor sharp limbs, but the Shrike\u2019s reversal of Rachel Weintraub\u2019s aging and the Abraham/Isaac dreams that torment Sol and Sarai are horrifying in a cerebral, emotional, please not-my-kids way. I didn\u2019t find this story as freaky when I read Hyperion a decade ago, but then I didn\u2019t have kids ten years ago, and I wasn\u2019t able to fully appreciate the torture (and even the strange joy) of Rachel\u2019s affliction. It felt personal this time, and I think I\u2019d rather the tortures that plague the other characters than the torture that plagues Sol. His torture hits me in a place that is far too sensitive. The Detective\u2019s Tale -- \u201cThe Long Goodbye\u201d: Here is the action story. This is the \u201cboy\u2019s own\u201d adventure with a girl detective at its heart. It\u2019s a Hollywood blockbuster with all the ingredients: the obligatory chase sequence, the giant action ending, an apocalyptic conspiracy theory and love almost triumphant. And even the heroine\u2019s name is properly overdetermined -- Brawne Lamia -- at least for the lover of a cybrid version of John Keats. It isn\u2019t quite as deep as the other entries in Hyperion, but it is just as entertaining. The Consul\u2019s Tale -- \u201cRemembering Siri\u201d: All that was left for Simmons to deliver was his tragic love story, and he nails it in the story of Siri and Merin. Relativity and time debt give Siri, (a village girl from Maui-Covenant) and her young lover, Merin (a Shipman who is helping build the new colony planet\u2019s farcaster), just over one hundred and fifty days together in their entire lives. But at the time of their Seventh Reunion Merin is 23 years old and Siri has died in her eighties. Merin attends a pseudo-funeral with his son and his grandchildren, but the former is older than him, and the latter are just under half his age. It\u2019s genuinely sad because Siri's and Merin's love was true. Merin takes up Siri\u2019s cause and tries to finish the fight she started but he's doomed before he even begings. So he passes the task on to his grandson. His grandson the Consul. One man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter. One man\u2019s spy is another man\u2019s hero. But if you wanna know which the Consul is you\u2019ll have to tune into The Fall of Hyperion because the answer isn\u2019t in Hyperion. Ultimately, I think that was at the heart of why I didn\u2019t love this book ten years ago. I wanted closure. I didn't like being left hanging. It doesn\u2019t bother me so much now.

I really did.Reading this book definitely wasn't easy. So many times i didn't know what the hell was going on. Most of the time I was confused or frustrated, and many times I thought about giving up. If this wasn't a library book, I would definitely put it down, and read it again when I'm in a mood for reading this kind of book.The book is written in 'short stories' form, and I think that was my problem with it. I got bored at beginning of each story, and as soon as things got interesting, the story would end. Only story I enjoyed from start to finish, was Sol's story. I think he and Rachel were the only characters I got attached to. I didn't care what would happen to others.And one of the reasons that I didn't give up reading is that I hoped we would get at least some answers at the end. But nope. It ended on a cliffhanger and not a single answer was given... Did I mention how much I hate cliffhangers? 'Cause I do.For now, I don't think I'll be continuing on with the series.

There are, if memory serves, about 25 (or was it 250?) inhabited worlds between which slipships (sp?) use Hawking drive (presumably named for the amazing Stephen Hawkings?) and traveling at light speed leads to time debt from the voyages to take into account the quantum physics of space and time. The story revolves around seven pilgrims headed to a world not connected to the WorldWeb (this being a network of human habitations connected by networks and AI intelligence of the TechnoCore). There is a ton of speculative ideas that were very far-reaching for a book written in 1981 including the aforementioned WorldWeb (think of the World Wide Web that was conceptualized in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991!), farcasting portals for stepping from one world to another using time-space singularities, cybrids which are androids whose AI is seeded with known Earth personalities such as John Keats (whose poetry and life plays an enormous part in the story!) The Hegemony has become somewhat authoritarian amd paranoid following the incredible rise of intelligence in the AI systems and the menace of the Ousters who are now completely comfortable living in deep space and have developed sophisticated weapons that threaten Hegemony worlds. On Hyperion, the destination of the pilgrims, there is mysterious murderous creature called the Shrike who lives near the Time Tombs which are now off limits to the imminent danger. Each of the pilgrims has a specific and important link to Hyperion and to the Shrike and each tells their story during the long voyage. Needless to say, there is a LOT of material here and telling you more would inevitably lead to spoilers so suffice it to say that there is no question that Hyperion belongs in the upper echelon of science fiction novels and its vision of the future is at the same time quite terrifying and incredibly fascinating.Looking forward to the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "6.0 stars.

Whereas Chaucer's pilgrims generally do not tell their own stories, the focus in Hyperion is the tale of the teller. The caveat, though, is that each teller's tale is intimately wrapped up with a tale of another: the priest must tell a second priest's story; a soldier, another soldier's; a poet, a patron; a teacher, his daughter; a PI, her lover; a diplomat, a rebel. So, the tales of others are passed along, but only to the extent that the persons embedded in the tellers' tales relate to the teller. The tales are furthermore focused on aspects of Hyperion and the object of the pilgrimage therein; that's not chaucerian, either. And of course there's no proto-bourgeois Hoost in this non-novel to guide the proceedings, nor is there much in the way of humorous infighting between the tellers via their tales (cf. the Summoner v. the Friar in Chaucer, say). \"Non-novel\" because it really is a collection of six novelettes that overlap in various ways. Some of the tales are proficient (priest's, soldier's, detective's), and several are affirmatively annoying (consul's, poet's)--but the scholar's tale is very affecting (though I'm not sure if it's cheap sentimentalism or not). But that overlap doesn't make for a sustained narrative. Yeah, the setting gets developed, allowing one to piece together a lengthy political backstory, pushing toward a nasty conclusion.Some tedious explorations of scifi technology (though it is very cool that one guy has a \"home of thirty-eight rooms on thirty-six worlds\" (196)). Pedestrian commentary on religion via the figure & church of the Shrike, which is actually not doing it for me, except when the scholar refers to it as the golem (298) which makes it more interesting than it otherwise happens to be. (Poet refers to it as the Frankenstein monster (223)--not seeing that, though the reference is explained.) The object of the pilgrimage is the Shrike's house, the \"Time Tombs,\" a lackluster name, apparently referring to backward arrow of time at that point. Okay, then. Lotsa pointless references to poet Keats. Plenty of bad art theory (from the poet, mostly). Nifty concept is \"time-debt,\" arising out of travel at relativistic speeds--but the non-novel manifestly fails do anything with that concept other than use it to refer to the effect of everyone else aging while you stay the same.Pleases me perversely to note that one character has vagina dentata (172). Also like that this story fits into my general thesis that if robots or AIs are part of the story (as opposed to merely being a component of the setting--a fine distinction), then the point of the story will eventually be a robot/AI rebellion.Reveals that they blew it up, the maniacs, by not-at-all foolishly building a quantum singularity on Earth, and--surprise!--it got loose. Villains of the piece are loony spacemen and some surly computers. Overall, the non-tale framing portions account for about a less than a fifth of the book; that's not sufficient to drive the narrative forward, though there's plenty of generic setting development in there--so, when the pages run out, it's kinda difficult to see the point. Maybe that's cleared up in the sequel. Dunno.

Hyperion. Quite the achievement. Like its fascination with poetry might suggest, this novel is a piece of art.There are many themes addressed here, and a re-reading at some stage is likely in order. On one level it's a novel about faith: the loss of faith, and, perhaps, the regaining of faith. On another, it's a novel about retribution. Alternatively, it is nothing of the sort, and just a darn good Space Opera. As other reviewers have noted, there is a notable element of horror throughout. It is a dark work, and disturbing. It evokes emotional responses and raises questions. I guess that is the whole point. There isn\u2019t a lot of 'hard' science at work here, but there are some tidbits that keep the journey interesting. Speaking of journeys: this book is actually one big journey. Seven pilgrims set off to see the legendary Shrike on the planet Hyperion. On their pilgrimage they share their accounts of what brought them there. As would be expected, some of the 'stories' are better than others. One or two accounts are particularly brutal and/or moving. There are times when the novel does read a bit like a short story collection, but there are common themes and threads tying everything together. Hyperion won a number of awards, including the Hugo award for best novel. It seems it wasn't even nominated for a Nebula, although its sequel (The Fall of Hyperion) was.

Alice Munro is about the only author whose short stories I'm willing to pick up. So it is probably fortunate I didn't know going in that this was Hyperion's structure cause I would have noped right out.As it was, I found this novel engaging and clever. Each of the pilgrim's tales has a different tone- noir, space opera, spiritual parable. Inevitably some were more enjoyable then others. A few I would have loved to read as complete novels. The writing was technically skilled. I was more than halfway thru when I realised how completely hooked I was. My only complaint was that the overarching story (and as a result all of the short stories) were incomplete.

Humans now live on several planets, one of which is the planet Hyperion, where a creature called the Shrike lives near the Time Tombs, structures which move backwards through time. 7 citizens are sent with the hope that they will be able to prevent Armageddon. This book mainly revolves around the stories of the pilgrims as they travel to the Time Tombs, describing their backgrounds and why they accepted the pilgrimage. Rarely has a book moved me from tears to elation and back again so quickly. Dan Simmons does a great job of setting up the story and describing a scene. He has a beautiful use of language that makes me wonder why I haven't picked up one of his books before. I don't often like books of short stories, but this one worked. The stories were all connected in subtle ways, and really helped me get a feel for the characters and their motivations in this trip. It also offered a glimpse into different parts of this unique world. Some stories were heartbreaking, and some made me laugh with wordplay or insights into humanity.In twentieth-century Old Earth, a fast food chain took dead cow meat, fried it in grease, added carcinogens, wrapped it in petroleum-based foam, and sold nine hundred billion units. Human beings. Go figure.It does end on a bit of a cliffhanger, but this book has done such a great job with the backgrounds of the characters that I am thoroughly invested in seeing what happens to them in book two.Recommended for anyone who wants to explore a strange new world with some great and unique characters.Cross posted at Kaora's Corner."}, {"userName": "Mangrii", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30410174-mangrii", "userReview": "La famosa novela de Dan Simmons publicada en 1989 y ganadoras de los premios Hugo, Locus e Ignotus, es la primera de una tetralog\u00eda llamada Los Cantos de Hyperion. Siguiendo una estructura narrativa similar a la de Los Cuentos de Canterbury de Geoffrey Chaucer, nos narra la historia de c\u00f3mo siete personas se dirigen al planeta Hyperion a una \u00faltima peregrinaci\u00f3n a su encuentro con el Alcaud\u00f3n, el conocido Se\u00f1or del Dolor. Durante el viaje que nos lleva hasta las Tumbas de Tiempo, hogar donde el Alcaud\u00f3n permanece encerrado hasta ahora, conoceremos las incre\u00edbles historias y los motivos que a cada uno de los peregrinos los ha llevado hasta esta misi\u00f3n suicida; revel\u00e1ndonos a su vez pinceladas del complejo universo que ha desarrollado Simmons.La novela, que recibe su nombre del poema \u00e9pico inacabado Hyperion de John Keats, es un conjunto de historias muy diferentes entre s\u00ed que tienen como nexo en com\u00fan en alg\u00fan momento, Hyperion. Tendremos la historia de un sacerdote cat\u00f3lico que se embarcar\u00e1 en la b\u00fasqueda de los Bikura, una extra\u00f1a poblaci\u00f3n de Hyperion. Un ex alto cargo militar, que sufrir\u00e1 con los delirios de un extra\u00f1o amor. Un poeta borrach\u00edn lleno de talento, y obsesionado con terminar y perfeccionar su obra maestra. Un profesor con una hija, que tras su visita a las tumbas de tiempo merma tanto mental como f\u00edsicamente hacia el pasado. Una detective privado que nos aportara la trama m\u00e1s policiaca y sci-fi de toda la novela, y por ultimo un c\u00f3nsul de gobierno que oculta un secreto fundamental en toda la historia.La historia se caracteriza por utilizar diversos m\u00e9todos de narraci\u00f3n y estilo en cada una de las seis historias que hilan la trama central. Esto es especialmente singular, porque Simmons demuestra ser capaz de crear y hacer reales unos personajes solo con sus historias. Adem\u00e1s los cap\u00edtulos son muy extensos, solo tiene 6 para las 600 y pico paginas de extensi\u00f3n, que abarcan una historia cada uno, y un tramo de la traves\u00eda; pero que se hacen realmente amenos y entretenidos, siendo casi imposible (salvo imperiosa necesidad temporal) dejar la historia a la mitad. Una historia fascinante construida a base de personajes, con una diversidad tem\u00e1tica abrumadora (perdida, lucha, amor, arte, venganza, muerte, esperanza, religi\u00f3n\u2026), ayud\u00e1ndonos adem\u00e1s a construir un complejo universos lleno de facciones y elementos. Decenas de mundos, sociedades humanas, extraterrestres, inteligencias artificiales y m\u00e1s elementos futuristas (teleyectores, universos virtuales, terraformaci\u00f3n, comunicaci\u00f3n interespecies,\u2026) forman este mundo de Simmons. Si sois como yo un poco novatos en la Sci-fi en una vertiente m\u00e1s compleja, tener un buscador cerca si os gusta comprender todo el vocabulario que aparece, porque la experiencia se disfruta el doble.Hyperion podr\u00eda decirse que es un gran flashback que nos ayuda a comprender y a situarnos en la historia que va a contar a lo largo de la tetralog\u00eda, Los Cantos de Hyperion. Planteando conceptos de evoluci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica, religi\u00f3n, familias, ecolog\u00eda, arte\u2026 y miles de temas m\u00e1s, iremos comprendiendo el funcionamiento de estos universos, sus facciones, sus guerras y los objetivos de cada una de ellas.

With war looming seven pilgrims are chosen to journey to the mysterious Time Tombs, located on the far flung world of Hyperion, to petition the dark and enigmatic Shrike. The story is told using the \"frame story\" format. Each pilgrim tells their own individual story while they are traveling to the Time Tombs. It proved a surprisingly effective method of storytelling and allowed each individual pilgrim's tale to be told in a different style. Some worked better than others. Each pilgrims tale was interesting to a greater or lesser degree. My favorite was probably the Scholar's tale. It was compelling and emotionally engaging. The others provided a bit of everything. Action, romance, philosophy, mystery, and more. The world building was excellent and the plot was suitably complex and epic in scope. Simmons is the type of author who likes to drip feed the reader essential information. This has the side effect of making the start of the story both dull and slightly confusing. You learn as you go and it makes some of the weird sci-fi terms and technologies easier to understand, but I would have preferred a bit of careful info dumping at the start to make the beginning of the novel more enjoyable to read. The ending makes one glad there is a sequel. Overall I was happy enough with this story. It had some fantastic moments and some dull ones. The good outweighed the bad by the end. Rating: 4 starsAudio Note: This audiobook was narrated by: Marc Vietor, Allyson Johnson, Kevin Pariseau, Jay Snyder, and Victor Bevine. I'm a big fan of Marc Vietor and Jay Snyder and both delivered fantastic performances. It is the first time I've listened to Kevin Pariseau, but he also did a great job. Allyson Johnson was competent enough and Victor Bevine was his normal self, competent but weirdly dull sounding. I'm a little worried that that Bevine is the sole narrator for the Hyperion sequels."}], "description": "On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike.
