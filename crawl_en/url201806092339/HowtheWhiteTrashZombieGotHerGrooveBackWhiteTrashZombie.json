I really enjoyed Diana Rowland\u2019s snark in this latest installment, and the secondary characters were extremely well fleshed out which both went a long way in distracting me from the inescapable brain eating ick factor. The on-again-off-again relationship between Marcus and the heroine is also another sticking point for me. But in the end, the author\u2019s firecracker of a protagonist and killer sense of humour tipped HOW THE WHITE TRASH ZOMBIE GOT HER GROOVE BACK into 4 star territory.Angel Crawford is quickly becoming one of my favourite protagonists to listen to in audio. In this installment she\u2019s attempting to master jujitsu by trash-ifying the terminology (i.e. osoto gari becomes Trip the Drunk Guy), learning how to punch without breaking her hand (while holding a beer! LOL), and FINALLY putting Marcus in his place (hopefully for the last time). Angel is also one of the rare heroines who\u2019s character growth is obvious from book-to-book; she\u2019s come a long way since MY LIFE AS A WHITE TRASH ZOMBIE, and is taking steps to help ensure that her forward momentum continues. The ending of this book did give me some cause for concern though; Crawford\u2019s zombie state practically cured her of her addictions overnight, but the discovery of mods might soon change all that.Saberton continues to be a thorn in the Zombie Tribe\u2019s side by kidnapping their leader, attempting to blackmail a congresswoman, and conducting longevity experiments. I\u2019m still not entirely sure why Nicole harbours such hate towards her friendly neighbourhood brain-eaters, but the whole thing reeks of government conspiracies which, as far as story lines go, I am not a big fan of. Rowland adds a couple of new elements to her zombie lore which again, were a little too WTF for my tastes; maybe I just need to read more walking dead novels, either that or the author really has gone off the deep end. I wish there\u2019d been more of a resolution to Angel and Marcus\u2019 relationship too because 1. I seriously hate that guy, and 2. NICK!! *swoons*This audiobook wasn\u2019t available in Canada through my usual go-to retailers which left me scrambling for a copy on release day. Normally, in cases like this I\u2019d hold a grudge and postpone buying it out of spite, so it\u2019s definitely a testament to Allison McLemore\u2019s talent as a narrator that I went above and beyond to snag the audio version. I just could not wait to get my grabby hands on this one! McLemore\u2019s Southern twang is perfectly suited to Angel\u2019s POV, her character voices are distinct and memorable, and she delivers all of Rowland\u2019s punch lines with finesse. There\u2019s even a hat tip to audiobooks in this installment when the author references PASSION OF THE VIKING, Crawford\u2019s current listen, which I loved!Allison McLemore and Angel Crawford is a match made in heaven.

I actually listened to about an hour and a half of this audiobook several months ago and found it just wasn't working for me so I decided to try it again later. I started over from the beginning this time and was able to make it through the book but still had some trouble with the first part of the book. The story did really pick up and by the end I was really enjoying myself but that beginning was rough for me.I think that the beginning of the book had too big of a focus on Angel's internal dialogue. I love Angel but I have to tell you that she was starting to drive me crazy. Some of her actions seemed a bit childish to me and I kind of wanted the other characters to tell her to snap out of it. Once the action really got going I didn't have any of these issues so maybe the balance was just off at the beginning.This book did have a lot of things going on and once the action got going it seemed to move pretty fast. There were a few revelations that I found completely surprising and look forward to seeing how they impact future installments. Angel proved that she can hold her own in a fight and is able to make really good decisions very quickly. The big twist was a pretty big surprise for me which was a definite plus. Allison McLemore does such a wonderful job in narrating this series and this book was no exception. She is the voice of Angel to me. She is able to perform a large cast of characters quite well making it easy to follow along with conversations. She reads the story at a very nice pace making it very easy to listen for hours at a time. I would recommend this series to others. This is the fourth book in a series that I think is best read in order. I thought that this was a good installment, not my favorite, but still good. I do consider 3 stars to be a good rating. I look forward to reading more of this series very soon.Initial ThoughtsThis book was a little harder for me to really get into it. I actually listened to about an hour and half a few months ago and set it aside. I started from the beginning again this time and eventually was hooked. I liked it but some of Angel's internal dialogue got on my nerves. Once I got about a third of the way through the book it did pick up a lot for me. The narration was wonderful. This really fell somewhere between a 3 and a 4 for me.

Unfortunately, she was a bit of pain in this one and that lead to me not liking it as much\u2026 It was still a decent read though.-I enjoyed the main story line with Pietro (the zombie boss)/his people being kidnapped by the evil Saberton\u2026 Which lead to Angel/the gang getting together to save them. It was quite fun to read \u2014 well, it was when Angel and co were just being friends and hanging out together, the actual road trip/investigating parts weren't as engrossing, those parts kind of dragged\u2026 Though I did like the end when the gang all went on the rescue mission and the action really kicked in. Also, the Pietro/Pierce thing and Marcus's new role was a nice twist. -Angel cried way too much in this one, she really needed to get a grip. Anytime someone said something to her she didn't like, she started crying and feeling sorry for herself. It would have been okay if she'd only done it once or twice but she kept tearing up whenever someone so much as looked at her the wrong way. Other than her excessive weepiness she was fine, I'm hoping she'll be back to her normal self in the next book.-I was glad that Marcus/Angel broke up, he was way too controlling and made decisions for both of them when she'd told him not to over and over. I especially liked that there wasn't a big drama around their break up, they were civil and mature about it. Marcus will always think he knows best for Angel so I hope they never get back together, they're much better as friends. -There seemed to be hints about Angel getting together with Philip, he didn't seem into her though, but she kept getting all hot and bothered about him\u2026 It was kind of cute but also creepy at the same time since she was his zombie mum.-Naomi/Angel's friendship was great, even when they were bitching at each other, it was still nice to have them interact so much. I loved that Angel had two good female friends/relationships, but at the same time it wasn't enough compared to how many strong male friendships/relationships she had (Marcus, her dad, Pietro, Kyle, Brian, Nick, her boss, Dr Nikas, and no doubt Andrew will soon be another). I would have liked there to have been more of a balance.-What was up with Naomi's sixth sense and influence with zombies?-I didn't like all the repetitiveness/recaps from previous books.The White Trash Zombie series is still a current favourite of mine despite this one not impressing me as much. I'm hoping Angel will return to her former self and stop all her cry-baby-self-pitying ways and get back to being her awesome self."}, {"userName": "Douglas Meeks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5970245-douglas-meeks", "userReview": "I had to sit back and think this review through since zombies are not my favorite thing but Ms Rowland's zombies are unlike any you see on the TV/movie since they are fully functional humans (well kinda like really strong and fast healing humans) with what I would call a beneficial parasite that still has an unfortunate side effect of needing the normal zombie cerebral delicacy from time to time (which is \"usually\" handled in creative ways that do not require killing somebody).In this installment Angel is still trying to live a normal life in spite of the \"zombie thing\" and the book would be boring if that was the story but throw in some really evil guys, a killing, a kidnapping, some romantic angst and a host of main/secondary characters that are fleshed out and brought to life by skilled writing.The addition of the Congresswoman in a previous book comes to fruition in this one and you are finally going to have a politician you will love. As usual Ms Rowland has thrown in a couple of curve balls from left field that you never see coming and a couple of really inappropriate hilarious moments make this near 5 Star reading for me.I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that there is a \"gross\" factor to be considered for some readers, it has been kept at a somewhat low level, relatively speaking, in previous novels but becomes more prevalent in this installment since there is a fairly detailed scene of an autopsy to start the book and while it was no worse than watching CSI for me but I thought I should mention it.The growth of Angel is another of the reasons I enjoy this series so much, in many series the heroine never seems to get any smarter, Angel does not fall into that trap, she is getting better/smarter and more confident in each novel. I like where this part of the overall story is going.The writing and exceptional plot overcome any reluctance due to \"squish\" factor for me and I still consider this 4.5 Stars rounded to 5 (wish she would have closed one romantic storyline a bit more) but I will be on the auto-buy list for the next novel in this series.RELEASE DATE 1 JULY 2014"}, {"userName": "Krissys", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8088120-krissys", "userReview": "How the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back (White Trash Zombie #4) by Diana Rowland \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s zombie versus zombie as the Saberton Corporation declares war against the Zombie Mafia, kidnapping several of their party.

It\u2019s seriously beginning to grate on my nerves, if you can\u2019t tell. Fortunately, I like everything else about the book (well, with the exception of something Angel did concerning one of her relationships) and I like Philip, but I\u2019m so sick of this relationship being emphasized so much, this doesn\u2019t happen with any of the other zombies who turn other people, so I wish Rowland would just cool it with this one, though I fear it\u2019s only going to get worse.Saberton is back in How the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back, though to be honest, I guess they never really left. After one of the Tribe is killed and Pietro is kidnapped, it\u2019s apparent that someone\u2019s feeding information to the bad guys, so while the gang tries to unravel that mystery, they also have to try to get Pietro back from the Sabers, who have taken him to their headquarters in New York City. Angel\u2019s reaction to the city, and particularly the subway, had me cracking up! Her description hilariously (and accurately) describes the shithole that the subway is; crammed, dirty and smelly. The others are more familiar with the New York, particularly Naomi/Heather/Julia, who risks running into her evil mother, Nicole, and brother, Andrew, both of whom think she\u2019s dead (though she has had plastic surgery in an effort to keep them from finding out she\u2019s still among the living, which I still think is weird). I like her relationship with Kyle, but his \u201cI don\u2019t want to live but am not offing myself anytime soon\u201d attitude would seriously piss me off if I were her.A word of warning, if you found the scene from one of the past books where Angel cracked some skulls, literally, you may want to gird your loins because there are definitely some blood-spattered scenes towards the end of this book.There are definitely a lot of changes in this book, with Angel, Pietro and a number of other characters. Old secrets are exposed, new ones are brought to light, relationships change and past histories of certain characters are revealed, all of which should make for interesting dynamics in coming books. I\u2019d love a book to focus more on Dr. Nikas and would even love some flashbacks involving him, he has to have had an interesting life.I\u2019m still not sure what role Nick is going to play in the future. It doesn\u2019t seem like Angel\u2019s attracted to him, though it\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that he likely has feeling for her, but he\u2019s definitely turning into a close friend. Like I said, not sure how that relationship\u2019s going to play out in the coming novels (I\u2019m definitely a Marcus girl, so\u2026).Overall, a good addition to the White Trash Zombie series, though I don\u2019t know how long they can continue to focus on Saberton but am not sure what other direction Rowland can take the series.

One we have Angel taken out of her environment and out of the group of people she works with and thrown into a world world that is completely new to her.Saberton is still at it and trying its best to destroy all zombies. They kidnap some major players in the whole Z game including the head of the clan Pierto. That throws everyone into a frenzy as they know what could happen if they not find him fast and most important without anyone knowing.While the books seemed a bit slower in the beginning compared to others I still liked it best. Of course because of Angel and how wicked awesome she is. She has shown some really, major growth throughout the series and it really shows. Just not as you would expect it sometimes. She really runs into a lot of self-doubt, this book. But in the end it just shows how much she really has grown love how far she has come and all people she has, met and how they see her., verseus how she sees herself.I like that she now has friends to hang out and talk to , no matter how different they might be from her world. Also she can trust them. Or can she? Also dealing with a mole and really it can be anyone in there group. She doesn\u2019t know who she can trust and who she cannot trust .Since she is in New York throughout this book we do not get a lot of interaction with people form her work and her work, which I kind of missed.

I'm just getting tired of the constant one step forward, two (or more) steps back in the Angel dance.But, mostly, it's the writing - the way the narration spends so much time on 1) reminding us of things we know (yes, Angel, by book 4 we do know that you're not like normal people, and even if we were picking the series up in the middle, the name of the series does give some things away), 2) Angel's insecurity (we really don't need to be reminded every couple of pages, especially in the middle of action and things, about your issues).Also, it took far too long for the story to get started in this book, and is it just me or is most of the humor either non-existent or completely forced? And Kyle, Brian and Philip are all but interchangable, with few exceptions.Maybe it's an expectation thing. When I read the first book I wasn't expecting to like it much, and was pleasantly surprised.

Allen Prejean is the Coroner's Office chief investigator who still sees Angel as a screwup. Nick Galatas, formerly known as \"the Prick\", is one of the death investigators while working toward a medical degree and has been a real help to Angel.

The Plague is a one-size-fits-all bucket of the pains resulting from the bad-brain concoction Charish \"cooked up\".The Cover and TitleThe cover is rather gruesome with the bleeding, scarred, and smokin' Angel framed in a tangle of white-and-black sock-clad legs and other severed limbs in this gray-white-pinky red cover. It's an even paler pink that forms a good part of the title with a dark pink forming the rest of it. The author's name is more of a pastel pink outlined in black at the bottom.The title leaves me wondering (especially after the ending). Is it a positive or a negative in how How the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back? It could go either way\u2026!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4295616-jennifer", "userReview": "Originally posted at The Book Nympho\u00a0 \u00a0 I've had\u00a0\nHow the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back\n\u00a0on my Audible account since it's release day. Why\u00a0has it taken me so long to listen to\u00a0it? I had\u00a0'meh' feelings over the last novel,\u00a0White Trash Zombies Apocalypse.\u00a0I knew I had to be in the right mood to listen and after watching The CW's new show, iZombie, I was finally in the mood to be back in Angel's world. What worked:  Angel's signature snark \n   Great secondary characters \n   More understanding about zombie life and what they can do \n   Less Marcus \n   Allison McLemore's narration \n   More gore (earn it a 4 star vs a 3.5 star rating) \n   Angel's continuing growth as a character and heroine \n   What didn't quite work:  Slow start had me zoning out so I missed some key info \n   The feel that there might be a new romantic interest for Angel (YAY) but by the end it looks like there might be more Marcus (he's just not my favorite love interest for Angel) \n   Still not clear on why\u00a0Saberton and\u00a0Nicole are after Zombies \n   Confusion (on my part I'm sure since it's been over a year since I listen to the last one) on some of the female characters. I kept getting them mixed up. \n  I'll give a listen to the next novel,\u00a0White Trash Zombie Gone Wild\u00a0when it's released in October. And on that October release date.... usually the novels are summer releases, I can't help but wonder if the October release is because The Walking Dead returns in October? But I could be reading too much into it.

The stakes were a good bit higher, so I can understand why it wasn't as outright fun as the others. But beyond that, the character relationships seemed a bit forced this time around, and the humor a bit heavy-handed. Certain details are repeated more often than necessary, and certain jokes/quips the author favored are repeated in situations where the characters, as I read them, may not have actually used them. Something just seemed off. Like the idea to write the book came before the idea to write the book about. It was an interesting read and I'm glad I did so, I just wouldn't recommend it be anyone's first foray into the WTZ world."}, {"userName": "Cristina (a book away from an episode of hoarders)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1816527-cristina-a-book-away-from-an-episode-of-hoarders", "userReview": "Finally available for preorder on audible.

She becomes friends with Kyle, but Kyle is dating Naomi. Then there's Brian, who, I don't know, seems to like her, but not in a romantic way. As for Markus, they like each other, but have no chemistry together. So... there's zip in the romance department. A surprise: Nick, Angel's co-worker, seems to be interested in Angel, but that has yet to be seen.I feel like Angel needs a love life.Anyway. I'm still enjoy the writing so I'll continue with book 5.

Unfortunately I had completely forgotten books #2 & #3 so I didn't remember most of them.Generally it was a poorly written book. It could have been a movie, or a tv-show. Nothing about it used its format in any substantial way. A run-of-the-mill action...thing.So, some spoilerific notes on who everyone is, so I can reference them for the next books:Angel Crawfordprotagonist, was an addict, has dyslexia, survived a flood and the ruin of all her belongings, got her GED with help from a coworker called Nick, said she's going to apply to a college, acted as a consigliere for Pietro talking to Andrew Saber, blackmailed Saber mom with nude pics, got addicted to an enhancement drug called V12 meant to super-zombiefy her for a few moments (\"super zombie powers activate\"), has a dad who was violent and a drunk and now has a girlfriend and is very loving, broke up with boyfriend ex-cop Marcus because reasons, has a zombie baby called Phillip, her best friend was a Saber kid who got plastic surgery and changed her name to escape her mother's company her name is...er...sure...she's with a dude called Kyle -zombie, ex-saber- who got MAJORLY tortured by Saber Corp, Allen is a dude at work -her supervisor?- who's constantly busting her balls about stuff, evil-bad-torturing doctor Charish escaped with Saberton's help, doctor Nikas is the head doctor in the zombie lab she part-times at and Jaques-something is his assistant, Pietro ate some guy with perfect eyebrows and now wears his skin -his name also starts with a P-, Jade or Jane is a congresswoman Saber Mom tried to extort -was to be married to Pietro, now knows about zombies.At the end of the book: Something is iffy with Nick.

Angel was a total wuss for at least 90% of the entire story! Let me be clear: I have no problem with strong female characters also expressing emotion. However, Angel's attitude consistently grated on my nerves. And the shoulder punching! Dear God, the shoulder punching. I thought it would never end! Who does that? Annoying people, that's who.WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT: If you haven't read any of this series, it recaps a lot so is easily read as a stand alone.WHAT SUCKS ABOUT IT: If you haven't read any of this series, it recaps a lot so is easily read as a stand alone.There was zero real action until the last quarter of the book. I have always loved the zombie origin concept of this series and especially like the new theory of transformation. There are a few new questions raised, and I'm anxious to see where the author intends to take us. NYC was a welcome change. Now, on to Dallas?Yes, I will reluctantly read the next in series.

I admit that there little redeeming value in the books except fun, fun, fun.  This is book 4 in the series. It's 336 pages, rated 3.98/5.0 on GoodReads, and I rated it 5/5, as there was little I didn't enjoy. In this episode, the head Zombie of the good guys get kidnapped by an evil corporation and Angel and her friend zombies must rescue him. Of course there's ancillary relationship issues, zombie-life problems and amusing side lines too. This series is very similar to the iZombie tv series, in that the main character works at a morgue, which facilitates her getting brains.

(So to speak.) I like the change, but it really starts pushing her away from the simple hick girl in a more pronounced manner than before. We have less hum-drum life living and more of a superhero feel. It's not bad, not by a long shot, and it is definite character development. More that just that, it is a wonderful setup for more books to come and the brilliant segue into her old life problems. We've got a rise in this novel, setting her up for a brand new fall.

Angel falling apart is an awesome way to portray what happens in this installment.Angel finally passed her GED (yay!) and is still enjoying her job at the Coroner's Office (cool). She even gets along really well with (most of) her co-workers. Plus she's got a BFF (Naomi). But her relationship with Marcus isn't going so great because he's still trying to make decisions for both of them without checking with her first! When a bunch of her zombie Tribe get kidnapped by the evil Saberton Corporation she finds herself teaming up with Naomi, Philip and Kyle in hopes of saving everyone. But when the double crossing begins and it seems like someone is feeding the enemy information, it gets really hard to figure out who can be trusted.Yet, that's not going to stop this white trash zombie... Okay. There are a LOT of awesome things about this book: Angel's snarky voice, the growing zombie world (got insight into some of the history), how deeply she's getting herself into the Tribe, her friendship with Naomi, and that--no matter what the cost--she's always willing to help everyone. But there were a few things that got in the way: Marcus is really starting to get annoying, their time in NYC went way too long, and several scenes even made the story drag in some places. I just felt that this book could've been a little shorter and tighter, like the previous three books.Oh, and I really liked some of the gross zombie imagery. Some screwed up zombie weirdness goes on in this one.But, OMG, there was one thing about this book that was AWFUL. The freaking font size! For some reason--maybe because the story was longer--the font type was TINY. Unless it was broad daylight, it made my eyes hurt. So I found myself reading only a few chapters at night and the bulk during the day.
