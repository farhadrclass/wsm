I had to continue absorbing as much of her books as I could, but given they are usually 500+ pages, and quite intense, I have to layer them in every few months. I happened to arrive in my building's laundry room a few minutes early and perused the library's bookshelves while waiting for the dryer to complete its cycle. Lo an' behold, there she stood.Some kind soul had dropped off this book and it beckoned me to depart quickly with it. Well... as soon as I finished getting all my clothes out of the dryer. It sat on my living room's bookshelves for a few weeks, until I'd seen a review of it this week and decided to move it up on my TBR list. SO GLAD I DID!\n\nOverview of Story\n\nEdie Burchill, a thirty year old book lover working in the publishing industry, recently split from her live-in boyfriend, is visiting her parents one weekend when a letter arrives in the mail, postmarked nearly 50 years ago. Edie's mother, Meredith, tells her very little, only that it came from one of the Blythe sisters who live at Milderhurst Castle where Meredith stayed as an evacuee during WWII's German Blitz. Though Edie and her mother aren't very close, she knows Meredith hasn't told her the entire story. And when Edie finds herself driving near the castle, and an opportunity to take a tour arises, she jumps on it. Inside Edie meets 85ish twins, Saffy and Percy, who care for their much younger sister, Juniper who is in her early 70s. All is not well with Juniper, who thinks Edie is actually Meredith from nearly 50 years ago. Edie visits local historians, presses her mother's family and becomes closer to the twin sisters, in hopes she'll discover what hides behind her mother's wistful eyes. And as she falls deeper in the story, she learns of a broken engagement, a missing fiancee, a long-lost love, a crazy author, an affair and a few mysterious deaths. Not to mention the mystery of the \"mud man\" who the sisters' father, Raymond Blythe, wrote a famous fiction (or was it?) story nearly 70 years before.\n\nApproach & Style\n\nThe book alternates time periods every few chapters, showing what happened in 1939-1941 and what is happening currently in the 1990s. Chapters take on different points of view and focus from all of the core characters: Raymond Blythe. His 3 daughters, Saffy, Percy and Juniper. Edie spends time with her parents and her mother's sister Rita. Mr. Cavill, the missing fiancee, has his own stories and connections, and his family is still looking for him in current time. The stories and characters unfold chapter by chapter, leading readers to discover all the covert relationships and actions that have occurred to bring everything to current times.\n\nStrengths\n\nKate Morton is quickly becoming my favorite author. Her writing style, though a little exaggerated and too lyrical at times, is astoundingly beautiful. You will always picture the setting, the views and the backdrops. Her choice of words ranges from intoxicating to phenomenal. And her ability to stop the story at just the right moment before switching to a different character or point of view is dazzling. And sometimes, it's not even a cliffhanger or point of suspense; it's a mere change to give you a chance to breathe and let your imagination run free for a bit.The plot is intricate, realistic and intense. You question with each chapter the motivation of the good people and the sentiment of the bad people. You wonder why they make the decision they make, only to find out later, you should never second guess it. I can imagine Morton writes very detailed outlines over several months, determining when to drop certain hints, and when to hold back for a complete and utter shock. She's clearly writing in a forum and a genre that is well-suited to her strengths.\n\nOpen Questions & Concerns\n\nAt times, the story is a little too unclear. In 90% of the cases, it works to your advantage as your suspense and thrill increases; however, every so often, it goes a little too far, unravels more than it needs to and opens itself up to a few too many questions that don't fully find resolution. In particular, with the ending of this one, I wasn't sure of a connection to make with the delay that happens on the bus (no spoilers here!)... that said, it's easily forgiven, but this reader wanted it a little more tidied up.Empathy for the character of Juniper should have been a stronger theme. Readers will feel attached to her, but when you discover what truly happened to her in the end, and how it seems so much could have been prevented, you wonder whether she was just there to suffer. A tweak here and there might have made this a little more acceptable, but then again, reality doesn't always work that way either. People have a misguided notion they are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you love flowery language, tremendous detail and an ethereal quality in a story, you must read Morton's books. And this one in particular shows the push/pull between siblings and parents and children, all the things you never know even though you live together for so many years. We are all different people and despite sharing so much in common, our relationships are unique. This book shows us how to question why a sister can control another, how a mother can choose not to truly love her child... and how a man could go crazy over losing so much in a lifetime.Go into this one expecting a long and intense journey, and you will be pleased. Go into this hoping for a thrilling ride of great leaps and shocks, you will be disappointed. This is not about how dastardly someone has behaved; this is about how people disappoint one another when they least expect to.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

I finally decided to take the plunge, hoping to disagree with the bad reviews. Sadly, I don't. The Distant Hours is packed full of unnecessary detail and description. On and on it goes, page after page of long-winded waffle, page after page of no dialogue, no action and no furthering of the plot. I can see that she was trying to create an atmospheric literary piece, but I think she tried too hard to be too clever, entirely at the expense of the actual story. Had this been my first Morton book, it would have also been my last. In fact, had it had been my first, I\u2019d have abandoned it before the half way point. I stuck with it through 'loyalty' to Morton, and skim-read it in the hope that the 'real' author would eventually appear, and give me her usual tantalising, goose-bump inducing reveal. She did not. When the reveal finally limped in, I just thought, 'yeah, whatever.' The sad thing is, it could have been so good. It has all the right elements: three mysterious elderly spinster sisters who live in an imposing castle; the memory of their haunted and troubled father; a lover who\u2019s been missing for 50 years; a woman who lived in the castle in her teens but has never talked of it since; various secondary characters with hints of their own secrets. It so easily could have been another intriguing, suspenseful, excellent Morton book.Hugely frustrating."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "I loved Morton's earlier novel, The Forgotten Garden, and had high expectations for this one as well. If this book wasn't tailored made for my reading tastes, I don't know what would be:- Ancient castle in the bucholic English countryside- Past and present plotlines weaving and intersecting- Homage to books, readers and the written word- Gothic elements galore (including madness, forbidden love, family secrets, a lost letter, and a creepy children's story)However, by the end of this massive 560 page book, I was left closing the back cover with what I am sure was a comical \"What-the-****-?\" look on my face.Seriously, I concur with so many other disappointed reviewers that this book needed major red pencil attention by the editors. Morton is a gifted writer, but this book suffered from too much literary cleverness at the expense of what should have been a gripping and taunt gothic mystery. It's not enough that she can write strings of beautiful sentences; there needs to be a satisfying conclusion to such a whopping tome that I've invested loads of not-so-distant hours toward finishing.This time, the Morton magic didn't happen for me."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544490-anne", "userReview": "Actual rating: 3.5 \ud83c\udf1fMy edition of this book has over 700 pages, but it really didn't feel like a long book. The pages just kept flying by, which is due to Kate Morton's excellent writing style. She has a way of pulling you into the story and making everything feel alive and real. You have no option but to be completely invested and enthralled by what's happening. Like with her other books, the setting and overall \"feel\" of the book were just perfect. The suspense is written in a wonderful way - not over the top and just the perfect amount to keep you guessing without driving you crazy (and thus becoming annoying).However, I did enjoy this one less than the other two book by her I've read (The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden). This was mostly because I just didn't connect to any of the characters. I even disliked the main character Edie at certain points (no real reason why, I just didn't find her very sympathetic). And with the others, I felt like I didn't \"get a good grip on them\", so to say. And then the two characters I would have loved to get a clearer picture of (Raymond Blythe and Thomas Cavill) were kind of glossed over. A better view into their lives and thoughts would have been wonderful, and considering that they both are key figures, it definitely would have made sense and added some more depth to the story.Then again, the book definitely earns some plus points for being unpredictable. The ending, like in Morton's other books, takes a dark turn, and once again, I was not let down. The way all the beautiful things are combined with the gruesome and dark themes is done in a great and fitting way. Like I've said in my other reviews of her books: I'm glad she doesn't shy away from going down this route!Despite my detachment from the characters, I had a great reading experience and would definitely recommend it to others."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1335103-carol", "userReview": "I welled up when this book ended & not just because I hated to see it end.

I don\u2019t know quite what to make of Kate Morton, whose writing (at least for me) gets increasingly annoying with every book she publishes. At some point she has begun to confuse languor with atmosphere, and the pace of this book is like sitting on the leading edge of an advancing glacier. It could be millennia before it gets where it\u2019s going. Morton is plainly far more interested in the details of setting and landscape than in narrative and character, and consequently she spends far more time on description and explanation than on dialogue or action, with the result that I started to feel as if I were having a guided tour of a novel instead of reading one. This is all the more frustrating because somewhere under all the visual detail there\u2019s a story I was kind of interested in hearing, but she just wore me down with page after page after page of rambling, stylistically torpid journeys through landscapes both external and internal. I gave up after a two and half page description of someone looking for a pile of laundry.

As an Ann Tyler and Maeve Binchy fan, I wouldn't know. I loved Morton's previous two books, and this one is even better. Flying back and forth in time between the evacuation of children from London prior to the blitz of 1941 and the modern day (1992), Book editor Edie Burchill uncovers the truth behind the creation of \"The True History of the Mud Man,\" a spectacularly successful children's story written by the patriarch of Milderhurst Castle in Kent, now in the possession of the \"Sisters Blythe,\" three characters truly wrecked by their father and their connection to the baleful book he wrote. Central to the complex and thoroughly gripping plot is Edie's mother, who was thirteen when she was evacuated in the war to Milderhurst and became entwined in the drama. Her part of the tale is only one of the things Edie discovers.Morton writes great characters and provides them with intelligent and utterly believable dialog.

I had it finished in a week. A few times a got a little frustrated wanting to know the secrets but the wait was well worth it. There are a lot of secrets in this book.I was worried it wasn't going to stack up to her two previous books due to some 'not so good' reviews I've read and heard. This book is a lot darker than her other two, but similar in the switching back and forth from the present to the past. Again, I love the way she tells a story and this is a fabulous story to read. Remember though, it is a dark book and she does take her time building the characters but it was one hell of a read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It all starts with a lost letter delivered to Edith\u2019s Mum, Meredith. The letter has been lost for 50 years. The letter is from Juniper Blythe who is now an eldery lady. Juniper and her twin sisters took Meredith in during the 1940 London Blitz and here the story begins of Middlehurst Castle and the secrets within it's walls......"}, {"userName": "Christy B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1204629-christy-b", "userReview": "I read the last hundred pages of The Distant Hours in the middle of a pretty intense storm. This just brought me even deeper into the story, where I felt as though I was a part of it. People who have finished The Distant Hours will know what I'm talking about.I'm such a huge Kate Morton fan. I raved over her two previous books: The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden, so when I heard about The Distant Hours a year ago, I could not wait for it. I had such high expectations, and I figured, for once, I wouldn't be let down by them.I was right. Oh, was I right. The Distant Hours was such a lush, dark, beautiful, sad, novel. I felt myself lost in it every time I picked it up. The mystery and the scenery. I was so caught up.The story starts when a lost 50 year old letter arrives in the post. Edie watches her mother's reaction as she reads the letter and Edie immediately becomes curious. The curiosity leads her to Milderhurst Castle, home to the sisters Blythe and home to Edie's mother during the London Blitz. Edie finds twin sisters Percy and Saffy and their younger sister Juniper, who hasn't been quite the same since her fianc\u00e9e abandoned her 50 years ago.Edie finds there is much to their story. Much more. Nothing is as it seems, of course. Stories and legends that have been around for decades prove to be untrue. Just when you think you've got something figured out, you are not even close.That happened to me. Many times. I wasn't right about a darn thing. Nothing was as it seemed. And even at the end, we find out that Edie's conclusion - what she believed was the truth - wasn't correct. However, it didn't matter. No matter how you looked at it, the ending was sad.The Distant Hours was more character driven than plot driven, so therefore it's not for readers who like fast moving plots. The story weaves in and out of 1941 and 1992, switching back and forth seamlessly.I took my time with this one, despite my desire to find out what happens, because I wanted it to last as long as possible. Like her previous novels, Morton has written another story that has permanently attached itself to my imagination. Its ending never leaving me.

When Morton sets the stage and begins to play out the lives of the Blythe sisters, children of a famous and ultimately bizarre writer, during the time of WWII, she has me hooked. At the same time, she introduces the modern-day story of Edie Burchill, the daughter of a WWII child evacuee who was sent to the castle to wait out the war. It is her mother's story that Edie is determined to unearth, but in the process she finds herself enmeshed in the story of the Blythe sisters as well. This contrivance of running parallel stories in different time lines is fairly common and seldom well done. Morton does it well. She makes us equally interested in both stories and anxious to see how they converge one upon the other.I would never argue that Morton's books are great literature. They are pure enjoyment. Now and then, that is what we need and what we seek. I never feel disappointed by having spent my time with her characters and she keeps me straining to figure out what the truth of the mystery will be (which I never do)."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/758088-eve", "userReview": "If I only read one book this fall, I decided months ago, it would have to be The Distant Hours by Kate Morton. Kate Morton\u2019s debut novel, The House of Riverton, held me so spellbound that as soon as I finished it, I read it again. Despite the fact that The House of Riverton left me emotionally drained, I eagerly pre-ordered her next novel, The Forgotten Garden, and devoured it in one sitting, heedless of the late hour and lack of sleep, when it finally came. I'm glad to report that her third effort, The Distant Hours, was just as compulsively readable and captivating as the first two. Everything I loved in The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden, and have come to expect from Kate Morton, is in The Distant Hours.First, there's always a mystery that unfolds in lush, gothic detail, usually in a bygone era. Here, a letter sent during World War II arrives 50 years later. Like a siren call from the past, Edie is compelled to find Milderhurst Castle and discover the fate of the Sisters Blythe, Juniper, Persephone, and Seraphina. Aristocratic beauties in their day, what has happened to the Sisters Blythe over the years and what precipitated their tragic decay reminds me a bit of Grey Gardens mixed with We Have Always Lived at the Castle. So lovely and promising in their youth, they are now old women who never escaped the mouldy castle of their forebears, their dreams strangled by a mysterious tragedy 50 years before. \u201cHave you ever wondered what the stretch of time smells like? I can\u2019t say I had, not before I set foot inside Milderhurst Castle, but I certainly know now. Mould and ammonia, a pinch of lavender and a fair whack of dust, the mass disintergration of very old sheets of paper. And there\u2019s something else too, something underlying it all, something verging on rotten or stewed but not. It took me a while to work out what that smell was, but I think I know now. It\u2019s the past. Thoughts and dreams, hopes and hurts, all brewed together, shifting in the stagnant air, unable to dissipate completely.\u201dThe long shadows cast by their controlling father, a celebrated novelist, and his most famous work, The True History of the Mud Man, over their lives has something to do with why the Sisters Blythe have never left the castle. Morton, as usual, is adept at weaving subtle strands and hints so that even as the reader uncovers more and more of the mystery, the final reveal is devastating and unexpected. Hint - within the short, haunting excerpt from the Mud Man tale in the beginning of the book are symbolic clues as to the dark history and future of the Sisters Blythe. Love affairs cut tragically short; age-old secrets waiting to be discovered; suspenseful, atmospheric setting; and writing that left me breathless - The Distant Hours enthralled me to the very end."}, {"userName": "Katrina Passick Lumsden", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden", "userReview": "I can't say enough about this book. It's not a happy one, so don't go into it thinking you're going to get a sweet happily ever after. No, that's not really Kate Morton's style. But beautifully lyrical prose and an almost unnerving talent for atmosphere makes this, on the surface a beautiful read. What's not so obvious is that Morton's talent for crafting intricately layered, interesting characters is superb. She presents you with a certain set of traits for each character that cause you to draw a hasty conclusion about their personality only to pull the rug out from under you later and completely destroy your preconceived notions. Each character shifts, grows, becomes more three-dimensional as you delve further into the story, and that's just what characters in a story should do. The story itself is sad. A love affair whose reverberations continue fifty years into the future and affect quite a few people. But it's also a reminder to live your life for yourself, to let go of fear and the machinations of others, to love those around you, but not to allow that love to suffocate you. It's a reminder that love isn't always a grand thing, but sometimes it's all we've got."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Un relato exquisito, una narraci\u00f3n que envuelve los sentidos.

Even with the hope, sometimes it felt like a shadow was in the corner, waiting for it's turn to walk in.Secrets and betrayal ripple throughout,one seeming to stretch from another and shape someone else's fate in some cases. One instance or two the people involved thought it was done with best intentions but find themselves carrying a heavy burden.I felt for each of the Sisters in different ways but most of all for Juniper... the person she was then and how we meet her in present day... *hugs her gently*Like Mister Carlos Ruiz Zafon (though their styles are wonderfully different), Kate Morton has a way of weaving her tapestry of people and places, building atmosphere and tension. It's a wonderful feeling to let go and disappear into the rich and complex world of this, dreading and yet really wanting to know what happened to set everyone on the path that led to present day.Once again, words fail to say how this book affected me... this was the introduction to Miss Morton's writing for me, another one of those chance finds on the shelf at work :). Sounds cheesy, but the cover just 'called out' to me every time I passed it. So glad I took the chance on this <3It takes awhile to get to what happened, but the journey I didn't mind at all. We get clues dropped in throughout each chapter and glimpses into everyone's minds. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough :).When the secrets come out, it's a doozy. The first time, I was floored... did not expect to hear what I did and not long after, yet something else came up and then something after that. I won't spoil it for you, but your heart will go out to everyone when it comes.One secret that was sort of in the background but still present I remember guessing at, but being wrong yet again... Looking back when you think on everything,you can see in certain parts the little things you picked up on and/or may have mistaken for something else, or perhaps disregarded at the moment.Raymond Blythe is at the center and the side of alot of things and his actions echo down long after.There's three endings of a sort really.. two have connections to the past although in different ways. The other, is haunting and lays certain things out that had my mouth dropping open the first time and my heart pounding.One of the most beautiful gorgeous novels I have had the pleasure to read, and will read many times more... highly recommend, happy reading!\u201cIt was the sibling thing, I suppose. I was fascinated by the intricate tangle of love and duty and resentment that tied them together. The glances they exchanged; the complicated balance of power established over decades; the games I would never play with rules I would never fully understand. And perhaps that was key: they were such a natural group that they made me feel remarkably singular by comparison. To watch them together was to know strongly, painfully, all that I'd been missing.\u201d .\u201cFor it is said, you know, that a letter will always seek a reader; that sooner or later, like it or not, words have a way of finding the light, of making their secrets known.\u201d .Pre review:That's it... going back to an old favorite!"}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2153853-veronica", "userReview": "I was very disappointed with this. I enjoyed her two previous books, without thinking they were masterpieces -- just long, lazy holiday reads. But this one began to seem awfully long, with too little substance and far too much padding. From the start, I felt the present-day first person narrative and the parts told in the third person and set in 1941 didn't sit well together. I did enjoy the 1941 parts at first; Middleton is still superb at evoking an atmosphere in the past with lots of period detail (certainly a million times better than Mary Ann Shaffer). But even these parts started to seem too slight, long-winded, and repetitive. In the 1992 part, I even warmed to the shy, bookish Edie at first, but she was such a dull, self-effacing character that it was simply not believable that people who hardly knew her would suddenly start confiding their fifty-year old secrets to her.As with her other books, you could guess roughly how things would turn out halfway through (even if she reserved a few twists). But oh, she took a long time getting there, and then galloped through a bunch of implausible coincidences to reach the denouement in thirty pages or so. She was trying much too hard with the gothic touches. And the epilogue was downright cheesy. A good editor with a big red pen would have helped a lot, but I still don't think it would have matched up to her other books, which had enough subtlety to retain interest."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/436675-erin", "userReview": "Any book over 500 pages makes me narrow my eyes suspiciously. There is so much room for extraneous things in a book that size. I was pleasantly surprised to find nothing extraneous whatsoever in The Distant Hours. It\u2019s so long because Morton doesn\u2019t just focus on a few main mysteries. Instead, she weaves in all manner of smaller unknowns that click into place one by one, usually just when the reader has nearly forgotten about them completely. The result is an extremely complex and masterfully woven plot that doesn\u2019t sort itself out until the very last pages.The novel is broken into five parts. Each part is broken into chapters of two types: there are Edie\u2019s chapters, which bear names instead of numbers, and there are flashback chapters, numbered and dated. I thought at first that the flashback chapters were Edie\u2019s reconstruction of the story, but I soon realized that wasn\u2019t the case. The flashbacks tell what really happened, clarifying some mysteries even Edie never solves. These historical chapters could be a separate novel in and of themselves.Morton does an amazing job drawing all of her characters. Even the minor ones, from the Blythes\u2019 housekeeper to the town gossip to Edie\u2019s boss, are vivid and real. Yet the full cast of characters doesn\u2019t detract from the story. I was never confused about who was who, and by the novel\u2019s end I had a good sense of where each character fit into the story.I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Distant Hours. While no book is without its flaws, there is no one thing about The Distant Hours that stuck out to me as being off. I would not hesitate to recommend The Distant Hours to anyone interested, and I hope to check out Morton\u2019s backlist for myself in the near future."}, {"userName": "A.

It's one of my favorite books to recommend so naturally I was excited to read another work by Kate Morton. I found the entire story to long, to drawn out and lacking any real emotion. It was an effort to finish. With the exception of one or two chapters about the relationship between Thomas Cavill and Juniper Blythe it felt like a narration you would find in the newspaper.I had the ending figured out three hundred pages into the book and read the remaining 260 pages just to see if I was correct. The book was plot driven - not character driven. I much prefer the latter.And whoever compared the story to 'Shadow in the Wind' must not have read one or the other book. There is no comparison. It's like comparing Shakespeare to Harlequin Romance. One is full of characters with strong compelling personalities - the other is full of paper dolls. One is full of suspense with unexpected turns - the other like a drive to the local market.Not a book I would recommend to anyone."}, {"userName": "Cryssa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4742741-cryssa", "userReview": "This was the first Kate Morton book I had ever read and I heard rave reviews over the Forgotten Garden. It started off great; I found her prose fresh and her descriptions unique. Kate Morton is clearly a talented author but I think she failed with this book. She could have really benefited from tight editing. I didn't understand her structure in the least. Switching from a first person narrative to a third person narrative, using different view points was distracting. That was the first snag I hit as a reader. If she had made it all third person and still maintained the different view points, I would have been fine with that. I don't think the first person narrative added any additional insights either. That story line seemed like an add-on, almost like the original story was too short or needed some zip. It was the weakest part of the book. At about the 200-250 mark, I too felt like calling it a day. I found the scenes became repititious and I didn't care about any of the characters. Some of the mysteries/secrets that were revealed were a let down (i.e the contents of the lost letter). By the last third of the book, it picked up and I couldn't put it down. If she had sliced out whole chunks in the middle and ensured that she showed a scene once and well, the book would be excellent. I still want to read the Forgotten Garden and the House at Riverton but I don't recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11895508-regan", "userReview": "This was my first read by Kate Morton...and wow...absolutely stunning.

Think more Rebecca than \"Fall of the House of Usher.\" The switching between 1941 and 1992 helps, I think, keep the tone light. Of course there are some Dark Family Secrets that get revealed, and a Literary Mystery gets resolved.Edith's trip to Milderhurt and the Castle is, at first, accidental but it's clearly fate, thanks to her mother's year-ish there during the Blitz. The Sisters Blythe (honestly, the characters are really well named here!) aren't quite as Miss Havisham as they originally are made out to be, but the Castle certainly is trapped in time. That Edith is ultimately able to unravel the past, not to mention bury it (in a manner of speaking) is not what you'd expect from the start because there are all sorts of Portents and Clues that lead the reader to think that Something with Happen to Edith.
