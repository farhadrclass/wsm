Maybe it worked for some people, but it didn't work for me.The author makes the effort to motivate the reader and provides a lot of ideas for action, but personally I read books for acquiring knowledge, not for motivation or suggestions for actions. So this book doesn't work for me.I didn't like the constant repetitions of the author. He repeats the same thing over and over, again and again and again. Nope! I understood it the first time, the more times you repeat it, the more it becomes a brainwash. I also didn't like the repetitions at the beginning that \"this program is amazing\", \"this program is the best\", \"this program is helping you\". NOPE. I'll be the judge, and it's not like you say or try to brainwash the reader to think. I hate this kind of books that resort in this kind of methods.So, bottom line. This book would be good for middle aged people that are set in their ways and need a lot of repetition to wake up from their slumber of inactivity."}, {"userName": "Angchronicles", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10876953-angchronicles", "userReview": "Chocked full of inspirational quotes, bible verses and proverbs. Fillief with list of books videos and Cd one should read to find their inner child.For me a confirmation that I'm living great experiences by slowing down, refusing to say I'm busy and getting to know family and friends more intimately. For readers who don't know how to break mundane life style vaszily offers a mountain of ideas."}], "description": "What are the 9 most intense experiences\u2014the transformative steps that can improve your life starting now?
