And right now, I can't handle sad but I pushed on and it was a good book. It's still very sad. When Jess wakes up, she's in a hospital room. She's a prisoner though. She's not sure what has happened. She was in pain. But finally someone tells her she has been charged for killing a little boy in the building she lived in. Jess was friends with this little boy, she treated him the best she could because she knew his home life was bad. How could she be so high that she would burn the building and the boy inside? When Jess is able to move, they transfer her to Fellside prison. She is kept in an isolated ward because she is dying. She wants to die because she can't stand the thought that she killed her little friend. She is in such despair. I found this to be so sad and the way she was treated. I mean sometimes they get it wrong. Sometimes they don't look at all of the evidence the right way. Sometimes innocent people take the fall. But...... Jess is seeing Alex in her dreams. He tells her things. Jess remembers getting high with her boyfriend at the time. She finally got clean but he pulled her back in.. into a world that she should not have been in.... Memory and longing betrayed her. She let him put the tube up against her lips. She breathed in. A shallow breath at first. But the second one was deeper. And from there, by slow and inexorable degrees:the needlethe first time he hit her and said he was sorrythe first time he hit her and explained why it was her faultlosing her friendslosing her jobburning down the housemurdering Alex Beech.Alex brings Jess back from the brink of death. She was floating, going away and her brought her back. He had unfinished business for her. After Jess started to get well, they put her in with the regular convicts even though some thought she shouldn't be placed there. But others thought, she's a child killer, let her get what she deserves. And she did, beatings - things you imagine in jail. Through all of this bleak, hopelessness.. there is a tiny spark. There is something happening at the prison. There is something that brings the case back open for Jess. All you have to do is look in the right place. And sometimes, just sometimes, you might get help from the spirits that were done wrong. I did like the book once it got to where it was going. I loved Jess, she wasn't a bad person. She got in with the wrong crowd but don't we all at some point? I think the book was written very well but don't sit down and read this if your depressed!

I'm honestly such a sucker for story lines where everything some how comes back together and so I really enjoyed the way things unfolded. I think Carey did such a good job building the anticipation to the climax at the end where everything goes down. I was pretty anxious to know what was going to happen. I know a lot of people didn't like this as much as The Girl With All The Gifts but I'm pretty sure I enjoyed this one even more."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "4.5 *Fellside is not really a horror story, in my opinion. It's more of a ghost story with horrific elements. Whatever the genre in which it's classified, it's a damn fine book! Jess is a heroin addict who was badly burned in a fire; a fire in which a young boy was killed. This story begins when Jess wakes up in the hospital and discovers what happened. She is held responsible for the death of the boy, and ends up in prison. I can't tell you anything else about the plot because I believe the reader needs to let it unfold as the author intended.I thought the beginning of this book was excellent, but then the pacing slowed until about the halfway point. As the plot thickened though, the pacing picked back up again and took off in directions that I doubt anyone could see coming. Much as what made The Girl With All the Gifts a special story, Fellside is also special-it's about the telling of the tale as much as it is the tale itself. The characters here were not all black and white, and I enjoyed that. They almost all had many layers and nothing much was totally clear about any them until near the very end. Being that the majority of this book took place in a women's prison, I expected the main players to be bad people, and don't get me wrong, some of them were. But the majority of them came across to me as REAL people, not just cardboard cutouts that moved the plot along. And the people that I expected to be the \"good\" characters had a lot of surprises in store. I bet they surprise you too. This novel was a mystery to me almost the entire time I was reading. I couldn't guess, (though I tried!), where the story was going to go, what was going to happen or how it would all end up for Jess. I find this to be a rare occurrence, and as such, I relished the journey that was Fellside.Highly recommended to fans of the author's previous work as well as to fans of ghost stories!You can buy your copy here: http://www.amazon.com/Fellside-M-R-Ca...*Thank you to the publisher and to Net Galley for providing the free e-ARC of this novel in exchange for my honest review!

Carey's writing is punchy and fun, easily the best part of the book. The premise here mixed mystery with the supernatural, one of my favourite styles, but it failed to keep the pacing necessary to maintain my interest. Seemingly long periods of time in the dreamscape/afterlife were hard going and not always relevant. The finale kicked it all back up again, but I found myself shrugging as I thought about the review. Overall, the book is forgettable. My thanks to M. R. Carey, Little, Brown Book Group, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2016/03/21/b...After the brilliant novel that was The Girl with All the Gifts, I swore to myself I would read anything else M.R. Carey writes. Not long after, I was practically beside myself when I found out he was going to be writing a ghost story.Turns out, Fellside is a very different kind of ghostly tale, and not exactly in the horror vein. Instead, it\u2019s a little bit of mystery, a little bit of paranormal, and even a little bit of court drama, all bundled up in a wonderful package along with Carey\u2019s unique brand of imagination and creativity. The story follows Jess Moulson, a junkie convicted after she set fire to her apartment complex following a heroin bender, accidentally killing her neighbor\u2019s ten-year-old son who was home alone. Even though Jess has no recollection of the events that went down that night, the court ruled it as murder and sentenced her to life in a maximum security prison called Fellside.Jess is haunted the moment she arrives, not only by the ghost of Alex Beech, the boy she killed, but also by the shame, loneliness and guilt she feels from all the mistakes she made in the past. But instead of plummeting her further into darkness, the spirit of Alex actually rescues her from the abyss and gives her a new sense of hope. Jess immediately makes an enemy of a fellow prisoner named Harriet Grace, the boss of G-Block, when she refuses to run drugs for Grace\u2019s corrupt racket. The road to redemption, Jess believes, is not to commit even more wrongdoings, even though she is aware such attitudes might eventually get her shanked in a place like Fellside. But she has a purpose now, and she is determined to see it through to the end even if it kills her.In a book like this, there are not a lot of sympathetic characters. In fact, the beginning of Fellside made me boiling mad, and not just because of all the healthcare professionals, prison guards, and other authority figures who were corrupt and/or incompetent, but also because that seemed like such an easy way out for an author to paint someone as a villain. Even someone like Jess took time to grow on me, given the complete and utter disaster she was at the beginning of the story. After all, it is hard to sympathize with someone who has abandoned all hope, becoming entirely convinced of her own worthlessness. However, I now know that Carey set it up this way for a purpose; Jess had to fall far before he could raise her up again and juxtapose that to the new person she becomes. Even so, my favorite characters ultimately came from the most unexpected quarters, mostly minor bit players like Shannon McBride, Fellside\u2019s resident storyteller, or Lorraine Buller, Jess\u2019s taciturn yet compassionate cellmate.The story also didn\u2019t hook me right away, mostly because of its many moving parts that didn\u2019t all come together until the second half of the novel. I didn\u2019t care much for the humdrum chapters on Harriet Grace\u2019s drug-running ring, for example, at least until that plot thread collided with Jess\u2019s. Things became many times more interesting when the story morphed from a prison drama to a full-blown mystery. While I plodded through the first part of the book, I must have read the last two hundred pages or so in a single sitting, so energized as I was at the plot\u2019s new direction. I definitely found the ending to be stronger than the beginning, even though it started running along a more predictable path. There was a court scene which was especially played up for dramatic effect, but hell, I ate it all up. I could hardly have made myself put down the book by that point.Even if you enjoyed The Girl with All the Gifts, it\u2019s difficult to say if you\u2019ll enjoy Fellside, simply because the two books are so different. Fellside is not your typical ghost story, more suspenseful rather than creepy, and I can see it appealing more to mystery fans than horror buffs. Still, there are some mirroring themes. As ever, Carey is fond of keeping his readers in the dark right up until he springs the big surprises. And then there are scenes of intense violence, but when all is said and done, we\u2019re also left with a spark of hope.Finally, of course, there\u2019s the author\u2019s writing itself, which is as bold and hauntingly evocative as I expected. No disappointment there, as far as I\u2019m concerned. If anything, this novel demonstrates Carey\u2019s versatility and my admiration for his talent has actually increased. While it took me some time to warm up to Fellside, I ended up really enjoying the story\u2019s poignant look at life on the inside of a women\u2019s prison, as well as the memorable characters you\u2019ll love to hate and hate to love. Recommended for fans of paranormal mysteries and suspense."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "After 'The Girl With All the Gifts' this was a highly anticipated release. Like that book, it's very compellingly written - early on in the book, I said to myself, \"Well, I think it doesn't really matter WHAT Carey's writing about, if he writes it, I will enjoy reading it.\"Admittedly, the topic/setting here is not as 'up my alley' as 'The Girl With All the Gifts' is. I love weird futuristic dystopias to death, and while I also enjoy ghost stories, this leans more towards 'contemporary British prison drama that happens to contain a ghost' rather than towards being a classic horror story.Fellside's the name of the prison. Sentenced to reside there is Jess Moulson. Jess is a junkie whose no-good boyfriend got her deeper and deeper into her addiction - until one tragic night. While she was strung out on dope, Jess' house burned down, killing a young boy who was her neighbor - and ironically, the only person in the building that Jess had warm feelings for. Although Jess can remember barely anything about what actually happened the night of the fire, the courts judge that it was intentional arson on Jess' part, and she's convicted of the murder of the boy. Along the way, the crime becomes a high-profile case, and she's vilified by the press and the public.This, I thought, was the weakest part of the book. Maybe England is a bit different from the USA, but the whole thing seemed like a rather typical, unremarkable, sordid incident. Here, a junkie causing a fire that killed someone in a low-income area might make the paper - once. It might be considered manslaughter, at the worst. And no one would pay much attention. A lot of the book rides on Jess' guilt - both her personal guilt at her culpability, and that which is presumed to be hers by others - and I just wasn't feeling it. I think the book might've worked better if Jess had been portrayed as a much more horrible person; but the author is careful throughout to give the reader room to be sympathetic toward her. However, aside from this one quibble, the writing was excellent, with great tension, forward motion and vivid characterization.Once in prison, wracked by guilt and depression, Jess decides to kill herself through a hunger strike. In her extremity, a ghostly presence makes contact with her - and believing that perhaps she might be able to do something to ease the spirit of the boy she killed gives her a new reason for living... But first, she'll have to survive Fellside - where beatings and even murders are common, criminal schemes are everywhere, and the employees are just as crooked as their wards."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Fellside then. One of my most anticipated for 2016, even given that Mr Carey had the probably intense pressure of following up his incredible previous novel \u201cThe Girl with All The Gifts\u201d a book I still throw at people now, so madly did I feel that one at a time I needed a reminder of why I read. So did Fellside live up to my hope and expectation? Oh yes and then some but I would caution that the two novels are entirely different entities when it comes to the storytelling. Both brilliant in their own way, but completely in their own way \u2013 if someone said \u201cbut which did you like better\u201d it would be like asking me which of my children I love more. Impossible to answer. Well apart from one of said children made me toast this morning so at the moment\u2026Fellside is a novel you should go into cold \u2013 like The Girl with All the Gifts the more you know about it the less you will feel it -for that reason I will speak about plot as little as possible \u2013 but from the opening page it is peculiarly haunting, beautifully constructed and embeds itself into the darker recesses of the mind so you think about it at odd moments of the day. To me this was a sign that I was both going to adore it and have to endure a certain amount of book trauma at the end \u2013 and that turned out to be absolutely true.Jess Moulson is a character to die for, undeniably conflicted, following an unknowable path to very dark places, you are with her all the way \u2013 and honestly that is the least of it, the author has a real talent for group dynamic within a story and setting this one in a prison, an eerie place and a character in its own right, just added more atmospheric layers into an already desolate landscape. You never know what might be just around the corner, often I was not sure I wanted to find out but kept going anyway unable to stop.Blurring the lines between light and dark, good and evil, creating a mythology that lingers in the mind, Fellside is not one thing but many \u2013 a novel I shall return to as I\u2019m sure I missed some nuances, but also the descriptive language in parts is so beautifully perfect you just want to read the words again for the sheer pleasure of it. If like me you like to be challenged and emotionally disturbed by a novel then Fellside and indeed The Girl with all the Gifts will hit the sweet spot on that particularly. The best way I can describe my feeling while reading this is it was like having that falling dream, where coming out of it leaves your heart pounding. I was distraught at the end, a little tearful but mostly AGAIN going \u201cYes see? This is why I read\u201d\u2026I\u2019m fairly sure this will divide opinion \u2013 when you write a novel that does what The Girl with all the Gifts did, then as I said at the start you are probably going to be under a particular pressure \u2013 but MY opinion, for what its worth is that Fellside is both charming and horrific, creepy and engaging, it gets under your skin and stays there. Jess and the numerous other people I found inside the walls of Fellside will not leave my head anytime soon. Nor will the place itself, so the only thing I can do is say\u2026.Highly Recommended."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "No matter how many times people told me this had nothing to do with The Girl with All the Gifts, I found myself still scouring the book for signs that it could be connected. Silly me. I failed.But that doesn't mean that this wasn't a good tale! On the contrary, it might be a must read if you like to learn to like characters that you normally wouldn't give a fig about. Specifically, a woman who is self-destructive enough that she wouldn't even work on her own defence at her trial, who has, off and on, had a drug problem, and who is occasionally suicidal while barely scraping by within the women's prison, Fellside.So what's this about, then?It's a ghost story. :)Not really intended to be scary, though, but it does have a lot of great conflict and tension, with a very robust plot and good character-rounding. I had a good time. :) Especially when it came to the ghost. The ghost had a lot more definition and character building and twists and turns than I usually get to enjoy in such tales. It's not like the ghost is hard to find or traditionally \"Mysterious\", either. The real trick is in the mind, and what can I say? I love that kind of thing. :)This is definitely a character-driven novel, and you can expect some pretty deep immersion into the nature and intricacies of guilt.

Jess has been given heavy prison time for deliberately starting a house fire that not only destroyed her face and injured her asshole heroin addict boyfriend, but killed a 10-year-old boy named Alex. Jess essentially martyrs herself, accepting her punishment with a heaping side of self flagellation, deciding her time in prison will be short once she goes on a hunger strike/suicide mission. The only problem is, Jess can't remember any of the sins she's been told she committed, so she just takes everyone's word for it (like you would.) As she withers away in the prison infirmary, dead Alex comes to her with an afterlife request - find out who really killed him, because he's sure it wasn't Jess and he can't find peace without knowing.The blurb is essentially Orange is the New Black but with ghosts and mystery. Once you get passed the blurb though it's none of those things.It's more like:with lots of:This comparison to Orange is the New Black is apparently made about anything that takes place in a women's prison now??? Even if it lacks everything that makes that show good - the characters, the drama, the twists, the sex and the humour. There are a lot of things happening in the book, a lot of different characters telling the story through their POVs. If listed, each component sounds like it should be interesting: the baddest prison bitch running a drug empire, the corrupt guard doing her bidding, the meathead chicks who will shank anyone who looks at them the wrong way, the doctor with a sensitive complex that just wants everyone to stop being mean, Jess' lawyer's love for her (that made zero sense), and of course Jess with her pet ghost - but somehow these elements failed to come together in a way that was riveting or engaging for me, or even really unique. I found the whole thing to be very drab, shades of khaki, the prison population seemingly created using cliche character types that we see so often in situational drama like this.While I liked the writing style - certain sentences definitely grab you, poke at your emotions and resonate - overall the book was too long and ultimately aimless. Because of it's length (486 pages), any suspense/thrills that could have been built, any conventional mystery that could have existed, was forgotten between page and pages of other background story lines happening within the prison, involving side characters, that I just didn't care about.And the ending was *fart noises*... It took so long to reveal all the \"secrets\" of what really happened the night of the fire and what really happened to Alex/who Alex really was, that by the time we got there I felt kind of like:and a little bit like:2\u00bd stars for being too long, torpid and lacking any type of mystery, or thrills despite forcing itself into those genres."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "Once again I am disappointed due to my own stupidity. For some reason (not reading the blurb, perhaps?), I assumed that this novel was set in the same world as The Girl with All the Gifts. It was not. There is no zombie plague here, if that\u2019s what you were hoping for. But I'm probably the only dummy who didn't read the blurb.Jess is a heroin addict who is sent to Fellside Prison after an unfortunate event ends with a child\u2019s death. Jess has no recollection of his death but is filled with remorse and guilt. Alex was her friend, her only friend, and she felt protective of him. Now she doesn\u2019t seem to care what happens to her and has given up on living. As she nears death from a self-imposed hunger strike, she sees Alex in ghostly form and realizes there is quite possibly a lot more to the story of his death than she was led to believe.What follows is a story that I wouldn\u2019t consider horror at all. It\u2019s more a story of prison corruption, evil doers and innocents caught up in a big old mess. Jess struggles to discover the truth about Alex\u2019s death while she also has figure out how to survive prison life. Jess is a great flawed character and the plot, for the most part, was gripping and grueling but I wasn\u2019t really in the mood for this type of story when I picked it up and found myself a bit bored here and there.The good? Flinty Williams narrates the audio and you can\u2019t go wrong with that accent.The bad? It\u2019s a little slow and unless you\u2019re into reading about prison politics you may find yourself a little bored too. There are a lot of characters and many are called by their first names and their last names by other characters. I had a hard time keeping them all straight and, in the end, I am not sure I did.

But in order to do this, I have to get a few things out of the way first.I was insanely excited to read this book. Like, seriously. Insane.I read \nThe Girl with All the Gifts\n in one sitting and was drooling for more from this author, so when I heard that a new book by Mr. Carey was coming out in 2016, I was likeAnd when I got a review copy from NetGalley, I was completely ecstatic. I told everyone. Even people who (*gasp*) don\u2019t read, and couldn\u2019t possibly care less that my bookiest wish had come true.And then I read it.So my expectations for this book may have been a leeeeeetle too high, but even if I\u2019d read this as a debut by an unknown author, I still wouldn\u2019t give it more than three stars, and bearing that in mind, you can take my review as you wish.The premise of this novel, which I won\u2019t rehash here, was very good. I expected to like this book a lot just on that alone. But it ended up being a lot of andand I was just so not okay with that.I don\u2019t watch Orange is the New Black. Please, hold your rotten tomatoes until the end, thanks. I tried, and I only made it through like three episodes. I just find it stressful, and I don\u2019t enjoy prison as a plot point in general. I had no idea, going into this book, how similar the scenes and characters would be to those in that show. There\u2019s the lady in charge of the prison because she\u2019s connected and running drugs into the prison. The crooked guards who have sex with the inmates. The useless and entirely self-interested warden and the scary enforcers. Very, very familiar.The \u201cghost\u201d portion of the novel was weird and fairly unique in my reading experience. The place where Jess travels with Alex is unique but bizarre and hard to believe or get in to.Stylistically, it\u2019s well written; the language is simple and easy to follow, without being boring, repetitive, or drawing too much attention to itself. The characterization is a bit lacking, but the settings are strong and well-developed. I was not a fan of the ending, but hey. I seldom like the endings to books.All in all, and based solely on this book\u2019s own merits, I\u2019d probably have to say that this is a strong 3 star novel that just wasn\u2019t to my taste.But compared to \nGirl with All the Gifts\n, it\u2019s absolute boring, mucky drivel. ***********************************Ummmm....yeah....2.5 stars? Maybe 3? Not sure I believe this was written by the same M.R. Carey who wrote one of my favorite novels ever. I knew the stories weren't remotely related, and that was fine, but I wasn't prepared for how disappointed I would be. *sighFull review to come.************************************OH MY GOD NETGALLEY GAVE ME A COPY AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*************************************"}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "Heroin addict Jessica Moulson receives a life tariff for starting a fire that causes the death of a small boy. She had no intention of harming the boy Alex - didn\u2019t know that he was even in the building. But the prosecution claimed that she did intend to kill her fellow addict boyfriend & she was convicted on his testimony, which legally makes her a child killer. At 1st sight that seems unfair, but when you think about it, it makes sense. Suppose I\u2019m in the zebra crossing along with your ex, whom you try to run over with your motor car, only the ex jumps safely out of the way & you obliterate me instead. You\u2019ve certainly murdered me even tho\u2019 you never so intended.If you\u2019ve read books like Alex Marwood\u2019s The Wicked Girls, you know what public fury & media frenzy those convicted of murdering innocent children arouse, & prison inmates are as judgemental as most of us, so we\u2019re not surprised that Jess will become an object of opprobrium & a target for bullying. Which logically & morally is senseless in her case, but brings out the distinction between legal guilt & moral responsibility. She is only supposed to have tired to kill the druggie boyfriend, so whilst legally she is guilty for the death of the child, morally she is blameworthy only for encompassing death of boyfriend. Even before we learn a lot more about him in this book, we\u2019d hardly see his demise worthy public outrage.Thinking about that paradox was only the beginning of the moral & spiritual issues you\u2019ll find yourself facing in Fellside. I think M. R. Carey\u2019s The Girl with All the Gifts was a better executed story, but Fellside is on a higher artistic level. Both are quest stories. Girl with All the Gifts a journey quest whose progenitors are The Odyssey, the Anabasis, the Morte d\u2019Arthur, Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, Journal of the Plague Year & The Lord of the Rings. These recount journeys by a group of friends trying to find their way to a safe haven through many dangerous adventures. The present story is a katabasis, a descensus Averno, like the sixth book of the Aeneid, the gospel of Nicodemus, & Dante's Inferno. H.M. Prison Fellside is supposed to be in the Yorkshire moors geographically; spiritually it is directly over the pit of Hell. Normally on such a quest the pilgrim voyager is accompanied by a spirit-guide: Aeneas by his father Anchises, Dante by Virgil. Jess\u2019s spirit-guide is apparently the ghost of the dead boy Alex who perished in the fire she was convicted of starting. Jess initially attempts to starve herself till as she approaches death she meets this spirit in her dreams who leads her to choosing life, even life in prison. Slowly Jess develops her spiritual powers & her friendship with this spirit, who gradually reveals yet another identity. You may read other reviewers who were disappointed by Fellside, because they loved The Girl with All the Gifts & wanted another adventure story, or maybe a mystery story, or a supernatural horror story. There are all of these elements in Fellside, but spiritually it\u2019s much more elevated. As an example of one of those standard fictional genres, Carey could have ended this book 60 pages earlier than he did - & I would happily have given it four stars & it could have had an HEA epilogue as well. When I heard where Jessica stood up in the appeals court after the verdict to make a personal statement & I sensed the direction the book was taking, I wanted to stop the car & scream \u2018Jess, Don\u2019t do it!\u2019 But of course she had to do it. This is a story of redemption. Now that we\u2019ve been redeemed, what do we do about it? We don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to anybody. But when it does, we want to be there. So we ask to be posted back to the front line, to the trauma unit, to the mission outpost, to the entrance to the dark cave concealing the downward path leading straight to . . . . As long as there\u2019s unfinished business to take care of, we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. In this book M. R. Carey chooses to have his hero Jess go for full-blown tragedy: unnecessary, excessive, cruel, but also inevitable & right - & very beautiful."}, {"userName": "Sahar Dehqani", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69999205-sahar-dehqani", "userReview": "\u0622\u062f\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0634\u0628\u06cc\u0647 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0646\u060c\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0634\u0628\u06cc\u0647 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0646\u061f\u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u062c\u0641\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0686\u0646\u062f\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u06cc\u0634 \u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0631\u06a9 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8386404-richard", "userReview": "[the whole dreamscape aspect (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "A hard book to classify/shelve. M.R. Carey is an excellent writer, and draws you into a book, which seems like a classic who dunnit. Jess Moulson is on trial for murder when a young boy dies in a fire, supposedly caused by her carelessness when she was shooting heroin. Convinced of her own duplicity by the evidence and testimony of her own boyfriend, she is sent to Fellside Prison in the British moors, where she commences a hunger strike. However, she is visited by the ghost of the murder boy (Alex), who asks for her help in finding out what really happened. Lots of women prison drama, and traipsing through inmates' dreams. Kind of trippy, weird.

The problem is, she doesn\u2019t remember setting the fire, but she quickly begins to believe herself capable what with all the evidence stacked against her. Resigned to her fate she beings her life in Fellside, a prison deep in the moors of Yorkshire, knowing she won\u2019t have to suffer for long after she begins refusing food. As her body and mind weaken more and more each day, she\u2019s visited by the ghost of Alex, and he proposes that she work to discover who truly killed him so that they can both be at peace.Honestly, I don\u2019t remember even reading the synopsis of this before falling all over myself in excitement. I simply adored The Girl with All the Gifts and maybe that\u2019s where I went wrong. My expectations were astronomical. Regardless, there\u2019s nothing in the synopsis that would have normally turned me away from reading the book but ultimately this one fell flatter than a pancake for me.Yep, I\u2019m definitely part of the black sheep crowd with this one. I\u2019m pretty broken-hearted about it though because this was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. The majority of my complaints are spoilers so I\u2019ll do my best to explain without revealing too much.There are not only a ton of characters and scenes told from various points-of-view but somehow they all managed to be completely lackluster. Jess Moulson is not a likable character having been convicted of killing a child, however, that\u2019s never been an issue for me since I liked Lolita and even Tampa. There just wasn\u2019t anything about these people that captivated me or even interested me in the least. The storyline started off slightly interesting with the mystery of the fire but that quickly dissolved into prison drama with a \u201cbad\u201d warden that\u2019s helping bring drugs into the prison and all the threatening of inmates to be the drug mules. There was the prison doctor that had a sad personal story that wasn\u2019t explored very much that did nothing in the pity part of my heart, the nurse with her questionable yet excessive anger towards Jess for the crime she was convicted for, and the various stories of other inmates and the lives they\u2019ve led and the losses they\u2019ve suffered. There was a really strange side story about Jess\u2019 lawyer too that I felt was pretty ludicrous to say the least. AND THEN, enter the ghostie to really complicate shit further.You\u2019d think adding a flair of paranormal to a story would help it but it ended up just being strangely bizarre and by the end it left more questions than answers. This book was a whopping 496 pages but it still shouldn\u2019t have taken me over a month to finish. It\u2019s one of those really slow-going stories where you feel that pressure slowly building in the background and you\u2019re waiting for that big reveal that\u2019s going to take your breath away. That eagerness to find out the truth of it all was the only thing that kept me going. Sadly, by the time the \u201csecrets\u201d are all revealed I couldn\u2019t help but feel equal partsandI received this book for free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."}, {"userName": "Kajwan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52598613-kajwan",

http://www.tenaciousreader.com/2016/0...Fellside is haunting and unique and at times, quite grim. Once I was hooked, I was firmly hooked. Our introduction to the protagonist is memorable and it takes a little time for both her and for us the readers to piece together the story of what brought her to that initial scene in the book. Turns out, our protagonist is actually a heroin addict. A horrible fire destroyed her apartment complex, killing a young boy. The last thing Jess remembers is shooting up, so when they place the blame on her, she can remember nothing in her defense.The book takes place largely in the women\u2019s prison that Jess is sent to. Her case was high profile in the media, she comes in to an atmosphere where some of the inmates have already decided to make her life harder. The one highlight for Jess, the one individual that really seems friendly and supportive (or at a minimum not openly hostile?) comes not from another inmate, but from what appears to be a ghost. A ghost in the form of the little boy she is charged with killing. Yeah, it kinda seems sad when the closest thing you can find to a friend is an apparition of the kid you were convicted of killing.As you can imagine, there are lots of good characters and interplays between inmates. Well, good as in perhaps fun to read, not as in \u201cgood people\u201d. Its a different atmosphere, and one were the most conniving seem to thrive, and we definitely get to see a lot of the darker side of human nature in this book. The fantastical elements of this really come in to play more later in the book. Before then it is more a creepy, ghostly mystery. I honestly feel like my only real complaint is that it took me longer to than I would have preferred. Maybe this is just because it is so different from The Girl With All the Gifts. But by the time I was hooked, I honestly could not remember why I wasn\u2019t instantly hooked because it does get extremely good.The narration was well done, capturing the emotion and tension throughout without ever feeling over the top. Definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "Rinn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140832-rinn", "userReview": "Also posted on my blog, Rinn Reads.Well, this was incredibly disappointing.After the absolutely astonishing book that was The Girl With All The Gifts, I expected something just as amazing from M.R. Carey the second time round. Sadly, it was not to be.I wouldn\u2019t call this horror, not in the same way that The Girl With All The Gifts was. It\u2019s more paranormal, but it\u2019s also just very odd. Jess Moulson finds herself in prison after a fire, a fire that she apparently caused whilst high. When Jess finds out what happened during the fire, she decides the best thing to do is to end her life, and goes on hunger strike. She is teetering on the very edge of life and death when she suddenly starts to hear voices and see visions, a figure from her past that might hold all the answers.To be honest, I think my main issue with this book was Jess. She was just a bit of a limp character, and there didn\u2019t seem to be much to her. I also found the whole explanation for Jess\u2019s visions to be a bit of a let down. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but with the way that the book was going I had started to suspect the reason behind them (it is very difficult to write about this book with giving anything away to be honest, which is why this review is so short!), regardless it was still disappointing and almost felt as though the involvement of Jess\u2019s case was entirely pointless. And if, like me, you\u2019re more interested in prison dramas after Orange is the New Black \u2013 this ain\u2019t that.As with The Girl With All The Gifts, Carey\u2019s writing is excellent. It was just the story that did not work for me this time \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even creepy like the blurb claimed. I will still read his next book with the hope that it will live up to the first, but I feel sadly disappointed by Fellside."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22104588-drew", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars. This is one dark, screwed up book.I picked up Fellside because I really enjoyed Carey's zombie thriller, The Girl with All the Gifts. I love his gritty writing and complicated plots, but most of all his ability to zero in on nasty, tough characters who have been through hell and are hardened by their circumstances. In The Girl with All the Gifts, we followed a schoolteacher, a military sergeant, and a child zombie. In this book, we meet drug addict, Jess, who has just been convicted of child murder.Jess can't remember setting fire to her apartment, but the evidence strongly shows that she deliberately sent the whole top floor up in flames, killing a young boy in the process, Alex. Now Jess is being sent to a maximum security prison on the Yorkshire Moors, Fellside.The plot combines ghosts, a brutally honest look at prison life, and a mystery - did Jess really kill Alex? If not her, then who? I wasn't sure how I felt about the addition of a ghost story at first - in her prison cell, Jess hears voices in the walls and meets the ghost of the dead boy she killed - but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't mind the paranormal aspect.The harsh, raw, and violent look at the inside of a prison made for an uncomfortable read sometimes, like when other inmates beat up Jess as a \"welcome\" present. I think the cold, hard setting will be unappealing to a lot of readers, but for me, I found it intriguing because these dark, nasty places really exist in the world.I think I have a weakness for corrupt characters. Be it the morally despicable Kaz Brekker from Six of Crows, the psychotic couple, Amy and Nick, from Gone Girl, or the violent, charming Alex from A Clockwork Orange, I can't seem to stop loving them. I just love when authors humanize them, exposing their flaws in such an honest way I'm able to sympathize with. I didn't expect to like Jess, who supposedly killed a little boy, but I really grew fond of her stubborn determination and surprisingly kind heart.The plot twists, intense court scenes with Jess's brilliant lawyer, and the unbelievably sad atmosphere surrounding Fellside made for a breathtaking read. I didn't think this book was as \"enjoyable\" as The Girl with All the Gifts, but it was still a darn good read."}, {"userName": "Liviu Szoke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16959770-liviu-szoke", "userReview": "Mie mi-a pl\u0103cut.

Fellside by M.R. Carey is a book that I have had trouble reviewing, but not for a lack of love. It is a story that caught me by surprise both in how badly I misjudged the cover and how thoroughly I enjoyed it. Jess is a heroin addict who sets a fire in her apartment that ends up killing a kid and disfiguring her half of her face. In prison for manslaughter, Jess just wants nothing more than to die...when the boy she killed comes back to haunt her. Is there such thing as redemption in Fellside or has he come back to make her pay for her sins? Jess is a character who you aren't sure whether you should love, hate, or want to throttle for most of the book but one that will win you over with her overwhelming and flawed humanity. I have always been fascinated with prison stories and this one delivered everything I was hoping for and more. The story slows in a few places but the end absolutely justifies (and explains) the means. I highly recommend this book.I received this e-ARC from Orbit Books/NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "Fellside is a maximum security prison on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors.
