Kadare is an Albanian \u2013 whose books were semi-tolerated by the Hoxha regime (as they were born in the same city) but who eventually went into exile in Paris (although after the Berlin wall fell and not long before the Albanian regime fell). This book is translated from what is itself a French translation.The book is a mix of narrative about Mark \u2013 an artist, interleaved with \u201cCounter Chapters\u201d \u2013 stories and legends Mark thinks about (although with strange dream sequences in the main narrative as well). The book is set post the fall of the Hoxha regime and Mark is a confused observer of the scene as Albania struggles into the free world \u2013 bank robbers raid the national bank, there are rumours about what is contained in secret national archives and the medieval Albanian tradition of tribal blood vendettas seems to be coming back.The book is easy to read but can prove a difficult narrative to follow \u2013 with little sense. I found the story unsatisfying. At times Kundera-esque (both in imagery and in older artist who attracts a younger woman), but without Kundera\u2019s more accessible themes."}, {"userName": "Lavinia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1405967-lavinia", "userReview": "So, first of all I'm happy to report that Romanians have a very good translation of the book, thanks to Marius Dobrescu. I understand the situation is not so good for the English version, which is translated from French, which is translated from Albanian. huh!People say that in order to like this book you need a bit of patience. Actually I was hooked. Not from the first chapter, that's true, but from the second, which is actually a story that combines magical realism with folklore. The book was likable but it ended too soon, I had the feeling I.K. could have gone into depth with the story, the characters, the kanun.I was absolutely fascinated (and started googling right away) about kanun, the customary set of laws Albanians had for hundred of years and which was revived after the fall of the communist regime. As I read, Kadare often discusses this subject in his books, so I'm tempted to try something else really soon. For those interested, here's a link to the Romanian translator's postface, which also explains a bit the kanun and gjakmarrja (blood feud): http://atelier.liternet.ro/articol.ph..."}, {"userName": "Kitty with Curls", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320462-kitty-with-curls", "userReview": "Not my favorite Kadare; this struck me as less Kafkaesque than simply confusing & a little bit tired.

In some ways, it reminds me of Milan Kundera, but I like it more than I do Kundera's books. There isn't that pervasive detachment, the insistence that people cannot make connections under a fascist state.

With a formal structure similar to that of Chronicle in Stone, this post-Communist novel alternates a regular chapter whose events take place nowadays with a \u201ccounter-chapter\u201d narrating a fairytale or a myth. Thus, the snake found by a group of people in the first chapter reappears in \u201ccounter chapter one\u201d in the tale of a girl married to a snake that turns out to be a man under a spell (in the Romanian version of the story the snake is a pig). The animal slips out of his skin at night and puts it back on the morning. Wanting to keep her husband in his human form, one night the girl throws his skin in the fire, and her husband disappears. The contemporary story and the folktale are variations on the same theme, and at times they intersect. The result is a contemporary setting and characters anchored in both a mythical, ahistorical past, and a present full of references to the history of the Balkans. This double anchoring is probably what gives Kadare\u2019s stories their enduring power because it infuses them with a truth that transcends the present, while illuminating it.The main theme of Spring Flowers is that of the Code of Laws and of the Secret Archives. In fact, we are dealing here with two aspects of a single theme, one referring to the old Albanian Code of Laws or the Kanun, and the other, to the Communist Secret Archives, but they constantly intersect, to the point that the truth about the one seems to hide (or to reveal) the truth about the other. The Kanun or the Book of the Blood is a book where the \u201cdebts\u201d of each family are inscribed, according to the ancient lex talionis or \u201can eye for an eye:\u201d \u201cwho redeemed the blood, and who still has to do some redeeming, who still has a blood debt and who hasn\u2019t\u201d (76). The ambiguity between the ancient code based on the law of the blood and the modern secret archives is deliberate, as if the crimes and the blood staining the pages of the Communist archives were but a new version of the same primitive institution of the blood debt."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1231281-ian", "userReview": "So I went looking for novels from countries I\u2019d not read literature from before, and came up with this one. Kadare has won several international prizes, and been mooted as a Nobel laureate a number of times. Spring Flowers, Spring Frost is his eleventh book, and his entire oeuvre \u2013 of novels, at least \u2013 appears to have been translated into English. Mark Gurabardhi is an artist in the provincial town of B\u2014\u2013 and, well, things happen. Beginning with a bank robbery. People also tell each other stories, and each chapter is followed by a counter-chapter which expands on that story, as if it were the plot of the novel (but the counter-chapters are not a single narrative). Some sections of the novel deal with the old Albanian mountain code of Kanun, blood vendettas that go back generations, so far no one remembers what they were actually about, and how they\u2019re in danger of kicking off again now that Hoxha\u2019s communist regime has collapsed. Much as I enjoyed Spring Flowers, Spring Frost, it didn\u2019t blow me away. I\u2019m glad I read it, but I doubt I\u2019ll read anything else by Kadare.

Until then it was a great combination of a day to day love story, ancient mythology, and a brand new society trying to find it's way after the end of an oppressive regime. The action takes place in a small town in Albania, unnamed in the old initialled style. Communism has departed, and the town must decide whether to globalise or revert to old traditions, which include the rather binding practice of blood feuds. Until the last chapter everything remains quirky, despite the fact there's some quite dark feuding going on. There's a couple of small twists and it's a really great read. And then it all goes a bit philosophical in the last round and leaves a very unsatisfying ending.

It feels extremely atmospheric - the character is the lens through which we see Tirana. And what we see is an endless circle of repercussions and suspicions (represented by the discussion of the kanun coming back and the Book of the Blood possibly being found again), and a society full of tension because of that.I also liked how truth is seemingly mutable:In the early days of the new era, people no longer gave a penny for official opinion, as they became free, from one day to the next, to adopt the opposite point of view. But to their great surprise, no significant change occurred. As in the past, once they got home from work, they would hear about events in such a mangled way that the stories were often completely distorted. Gradually, it became clear that, as for many other things, such distortions of the truth had nothing to do with politics. Apparently, for reasons still not understood, rumor, vivified over the weekend by the smells of good food and Grandmas burps, had a hard time when it encountered the atmosphere of the office, the clacking of typewriters, the secretaries' lipstick, and, last but not least, the stern gaze of the boss.Even if you could never say that the office had won out completely (as soon people got home, they had to negotiate the mule-like persistence of grandmas, often reinforced by children just back from school), even if, in this constant ebb and flow of home and office, office and home, rumor was never quite exempt from further shaping before it settled down into its definitive form, the first major impact on it, what might be called \"the Monday spin,\" was always the principal determining factor.And so the mutability of truth swims throughout this novel. The counterchapters take a story about a bride marrying a snake; from that story, it posits several possible truths. Mark ostensibly leads leads a life as an artist, however, he has hallucinatory dreams of being a policeman.At the same time, I have to say Kadare's obsession with sex gets quite off-putting. Perhaps there's a deeper meaning to that, but I don't care to explore it."}, {"userName": "Tarah Luke", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31837430-tarah-luke", "userReview": "#1001books #691leftAlbania is probably one of those countries that I will never get to visit in my life, but the descriptions of its scenery and people almost make me feel like I went. There were some very interesting parts to this book, but also some really boring parts, and there were things that were brought up that weren't fully explained. An example might be the girl and her snake husband, which was a story that I thought had many parallels in other cultures' folklore, such as in the Greek and Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche, or the Scandinavian story of the Polar Bear King. I thought that Kadare had a bigger point to make with this story, but it never emerged that I saw. Another thing I wanted resolved was the artist's friend Zef, whose name could have alluded to Zephyr, or a wind that blows things away. Where he went, what happened to him-- this was never explained either.

Kadare's 'Spring Flowers, Spring Frost' is testament to that. Despite the gushing reviews and the generous comparisons to Gogol, Kafka and Orwell, I found this story to be extremely confusing. The aim of the novel was always a little bit out of my reach. I didn't quite understand the structure of the 'chapters' and 'counter-chapters'. Maybe I didn't try hard enough to make sense of it all, but I was expecting the story to have a sound direction at least, a place it was going or taking me. I am afraid to say, Kadare's characters were uninspiring, I simply wasn't interested in their wellbeing, which I have found to be absolutely crucial if a story is to at least keep my attention.There are, however, pockets of brilliance, but these are few and far between. When Kadare is writing about the strange ritualistic laws of the Kanun, it gets exciting. The story about the virgin who married a snake was engrossing, but I was quickly disappointed when Kadare didn't follow this up. The account itself stood out as a stand-alone piece of information that had no bearing on the reflections of Mark or the inhabitants of the town. Another thing I have noticed is this edition is translated from the French, which is translated from the original Albanian. This may also be the reason for the negative experience I had. If you are fluent in Albanian, or even French, I guess you my have a better chance of enjoying this short novel. I wouldn't recommend this book at all, purely because I think a better translation is desperately needed.I give this book 1/5 stars.

Quite a statement of conjecture...as I don't recall any others in my extensive library! This is a very strange piece of fiction from the former North Korea of the Balkans...where dictator, Enver Hoxha ruled for decades...& allowed his 'prisoners' to watch Norman Wisdom films portraying the irrepresible little man struggling manfully against the reactionary forces of malign capitalism! There is little here of such honest banality. It's all opaquely Balkan, where symbolic significance evades my gaze...and events defy my interpretations. Mark, the protagonist, is a painter of nudes - his apparent obsession with the strong resemblance between his lover's mysterious & beloved genitalia and the deep, camouflaged cave which may, or may not, contain sensitive state secrets & archaic files is a leitmotif of rare prurience! - and he agonises over what everything means in a post-Communist world, where a bank robbery can cause such consternation & a visiting delegation from the 'Council of Europe' is anticipated like the Three Kings!...or the European Union! (Money for everything!). I enjoyed lifting the stone on kanun...the ancient Mafia-like lore of blood-feud & family honour...& its revival after 1989...& Kadare writes...though this is a translation from exotic Albanian into French & then re-cast from French into English!...with a deft tone if not a clarity. Curious stuff...but I read it with something close to amusement & would gently recommend it...by way of a literary excursion away from familiar by-ways!....if you don't mind the recurring reverie on women's hidden & secretive recesses!

In these cases I tend to blame the translation.In contrast Spring Flower, Spring Frost is much more satisfying and bizarre in places as well. If The Successor was a dour adult then this novel is the teenager that has has one trip too many. Yet both feature politics and quite heavily.Albania is now a democratic state (so I guess we\u2019re in 1991) and Mark, a painter hears, about a bank robbery and sees two kids unearth a hibernating snake. This takes him by surprise as such events would never happen under Communist Albania. While he obsesses about the robbery and the snake he starts going on other mental tangents. Within the very brief 180 pages we get musings on Albanian Folklore (which figures snakes) , The theft of immortality via ancient Greek mythology, The Kanun \u2013 the Albanian code of laws regarding blood feuds and the iceberg that sunk The Titanic. On top of this he has to finish painting a nude portrait of his girlfriend ( The Kanun and her are entwined). Cleverly enough Kadare manages to mesh all these disparate musings altogether and tie them to the fall of communism. As one can expect the final chapter is the big enlightening one and is the \u2018grand finale\u2019As I finished Spring Flowers I instantly started to make mental comparisons and this is indeed the better book.

Algunos cr\u00edticos lo han relacionado, tal vez por su complejidad, con ciertas fases de Spiritus, pero esta novela se aleja en algunos aspectos de aquello, y aporta otros recursos no exentos de riesgo y, en algunos casos, quiz\u00e1s un riesgo que no ha resultado. De ah\u00ed, que sea una de las obras que menos me transmite de su autor, y que resulta dif\u00edcil desentra\u00f1arla, con una lectura como atascada en la que Kadar\u00e9 no termina de fluir como es habitual en otras novelas.Dentro de un texto que en muchas ocasiones parece descentrado y con problemas de manant\u00edo, sin embargo, se plantean algunas cuestiones que, aunque apuntadas en las anteriores obras de su autor, no se hab\u00edan abordado de una forma tan directa como para resultar el meollo de una novela: el comunismo ha ca\u00eddo y una nueva Albania se presenta al mundo. Esta quiebra del r\u00e9gimen de Hoxha permite la ocasi\u00f3n de modernizarse, pero con la libertad reaparecen anteriores tradiciones, acogotadas por el comunismo, que son todo lo contrario al sin\u00f3nimo de la modernidad.Y si algo ha estado sojuzgado por el r\u00e9gimen, eso ha sido el derecho alban\u00e9s secular, su codigo de sangre conocido como kanun. La deuda y la venganza de sangre son instituciones retrogradas pero, prohibidas durante decenas de a\u00f1os, aparecen tras la quiebra comunista como un signo de modernizaci\u00f3n, de liberaci\u00f3n. Lo viejo, as\u00ed, moment\u00e1neamente se hace nuevo, en una paradoja hist\u00f3rica, y el pa\u00eds anteriormente oprimido y ahora libre, entra en conflicto, sin llegar a entender que se\u00f1ales proporcionan la modernidad y cuales significan el gran atraso.De esa manera, en Fr\u00edas flores de marzo se refieren diferentes comportamientos que arrastran de la mano la idea de modernidad para el alban\u00e9s desencadenado. Una de ellas, que se repite asiduamente e impregna el texto con reflexiones recurrentes, es el atraco a un banco, un suceso impensable de haber sido cometido durante todo el periodo comunista, pero un hecho com\u00fan y a diario en el mundo occidental, en el mundo libre. En Albania ya se atracan los bancos\u2026 al estilo de las pel\u00edculas; Albania ha entrado con los atracos (y con la inseguridad ciudadana) en la modernidad de Occidente y del capitalismo.La inseguridad ciudadana, o el deseo de mayor seguridad, es otro s\u00edntoma bien curioso. La supuesta inviolabilidad de domicilio, desde luego, no estaba muy garantizada durante el reinado de la Sigurimi. Sin embargo, el temor a que irrumpieran los servicios policiales en la casa y en mitad de la noche para efectuar una detenci\u00f3n era el miedo tipo del alban\u00e9s. Ahora, con la ca\u00edda del sistema y la desaparici\u00f3n tutelar del Estado, las viviendas est\u00e1n seguras ante la patada en la puerta de la represi\u00f3n policial y pol\u00edtica, pero expuestas a los robos y a los criminales comunes.El protagonista de la novela, el pintor Mark Gurabardhi, pronto instala nuevas cerraduras y puertas anti-atraco en su estudio. Abraza, as\u00ed, un pedacito de occidentalizaci\u00f3n que viene de la mano del p\u00e1nico, de la angustia para salvaguardar la propiedad privada, de la toma de conciencia de poseer pertenencias potencialmente arrebatables por delincuentes comunes y no en nombre del socialismo, del Estado o del bien com\u00fan.Una occidentalizaci\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n llega a las costumbres sexuales. En ese sentido ser\u00e1 la amante de Mark qui\u00e9n entienda de diferentes formas de modernizar los comportamientos en la cama (el pubis depilado, determinadas pr\u00e1cticas europeizantes). Son tiempos modernos, que entran en tensi\u00f3n con las costumbres desarrolladas por el anterior r\u00e9gimen comunista y colisionan con la recuperaci\u00f3n de las tradiciones milenarias y arraigadas que resurgen con fuerza.En mitad de este batido de modernidad, Kadar\u00e9 elige una estructura y un texto que tambi\u00e9n parece presentar id\u00e9nticas tensiones entre clasicismo e innovaci\u00f3n. A los cap\u00edtulos corrientes se les oponen lo que denomina contracap\u00edtulos, que vienen a ser fabulaciones o reflexiones m\u00edticas ancladas en historias cl\u00e1sicas, y que sacan al lector de la narraci\u00f3n de la historia principal, que es el devenir de Mark Gurabardhi.Estos contracap\u00edtulos son interludios on\u00edricos que recurren a la mitolog\u00eda griega y latina, una tradici\u00f3n que resulta un elemento siempre tan significativo en la novel\u00edstica de Kadar\u00e9, presentando as\u00ed un contrapunto a la perspectiva que de la historia y de Albania, y de los momentos actuales en los que se desarrolla la acci\u00f3n, posee Mark.De esta forma, el primer contracap\u00edtulo, amalgama varias cuestiones en diferentes planos literarios. Por un lado hay cierto eco del Kafka de La transformaci\u00f3n y de El proceso, por otro late una corriente que recuerda a Las metamorfosis de Ovidio, y por \u00faltimo convoca a los mitos y las leyendas fant\u00e1sticas del romanticismo alem\u00e1n, como la Ondina de Fouqu\u00e9, por ejemplo. El contracap\u00edtulo primero narra la boda y la noche de bodas de una mujer que, castigada sin saber muy bien qu\u00e9 delito ha cometido (al estilo de Josef K.) y con la permisividad de la familia, se enlaza con una serpiente.El contracap\u00edtulo segundo se centra en el denominado \u201cfuncionario de la muerte\u201d y en la historia de T\u00e1ntalo, que ha robado la inmortalidad y, tambi\u00e9n, sobre Prometeo y el hurto del fuego\u2026 interpretado como una enorme conjura pol\u00edtica en donde Zeus aparece como el Gran Tirano \u2013algo que Kadar\u00e9 ya hab\u00eda manifestado en su ensayo sobre Esquilo-, recurriendo el autor al motivo denominado como Gran Estratagema, pilar fundamental de sus novelas \u201cpol\u00edticas\u201d.El resto de los contracap\u00edtulos contin\u00faan con su funci\u00f3n on\u00edrica, casi surrealista, de ofrecer un contrapunto a la historia narrada. La toma de declaraci\u00f3n al iceberg que hundi\u00f3 el Titanic como si fuera un criminal pol\u00edtico, el descenso a unos infiernos circulares (Dante siempre presente en la novel\u00edstica de Kadar\u00e9) a la b\u00fasqueda de unos expedientes secretos que llevan, incluso, a los dirigentes socialistas y al sucesor del Gran L\u00edder a adentrarse en cavernas en pos de un misterioso archivo secreto que contiene documentos comprometedores\u2026Estos cap\u00edtulos a contrapelo de la narraci\u00f3n van iluminando la trama, a medida que el lector se va haciendo con un texto inc\u00f3modo, en una lucha que Kadar\u00e9 plantea, en este libro, con sus receptores que son, quiz\u00e1s, descifradores de todos esos mensajes ocultos que se concatenan mediante la imaginer\u00eda habitual kadariana, tal vez retorcida o algo mas desquiciada que de costumbre, hasta acariciar unas gotas de surrealismo.En ese sentido, Kadar\u00e9 apunta sin llegar a cristalizar, una innovaci\u00f3n bien moderna en Fr\u00edas flores de marzo, y es la de articular la novela en diferentes planos paralelos, con realidades diferentes que cohabitan, acerc\u00e1ndose a lo que se conoce como novela qu\u00e1ntica. El protagonista, Mark, arrastra la culpa de haber decepcionado a su padre, que siempre quiso que fuera oficial de polic\u00eda en lugar de pintor.De esa manera, en varias ocasiones la trama se desv\u00eda a un plano en el que Mark es polic\u00eda y se fija en sus actuaciones, para despu\u00e9s retomar la \u201cotra\u201d l\u00ednea narrativa de la presunta \u201crealidad\u201d del pintor. Se nos presentan dos mundos en los que suceden acciones distintas, salpicadas por interludios on\u00edricos que albergan saltos en el tiempo, quiebras y aceleraciones, como si la novela se hubiera desintegrado en part\u00edculas, y los trocitos los hubiera vuelto a montar el autor, desde\u00f1ando la linealidad, la coherencia temporal y la pura l\u00f3gica narrativa.La tensi\u00f3n entre lo antiguo y lo moderno, con la estructura narrativa elegida por Kadar\u00e9, tambi\u00e9n refleja esa tensi\u00f3n que vehiculiza la novela y, como ocurre en el texto, queda sin resolver, principal cuesti\u00f3n que presenta Fr\u00edas flores de marzo, la del avance dificultoso hacia la nada, hacia la irresoluci\u00f3n, hacia el complejo ed\u00edpico y de culpa que lo obstaculiza todo.El crimen de Estado, la degradaci\u00f3n moral que ha impuesto durante d\u00e9cadas el r\u00e9gimen comunista de Hoxha, horad\u00f3 tan hondo la conciencia de las gentes que obstaculiza cualquier avance. El p\u00e1nico ante la nueva situaci\u00f3n se resuelve con un salto al pasado, al momento anterior a Hoxha, con la recuperaci\u00f3n de las tradiciones m\u00edticas, b\u00e1rbaras, que proporcionan seguridad.As\u00ed, se realiza un descubrimiento; Mark Gurabardhi, el pintor, realiza ese descubrimiento, casi tan epif\u00e1nico como devastador: las tradiciones b\u00e1rbaras siempre han permanecido, el r\u00e9gimen de Hoxha era un r\u00e9gimen medieval y sanguinario, y los nuevos aires de la Europa occidental y su sociedad de libre consumo, no dejan de ser lo mismo.El avance, el progreso, la modernizaci\u00f3n, no es m\u00e1s que una mentira. Un imposible. Y Mark no puede m\u00e1s que sentir deseos de romper a llorar al t\u00e9rmino de la novela."}, {"userName": "Bob Newman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72341080-bob-newman", "userReview": "Mystery and History Surface after the FallSome years ago, a Swedish member of the Nobel Prize committee relieved himself of the view that Americans wouldn't be winning the Nobel Prize in Literature because they were, well, too American. It's a no-doubt primitive country addicted to pop culture (gasp !) and not given often to publishing the works of those writers admired by the Nobel Prize committee members (like himself). I was glad to read this gentleman's comments because it cleared up a mystery for me. That is, I realized why Ismail Kadare has not won the said prize. He is too Albanian. I fear that does mean that he is in some way compromised; he was unable to avoid history and wound up swallowing a bit too much of the fetid tides of dictatorship for the purist, puerile standards of the (luckier) members of the committee. Every nation, not to say every person, has their own buried, secret archives. They exist in the way water exists on Mars. We know it was there and may still be there, but it's hidden and we are not in a position to do anything about it. We should judge literature and not the behavior of a particular individual stuck in an awful situation. Tyrants try to wipe out the past in order to become the only focus, the only light in the darkness which spreads from them. When tyrants fall, the buried past returns, seeps up to the surface in unanticipated ways. In the case of Albania, we are talking about the return of the ancient blood feud [see \"Broken April\", also by Kadare] and its harsh laws after the end of Enver Hoxha and the communist regime. Interspersed with passages of modern banality, of almost European `normality\"---sex, love, jobs, and visiting delegations---are hidden icebergs that bob to the surface of life's ocean. The end of Communism didn't mean the beginning of modern life untrammeled. The legend of a girl marrying a snake that was really a man--things are never what they seem, you don't know what lies just beyond in the forest of symbols. Looking for the secret archives of the ancien regime, papers that would reveal all, people dig up mountainsides. We all want to know why those 46 years happened. A totally modern director of the local art center, who has revelled in a trip to Spain, is killed in the inexplicable revival of an old, nearly forgotten family feud. Mark Gurabardhi tries to get down to the essentials of his times pp.145-46 \"There was always something missing. And as soon as he tried to get it down on paper, he invariably left out some other trait....Obviously it was the hidden past that gave it all the value.\" The past is there, a low rumble that suddenly splits the night and transforms the present. An amazingly insightful, clever novel that never lectures, never becomes didactic. As usual, Kadare operates on several levels. It's all up to you to unravel as much as you can. In the labyrinth of your soul, you may seize upon SFSF as another brilliant book from a great writer. Then again, if you don't like myth and mystery, you may yawn and scratch your head. That's what the Nobel committee seems to be doing."}, {"userName": "Daniel Hagedorn", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67842717-daniel-hagedorn", "userReview": "Maybe reading books too, are about places and moments in time, and if so, I began this book in the town of Koper, Slovenia and finished in the morning while staying in Split, Croatia.

On the face of it, this work ticked all of the boxes for me - a contemporary work (exploring the social upheavals of Albanian society since the demise of communism there), a native - and well respected - author (compared in the blurb to Orwell, Kafka and Gogol, no less) and an interesting premise: the return of Albania's notorious Kanun 'blood laws'.These laws were developed pre-communism and have indeed seen a resurgence of such since communism's fall. Whilst these are actually a complicated set of feudal laws relating to social relationships and land ownership; this novel focuses on the blood law element that states: \"someone is allowed to kill another person to avenge an earlier murder or moral humiliation.\"However, in the context of this novel, this subject matter is used more as a device to explore the inner torment and anxieties of the work's (largely unsympathetic) protagonist - the artist Mark Gurabardhi.And there, for me, is the problem. Whilst reading this work I did gain a glimpse of life in contemporary Albania - the coffee shops, the occasional black-outs of small village life, the left-over paranoia from the communist era - yet I never felt engaged with the plot. For a start Mark is a particularly unlikeable character who - through his own unwillingness to engage with events around him - impedes our own attempts to immerse ourselves in the plot. He is also particularly misogenistic towards his (possibly pregnant) girlfriend which - coupled with his rather unsettling fantasies about her possible incestuous infidelity with her brother - serve only to alienate the reader even further.The main narrative is interspersed with several \"Counter-chapters\" which exposit upon topics as diverse as Tantalus, Oedipus Rex and the sinking of the Titanic. Again, I failed to see the connection with the main narrative, although it may well be that I am failing to pick up on culturally-specific allegorical references here...Still, despite my gripes I came away from this book with a certain sense of life in a small snowbound town in northern Albania... but, literarily, nothing more.
