This book was generously provided to me in exchange for an honest review by the author. I started this series with the six prequels and instantly fell in love. Then, when I began the actual series, my love turned to obsession. I have been waiting for a long time for the finale and this book was everything I wanted it to be, and more. I have been with the characters of this book as they evolved from kids to tough survivalists. They have experienced so much loss but have also found so much love. Jake, Zoe, Jason, Dani, and the rest of their group have settled in to life on the farm in California. They have helped to start neighboring farms and the group of homesteads has come to be known as Hope Valley. They are near their childhood home town now known as New Bodega where they can go to trade. Each day they learn more of how to not only survive but to flourish on the farm without the everyday things we all take for granted in our lives. Did they actually let their guard down or was it inevitable that danger would once again threaten them? It\u2019s the end of November and as Jason and Dani are out on a foraging walk through the woods and enjoying some time together alone, the unthinkable happens and they are once again torn apart. The rest of the group goes into rescue mode as they try to figure out what actually happened. In a world when super powers are the norm, this is not an easy task. But they are determined to bring back their missing family member whether alive or not.\n The rescue team finds their own danger as they are ripped apart and forced to rescue one of their own. And once again, I am so glad I read the prequels first as an evil character from the past re-emerges on his own quest for power. \n This book takes us from the farm to Sacramento and back to the Colony in Colorado Springs. Our group experiences love, loss and the addition of new members to their family. Through it all the bonds of love they have formed are strong and hold them together.Will this group I have grown to love finally find the peace they have longed for on their farm. Is there hope for some semblance of a safe and happy life in this new world they are now in? Will they ever be out from under the danger from the General? There is so much they have been through. What must they still endure? The book takes us from the end of November through New Year\u2019s Eve as this family of sorts is forced to defend themselves against horrors that are now everyday events in this new life. But they also prove that love and laughter is still possible. And that if they never give up hope, that just maybe, each new dawn could bring them closer to a safe and happy life in this new reality they are forced to call their norm."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7395171-dianne", "userReview": "The Virus. Most people were killed, but a few, became \u2018more.\u2019 Imbued with growing talents, they were the survivors, they became the hunted as others became evil personified and one crazed and power hungry man wanted them all under his control, as any cost. This is another episode in the fight to survive, to live and to re-build a world nearly drained of its very soul, the greatest battle is coming and one vision tells them it will be here, Before the Dawn. Prepare yourselves for the final showdown between good and evil, as Lindsey Pogue and Lindsey Fairleigh join creative forces once again in book four of The Ending Series, Before the Dawn.Lindsey Pogue and Lindsey Fairleigh are a writing team that shares the same love for their work and it shows as they pull out all the stops in this gut-clenching tale! Sometimes, I wanted to cry, I feared the unknown along with the characters and I rejoiced at reunions that held powerful emotional strings. Follow along as this group becomes the David to the Goliath of evil steamrolling their way as they combine all of their powers to make what could be their last stand! Ms. Fairleigh and Ms. Pogue had me holding my breath a times, re-reading to relive the best parts and saddened to have to say good bye to some of the finest and most loyal \u201cfriends\u201d I have ever made! These authors can write, they know how to give life to their pages and draw each reader in, fully and completely! If an author can have me re-thinking events as if they truly happened while sorting out my emotions, they have mastered their craft and done it well! And just revenge? They nailed that one perfectly!Simply breathtaking! Start to finish, constant action, and constant turmoil haunt the survivors, their ragtag family and the world around them. Heroes will die as unlikely heroes rise up against the vile megalomaniac and his inhuman army on the march. Zoe and Dani will undergo their own metamorphoses into strong and powerful leaders in their own right as they live through more pain and doubt, more losses and more heartwarming gains. Love is renewed, families find joy in the middle of sorrow and the group becomes as one cohesive body. Will sins of the past be forgiven? Can new members of their \u201cfamily\u201d be trusted? Where there is hope, anything can happen in this uncharted new world!I received an ARC edition from Lindsey Pogue in exchange for my honest review.Series: The Ending - Book 4Publication Date: November 17, 2015Publisher: L2 BooksISBN-10: 0988715473ISBN-13: 978-0988715479Genre: Post -Apocalyptic fantasyPrint Length: 427 pagesAvailable from: Amazon / Barnes & NobleFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Anita Boakes", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34798556-anita-boakes", "userReview": "read all books waiting to start reading book4 awesome can't put books down,so well written,BEFORE THE DAWN is next just finished reading OUT OF THE ASHES, give them a go, I guarantee you will want to keep reading more."}, {"userName": "Jenni Lind", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1186076-jenni-lind", "userReview": "Before the Dawn by Lindsey Fairleigh and Lindsey Pogue is the fourth and final full novel in The Ending series.This entire series (and accompanying novellas) is something I stumbled across in January 2014 and have happily devoured. While the entire series is amazing I think this final book is just perfect. Without spoilers, this book has so much going on but manages to stay on a clear overall line and give you the best parts of each character that you've grown to love (or love to hate) throughout all of the prior books and manages to end the series in a way that wants you to know more but are content with how things have ended in the series.I highly suggest anyone interested in dystopian, world-ending, or YA/New Adult novels look into this series:The Ending Series:  Book 1 - After The Ending Book 2 - Into The Fire Book 3 - Out Of The Ashes  Book 4 - Before The Dawn The Ending Beginnings:  I - Carlos  II - Mandy  III - Vanessa IV - Jake  V - Clara  VI - Jake & Clara I am utterly devastated that there won't be any more novels after this but I am 100% sure there will be more wonderful books by Lindsey & Lindsey that I'll be reading for many years to come!"}, {"userName": "C", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42353548-c", "userReview": "Where to begin? I don't want to write this review because it means that the Ending Series has come to an end. I have followed this series and have fallen in love with each and every character.This was probably the best book in the series - hands down. We finally learn so much more and questions are answered.I am beyond happy with how this book ended. Am I pissed it ended, hell yes! I wish it could go on forever. However, like all good things, it must come to an end.I felt sad for the ones that were lost and beyond excited for the lives of the ones who are still around. Dani kicked ass in her little spitfire way, while Zoe continued to be a strong, independent badass. I fell more in love with Jason and Jake.We come full circle for a certain mother and finally learn the truth behind certain actions.Okay, I'm rambling now because I haven't come to terms with the fact it's over.I'll sum it up in a few words: READ. THIS. SERIES!!"}, {"userName": "K.A.

I read the first 3 novels in quick succession and eagerly awaited this fourth installment. It didn't disappoint!Every book in this series had me gripped.The authors are fantastic at pulling you in and not letting you go. There are so many emotions, conflicts and challenges but the 'family' are united. The characters are well written, so much so that I never could decide who I loved more (especially between Jake and Jason).Buy them. Read them.

I\u2019ll admit, the third book in the series was probably my least favorite, and reading the third and fourth book in the span of just a few days had me a little burned out. I went into the fourth book full of trepidation that it was going to be yet another long drag through a narrative where very little happened. Luckily, that wasn\u2019t so.Let me first say that the writing in Before The Dawn was pretty damn flawless. I didn\u2019t notice any obvious typos, awkward sentences, or grammatical errors. Not a single one\u2014which is pretty amazing. The narrative flowed smoothly at a nice pace throughout, and other than a few short moments at the beginning of the book (Anna\u2019s sections of the book weren\u2019t my favorite), I didn\u2019t feel the need to skim.The characters were unique and complex, and though I sometimes had difficulty throughout the series telling Dani/Zoe and their respective J-named boyfriends apart by tone, I enjoyed their company. Their world was rich, fraught with danger and uncertainty, and unlike the previous book, had some pretty great action oriented moments. This was probably one of my favorite books in the series thus far\u2014it may even be my favorite. The story felt wrapped up by the end, and though it had it\u2019s stab at an HEA ending, it wasn\u2019t perfect\u2014which kept it from falling into the familiar romance genre trope that often ends with everyone pregnant, married, and all the bad guys defeated. Okay, so maybe there\u2019s a smidgen of trope involved, but it was pulled off really well.Overall, I really enjoyed the book, and I think it was a fantastic ending to the series. I would highly recommend it to anyone who\u2019s been following the series thus far\u2014including those who, like me, may not have enjoyed the third book quite as much."}, {"userName": "Boxy Frown", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5560719-boxy-frown", "userReview": "For the full First Look,head over to Heroes and Heartbreakers!Before the Dawn delivers with action, adventure, resolution, and drama in a huge way!"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5756494-megan", "userReview": "AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Mylia Muse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1539012-mylia-muse", "userReview": "A wonderful finale to a wonderful series.

I read the first book and was intrigued enough to read more. The second book really seizes your heart and captivates you to finish the book quickly. I couldn't have stopped reading if I wanted to. The women in this book are very strong characters. They enable the men to be more powerful with their \"abilities.\" Abilities are skills that you were given with the end of the world. The world was destroyed by a virus that killed over three fourths of all people. There is no electricity, running water, cars, or cell phones. The highways are littered with the cars/trucks that run out of gas or the owner died trying to escape. This series is about two girlfriends that survive and the \"family\" that they acquire while trying to get to meet up at the safe place they had decided to go to. What a four book series!

The author is no Anne Rice but she has fleshed out characters and an interesting plot. The series has strong adult female characters with just enough self-doubt to be believable.
