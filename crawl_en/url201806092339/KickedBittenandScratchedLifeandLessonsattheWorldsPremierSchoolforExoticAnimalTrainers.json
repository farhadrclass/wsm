I would have appreciated some discussion of the ethics of keeping zoo animals as student projects or even some sort of summary of the \"lessons\" applicable to life in general. Sutherland barely brushes the surface of the topic and sticks mainly to personal vignettes and somewhat interesting stories about the animals. The impression I was left with after reading Kicked, Bitten and Scratched was that life at EATM is unbelievably tiring and students are on the point of breakdown and exhaustion for their entire two years with dubious payoff at the end. The animals, whose names are confusing to keep track of, seem to get a bit of a short stick with constantly rotating student trainers and what appear to be fairly small cages and minimal exercise opportunities. The passion of the students for the animals is clearly present and Sutherland is plainly reluctant to make any sort of judgements, but as a result the reader feels they have too little information to have an opinion on the subject at hand other than that EATM is exhausting, a very odd assortment of people end up there, and only a few go on to actually have careers with animals. In a certain sense this book feels like it could've been a pithy and engaging long article in, say, the NYT magazine, rather than an entire book. That said, I thought it was interesting and definitely raised some issues worth thinking about. The whole thing felt more like a slightly too extended journalistic report rather than a deeply explored, well researched account of what is a more and more relevant topic as various animal species become threatened in the wild and need better conservation efforts. I was disappointed in the lack of what one might call a main point to the book. All that being said, if one has an interest in animals it's a pretty quick and engaging light read, and Sutherland certainly seems to paint a clear picture of what it's like to go to EATM. If you're thinking of applying, read this book!"}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "I can see the point of the people here who have complained that the book lacked focus. Sutherland was faced with a rather difficult situation: She wanted to talk about a place, and to chronicle the inhabitants of that place, both animal and human (or animals, both human and non-, if you prefer). However, there were two many of both ilks to follow in any comprehensible way. So instead she chose the non-traditional route of profiling the place rather than the people. This did mean that characters tended to appear out of nowhere and then disappear, but it also allowed her greater latitude in which stories she told. I also get the sense given that some characters were described rather than named (such as \"the young woman who raised baby deer in her house\") that there may have been some privacy and legal issues as well. This could be a bit confusing at times, especially if you were also unfamiliar with animals. (One reviewer here complained that he didn't know what a cavy was. I didn't even think of that aspect and I'd bet, after having been immersed in the zoo world for so long, Amy Sutherland didn't either. So perhaps a good editor may have helped.) The solution to this, I would have said, was to provide an epic-fantasy-like cast of characters, or even an index would have helped.However, even with that caveat I greatly enjoyed this book. It offered an interesting window through which to view the world of a college that trains animal trainers. It was enough (almost) to make one want to pack up and apply. (Not quite though -- I still think my job's just a tiny bit cooler, and probably much more well suited for my skill set.) This is a book everyone who's interested in zoos, animals, behavior, or dog training should read."}, {"userName": "Lauren Paprocki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12309810-lauren-paprocki", "userReview": "I read the book Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched: Life and Lessons at the World's Premier School for Exotic Animal Trainers by Amy Sutherland. In this novel it describes every aspect of life working at the famous Moorpark Teaching Zoo. In every chapter the book touches on different areas at the zoo and tells numerous memories and stories that different students their have come across. I give this book a 5 star rating because of my passion for animals and how it hides no secrets in sharing hot ruthless the work is. \"Many of these students have always felt out of step with the world. Here, they can talk about animals all day and no one will give them a sideways glance. Being among their own has it's downside, though: animal people typically aren't at their best with people, even other animal people.\" (Amy Sutherland, Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched: Life and Lessons at the World's Premier School for Exotic Animal Trainers). I choose this quote because it is not only a perfect explanation of how most \"Animal People\" are, but on a deeper subject it is the perfect explanation of me. Which is also why I think this book is great, because I can relate to what they have written on a personal level. This relates to class in a more indirect way in the fact that it is a group of memoirs in a non-fiction novel. Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched tells personal stories and puts them all together to make one great book about the teaching zoo. It relates to class in the ways we tell our stories in so many essays. This is defiantly another book for animal lovers and people who want to find out what real work goes into training animals and running a zoo. What a wonderful read!"}, {"userName": "Cj", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961912-cj", "userReview": "Pretty tasty mind candy, especially for me since I consider a fish tank the ideal pet. It seemed like a very good perspective on those, to me, odd folk who are willing to put up with a great deal of crap (in every sense of that word) to be around animals.The title sums up things pretty nicely. This is NOT a book about animal training, it is a book about the people (and animals) involved in the two-year EATM program at Moorpark college.I am kinda sensitive to overly dramatic prose, and at times Sutherland can seem a little sensational in her narration of the life and times of the denizens of EATM. But, it is highly appropriate that the initials sound like \"eat 'em\", because the students level of commitment to the program is challenged, it sounds like, on a daily basis, making for a very exciting, and occasionally graphic, read. Though, this might not be the best book for the squeamish. I do some volunteer work for a local aquarium, and I was very surprised at how the description of the students so matched the trainers (the husbandry staff) I come in contact with when I volunteer. Very interesting perspective on the commitment and mindset of an animal trainer, also some very interesting ethical questions brought, fairly gently, to the reader's attention. As long as you don't mind quite a bit of gory detail, and a very straight forward (some might consider non-pc) look at a year at EATM, it is a pretty cool read."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202774-tristan", "userReview": "I was drawn to this book by the Op-Ed that Sutherland wrote promoting it when it came out. The piece, titled What Shamu Taught Me About My Marriage, was about applying animal training techniques to humans, specifically her husband.In the first 100 pages that I was able to read before I completely lost interest, there was very little discussion of animal behavior. The book details life at the Exotic Animal Training and Management program at Moorpark Community College, but never gets close to any particular students to form any characters. The writing is mediocre, and the final straw for me was the jump to present tense in a chapter on the fires that put the school at risk.Throughout, I felt like I was reading a auditing agency's report on the school; though the time spent researching it is evident, I didn't have the interest in the subject to propel me through the rest of the book. For those with that interest -- in animal training or the Moorpark school -- it would be worthwhile. Everyone else, I suggest looking up the Op-Ed she wrote for the New York Times (or maybe her later book that I haven't ready: [Book: What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage: Lessons for People from Animals and Their Trainers]."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5221950-stacey", "userReview": "I am really disappointed by this book. I assumed it would be a memoir written by someone in the exotic animal training field; obviously, I realized immediately this was an incorrect assumption and instead was written by a journalist. No big deal. The big deal occurred when the author repeatedly misused scientific terms and misidentified animal species. I am neither a scientist nor am I in the veterinary or zoological fields; however, I have a knowledge of basic animal species differentiation, and it is so obnoxious to have the author use terms as synonyms which are not synonyms at all. Turtles and tortoises are not the same thing. Camels and dromedaries are not the same thing. Guano is not a synonym for droppings or excrement. I am shocked this slipped past the author and editors and can only imagine how grating it is to an actual scientist to read these sloppy mistakes. Finally, the book was full of misogynistic characterizations: women are gossipy, women are scared of insects, women are squeamish, women are easily seduced. These repetitious depictions undermined the entire premise of the novel being about a highly competitive program set in a high-risk environment. I wish I hadn't wasted my time."}, {"userName": "Keegan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134918-keegan", "userReview": "Of course this was a book in my mom's library that I read while I was taking care of her exotic animal farm while she was out of town. I'd never heard of this school before my mom told me about this book. Really fascinating. Unlike my mom, I am not at all interested in attending such a school (--my grandma's words: \"You couldn't *pay* me to go to such a school.\"), but I enjoyed reading about it. It was probably more interesting to me because my mom is such an animal person than it would have been otherwise.

A self described animal lover, she spends a year at the exotic animal training college, Moorpark, in CA, following a year of students through the main travails and trials of the year. It is definitely a very interesting book, and you learn all sorts of factoids about animals and get a glimpse into the world of animal training--which one rarely thinks about, but is so cool! You almost want to go join up, except that the pay is shit and you have to learn to be immune to pain. So maybe not. There was not so much about how to cross human and animal behavior--but the book certainly told the soap opera of the school. So, like any reality show where you put a bunch of strong minded people into an intense situation, things happen. Sometimes interesting things, and sometimes annoying ones. The book was interesting enough, but I don't feel particularly enlightened. I do have a heightened respect for anyone who works with animals, and appreciate the many fine lines that need to be walked.
