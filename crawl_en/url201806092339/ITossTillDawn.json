It deals with a youth of eighteen, just out of high school. It is more than coincidence that my son was eighteen when he began writing this book. I was mortified when I read this and saw the similarities in his life. I'm glad he toned it down from its original draft. You have to read it. He is presently a Junior at Grand Canyon University as an English major. He is a conno..conno..lover of books. His two buddies and he have started their own personal book club. Each have written their own novels/novelettes. I told them to get involved in other book clubs, having read and critqued some of the greatest books written. Alas, I am afraid they are becoming book snobs, of sorts. They can't get enough."}, {"userName": "Tami", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1472968-tami", "userReview": "I read this weekend. It is a quick read. I would recommend it to anyone that has felt as Chase has. Looking back to middle school and high school and even early college (Teen Years) I never felt as if there was no purpose to life, so I can't relate to Chase. I did like the characters he met on his trip, and I have felt the need to just get in the car and drive. Great \"finding the meaning to life\" story."}], "description": "Alone and adrift in the world, Chase Pollard wakes up one morning and makes the decision to abandon it all, leaving behind his family, friends, and everything he's ever known. Thus begins Ben Hewitt's debut novel, I Toss Till Dawn, the episodic road adventure of one teen seeking meaning and purpose for his life. By eighteen, he's already burnt out and empty, having tried drugs, alcohol, and relationships in an effort to fill the void. An emotionally gripping ride, I Toss Till Dawn examines a teens struggle for hope in a climate of modern despair. With each new chapter a captivating turn from the last, Chase's road odyssey forces him to face his inner demons, leading to a dramatic conclusion that will forever leave him changed. Teenagers as well as older readers will find value and enjoyment in this contemporary tale of a youth's struggle against the pain and loneliness of the world.", "title": "I Toss Till Dawn", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467520-i-toss-till-dawn", "average": 4.38, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347366392l/8467520.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/172014.Ben_Hewitt", "name": "Ben Hewitt"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Biography Memoir"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467520-i-toss-till-dawn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6851796-the-town-that-food-saved", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20176373-home-grown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059391-saved", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24350206-the-nourishing-homestead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298195.Bicycling_Magazine_s_New_Cyclist_Handbook"]}
