Excellent and brilliant collection of short stories!All of them were very good and enjoyable having a wide range of ideeas and subjects to debate on.The texts aren't very long and this is a plus for the writer that in a short length of words he creates believable characters and unique worlds.Like I said before, I love his writing and ideeas and listening to this audio I wasn't disappointed at all.Recommended!"}, {"userName": "Kev", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34286166-kev", "userReview": "4.5 stars.An enjoyable selection of short stories from an author whom I like very much.

Astonishing journey that twists and winds in unexpected directions.Mixtures of Lovecraft, and other Peter Clines characters makes this a collection an incredible journey that is well worth the time."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12534351-annie", "userReview": "I loved these short stories, and maybe they will tie me over until Peter can give us a new one...WRITE FASTER MR CLINES!!!!!

(I guess I should pick up more anthologies.) Some of the stories truly have unexpected twists (first and fourth story, both involving time machines, ) that blew my mind, while others' twists were kinda apparent (story #2 about the superhero, #6 about resurrection, and the last story.) from the very beginning. Couple of stories were simply good because of their content, without needing any twists - story #7 about the student studying zombies, the story about a robot finding Man and the title story. The other 3 of the total 11 stories were meh. Not boring or bad; just not as good as the others. So, overall a pretty good book.The narration was top notch too. I was drawn into each of the story and it was like watching a netflix series.Definitely would recommend."}, {"userName": "Jami", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami", "userReview": "So, what is not to like about the writing of Peter Clines paired with Ray Porter's voice?!?!? This was an excellent compilation of short stories that were well narrated by both narrators. I particularly enjoyed the first short story (the title escapes me) and the title story. The stories were of varying lengths and all of them kept my interest. The only complaint I have is that some of them ended too abruptly; but perhaps that is just a sign that they were so good that I wanted more! The abrupt endings of some of the stories was what kept this from being a 5 star rating."}, {"userName": "MGMaudlin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3429191-mgmaudlin", "userReview": "I am a fan of Peter Clines, especially of his novels 14 and THE FOLD, but these short stories, while well crafted, read more like experimental scenes from possible novels than true short stories. Yes, they wrap up fine and have Twilight Zone twists at the end, but in most of the cases some vital ingredient is missing, making them bits of entertainment rather than memorable stories."}, {"userName": "Renny Barcelos", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326578-renny-barcelos", "userReview": "Peter Clines is truly a wonderful author. I usually don't care about short stories, can't get engaged in such a small frame and then suddenly it's over, but these? They are all gold. He tells one hell of a good story after another in just some minutes (audiobook version). Can't wait for the next full novel."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10495729-ryan", "userReview": "Listened via Audible (this is an Audible exclusive). This is a collection of sci-fi/horror/futuristic short stories, and it was GREAT! I've read (technically listened) to a few other Clines books and they've all been amazing - this was no different. If you want an easy, interesting, and nerdy listen for your commute, I highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4175210-shane", "userReview": "Great collection of short stories. They all fall some where in the horror and or science fiction genre. There is even a story set in the Ex-verse for those lime me clamoring for more of that story.

Usually short-story collections from novelists feel like someone just emptied their drawer of all the stuff that they couldn't make work as a novel.
