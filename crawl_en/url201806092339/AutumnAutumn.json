There's a moment in the book when they're hiding out and realise they're being steadily surrounded by zombies. Why? Because of a loud 'constantly thumping' generator, the house being lit up like Blackpool and smoke pouring out the chimney from a nice hearty fire. When they realise they might have to forgo these things, they get sad because they can't imagine life without treats. The country in tatters, friends and family dead, dead people walking around and potential human extinction is something they all make an effort to get over, but no electric to watch DVDs? Unacceptable, apparently. The characters were infuriating. Apart from them boomeranging from one extreme personality to the next, they were such dull, one dimensional people I would have much preferred to go it alone than be stuck with them during the end of the world. One moment Michael is telling Emma that, regardless of her feelings or opinions, humanity is gone, never coming back, no use crying about blah blah blah, the next he's anxiously asking whether or not mankind can rebuild itself and what they can do. Carl goes outside, touches plenty of the zombies, Michael doesn't hesitate to hurtle through a crowd of them, then a few pages later they're too scared to go outside again and have to (alternately) talk each other round. I think the problem is they're never developed. The only one who does any sort of changing is Carl, and that's mostly downhill. You know how in Dawn Of The Dead when Anna steps outside to see the world gone to hell? I love that. I love the uncertainty, the fear and the adrenaline fueled mayhem as survivors battle to save their arses. There is nothing of the sort here. People literally just drop down dead and then it's 10+ pages of the survivors being too scared to go outside. I didn't dislike the way the people died, nor the order of things when they started getting back up, but, my god, give me something to sink my teeth into. Where's the carnage?! The chaos? Save for the odd pile-up and the constant references to 'decaying corpses', there's nothing new and exciting happening. One character just goes home and goes back to bed 'in a panic' when things kick off. The writing is very, very flat, not to mention fairly poor. It doesn't read easily and suffers from A LOT of repetition. The only way he can describe something is 'decayed/decaying', every character starts every second sentence 'Christ!' 'Jesus,...' or 'Bloody hell!'. The conversation goes round...and round...and round, no issue is ever resolved. The constant exaggeration wasn't really necessary, since it didn't add any sort of fear to an already dull plot. I think the author used it as a (cheap) ploy to make the situation appear a lot more dangerous but, for reasons I'm not really sure about, it aggravated me. I get that the newly quiet world means sound carries and causes a chain reaction but the 'thousands upon thousands upon thousands' of 'decaying corpses' find their way to a house the main characters had trouble finding just stinks to me. Especially since the zombies were supposed to have to attention span of a 6 month old. I did like the cycle of the zombies and how they became more vicious over a length of time. I also picked up on the enthusiasm of the author, which is always a good thing. I can't get away from the fact this book was published way before David Moody was ready, though. I know that it was put online for free when he was a 'frustrated writer', presumably when he had had no luck with traditional publishing houses. If so, reading through this shows that they were not wrong to turn him down. Saying that, I do realise this was written about 10 years ago and so I'm holding out for Autumn: The City to see if he's improved."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 StarsI am not sure why the reviews are so all over the place with this book. This is a top notch zombie thriller that is a slight variation on the standard post apocalyptic story. This is my second David Moody novel which I have read, Hater being the first.Things that make this book stand out. One interesting aspect was, wholly shit Moody wasted no time wiping out the human population. From one minute to the next, schools, towns, cities, and then countries fell dead to an apparent virus. A second cool part of this book was how those few survivors had to \u00a0quickly come to grips with the fact that the world has ended, and that they were alive with no apparent direction to go.\u00a0Michael, Carl, and Emma, our stories main heroes meet each other along with 23 other survivors soon after all has gone quiet in the world. \u00a0This group thinks that they are safe together at the community center, but they quickly disagree as to their future. Without giving away any of the cool story line, things change and our 3 protagonists leave the safety of the group to find their own way. The last alternative take on this genre is the fact that the survivors were not killers. There are no kick ass zombie beheading stories, or mass killings to talk about. This book focused on what it would be like to lose everything. To lose all you ever had, ever loved, and ever dreamed. Then it forced them to decide how to go on. All great stuff.The slow building of tension and danger, coupled with the slow changes to the world, after such an incredibly fast destruction gave this book an awesome feel of dread. While clearly a book one, it does have a good start and ending point. I look forward to reading the rest of this series. To me, this is a post apoc must read."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "Ninety-nine percent of the population has died in less than twenty-four hours, most of them dropping dead wherever they happened to be when the sickness struck.A group of survivors makes its way to a flimsy community center.  When some of the dead suddenly struggle to their feet and begin to wander about, three of the group decide they might be better off holing up in the less populated countryside. The others, forgetting what happened to the idiots who decided to wait for help in the dining room of The Poseidon Adventure, decide to stay put.This book is filled with characters who I DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK WITH IN ANY EMERGENCY. They show no foresight. True, they can be forgiven for not anticipating that the dead will become ambulators. Few people expect that to happen...BUT...no one even considered the possibility of marauding bands of armed and violent survivors coming to raid their meager food supplies? Yeesh! These people have no imagination whatsoever!The book has a long, s-l-o-w build up. The dead are pretty disoriented when they first stumble to their feet. Aside from the fact that they are CORPSES and they are WALKING AROUND, they're not scary at all. Anyone who thought last season's The Walking Dead was too boring, should probably stay away from this one. I, however, thought there was a great, encroaching creepiness, and I was kept pretty nervous waiting for the ax to fall. And then, with no warning, the dead turn nasty. While they don't seem to be hungry for brains, they ARE REALLY PISSED at the living, and you basically don't want to mess with them. And before you know it, things are quickly looking hopeless for our intrepid little trio.I'm torn between three and four stars. There is really nothing new here, but all the same, it kept me turning the pages. Apparently, there are sequels, but I probably won't continue with the series."}, {"userName": "Victor *we were on a break!*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32798006-victor-we-were-on-a-break", "userReview": "11am Tues Sept99% of the world\u2019s population is deadOkay.I didn\u2019t realize that this was previously released for free online and made into a series and a movie. If this were published today, I would say that it was unoriginal and offered nothing new other than a glimpse into the lives of some survivors. Seeing that it\u2019s more than ten years old, it was probably fresh back then. Let me walk this back a bit, the dead here are... different, so that's original.Sometimes we read these stories and gloss over or miss how catastrophic an event like this is. In this one 99% of the people in the world dies in 24 hrs. Shortly thereafter some of them start moving, and then they become violent. Even if you left out the reanimating part, being in the 1% that is still alive has to be frightening. The feeling of aloneness has to be suffocating. My mom says I'm antisocial - I like to think of myself as a loner, like Lone Wolf AKA Leonard \"Lenny\" Kosnowski. Even for me, being this alone is overwhelming.  To want to befriend anyone to preserve your sanity; to need to befriend even unlikable people to preserve your life. Not to mention, surviving in a world where you have to fend for yourself: where all of the conveniences that you\u2019ve grown accustomed to are no longer available, or won\u2019t be for much longer. No more Diet Pepsi :( Scary, right?There is something in the writing that makes this feel real. Maybe because there are no superhero types; just real ordinary people caught up in something that none of them (except our preppers in the NW) are prepared for. Their fears, hopes, and indecision are believable. Their stupid mistakes, a little less believable. To be fair, some of the mistakes are due to lack of imagination. There\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m yelling at them to take this particular item with them to protect their hideout but they don\u2019t. They could\u2019ve used it, but then there would have been less tension in the story. Silly me, always wanting to be safe.I didn\u2019t like any of the characters. Which is understandable given the circumstances. These are adults faced with a catastrophic event with nowhere to turn to for guidance, answers or security. Freaking out a bit is par for the course.The author co-wrote the screenplay for the movie Autumn (2009). It was bad. Just goes to show you that even having the author write the screenplay won\u2019t guarantee a good product. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen it but IIRC, it could have benefited from good actors and a bigger budget. If it couldn\u2019t get both, then better actors. The atmosphere the author created in the book obviously didn\u2019t translate to the big screen. I enjoyed this for what it was, but I am not sure if I\u2019ll continue with the series. Having said that, I recommend you read this book, then watch the movie.How cool is that cover? I wrote this review just so I could show it off on my blog\ud83d\ude42 Okay, 90% cover, 10% to share my thoughts \ud83d\ude1b"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104004-jessica", "userReview": "\u201cBillions died in less than 24 hours.\u201dMost zombie stories begin the same way. Take a random, ordinary day; add a mysterious plague that kills a great percentage of the population; focus on a handful of survivors as they seek each other out and come to terms with the fact that their loved ones are now flesh-eating undead. I really don\u2019t see the need for re-writing the classic Night of the Living Dead gig, unless there\u2019s a new (or at least interesting) twist to it. Like 28 Days Later, where the never-identified-as-zombies \u201cInfected\u201d have a very different sort of affliction, and even Shaun of the Dead with its comic twist. Autumn, sadly, offers nothing new or exciting in its story. True to the genre formula, the book begins with an ordinary autumn day turned gruesome, as people begin to asphyxiate and literally drop dead, leaving very few survivors. By the end of the next day, half of the bodies \u201cwake up\u201d and start walking around aimlessly. And then they start reacting to sound and light\u2026 And then they start attacking the living... Not really all that suspenseful if you\u2019ve ever seen a zombie flick.But that\u2019s ok, that\u2019s what makes it a horror story. Author David Moody (if he - a horror writer - was actually born with that last name, it would be a crazy coincidence) still has a chance to wow me with his writing skills and characterization. We can look into the human condition; we can sympathize with the characters and bite our nails when it looks like they have no way out. We can be mentally transported to the cottage in which the survivors huddle and feel part of the story. At the very least, since it is a horror story after all, we can be supremely grossed out.Or not. Moody\u2019s writing is disappointingly amateurish and repetitive (if I read the phrase \u201cunexpected and inexplicable\u201d one more time, I would have slammed my head into a wall). His descriptions are flat and the characters are mind-numbingly dull. We skim the surface of them \u2013 age, sex, occupation \u2013 but never delve into what they are feeling. Their interactions mainly consist of: \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and, \u201cAre you ok?\u201d \u201cYes, are you ok?\u201d I think the zombies could have had more interesting conversation!The overall lack of suspense made the entire story seem anticlimactic. Nothing, truly nothing, happens. Even the undead are boring. They don\u2019t eat a single brain in the entire book. Everyone knows zombies eat brains! I believe the closest we get is reading how one man is \u201cswallowed up by the crowd\u201d or something similarly un-detailed and not-interesting. Yawn. Maybe the story gains momentum in one of the four sequels Moody penned for Autumn, but I\u2019ll never know, because I won\u2019t be reading them."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/777555-erin", "userReview": "I just finished AUTUMN by David Moody and, uh, wow. I will never get those hours back.First off, I want to get in contact with this author and ask him. Am I supposed to like Michael? I mean that as a serious question, because I can't tell. I mean, if I'm meant to go \"Wow, what a lol edgy lol aspie douchebag.\" and dislike him, then A+ job David Moody! You managed to make a detestable main character!If not, uh... I mean, there are large parts of this book that read like a teenage boy's idea -- and you all know the kind of teenage boy I'm talking about -- of how they would react to the end of the world that's ~cool~ and ~suave~ and ~can't understand why everyone's so upset about things~.Which is really fucking annoying.Hell, I would argue that one of the reasons why Carl's mental state deteriorated so quickly was not because that's the sort of person he was, not fully because he lost his wife and daughter, but because Michael was an asshole and encourage Emma to be one too. There's a reason humans were given both the capacity to reason and the ability to give comfort, and that's to reason out when it's time to do the latter.In any case, I hope this was the first book he's ever written, because it reads like one. The characters barely have different voices. The writing is stilted, the characters nearly always exist in a white room, and their dialogue is completely bereft of context descriptions.I think that's one of the things I hated the most. There would be lines upon lines of just dialogue, and nothing else, and I hated that. For god's sake you idiot, tell us what your characters are doing while they're talking to each other.And, you know, I think a lot of my disappointment would have been... not so disappointed if it had a rocks fall ending. Rocks fall; everyone dies would be the perfect ending for AUTUMN, especially considering that it's a look at the ~human condition~ in the wake of an apocalypse.A shitty look.After Carl goes down on the first floor of the house, it would have been amazing if Michael and Emma both ended up being ripped apart by zombies as they tried to escape. The other three books could follow different groups of people, and it would have been a good plot, if not an actual good book.But no, Michael and Emma both get away. And, you know, I argue against the idea that characters need to grow over the course of a book. I think because I've never actually read a bok where there was no character growth.I mean, hi, it's not hard, just make it so that Michael realizes he's a but of a twat and you've got character growth for your main character. Instead, no, Emma gets character growth in that she starts to realize that ~Michael's right~ about the way to go about dealing with the whole tragedy, and starts to admire him for being so strong....David Moody, you are a bit of a failbot, and I don't think I much like you. That said, I'm probably going to read the other books because they're short and I would like to know what else I absolutely hate about your writing."}, {"userName": "Lea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea", "userReview": "I would more fairly rate this book 3.5 stars.Okay, so what we've got here is -- in some ways -- a fairly typical zombie apocalypse/survival story. Set in England, the story follows a group of people (soon winnowed down to the three main characters) who take refuge in a community center during what appears to be an outbreak of a highly deadly disease. Within just a day or two, however, the situation becomes much worse as the dead begin to rise.Moody has an interesting take on this, as his zombies initially are relatively harmless, slow moving and dull -- they don't seem particularly menacing, and our protagonists initially don't believe themselves to be in great danger. Eventually, however, the survivors come to realize that the dead are becoming more aware and deliberate in their actions -- the author uses this to slowly increase the tension, and it's quite effective in conveying the survivors' inability to see what steps they should take, then their dawning awareness that this probably isn't something they will be able to just ride out at the community center.From there, we follow our protagonists -- Carl, Michael, and Emma -- as they leave the the other survivors (who are reluctant to leave what they perceive to be safety) and head out to the country, where they believe there will be fewer \"bodies\" (re-animated corpses).I think this book is about much more than zombies or even survival. For me, it had a lot to say about how individuals deal with terrible situations, and about how one person's actions can affect everyone around them. Moody doesn't make it easy here -- he doesn't give you any clear cut answers, and we're left with many questions concerning the survivors.Okay, so why not five stars? Well, partly because this just isn't my preferred genre -- I think fans of this sort of fiction would probably rate it higher. So take a star off for that. I'm also taking off half a star due to the nearly unrelentingly desperate situation the survivors find themselves in. I just wanted to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel, to know that they were going to make it in the end. Again, if dark and unresolved is your thing, you will probably rate it higher.I did like this book enough to check out Moody's other books, and I *THINK* I saw that a movie had been made of this book? If so, I will definitely watch it."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29826097-al", "userReview": "So creepy and atmospheric !

I liked how it took a different perspective on the zomibie topic by focusing on the characters so much and how they are dealing with the fact that the world they knew is gone and the new one is full of zombies. It had more of a real time feel to it than other zombie stories. Everything is happening slowly and you felt like you were right there with the charcters seeing it as it happened and feeling like they do, totally devastated wondering what in the world to do now. It seemed more realistic too than other zombie stories because there was no one person that became a hero and knew automatically what to do. These people seemed more true to how normal, every day regular people would respond in this situation. A lot was focused on the people's emotions and mental state, how they were coping with their loss. Not as action pakced as other zombie books but I think that will change in the next books as the zombies in this first book are slowly becoming more active and out to get people. It is like they are changing and learning how to be better zombies. Like they didn't know what to do at first. They didn't react to sounds or run or try to jump ofer fences. But unfortunately they are learning and will make it harder for people to escape them. Therefore, the reader has something new to look forward to in the next books.

Aside from each... character... speaking like... this... (which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine), they insisted upon repeating their opinions in four different ways each before the storyline could move on. Each scene was described a handful of different times, and it took forever for them to stop talking and just do something. Well, that would imply that they actually did anything at all. The zombies never actually became zombies - just animated corpses - and it was overall boring. The entire storyline just consists of survivors congregating, hiding, running to a different safe place, hiding, getting supplies, hiding, getting supplies, hiding, and then getting supplies.

He also started off self-publishing and landed a book deal, and I am very honored to have followed in his and J.L.Bourne's footsteps.That being said, I had not had a chance to read his AUTUMN series since its original inception online. Back in the day I read the first chapter, but then swore off zombie stories until I finished my own zombie series, AS THE WORLD DIES. Therefore, I was excited to dive back into the story and find out what happened after the world died.First off, I can see why zombie genre fanatics may not like this book. Moody's zombies are NOT the traditional zombie. They do not chow down on the living, but they do become increasingly dangerous as the book continues. I have only read the first two books, so I don't know if the undead ever develop a taste for human flesh, but they do seem intent on squashing all life where they find it. For purists this may diminish the threat from the undead, and I will admit I did miss that element of the story, but Moody did a very good job making the undead dangerous when in vast numbers.There was quite a few things I really enjoyed about this novel. First off, the death of the entire world is truly horrifying. I also enjoyed how the dead don't immediately get up and start attacking the living. The gradual build up to the undead becoming truly dangerous was enjoyable because it lulled the survivors into a false sense of superiority. Moody's descriptions are also quite vivid and one particular sequence dealing with a running generator and the response of the undead was very well done.This Texan did have a little trouble with what I realized was a very British response to the events in the book. The folks in this book take the \"stiff upper lip\" stuff very seriously. At times they show very little emotion, which struck me as odd until I talked to two of my friends who are expatriates of Great Britain. \"Oh, yes. That's a very English response,\" they assured me. This is actually one of the things I ended up liking about the book. It was interesting to see another cultural reaction to the world dying and the undead taking over.As a post apocalyptic book, this story is very solid. As a \"zombie\" book, I can see where purists of the genre may get annoyed.I only give this book four stars because the second book, Autumn: The City, was even better than this one."}, {"userName": "Gregory", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4189741-gregory", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this...

I'm told that it does get better, but I'd long since stopped caring for any of the characters, and there's simply too many books on my plate to bother with this mediocre effort. For those looking for zombies, I'm sure you can find something in this book to love after you've plowed through most of the all-too-saturated market. But for me, I'm sure I can find another zombie book that'll fit the bill, and be a lot more enjoyable to read as well.However, since I literally couldn't finish reading this book, take my review with a grain of salt. Consider it a cautious warning, and do a little leg work before picking it up just to make sure it might appeal to you.

What shall we do?- I don't know.- Are you okay?- Yeah.2.:There are serious mistakes in story, which completely contradicts the story and the world where the story is set.For example: A-The survivors in the farm house eat breakfast every morning, lunch, etc... They use cutlery and plates for the eating.Okay, but how do they do the dishes?The story says, everybody died. There's no electricity, no TV, no radio, nothing. So I guess, then there's no tap water too right?How do they clean the plates if there's no tap water?I think without tap water people would simply use their hands to eat.B-While driving on the highway, one of the survivor shouts at the driver something like: \"HEY! I told you to turn right you idiot! Why did you turn left?Now we'll never find that house!\"What??!This is a HUGE mistake! You found out this story Mr. Moody right? Don't you remember your own story?You told us that there're no people anymore, no police, no laws, no rules, no judges, no prisons.So why does the driver need to keep the laws of driving?Who the hell cares anymore? Why doesn't he simply turn back and leaves the highway in the other direction? Or why doesn't he switch the car in backward more and goes back?This mistake is so stupid! I think the writer really forgot the world where his story is set and he reacted (I mean the character) as someone would react in the normal everyday world where there are still laws for driving.C- When the survivors found the house they are looking for, they think:\"This house will be perfect! This is a big house and SAFE.\"What the f*ck does SAFE mean?HELLO!! Mr. Moody!!! Did you forgot the story of your own book again??!Remember!! Wake up!Everybody is DEAD! There are no criminals, no bad people, no burglars.Why should be the house safe? Safe from WHO?The zombies at this stage of the book are completely HARMLESS, okay? They are just wondering around like drunken, retarded idiots.So why are they looking for a safe house? Nobody wants to hurt them!This is a huge mistake again!It actually happens more times. When one of them goes into a coffee shop, the girl asks: \"Are you sure it's safe to go in there?\"Why the hell shouldn't it be safe?? HELLO??!!No one wants to hurt them at this stage of the book! NO THREATS at all.Actually at this stage of the book, the world is the safest place ever.No criminals, no crime, no dangerous zombies (yet), so why are they worrying so f*cking much?And the last thought about this piece of garbage:The book is advertised as \"Without ever using the 'Z' word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story.\"Why don't you use the Zombie word in your book Mr. Moody?If you write a zombie book then why don't you call them zombies?!This is so stupid.If you write a book about a pirate captain, will you call him the \"guy with the parrot on his shoulder\"? Or \"the guy with the fake, wooden leg\"?If you write about something but you never say the actual word out loud, that WILL NOT make the book any better, believe me.- Next time when you try to write a zombie book, call the damned zombies zombies!- And try to avoid serous mistakes which contradict your entire story line.- Try to write real conversations about real characters!- Try to write action scenes with suspense, and not f*cking boring, endless, aimless, retarded conversations such as \"What are we gonna do?\", \"Dunno...\".I seriously advice everybody to avoid the books of this amateur writer. It really p*ssed me off."}, {"userName": "Ines", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43642795-ines", "userReview": "what i really like about this book is the main reason most of the people hate...... to be very slow, it is not fast pace, but all around the claustrophobic feeling due to living among the Zombie....i suppose it should be the reason why it has been written in such way.....Good job David Moody!!!( i am not native english sorry for my gramma and syntax!)"}, {"userName": " CCAM&GZM", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879896-ccam-gzm", "userReview": "If you had in view when you got this book or if you got it just because you heard that is a zombie story, then you should know that you\u2019ll not find \u201cbrain eaters\u201d or something like \u201cReturn of Living Dead\u201d.This book is about people. About living people who still have feelings, emotions, passions and dramas. Moody, like he accustomed us, (look at the \u201cHater\u201d), steps abruptly into action, without too many descriptions and without wasting time. The explanation of the pandemic or apocalypse (as you prefer) is left to the reader\u2019s choice.The characters are suddenly pulled from the daily routine and transported into a world of death (of the humans, not of the animals), and the few survivors who are gathering together (you\u2019ll see by yourself how) are witnessing with horror to the metamorphosis of the majority of the corpses which infest the city. The living-deads, as I said, do not move too fast and they do not rise with the instant hunger for human flesh. They are used by the author to mark the tension of those who survive.The three main characters (Carl, Emma and Michael), launch themselves into a race of survival, but not by shooting in all directions, but trying to restore the most elementary conditions of civilization which has disappeared, like: toilet, electricity and basic daily food. Carl is torn apart by the loss of his wife and daughter, and Emma and Michael look for each other, live together without developing a romantic relation but one based on compassion and emotional support. They are not prepaired, they are not heroes, but common people who difficultly manage to survive the conditions that fate has imposed onto them.The end is neither Hollywood like, nor tragic. The key word is hope, hope of survival, hope of the future.I recommend reading this book not for the walking monsters, but for the basic human feelings of the characters that are found in each of us and which, due to daily struggles, we do not let unfold as much we should.

David Moody has a knack for looking at the end of the world through the eyes of the average person. There are no superheroes, just people like you and me trying to survive.In Autumn, almost everyone dies in one fell swoop. The few survivors are terrified, they don\u2019t know what to do or why it happened. The main focus is on a handful of survivors, Michael, Emma and Carl; what they do, how they react and handle the end of the world.David Moody has created a great group of characters. He has built them up as people that the reader can relate to; we could be one of them. The reader can feel the pain of their loss and the frustration that each of them feels by just trying to survive. When I care this much about the characters, the author has done his job.Autumn is the first of five books. I first read his Hater Series over a year ago. Reading Autumn now, I had to ask myself why I waited so long to get this book. This is one of those books that leaves you with the nagging question, \u201cCould I have done anything different?

Focusing more on the characters and not the mindless hordes trampling the countryside.

At the end you are left wondering, \"what next?\" It is like watching an episode of \"The Walking Dead.\" Slow character build-up, giving you just enough to keep you interested; but not enough to know what they are truly thinking, feeling; and what motivates their behaviors and reaction to the end of it all.

But in all honesty, parts of this book (read: most) were so comically bad that I thought, surely this must be a joke. He - he can't be serious....can he? Really?To make a laundry list of Reasons Why \"Autumn\" is One of the Worst Attempts at Literature I've Ever Read would take more time and effort than I'm willing to put in. In short, see previous sentence. Between the complete lack of character development, slow-moving plot that never really goes anywhere at all, laughably stupid survival decisions made by equally stupid Rick Grimes wannabes, and writing that stank more than a \"decaying corpse\" (oh, and did I mention the redundancy?), \"Autumn\" read more like a teenager's fan fiction than a book that should be for public consumption. The characters were not just flat and predictable; they were downright /unbearable/. Michael went from a socially-awkward IT nerd to a sad attempt at a hard-ass survivalist equipped to handle the end of the world without a single emotion in one moment, then be sobbing in the next. He had no development whatsoever, made no sense, threw tantrums every other page yet was suppose to be that \"cool and collected\" guy, and really he was just a complete asshole. Emma was a whiny, useless, wishy-washy crybaby; if Moody was aiming for thinly-veiled misogyny he succeeded swimmingly. Carl was the most interesting of the bunch, and even he made me want to chew sand rather than read about him. Each character was so indistinct from the next that I literally gave up keeping Michael and Carl straight about halfway through the book. And you know what? It /didn't make a difference./ That's bad.I'll give Moody props for the \"evolving zombies\" plot. That could have been intriguing, but against a background of shit nothing ever really looks appealing. Not to mention it took three-quarters of the book for them to even display any aggression. The rest of the time it was just Michael, Carl and Emma getting in circular arguments, crying, deliberating on the future, getting mad, pouting, magically knowing how to build a fortress out of found materials, arguing again, crying some more, and fighting about the future again. Oh, and then more crying.For my part, zombie apocalypses should be filthy, gritty, violent, loud, raw, angry, crushing, and very, very psychological. Isn't that why we as a culture are so obsessed by the idea of zombies, after all? There is something so captivating - and nothing quite as terrifying - as a human being who is no longer \"human,\" without social order or conscience. It's a huge mindjob, or at least it should be; \"Autumn\" did not have that at all. It had no urgency, no psychological horror, no rawness or real grit or struggle. It tried to have violence, but its execution was more like that of an adolescent death-metal fan's livejournal fiction. As a whole, the book just fell flat and left me thoroughly disappointed, with a bad taste in my mouth about anything else Moody has penned. I wanted to read this whole series, but the thought of trudging through another river of shit like \"Autumn,\" with two main characters I already harbor an established hatred for, just isn't much for motivation.I really hate disliking books. I do my best to find at least one tiny ray of awesome in almost every book I pick up, but \"Autumn\" unfortunately is one that I have absolutely nothing positive to say about."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369169-lori", "userReview": "Review copy form authorI am a huge fan of David Moody. He knocked my socks off back in September with his Hater series - in which normally rational people suddenly and violently turned against one another in an attempt to survive from an irrational fear of hate. (I am still impatiently awaiting the release of the final book for the trilogy!)Flattered by the embarrassing amount of love I was gushing on him (or so I assume!) he offered to send me a copy of the first novel in his zombie series - Autumn. This novel was originally released as a free online download and sold so well (and landed Moody a movie adaptation) that it is now being rereleased in print. Autumn dropped this October, and the remaining novels will be available in 3 month increments.Without ever using the \"Z\" word, David Moody manages to recreate the walking dead apocalypse. A unnamed virus suddenly and swiftly suffocates and kills 99% of the population. A handful of people, seemingly immune to the deadly virus and displaying various signs of shock and disbelief, slowly congregate to the town's community center building. The dead all lie where they fell, mouths open, stained in blood, looks of absolutely horror and pain frozen on their face.As the first few days pass, and the survivors decide what they should do, a third of the dead begin to rise. At first unresponsive and harmless, little by little they regain their most basic senses - sight and hearing - and frighten three of our survivors into action.I practically read this book in one sitting. Fighting off a miserable head cold on our snowy, slushy, dark and gloomy Thanksgiving day, I cocooned myself in a blanket on the couch and got completely lost in this eerie and awful world that Moody had created. Had the real world come to a similar end in those hours while I was reading his novel, I would not have been surprised. The books setting and the weather outside my living room window were just too perfectly matched!While just about anyone can guess what the final outcome will be in a genre that tends to leave little room for imagination, Moody managed to keep me turning the pages, cringing inwardly as he repetitively placed the characters in situations that had me thinking to myself \"oh no, I wouldn't do that if I was you.\"I mean, sure. There are twenty-something adults crammed together into a decrepit and not-very-well-stocked one floor building in the heart of the city, surrounded by thousands of rotting dead bodies that slowly begin to stand up and move around. And sure. So a few of those people are going to think that ditching the city for the fresher, more isolated parts of the country might be the right thing to do. And yeah. That causes some tension within the group. But really, people? Three of you, running away to an isolated farmhouse, where you are miles from any other form of protection? Do you really think that is a wise choice?The rest of the novel had me sitting on the edge of my seat, anxious to see what was going to happen to our little group of survivors. And now, it would appear that I will be impatiently awaiting the rest of the novels in this series as well!"}, {"userName": "Kate Lansky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2186989-kate-lansky", "userReview": "I was initially put off by the speed of the infection and death - and the author did specify that it was only a few moments between the two, thus making it very hard for me to believe the disease. I mean, it has to spread somehow, and that somehow hasn't yet been explained, leaving me very frustrated. Starting the story with something that feels unbelievable (the bad kind) made me stumble -- as did the immediate loss of power, phone lines, etc. I'm not talking a day or a couple hours - I'm talking maybe two minutes.I did, however, like the dichotomy of an unbelievably swift death and the slow, glacier pace at which the dead returned. It was more than a day between when the disease struck and when the dead began moving, and more time passed between then and when the dead began to be able to... function, for lack of a better word. I'm so used to the stories where the transformation from dead to undead is flash-fast, that this was a nice change of pace. It's also interesting (though not unique) that not everyone who died rises again. There are plenty of bodies that just stay dead. This makes things a bit more manageable for the survivors, of course... but all of this also makes for a rather slow start. It doesn't quite become a psychological piece until much later either, thus the slow zombification process doesn't help the telling of the story, other than to get the characters used to the wandering dead, and it should let them feel at least somewhat safe, as they begin to draw conclusions about the walking dead.But they never do feel safe, or even safer. There is always a sense of foreboding in their thoughts and actions, as though they are, much as the reader is, just waiting for the zombies to get going and start nomming on people. It makes for an uncomfortable read, as I spent a lot of the story feeling as though the fourth wall had been violated, carefully reconstructed, and everyone was wandering about whistling and saying \"what fourth wall? I don't see any fourth wall, do you?\" (An example: they find a rifle and their first thought is of defense, not hunting. The rifle could be a great way to supplement their food stores (which sound relatively limited), and food is always an immediate concern. But instead, they moan and groan about how they hope they'll never have to use the gun, how they don't need it and should get rid of it, etc.)Once we finally DO get zombies, they're pretty watered down. They're the standard shamblers, but they're weaker than normal. Thus the relentlessness you often sense in zombie stories is lacking here - the zombies can barely cross any barrier at all. Still, the author uses the phrase \"constant and relentless\" like a motto, frequently reminding readers that something or other - usually fear - is constant and relentless. On top of that, I didn't really care for the characters. Their stupidity might have had something to do with it, but... I never really felt close to them, or felt that I understood them."}, {"userName": "Amanda Makepeace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352290-amanda-makepeace", "userReview": "David Moody is not the first author to write about non-zombies. They seem to be popping up more and more as writers search for an original spin to the classic horror monster. What makes Autumn original are its characters. As I read, two things kept drifting into my thoughts. One was The Earth Abides and two, Survivors, the UK television series about a flu pandemic the wipes out over 90% of the world\u2019s population. What do these all have in common? Characters from all walks of life. Real characters. Real dialogue.Besides the fact that Autumn kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I think its characters are what appealed to so many people. They are ordinary, everyday people struggling to survive in extraordinary circumstances. There are things about them you love and there are things about them you hate. They are not perfect people, they are real people. It\u2019s easy to then insert yourself into this incredible story of survival, and think yes, I bet there would be people who react this way.There were only a few qualms I had with the book. Mainly little details, like where were they getting their water? I also wondered about the gas pumps (petrol in the UK)\u2013would they still be working without power? If not, the characters could siphon it I suppose, but it was things like this that went unanswered and nagged at me a bit. But not enough to distract me from the story.Autumn is one of those books that will keep you tense, worried, and frightened from beginning to end.

As the book begins, the reader is quickly confronted with the harrowing situation of a world that is suddenly turned upside down. Like Romero\u2019s classic work, the novel turns more towards the struggles of a few survivors who have to cope with the situation both mentally and physically. When the undead begin to show signs of aggression, the desperate predicament becomes a fast-paced tale of the struggle for life. David\u2019s writing is directed more towards the emotional strain of this now dangerous world, as he submerges the reader into a dark world where any sound or movement can prove fatal to you and those with you. The relationship between the two main characters Michael and Emma, creates an interesting sub-plot as the story progresses towards a breath taking ending.The book kept me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning, offering up a thick serving of horror, tension and dark suspense. The desperation of the characters in the novel is portrayed superbly, bringing forth a realistic (if a zombie novel can ever be called that) and terrifying read.Once you\u2019ve finished this first book you\u2019ll definitely want to read the further three instalments.

There are a few exceptions, like World War Z and Breathers, but that is because they take an interesting viewpoint on the zombie issue. This book is no different from any other on the market. Boom mysterious virus wipes out most of population. A few survivors left. Chaos ensues. The worst thing is that the zombies aren't scary. They are just animated corpses who for most of this book pose no threat other than their huge numbers. No scenes of eating human flesh or devouring the liver of a newborn babe. We are supposed to be terrified because we the audience knows they are zombies (even thought he word is never used).Our human protagonists are truly dull creatures that fail to develop any connection with the readers.
