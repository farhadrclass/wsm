Of course it\u2019s excellent. It\u2019s Nora.  Although Mitch is a great character his story steps back from Roz and the ghost. I think its a delicate balance when so many strong characters are in a story. Roz\u2019s strength seems to take center stage. Enough so that I was a bit intimidated at times. I mean she raised three sons, started a business and jogs every day. When my three kids were growing up I sometimes had trouble finding time to shower. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I nearly always enjoy this author's trilogies and this is no exception. I like getting to know a group of characters and then focussing on a different couple in each book but with all the familiar people on the peripheries. This book was centred around the developing relationship between Mitch and Roz with a fair bit of ghostly intervention along the way. It actually got a bit too creepy to read at home alone at one point. All very entertaining and highly recommended !"}, {"userName": "Alba Turunen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51447910-alba-turunen", "userReview": "4 Estrellas, y muy en consonancia con la anterior novela. Me ha gustado bastante, me ha enganchado desde el principio, porque s\u00ed, tiene un estilo cuidado que se lee solo, y porque la historia ha ayudado mucho.\"Rosa negra\" empieza unos meses despu\u00e9s de acabar \"Dalia azul\". En \u00e9ste libro tenemos la historia de Roz, la propietaria del Jard\u00edn y de la mansi\u00f3n Harper, una mujer pr\u00e1ctica, fuerte, luchadora, y en una \u00fanica palabra: admirable. Y su pareja protagonista, Mitchell Carnegie. Mitch apareci\u00f3 brevemente en el anterior libro cuando Roz solicit\u00f3 sus servicios para investigar sobre el fantasma de la casa, la Novia Harper. Mitch es un genealogista de reputado talento, un hombre bueno, sencillo, un genio despistado, y un desastre adorable, pero de estos hombres que enternecen y te llegan a lo m\u00e1s hondo.Aunque la historia ha sido interesante, lo bueno que ha tenido esta novela (como la primera), son sus personajes protag\u00f3nicos. Como he dicho, Roz es una mujer admirable, siendo muy joven se qued\u00f3 viuda y con tres ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, aunque con una buena posici\u00f3n social y dinero para salir adelante, pero poco a poco alcanz\u00f3 su sue\u00f1o, crear su propia empresa de jardiner\u00eda. S\u00f3lo cometi\u00f3 un error en su vida, y fue creer que amaba a quien no deb\u00eda, un hombre que fue un vil par\u00e1sito y se aprovech\u00f3 de ella para sacarle todo lo posible; aunque Roz consigui\u00f3 divorciarse de \u00e9l, la sombra de \u00e9ste canalla volver\u00e1 a amenazarla, y por desgracia estar\u00e1 m\u00e1s presente en la novela de lo deseado.Por el lado de Mitch, bueno, ha quedado algo m\u00e1s flojo pues el libro se ha centrado m\u00e1s en el personaje de Roz, y a Mitch creo que no he llegado a conocerle del todo. Su vida fue f\u00e1cil, se cas\u00f3, tuvo un hijo, pero un error que persisti\u00f3 durante muchos a\u00f1os de su vida, acab\u00f3 con su matrimonio, a\u00fan as\u00ed sigue manteniendo una relaci\u00f3n cordial con su ex-mujer y con su hijo. Cuando empieza el libro, Mitch ya ha aceptado el trabajo que Roz le propuso, investigar y averiguar qui\u00e9n es el fantasma y qu\u00e9 quiere.Realmente, este libro se ha centrado en la investigaci\u00f3n de la Novia Harper, y Nora Roberts ha dado unas pinceladas bastante interesantes, regalando poco a poco algo de informaci\u00f3n para que el lector (y sus protagonistas), puedan hacer sus c\u00e1balas. Lo bueno, en este libro averiguamos qui\u00e9n es el fantasma, pero a\u00fan no sabemos qu\u00e9 le ocurri\u00f3, espero que eso se desvele en el siguiente libro. En cuanto al papel del mismo, pues s\u00ed, en el libro anterior supimos que es Amelia, admito que me ha repateado bastante las apariciones del fantasma en \u00e9ste libro, siempre presente para fastidiar los mejores momentos, aunque aplaudo su \u00faltima aparici\u00f3n.Y en cuanto al romance de los protagonistas, bonito y sin muchos sobresaltos ni conflictos. Lo malo es que en algunos momentos se me ha hecho algo forzado, como que Roz y Mitch estaban juntos porque era su historia y la autora los ha juntado porque deb\u00eda ser as\u00ed. Creo que me ha faltado algo m\u00e1s de pasi\u00f3n, pero bien puede ser porque me ha podido parecer algo fr\u00edo, s\u00ed, debo decirlo: me encanta Roz, pero es una mujer fr\u00eda. Lo que s\u00ed que me ha gustado es leer un romance en el que sus protagonistas no son j\u00f3venes, Roz tiene cuarenta y siete a\u00f1os, y Mitch cuarenta y ocho. Ambos son personas adultas, con vidas resueltas, con sus propios hijos, y a\u00fan cuando menos lo esperaban, se ven en la tesitura de conocerse, gustarse y enamorarse. Me ha convencido el resultado, pues soy de la opini\u00f3n de que el amor no entiende de edades.Por \u00faltimo, destacar\u00e9 al resto de personajes, me ha encantado saber de Stella, Logan y los ni\u00f1os, y c\u00f3mo se van a adaptar a su nueva vida. Tambi\u00e9n de David, personaje tan central en la trama, y en la mansi\u00f3n Harper como todos, pero sobre todo sigo destacando a Hayley y a la peque\u00f1a Lily (que me parece adorable), y a Harper \u00bfQu\u00e9 voy a decir de Harper, el hijo mayor y heredero de Roz? Pues que me dej\u00f3 encandilada perdida en el anterior libro, y ver c\u00f3mo trata a Hayley y a Lily me ha enternecido hasta el extremo. La historia de Harper y Hayley es la siguiente, espero que est\u00e9 a la altura, porque estos dos personajes han subido mucho mis expectativas. De modo que espero con ganas el desenlace final de esta trilog\u00eda, y averiguar qu\u00e9 le pas\u00f3 a Amelia."}, {"userName": "Jacob Proffitt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt", "userReview": "I was interested to see that the romantic couple in this one were both in their late 40s. Are people with adult children allowed to start relationships?I liked both Roz and Mitch very much and their romance was a fun one to experience. You could see how they came together from a need for companionship but with a stability of having secure family relationships as well. This gave them space to parse their desires and the opportunity to act from a place of strength from already having healthy, established family relationships in place. This was an interesting dynamic and one you don't see very often.I was ready to praise Roberts for her adroit handling of an older couple romance, but as much as I like Roz and Mitch, they just feel young to me so I'm not sure if she actually did pull it off. While they're certainly mature, they could as easily have been mid to late 30s as 40+, when all is said. Still, that's the thing about us old folks\u2014we don't really have to be any different than our 30-something peers, maturity-wise. Or physically either, if we take basic care of ourselves (which we see both Roz and Mitch doing, actually).If there is a downside to the book, it's the over-active presence of the Harper Ghost, who we now know as Amelia. When a selfish person goes whacko and sticks around after death, the result isn't pretty. I'm really not sure what the point of adding the supernatural was, here, though it did drive some of the story (not least in that it brought Roz to Mitch). Still, those story elements could easily have had a better foundation and a ghost with violent tendencies detracted somewhat from my fun\u2014particularly as we continue to get a prologue from her perspective to start us out. Really not a pleasant way to start a book\u2026A note about Steamy: Like the first book, this one was light on the steam. A couple of scenes that weren't very long. Unlike the first book, these scenes were at least well-done."}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste", "userReview": "Mini review:This installment was just as sweet and funny and enjoyable as the first. Rob has hired Dr. Mitchell Carnegie to dig into her family\u2019s history, in hopes that he can help them find out more information about the ghost haunting Harper House and lay her to rest. Mitch is a cutie, absentminded and obsessive over his work and completely suited to Roz. The romance was fun and a bit unique for Nora due to it being between two middle-aged people, instead of the late 20s to mid 30s set that she tends to write around. Each party having adult children added some variety. Also, the ghost haunting Harper House has become more unpredictable by this point, on more than one occasion becoming disturbingly violent. All in all, another enjoyable Nora novel."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23016460-amber", "userReview": "The Harper Bride Ghost is back and this time she is preying on Rosalind Harper, the owner and proprietor of Harper House and in the Garden Nursery.

In this story we meet Roz & Mitch who fall in love while working over a genealogical project. They're in search of the Harper Bride Ghost who has been haunting Roz's family home for generations.I was slightly surprised to see Roz take the lead heroine for book two. With Nora's trilogies you get a certain formula to them. The first heroine (in this trilogy Stella) goes through some sort of transformation and finds herself. The second heroine holds a tough as nails beauty who doesn't quite fit in with her gender. She's beautiful and smart, hard and hurt, but she comes through to find love in the end. And the last heroine is usually the rock. The one who has to go through harder lessons than the other two but she comes out strong. When I first started Blue Dahlia I had pegged Roz as the third heroine. Though now that I've finished Black Rose I can see how Roz fits into the second heroines mold. She comes across as hard and hurt, beautiful and smart, and above all a blunt woman. Heroine number two is nearly always blunt. And naturally Haley would have to be heroine number three. She did move across the deep south, pregnant, and take a chance at a new life. She'll be a brilliant third heroine. Oh! Besides that, she has the baby. As Amelia (the ghost) is obsessed with children, this fits.Years ago I read this one only halfway through (whenever it first came out). I was going through a genre crisis at the time and didn't much feel the need to read romance novels. Time never fails, and given enough of it, Nora always manages to suck me back in for a romantic spell. Apparently 2012 is one of those spells as I've read more books by her this year than any of the other authors I've been pursuing. Read: 1.5 times. (Next time around I'll just round the .5 off and be at a third I suppose. Or maybe just a second. Really it doesn't matter. Case in point, there will be a next time)."}, {"userName": "Sombra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55602919-sombra", "userReview": "La serie sigue viento en popa a toda vela...Roz y Mitchell por separado son muy buenos personajes pero juntos, son adorables.Desde el primer momento me atrajo la pareja que iban a formar, ya que parec\u00edan dos polos totalmente opuestos y adem\u00e1s con m\u00e1s edad de la que estoy acostumbrada a leer en cualquier tipo de g\u00e9nero, ya que ambos tienen m\u00e1s de 40 a\u00f1os.Y la verdad, no me ha decepcionado, al contrario, me han parecido una gran pareja que ha sabido aprovechar muy bien esa segunda oportunidad que les han concedido en el amor, sobre todo despu\u00e9s de que Mitch perdiera a su mujer por su vicio y de que Roz saliera de un matrimonio con un estafador de campeonato.La historia, como digo, ha sido muy bonita y siguiendo la l\u00ednea del primero pero con algunos cambios: No solo hemos tenido m\u00e1s acci\u00f3n por parte del fantasma de la familia (que me ha llegado a poner los pelos de punta en ocasiones y en otras me ha hecho darme ganas de que acabara todo el asunto para que dejara de dar por saco), sino que tenemos a un ex marido egoc\u00e9ntrico, cabreado y humillado en su amor propio que tampoco lo pondr\u00e1 f\u00e1cil para Roz as\u00ed como la esperada boda de los protagonistas del libro anterior, Stella y Logan.Eso s\u00ed, me ha encantado c\u00f3mo Roz ha manejado la situaci\u00f3n.

This book picks up where \u201cBlue Dahlia\u201d left off, in terms of the mystery of the Harper Bride, a ghost who haunts historic Harper House near Memphis Tennessee, and the personal lives of the living characters, as well. In \u201cBlue Dahlia,\u201d Roz Harper, fortysomething mistress of Harper House, hired Mitch Carnegie to do some family research in order to find the identity of the Harper Bride. Mitch and Roz were attracted to one another, but didn\u2019t get to spend much time together until Mitch came to Harper House to work full time on the Harper genealogy. It doesn\u2019t take Mitch long to start pursuing Roz romantically, and along with that, the Harper Bride makes her displeasure with the turn of events known. Her behavior escalates from singing children to sleep to messing up Roz\u2019s room and tearing up her clothes when she seems to be falling for Mitch. Roz has other problems, too, as her ex-husband from her brief and disastrous second marriage comes back to town and starts messing with her, as well, taking out credit cards in her name, attempting to cancel her country club membership, and other equally juvenile attempts to get under her skin. Through it all, I could find nothing but admiration for Roz\u2019s character. She is a mature, intelligent woman with her feet firmly planted on the ground, and while things upset her, nothing really riles her. She kicks butt wherever it\u2019s needed, both literally and figuratively, then dusts off her hands and walks away like it\u2019s no big deal. Even when things do get to her, she prefers to be alone to deal with them. She is easily my favorite Nora Roberts heroine in a long time. Through Mitch\u2019s research, and the things that happen to Roz as she falls in love with him, the group at Harper House learns more about the identity and circumstances of the Harper Bride, but there are still parts of the mystery yet to be solved by the book\u2019s conclusion. Standing alone, this book would do well. As the second installment of a trilogy, it sucked me right back in, and had me hurrying to pick up the next installment to see what would happen next.

I really enjoyed the first installment in the series, but this... not that much. And it would really be a star 1/2, not even 2.I was bored the whole time, even wishing for it to end. I must admit that it has been the worst romance book I had ever read. I didn't like a thing about it.First, Robert's writing style in this book is horrible. You never get to really understand how the characters feel because she uses a very impersonal way for describing the events that develop. She uses the same tone when the characters are insanely happy or about to kill someone due to frustration. For this reason the reading becomes really tedious. But what was worst was that the relationship between the two characters never really felt real. I never really liked Roz as much as to read her own story. I mean I liked her but as a secondary character. The doctor was fine, maybe if we could have seen more of his POV the story would have been a bit better.And the ghost part in this book... Seriously? Crazy ghost lady flying everywhere, talking as a person and throwing things in the air as choking people...too weird for me. I didn't even enjoyed the paranormal side of the book.

Her ghost haunts the house and grounds of the Harper household and has for as long as anyone alive can remember. Most who have seen or heard her speak of the care she shows to the children of the house, singing lullabies to the young and offering a comforting presence to young mothers. But there is a darkness, too, and when lullabies become edged in madness and comfort turns to terror, a group of family and friends must ban together to find out who their ghost is, where she is, if they have any hope of surviving her wrath.Rosalind Harper is a strong, independent, mature woman. She lost a husband young, made a mistake with a second marriage, but has lived a life of class and poise, correcting mistakes and building her life from tragedy. She may be the mistress of Harper House, but her focus is her family and her business, the In the Garden nursery. Since the events of Blue Dahlia, Roz, along with friends Stella and Hayley and their respective loves and children, have had to put the search for the identity of the Harper Bride on hold. Genealogy expert Dr. Mitchell Carnagie was unavailable until a previous engagement was concluded.When Roz's path crosses Mitch's again during a wild spurt of Christmas shopping, more than talk of ghosts gets stirred up. Mitch's project is finished and he's ready to start the search for Amelia full time, and Roz realizes that the sexy doctor might just be the balm to that niggling bit of loneliness that tugs at her heart. What she doesn't realize is that her resident ghost has no love of men, and as the relationship between her and Mitch heats up, Amelia turns her viscous will into keeping them apart.Some of my favorite romance reading of all time has been various Roberts' trilogies. I love how she weaves interesting and sympathetic characters who are easy to fall for into an overall arc that spans three books, while maintaining a level of storytelling that supports each book individually. She truly is a master at that impressive feat.I'm particularly fond of lead character Roz Harper, a woman of advancing age, within spitting distance of fifty, with concerns and attentions suited to her age and her milieu. She's got an ex-husband who's a rake and a snake, and she's forced to deal with him, though it goes against her grain to do so in the manner in which it is forced. She doesn't break under pressure of ghost or male ego, and holds close to her heart those she considers friends and family. As a character, she's the epitome of grace and cool southern charm...with just enough fiery temper to keep her from being too Stepford.While I am known for having a fondness for damaged characters who rise above their personal demons to wage battle against the forces of darkness, I admit I found Roz's well-balanced, independent nature both an admirable and welcome change. She's got a steel spine with pleasant touches of softness for contrast and depth, and she approaches problems with a keen mind and determination. I couldn't help but like her. And respect her. Mitch was a charming counterpoint. A man who is aware of his demons and admits to his past mistakes as he takes responsibility for them. He's a good man, honest and hard working, with the confidence to appreciate a woman of strength without the games and machinations so often seen in younger couples.Their relationship sparks and simmers, developing slowly but sweetly along with the plot threads of the Harper Bride, who shows her nasty side in all its freaky glory more than once, and the ex-husband, who's a sleaze of the first order. There are ancillary plot threads of extended family that also add to the mix. Together, the plot develops with solid pacing and depth, each aspect complementing the other and building off each other nicely.Knowing that this was the second book in the trilogy helped assuage the impatience to get the answers to Amelia's past, and Roberts takes time to provide glimpses of her history and add some truly atmospheric creepiness to her haunting ways. As a result, Amelia is just as well rounded...if definitely unbalanced...a character as the living members of the book.My only complaint...well...not really a complaint, more as a dissatisfied observation, with this book in particular and the series as a whole is that the characters all seem a little too perfect, a little lacking in flaws and insecurities and peccadilloes. They all make noises about their hang ups - Roz's temper and stubbornness, Mitch's tendency to be messy and forgetful, etc., but in the end, they're all just a little too perfect, always doing the right thing at the right time in the right way. It's a little disconcerting. And not always the easiest thing to relate to. I think that's why, despite the fact that I liked the book quite a lot, I never actually connected to it on a personal level, and why, though I admired Roz and had quite a lot of affection for Mitch, I was never completely invested in their relationship or the continuing saga of the Harper Bride. Not enough to be rabidly enthusiastic of it, anyway.I liked it, though. Quite a bit. And anyone who enjoys romance mixed with haunted houses and a centuries-old mystery and a lot of horticulture will probably enjoy it, too. ~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."}, {"userName": "Maria Belen Paz Mena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43794690-maria-belen-paz-mena", "userReview": "Este libro me ha generado sensaciones encontradas. La parte de la historia de Amelia es lo mas interesante, ya que vamos descubriendo qu\u00e9 fue lo que le pas\u00f3, aunque desde entrada tenemos un estimativo, creo que los personajes lo descubren con mucha cuota de azar, porque me parece que no cuentan con los elementos suficientes para descubrirlo.-Respecto a Roz y Mitch, tienen sus buenos momentos, pero toda la historia de Amelia se come su historia en particular. La ensombrese bastante, aunque su gran momento es cuando Roz pone en evidencia a su ex marido. GRAN MOMENTO!Finalmente llega la historia de Harper, la vienen preparando desde el primer libro, espero que este a la altura.-"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/949924-maria", "userReview": "It is refreshing to see a heroine who is almost fifty. Roz's enjoyment of Mitch, the absent-minded professor, starts off as a mutal attraction that she thinks is only that, but both, with their children all grown-up, are thrown off-course by the depth of their liking for each other when both feel they are past that point in their lives. The parts with the ghost are a little overwhelming, but the rest of the book is both fun and painful, complete with an -ex showing up to make trouble and that nasty relative that we all have somewhere in our family trees."}, {"userName": "\u2661Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24176098-elizabeth", "userReview": "No pude con este libro, me pareci\u00f3 de lo mas lento por lo que lo dej\u00e9, me aburri\u00f3."}, {"userName": "Dannie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8508561-dannie", "userReview": "Slightly better than the first one \"Blue Dahlia\".

And the ghost acting like a poltergeist instead of just hanging here singing made it so much more compelling. On the other hand, I don't think that I'd have handled her murder attempts as well as Roz did O_o.Now, regarding her asshole of an ex-husband... BEST PART. I love how it was handled, everything of it. The stalking, the pettiness, which makes it hard for her to complain to the police, even though she is a victim, him manipulating the other women/couples, and GETTING HIS DUE BACK RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINNER WITH HALF OF THE TOWN'S WELL TO DO, yeah yeah yeah, go Roz, your sharp tongue is a thing of beauty and should be revered. And best part of it all, it wasn't written \u00e0 la 'fifty shades of grey': 'I know you hurt me terribly and are so so bad for my life, but I just can't resist your animal magnetism and oh, catch me while I swoon and marvel over your chiseled face while forgetting all about the thieving, the adultery, the manipulations...' If Roz had been written as having trouble choosing between Mitch and Bryce (and all I could think of was Bryce de Nice, every damn time), I think I'd have shucked my ereader at the wall.Loved too how protective Harper is and how it's dealt with, regarding the fact that she's a grown woman who doesn't need her hand held, while Harper still feels the need to protect his mama.
