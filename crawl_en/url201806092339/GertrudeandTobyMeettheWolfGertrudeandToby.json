Gertrude the goat and Toby the tortoise are pals. They live on a farm together. On Fridays when the farmer goes to town on errands, Gertrude and Toby go out on an adventure. Today it is fishing at a nearby pond. On their way a boy is shouting about a wolf. Soon they have to figure out what to do about the wolf themselves. I like this story about friends and trying to find a solution to a problem. A good children's book about friends and problem solving."}, {"userName": "Carla Johnson-Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074498-carla-johnson-hicks", "userReview": "This is the 3rd in the Gertrude and Toby Fairy-Tale Adventure Series. Every Friday, Gertrude the goat and Toby the tortoise head off on an adventure, when farmer Sam goes to market. In this story they decide to go fishing at Trout Lake. They have had a debate on the best bait to use (worms vs beetles) and decide that the one who catches the most fish will get to choose the adventure next Friday. On the way to the lake, they see a boy who cries wolf. When seeing him get dragged off by a wolf, they decide to help rescue him. Of course the three little pigs also make an appearance in this cute story.Once again, we meet fairytale characters in a different story and setting which is actually fun. It would be more entertaining for children, if they are familiar with the original fairytales so they can compare them. It is great to see Gertrude and Toby again. They will become the favourites of children who read this series. Their mannerisms and speech patterns are part of the humour in the stories. I also enjoy the illustrations in these books, they are large, colourful and fun to look at. I recommend this book to schools and classrooms (primary/junior) as well as to family libraries.I received a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36095389-patricia", "userReview": "Thank you Netgalley, Shari Tharp and Atlas for the chance to review this book.This is the 3rd in the Gertrude and Toby Fairy-Tale Adventure Series, a planned series of 4. As in the other books we follow Gertrude the goat and Toby the tortoise on there escapades away from the farm when the farmer is away. In this story they decide to go fishing having had a debate on the best bait to use (as you do) and on their way encounter the boy who cries wolf, three little pigs and naturally the wolf himself.This follows the familiar pattern of the previous books and in this case familiarity is a good thing. In three relatively short books they have established two really cute and funny characters that will appeal easily to the age range it is aimed at (6-8) and younger. The only problem I have now is finding when the next edition will be out for an impatient 5 year old!"}, {"userName": "Genevi\u00e8ve", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49534674-genevi-ve", "userReview": "Gertrude and Toby Meet the Wolf is the first of this series that I have read.

I reviewed and loved each of the previous books in this series. Plot:Gertrude (the goat) and Toby (the tortoise) go fishing. Along the way, they see and hear a little boy running from a scary wolf - twice. However, they never actually see the wolf either time, After fishing for a bit, they do see the wolf (this is their third encounter with the boy) dragging the boy off to his cave to turn him into boy stew (a sad alternative to pork apparently). Gertrude and Toby rush off to save the boy. After escaping from the wolf, the three end up in the house of the three little pigs. The wolf, after assuming an adorable woodland disguise which fools no one, arrives at the pigs home demanding food, namely boy or pork. Everyone is terrified until Gertrude remembers that they have fish. The wolf is mollified for the day and the three pigs, the boy, and Gertrude/ Toby part friends. The story ends with our heroes lounging on a grassy bank at home on the farm dreaming of their next adventure.This is a charming story full of adventure and action. The only annoying part was the boy exclaiming in surprise, near the end that, \"There really was a wolf! Who knew?\" Wait, what? The boy has been pursued and tied up by the wolf and still he seemed surprised? It didn't really make sense. I understand that maybe at the beginning he is the \"boy who cried wolf\" when there was no wolf. But at the end, he is captured, almost turned into boy stew, and then really pursued by a wolf. It seems to me that the time for surprise has passed. Perhaps that sentence would have more literary impact if he said it earlier in the book? Maybe when he is tied up? Gertrude and Toby could look surprised and the reader is then in on the joke that this is the \"boy who cried wolf\".Illustrations:Since this is an early reviewers copy, the illustrations are not complete. However, I do have beautiful line drawings in my copy. They are incredibly expressive. I especially loved the fabulous wolf. He has such intense emotions and they are all conveyed by the artist. He is drawn scarily (his paw wrapped around the boys arm, his claws and teeth prominently displayed) but in a comical way (a scary wolf in homemade woodland clothes). I also love Gertrude and Toby. This is our third outing with these characters and the illustrator seems to be feeling very comfortable with them - even unto them showing angry irritation with each other. His portrayal of each is true to their character and really adds depth to their stories. I just cannot say enough good things about these pictures!Overall:I hope you love these books as much as I do! They are not perfect but they are full of fun and charm."}, {"userName": "Amie's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11232185-amie-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "\"Gertrude and Toby are best friends and live at McFarland Farms. Every Friday when Farmer Sam goes shopping in town, Gertrude and Toby sneak off the farm for a fun adventure.\" This is the third book in the Gertrude and Toby Fairy-Tale Adventure Series and the first book that I have read. It is NOT necessary to have read the first book to enjoy the third. Each title works as a stand-alone story.Gertrude is a goat and Toby is a tortoise. They seem to make an unlikely pair, but they work perfectly in the story. In each book the pair go on an adventure and they run into characters from other fairy tales.At first I was skeptical that this concept would come across as fresh and unique, but it definitely does. I loved the fact that the pair head out to go fishing at Trout Lake and they decide that whoever catches the most fish will be the one to choose what adventure they will embark upon. As they are walking a boy runs by on a few separate occasions yelling that a wolf is close by (from the fairy tale \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf) and later in the story when a wolf actually does appear, readers meet the pigs from the fairy tale \"The Three Little Pigs.\"The illustrations are simply gorgeous and a treat for the eye. Parents (or Grandparents) will enjoy reading this story to their children just as much as the children will enjoy listening to the tale of the two best friends. I highly recommend this truly wonderful book and I believe that it will make a terrific Christmas gift. Since this book is due to be released in hardcover ten days before Christmas, the timing is perfect. I rate this book as 5 out of 5 Stars and I look forward to reading the first two books in the series as well.I received a free copy of this book from the Publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Donna Maguire", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997643-donna-maguire", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, the images are lovely and the layout is great it keeps attention too.

I've read the previous books in the series and loved them! I think this might be my favorite of the three, although the other two were really in all honesty just as fun! I just liked the way the author and illustrator portrayed the story of the three little pigs in this one.I love how Gertrude and Toby play together and plan their adventures. I loved their fishing and competition to see who could catch the most fish. I had my children and several nieces around while I read this aloud and they all loved it. We had just finished reading book #2 in this series and laughed and they all instantly asked for another one. After we finished reading this one, once again they all asked for another one. I told them there are only 3 so we'll have to wait for another adventure from this fun friend duo.Definitely a children's story I'm going to be recommending to friends and family for fun books to read to kids or fun books for gifts. Loved this series! The illustrations and the story itself are both a lot of fun. They author probably has a lot of fun coming up with these stories(and if not it definitely comes across as that to the readers). The 3 pigs and the wolf were just fun! I know I keep saying fun but honestly it's true. This is one of those children's stories that I could read over and over again and would encourage my children to want to pick this book. If you've read stories to little ones, your own or not, and they beg you to read the same book over and over and over and over and over and over and over....(you get the idea) and it's a book that they love but for you, you just can't quite get into it or love it and you want to hide it or get rid of it or something, anything to save you from reading it again and again. (No I never did hide a favorite book, although I was tempted a time or two, but I was a good mom and kept reading the books that brought joy to my kids and some patience to me - LOL).I would recommend this book to anyone of any age as a fun snuggle up and read and read and read again with one or many little ones!Content: Squeaky Clean!I received a review copy from ebooks.

He was a bit scared of the picture of the wolf grinning evilly in his cave, about to cook a boy in a stew. At one point he didn't even want to finish reading, but he did, and I think he'll enjoy it more as he gets older. It also helps to be familiar with the story of the \"Boy who cried wolf\" as well as \"The three little pigs,\" because this is basically a cartoonish mash-up of both of those, with Gertrude and Toby along for the ride.It was nice that Gertrude (a goat) and Toby (a tortoise) had distinct personalities and things they said, and there was some humorous banter and situations too. Definitely fun for older kids.(In compliance with FTC guidelines, I disclose that I received this book for free through LibraryThing Early Reviewers.
