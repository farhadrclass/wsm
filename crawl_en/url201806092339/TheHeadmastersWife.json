Tragic ... unexpected turn of events in the course of the story. A sad story really... beautifully written. Scenery of Eastern Canada beautifully described. Easy flowing read, once you start, you just want to move on and get to the outcome. Intriguing... Story seems quite logical, until it takes a turn.... 4.5. Recommended!And thanks to Goodreads and my Goodreads friends, for I found this book here.... what a grand source of books GR is! Like his father before him, Arthur Winthrop is the headmaster of Vermont's elite Lancaster school. It is the place he feels has given him his life, but is also the site of his undoing as events spiral out of his control. Found wandering naked in Central Park, he begins to tell his story to the police, but his memories collide into one another, and the true nature of things, a narrative of love, marriage, family and of a tragedy Arthur does not know how to address, emerges. Luminous and atmospheric, bringing to life the tight-knit enclave of a quintessential New England boarding school...What seems to be a deceptively simple story about the headmaster of a New England boarding school and his wife, facing late middle age and growing apart over differences of opinion on their teenage son, morphed into a haunting, mysterious page-turner.... A meditation on longing in all of life's stages.... - Concord MonitorNothing is what is appears in this brilliant story of a life gone awry... The book is, at its core, a trenchant examination of one family's terrible loss and how the aftermath of tragedy can make or break a person's soul...- Publisher's Weekly"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3444927-suzanne", "userReview": "I could not put it down!

It twists and turns like a thriller but deals with grief and loss at the same time. I've never read anything like this. I don't want to give away too much because it is best to go into this novel not knowing anything. I never would have read this but two people outside of Goodreads had recommended it to me. The first time someone told me about it I saw the cover and passed. I'm big on covers and the cover is so blah and made me think it was going to be boring. Then someone else told me to read it and I took it as a sign. I'm so glad I did. It's not boring in the least!!! It is also so beautifully written. At times almost poetic.

Fallish, cool weather, back to school and this story that takes place at an insular prep school the Northeast.Loved how the author drops the reader right into the middle of the story and how aware we are of that but not of what has actually happened. Quite a jolt with the surprise at the end of the first part.The closed world of a live in school, where expectations are passed from father to son. A staying in place, in a way not really growing up, and out, a world and community all its own. Relationships made, marriages, children, things said between a man and woman and what happens when one is lost. Played everything the right way and still floundered.Found this to be quite good, writing is straightforward but evocative, setting and tone perfect for the story. Whether you like the characters or not doesn't really matter, it is a story of a relationship, loosing ones moors and trying to find a new way when the old is no longer viable."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11410830-paul", "userReview": "The Headmaster\u2019s Wife Simply Stunning Like all good stories this has a beginning a middle and an end and have called the three parts; Acrimony, Expectations and After just to help us out. I am sure there will be plenty of people that will try and pigeon hole this book, as literary or psychological thriller but I am adding a new pigeon hole \u2013 its bloody good.Arthur Winthrop is a middle aged headmaster of an elite school in Vermont who is found running naked through New York\u2019s Central Park on a cold and snowy day. While in custody he owns up to an even worse crime that like in Lolita the Headmaster had fallen in love with and carried out an illicit affair with a student. Not only that he had had carried out an illicit affair but things worsened when she started dating a student.What we get is a stunning novel in the first half with its dark undertones of obsessive lust for a schoolgirl and her betrayal at all levels and the whole section is narrated by Arthur making his statement to the police who then looks as guilty as hell. Is he making this confession of his own free will? What is compelling is the narration which seems so dark, obsessive dealing with love, lust, grief, marriage and loss.The Acrimony hooks you and Expectations winds you in like a salmon on a fly hook totally stunned and enthralled you just want to read on. The obsession that takes hold of Arthur Winthrop also gets under the skin of the read you not want but need to read on as this is a fast paced and complex that is so brilliant in this book. This is everything you want and need to read and gives complete enjoyment to the reader I cannot recommend The Headmaster\u2019s Wife highly enough."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda", "userReview": "This book is cleverly written!!

It opens with the Headmaster of a prestigious but insular Vermont school, Arthur Winthrop, being found wandering naked in New York's Central Park. Taken into custody by the police he slowly tells them how his life has spiraled out of control due to an obsessive love affair. Half way through the book, the story switches to the Headmaster's wife Elizabeth and we gradually learn more of her and Arthur's stories and what has brought them to this point. The atmosphere of the school was well conveyed, not just as a beautiful place in Vermont but as a suffocating, closed environment where behaviour must be correct and conventional. I enjoyed the way the author skillfully morphed the novel from what appeared to be a story of forbidden love to one that was much more complex, at the same time totally our feelings towards Arthur. 4.5\u2605"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9555257-maria", "userReview": "The Headmaster's Wife is about love, class, family, and expectations, but it is ultimately a story about how people grieve. A novel in three parts, the first part is told from the point of view of Arthur Winthrop, headmaster of an elite prep school in Vermont called Lancaster. The second part of the story is told from the point of view of his wife, Elizabeth, and she presents a slightly different version of events for us to consider. The third and final part is the denouement, and it manages to be both sad and hopeful. Which feels right, because life is often simultaneously sad and hopeful.I won't share points of the plot because I don't want to spoil the experience of reading the book, but Thomas Christopher Greene has created a remarkably convincing unreliable narrator. Not since reading Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club have I been so surprised to discover the difference between the events as they are presented and the 'truth' of the novel's reality.I believe fans of John Irving and Wally Lamb and Richard Russo would appreciate this book a great deal.Lastly, I like to read author acknowledgments at the close. Mr. Greene's acknowledgments made me cry - even harder than the conclusion to his beautiful story.The ones that love us never truly leave us."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "This story is divided into three parts; Acrimony, Expectations and After. The headmaster narrates the first part and the other two are narrated in the third person describing events from a different perspective. When I began reading the headmaster's story I was concerned by what he was doing and worried where the story was headed. By the end of his narrative I was shocked by the events that had unfolded. While reading 'Expectations' and then 'After' the reader gains insight about events described in part one and the story becomes a very different one.I don't want to say too much or give anything away that you may not already know from the book jacket or promotional blurb. I do want to say that I was completely engrossed by this book and read it from start to finish in less than 24 hours.

I thought it was pretty obvious from the start that Arthur is an unreliable narrator, and there's just nothing subtle in the story.

I had been intrigued by reviews of this novel that noted the three different perspectives from which the story is told, how each perspective informs the previous one so that readers gained new understandings of the characters. The reviews were generous. In spite of quickly getting the sense that this novel was not going to go anywhere near where I\u2019d hoped, I kept reading because I really kept hoping for something more. However, this novel is among those that I (sadly) have wasted far too much time on. The first narrator (the headmaster)is not particularly likable: he is arrogant, selfish, and manipulative. While this section was quite lengthy, I reminded myself that the different POVs would likely shed light on this part of the story or the characters and reveal to me why I should care about the them and their lives. Unfortunately, the second section is written in a completely dispassionate omniscient voice, and while the unsurprising tragedy of the narrator\u2019s life is revealed immediately, smart readers already knew what that event would be and, while we may be sad about the events, the narrative style does not elicit or evoke any sympathy for the characters. The third section brings us back to the present again, and this is where the story begins to turn its focus more directly on the wife of the title. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure why the title emphasizes the wife, because she is merely the rather passive \u201cvictim\u201d of her husband\u2019s actions, and she's not particularly engaging either. Again, the narrative voice didn\u2019t make me care about her any more than I cared about her husband, which is to say that one hour would be too much to waste on this novel so, dear reader, heed my warning and don\u2019t bother!"}, {"userName": "Ladybug Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3090746-ladybug-lynn", "userReview": "Most reviews say that the book is about grief and loss. While that is true, it is more a story of our choices and justifications for those choices and how they lead to grief. Elizabeth's (the titular Headmaster's Wife) life is heartbreaking not because of the big thing that is revealed in the book but because of the bad choices she makes. Choices she makes for comfort and out of loneliness instead of belief in those decisions. So sad. Read the book for the examination of a life not lived to the full potential and not for any twists- twists that are telegraphed early to the observant reader."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2209914-caitlin", "userReview": "The Headmaster's Wife begins as what appears to be a rather conventional tale of a headmaster's mid-life crisis involving an affair with a student and the story of his troubled marriage. It was so conventional, in fact, that I wondered why I was continuing to read it, but the writing was so good that it kept me with the story. I am very glad it did because as the reader finishes part one, narrated by the headmaster, and ventures on into parts two and three, narrated by different characters, the novel and its story bloom in completely unconventional ways. With a nod towards Rashomon, Mr. Greene amply demonstrates the complexity of all story, the bits and pieces of information that come our way as a story is told through different eyes and voice.Often books with multiple narrators fall down for me because the voices just aren't different enough - the characters all sound pretty much the same, their point of view isn't radically different, and I am left wondering why the author bothered. Mr. Greene's narration has none of these issues. His characters are deeply realized with their own voices, their own visions, their own sense of self. This mastery deepens the story as Mr. Greene slowly pieces it together leaving the reader with a sense of the larger whole created of its constituent pieces. Smart, moving, funny, deeply felt and told, The Headmaster's Wife is one of the best books I've read so far this year.

Greene has a way with words that hooks the reader from the first pages. The plot, however, is not as well-considered as I would have liked and I was disappointed by the denouement. It seemed like a deus ex machina, and not at all realistic.The book starts out with Arthur Winthrop, Headmaster of The Lancaster School in Vermont, a prestigious boarding school, found wandering naked in Central Park. What was he doing out there? The police are interested in his story and as it unravels it becomes obvious that parts of Arthur's mind are confused. He tells the story of a marriage that has soured over the years, with lost intimacy and increased distance between him and his wife Elizabeth. At the same time, Arthur becomes obsessively enamored of a new transfer student named Betsy Pappas. He is willing to risk all for a relationship with her. As the story of Betsy and Arthur unfurls, I found myself gripping the pages for more. However, something felt amiss to me and as the second half of the story fills in the pieces, I found out why.Arthur and Elizabeth have a son named Ethan who Arthur had hoped would follow in his family's footsteps and become Headmaster of Lancaster School some day. However, upon graduation, and right after 9/11, Ethan joins the army and goes to Iraq. Arthur is furious and Elizabeth is torn up with fear. Ethan is a good person but is not the son that Arthur had hoped he'd be. Elizabeth has tried to protect him from the world but has to let him go.I found the second half of the book as interesting as the first half. However, I also found it to be implausible towards the end. I don't want to give any spoilers so I will leave it at that. This is a good literary page-turner that leaves something to be desired - like a jigsaw puzzle with two or three missing pieces or pieces that don't fit in. I enjoyed the experience of reading it but hoped for something more."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5175000-susan", "userReview": "I recently finished reading \"The Headmaster's Wife\" by Thomas Christopher Greene. I admit to being somewhat at a loss on how to review this book. This is a book told by multiple voices and it is incumbent on the reader to determine what is true and what is an altered perception of reality. The setting is the elite world of the private New England prep school - Lancaster, in Vermont. Arthur Winthrop is Lancaster's headmaster, a position that his father held before him. When the book opens, Arthur is found wandering naked in Central Park and after being picked up by the police, he tells them (and us) his story in flashback form; this comprises the first part of the book. He drinks too much, has a indifferent relationship with his wife Elizabeth, who he tells us is obsessed with tennis and possibly her tennis instructor. He is estranged from his only son who is serving in the army in Afghanistan. Arthur becomes obsessed with a student, Becky Pappas, and he begins an affair with her. This Arthur is unlikable and his actions are reprehensible. At this point I wondered how I would finish the book.In the interest of not revealing any spoilers, I will just say that in the second part of the book, we hear from another point of view and learn that what Arthur views as true is not necessarily so...the cause of Arthur's mental deconstruction was not a surprise to me but the author did reveal the truth eventually, piece by piece. One of the jacket reviews called \"The Headmaster's Wife\" is psychologically complex and wickedly fast-paced\"; I would say it was somewhat predictable and that I had to push myself to keep reading it. Ultimately I found it to be a sad story about people with sad, not particularly interesting or remarkable lives. The point where a good discussion could be had would be the discussion about how a major life change causes psychological damage in different ways to different people.I received a copy of this book from the Amazon Vine Program for my honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "a &", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10315601-a", "userReview": "Thomas Christopher Greene's writing was done beautifully. I read the acknowledgments part and it said that he wrote this book for his second daughter who was born early and died. If I had known that when I was going in to read the book I would have had a different mindset. As it was this was a very complex story that was well written.Greene writes in a way that draws in the reader. However, the plot seemed confusing to me and I feel as though I didn't understand the message of the story properly and clearly. The concept seemed interesting but I don't think the execution was done as clearly. It didn't seem very realistic at all actually.The book starts out with Arthur Winthorp, the headmaster of the title, wandering around Central Park in New York naked. The police find him and asks him to tell them his story. Arthur talks of being a headmaster at a prestigious school, Lancaster. He talks about how his colleagues were worried about him and told him to step back in the classroom. He talks about his dying marriage with his wife, Elizabeth; his affair with an eighteen year old student Betsy Pappas; and hardly talks about his son Ethan. What happened with Ethan isn't revealed at the first part of the story. All we know is that he went into the army.Arthur's love affair with Betsy seemed crazy and impossible to me. What kind of a teenager girl would sleep with a fifty something year old man when she could have just as easily done it with classmates. Betsy ends up rejecting Arthur. Arthur, who was willing to risk it all for their love, goes to crazy depths to save it and keep it alive. Russell, a classmate of Betsy's, is caught in the crossfire. He is kicked out of Lancaster for illegally obtaining alcohol which Arthur planted in his room.I then felt uncomfortable because I realized how much Arthur loved Betsy. It seemed like the consuming kind of love and it was clear to me that Betsy didn't feel the same way about Arthur. I felt worried for Betsy and among the last few pages of part one my worry turned out to be logical.However there was this one shocking thing that came out at the end of part one. It filled in the gaps in the story and I wondered why I didn't see it before but it was written in a way that you would suspect it but you wouldn't entirely be sure.I like the second half less than the first half but it filled in more things about the story to make it clearer. We got to learn more things about Betsy Pappas, Elizabeth, Ethan, and poor Russell who was never really at fault.The reasoning behind the story made sense when we found out the missing jigsaw piece about Arthur. However, I didn't like the last part of the story at all. It left something to be desired, it wasn't a good ending to a good book. This was definitely a literary page-turner though. If I went back to analyze it I would probably find a lot of hidden messages and symbolism.Won in Goodreads First Reads"}, {"userName": "Sandy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10715774-sandy", "userReview": "The question above this box asks, \"What did you think?\" Hmmmm. This book rendered me unable to think. I can't figure out why. I don't have the skills to step back from the story and analyze it objectively, to understand how the author put the pieces together so skillfully. I don't know why it works so well, but it is a story like no other story I have ever read (and I've read a lot of stories).I believe the reader is drawn in by the oddity of the opening scene, and pulled along through the story by the desire to understand what events led to the strange behaviour of this rather ordinary headmaster of a New England boarding school. Quite early in the story, one begins to suspect that perhaps he is descending into madness. Or is it his wife who is suffering through an emotional breakdown? Why is he inappropriately fixated on a young female student? Why does he seek revenge on his romantic rival, the school's star basketball player? What is reality, and what is fantasy?

The choices, perspectives and desires that shape the lives of these characters are presented with not an inkling of the sharp turns that lay ahead. At the center of it all stands Grief with a capital G. Like the too big clothes Arthur wears, at the beginning, life has become oversize for them all.

I went into this book without having read any of the reviews and had no idea what it was about except for the blurb on the back. It was not at all what I was expecting. Well, the first part of the book was and had it continued down that course it still would have been good. I had a niggling feeling while reading that there was more to the narrative that was flowing below the surface. I don't know if it was my intuition or the author was just really good and he was able to plant the seeds. (I'll give the author the credit). The second part of the book was a partial retelling of the first part but now from the perspective of the Headmaster's wife. (I wondered where she was going to figure in so prominently. I mean, the book IS  named after her!!) Part two has an entirely different feel from Part one. It really was so well written that the author essentially tells me again what he just told me but it still felt like a new story. Part three is kind of a summation of both parts and a conclusion of sorts. I felt the third part was the weakest link. It was for this weakness that I marked it down from the 5 stars I planned to give. I was just not enamored with the results. It felt very \"up in the air\", and I wasn't entirely sure the author's motive for leaving some things as he did. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes good literary fiction."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281353-patty", "userReview": "The Headmaster's WifeByThomas Christopher GreeneWhat it's all about...I could just say that it is a story about a headmaster and his wife but this book is so much more.My thoughts after reading this book...This book is one of those delightful puzzles...from the opening the author led me to believe one thing...when the reality was something totally different.Without giving anything away...here is something to ponder. There is a man running in the park and suddenly he is naked and just as suddenly he is picked up by the police and questioned. He is Arthur Winthrop and he is the headmaster of Lancaster School. His father was headmaster before him and his hope was that his son Ethan would be headmaster after him. Lancaster is one of those schools where everyone eats in the dining hall and everyone wears uniforms and students are prepared for Harvard or Yale or Wellesley and everything runs according to plan...until Arthur kind of loses it. When Arthur is telling his story it also includes his wife Elizabeth...and the fact that they are sleeping in separate bedrooms. I am so sorry to make this so vague but I really can't tell you anything else or any reader's joy in reading this book will be ruined.What I loved best...I loved the way the author crafted this book. It was totally original. My ending thoughts for potential readers...This is not a book to be ignored. I thought it was masterfully written. I read and read and read...until I was exhausted and then still I read more...I fell asleep with it in my hands and awakened and started reading again. It was brilliant!One of my favorite books so far this year!"}], "description": "Inspired by a personal loss, Greene explores the way that tragedy and time assail one man\u2019s memories of his life and loves.Like his father before him, Arthur Winthrop is the Headmaster of Vermont\u2019s elite Lancaster School. It is the place he feels has given him his life, but is also the site of his undoing as events spiral out of his control. Found wandering naked in Central Park, he begins to tell his story to the police, but his memories collide into one another, and the true nature of things, a narrative of love, of marriage, of family and of a tragedy Arthur does not know how to address emerges.Luminous and atmospheric, bringing to life the tight-knit enclave of a quintessential New England boarding school, the novel is part mystery, part love story and an exploration of the ties of place and family. Beautifully written and compulsively readable, The Headmaster\u2019s Wife stands as a moving elegy to the power of love as an antidote to grief.", "title": "The Headmaster's Wife", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934519-the-headmaster-s-wife", "average": 3.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382759153l/17934519.jpg", "reviews": 1023, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50573.Thomas_Christopher_Greene", "name": "Thomas Christopher Greene"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934519-the-headmaster-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19446023-the-headmaster-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21853738-the-headmaster-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114427-if-i-forget-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88032.Mirror_Lake", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88029.I_ll_Never_Be_Long_Gone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88031.Envious_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88030.After_The_Rain"]}
