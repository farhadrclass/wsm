The writing style draws you into the story and the time frames easily. There are some bits of humour that really hit home for me as they perfectly describe people in my own life. I fully understand Joyce's reluctance to acknowledge her son's homosexuality in a small town in the 1980s. It is even more difficult for her to acknowledge that her son, John, died of AIDS and because of her controlling nature had been unwilling to share his adult life with her. My own mother still struggles to use the word husband in reference to my partner when speaking with her friends at church in Woodstock, but both of my parents were willing participants in our adult lives. Based on the story my mother would only be a few years younger than the character in the novel. Canadian society, even in the largest urban centres was not open to the 'gay lifestyle' at that time. It is a very changed world today. Unlike Joyce my parents were at least open to accepting and acknowledging myself and my husband within the family. I look forward to meeting the author in February at a local book club meeting and being able to further discuss the novel with him. The names of the fictionalized towns interest me as I think I may know which real towns they are modelled on and would like to confirm my suspicions.I would easily recommend this to anyone, and I look forward to investigating other titles from Mr. Francis."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "Joyce Sparks lives at Chestnut Park Nursing home. She is finding it more and more to difficult to get around each day and she knows this will be the last place she lives. When Timothy, the new male volunteer, shows up in her room trying to engage her in social activities, or at the very least, in a conversation she puts up her usual \u201cgrumpy old lady\u201d barrier. She can\u2019t maintain it though because, darn it all, he bears such a striking resemblance to her first love, Freddy Pender.Everyone in the small town of Balsden, Ontario knew that there was something a little off about Freddy. Something that was not quite acceptable in the 1950\u2019s. But Freddy left town to become famous and Joyce stayed behind, married Charlie and had a son. A son who wanted nothing more than to play in the pretend kitchen in kindergarten and receive a doll for Christmas. Something that was not quite acceptable in the 1960\u2019s. Something she had to keep secret from her husband.As Joyce shares her story we follow her through her life, her denial and then slow acceptance of her son\u2019s (and Freddy\u2019s) sexuality, small town life rife with gossip, the \u201cgay disease\u201d, and growing old. Could she have been a better mother, a better wife, a better sister or a better friend?I liked Joyce! I liked her story very much, too. Kudos to Mr. Francis for writing a story so filled with life, love, misunderstanding and heartache. Yet, told in a poignant way \u2026 interspersed with humor. People trying to do their best and not always succeeding."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4124973-linda", "userReview": "Joyce Sparks is grieving and regretful.

Her voice left me cringing on more than one occasion, she had too many issues that left me feeling very unsympathetic, and in fact, she angered me. I suppose that sort of visceral reaction should in fact warrant another star for this book; however, there were a few things that were left unanswered for me and I put this book down feeling as though it wasn't really \"finished\". The writing is wonderful, and quite powerful in many instances, but it didn't illicit the tenderness in me that I hoped I would gain for the central character in this novel. Joyce is a mother to a gay child, and the central story here is that she is unable to come to grips with this fact. A small town woman, married to Charlie out of convenience more than love, she stays put in the town in which she grew up, always wondering what happened to the true love of her life, Freddy Pender. Freddy, as it happens, is \"different\" - and of course talk is that he is gay - and he leaves town soon after highschool to pursue his career in entertainment. Joyce never accepts that Freddy is a gay man, just as she never accepts that her son is gay. Her form of coping is denial, secrecy, burial of the truth at all costs - her idea of \"protecting him\" - and in the end it severely effects her relationships with everyone, including her husband Charlie. Joyce is very much alone at the end of her life and in a sad, angry state. I would like to say that she redeems herself, and I think the author tries to ensure that she does, but I could never mustre a lot of sympathy for her. I related to her as a mother more than anything, and in my mind I could not forgive her for not accepting her son - in the end that love and acceptance would have protected him far better than denial ever would have. As a mother I could not forgive Joyce for her lack of acceptance, even if she did love her son. Worthy of reading and thinking about in an age where we still have a long way to go in terms of acceptance and understanding of that which is \"different\" from our own worldview."}, {"userName": "Clare", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/984138-clare", "userReview": "Exceptional. My heart broke over and over and over again. Without bashing us over the head this book asks us to think about our own prejudices that come to light in the smallest of our actions.

It's a fantastic, moving, funny book. I read slowly near the end as I knew the book was going to break my heart.The author spoke about the idea of shame around deaths from AIDS in the early 80's and wondered what those parents felt now, and this is the foundation for the book.A real character piece, Joyce Sparks comes vividly to life on every page. I have heard others saying they liked her sometimes and wanted to smack her other times but I was very engrossed and was quite happy to sit back and watch the story unfold.A great novel about acceptance and self and the things we hold on to.

Regret, fear, frustration, self-deception, pain... It is almost too difficult to understand the struggles of this mother (in the 1950s to the 1980s) whose son is gay. I say almost because there is still a lot of bigotry and fear against/ toward gay and lesbian people (not to mention queer or transgender) today. I think it has been said that it is still one of the biggest insults that middle-schoolers throw at one another.I really appreciated Francis' portrayal of the life of this small-town woman through her own voice. Small-town life has its own frustrations I would think, and they probably compound a lot of what happens in the novel. He also really penetrates the banality and boredom of the old age homes (is that what they are called?). I doubt that this is the experience of every elderly person, but probably the experience of a lot of them. A Place where there is no future, only the routinized present and a whole lot of past to dwell upon. Makes me wonder what kinds of things I will be thinking back on should I reach that point in my life."}, {"userName": "Farzana Doctor", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53506-farzana-doctor", "userReview": "Natural Order is a beautiful novel about an experience we rarely read in novels--the story of a grieving, regretful and homophobic mother of a gay man.

However, after the first chapter I was hooked and had to finish it until the end. It brought up many raw emotions in me, having lost my mother a couple of years ago. As a gay man, I am fortunate to have had parents who wholeheartedly supported and embraced me as I came to terms with my identity. It broke my heart over and over and over again reading this book, to see how harmful Joyce was to her son by not being able to accept him. The author does a fantastic job of showing how a person, especially a person of Joyce's age and upbringing, could grapple with their child's sexuality. I too have HIV, and it hit me in the gut once I realized this was a part of this book as well. Reading this book felt like I was reading an alternate version of my life, had my parents been less than open to my sexuality and diagnosis. I feel like this book is a must-read for anyone who has ever had a contentious relationship with their parent. The author makes human a character (Joyce) who one would otherwise be tempted to dislike. Joyce's struggle felt real, it felt honest, it felt sad and tragic. I feel like the author gave Joyce a sense of redemption in the end (not going to spoil it), though it was subtle and almost missed. I ended the book having forgiven her for being simply human."}, {"userName": "Brenna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328901-brenna", "userReview": "Summary: Natural Order begins with Joyce in a nursing home. She's elderly and reflecting back on her life, and in particular the life of her only son who died in his 30s. The book is a collection of memories which stand out to her, and how they impacted her as she grew up. This book makes you think, and it definitely makes you feel. It's about relationships and how we view other people, as well as how we treat them. It's about how we learn to deal with life and its difficulties. The story was heartbreaking to read. The constant fear of rejection and feelings of isolation on both the parts of Joyce and John ring so true to real life. Francis raises questions regarding the parent-child relationship and how expectations can be so harmful to it. That being said, I didn't particularly like this book. My main complaint about this book is how disjointed the story feels as the author moves between time periods from Joyce's present to her past. I would love to see more indication as to what time period the sections of the book are referring to. As well, I felt that the author spent too many pages trying to drive his point home about how the reader should feel towards Joyce. I almost felt like the writing was trying to force a reaction out of me, which was tiresome as a reader.I was kindly provided with an ARC in a Goodreads giveaway for this book."}, {"userName": "Jenny Gayfer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8582656-jenny-gayfer", "userReview": "Natural Order was a solid read. It pulled on all my emotions and captured my attention. It very much brought to mind the two years that my Mom was in extended care. It was bang on in the portrayal of daily life. The book gave me a vast picture of a persons entire life and reminded me that we are not impervious to age - it is coming to us all, and it is here already for some of those I love. It's a reminder that the person on the inside does not change, even though on the outside life ages them. They are still plagued by self dooubts and regrets. They are still trying to get it right. It's a reminder that elderly people are quality human beings, that so often get swept under the mat by society. There is so much life and wisdom waiting to be unfolded in each human being. Just ask...And as a parent, this book reminded me to always question my intentions. Is this in the best interest of my child or myself? It is a reminder too know what you want for your child at the outset, and to be sure that every act and gesture is a step in that directon. The character, Joy says \"...having a baby would fix everything.\" the fix comes from within, not from without. The most responsible thing we can do for our children, our families, and society, is to nurture our souls, and attend to our inner happiness. Only then can we serve those we love."}, {"userName": "Alexandra ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8066671-alexandra", "userReview": "A librarian personally (and very enthusiastically) recommended this book to me, as she had just finished reading it herself. After reading the book, I can see why she over-rode the holds to give it to me!Natural Order centres on the life of Joyce Sparks, a woman who had come of age in small-town Ontario during the 1950s and is living out the end in a retirement home. The book explores her complex relationships with the loves in her life: her high school crush and her son, respectively-- as well as coming to terms with their sexuality. The choices she makes haunts her for decades, until she meets a volunteer in the retirement home...From the first page, 'Natural Order' is a book that you can easily get into. I liked how Francis also gave depth to the secondary relationships between Joyce and other characters in the book (i.e. her husband, sister, friends).

Brian Francis does an excellent job getting into the head of Joyce, who is a complex character who struggles between what she feels is right and the mores of the time (1950s-60s). He creates a sympathetic portrayal of how a woman of this era may possibly struggle with her son's sexual identity.I admire Francis' ability to effortlessly shift between moments in Joyce's life, employing flashback in a seamless and revelatory manner that never once felt contrived or confusing. I also enjoyed the relationships Joyce has with her overbearing sister Helen and spinster friend Fern. In very few words Francis is able to convey a great deal about complicated female friendships. The scope of the novel, female narrator and Francis' clean writing style reminded me of The Age of Hope, by David Bergen, currently a Canada Reads selection.

Joyce is in her eighties and living in a seniors' care facility. The appearance of a young man as a volunteer causes her to dig into her memories and think about the past.

She thinks of the various times in their relationship that she had the opportunity to treat him differently than she did, and she struggles with the guilt she has over her relationship with him.Through these memories and talking to the young volunteer, she finally admits the truth of her son's life and death, a truth she has denied even to herself for years.This book reaches inward as Joyce sees how she failed her son even as she loved him and tried to do what she thought was best.

The son, in turn, feels that he cannot come out of the closet to his parents and in turn, robs himself of his relationship with his parents.

Its sadness is worth sinking into, however; it\u2019s a nuanced and multilayered exploration of loss, of aging, of the sins we commit against those we love the most, and of human failings in all their multifarious abundance.Told from the perspective of octogenarian Joyce Sparks, the story unfolds almost exclusively in the small, single-industry town of Balsden, Ontario. Joyce is in a nursing home, commentating tartly on her fellow \u2018inmates,\u2019 the staff, and her surroundings. Her voice is one of the most authentic I\u2019ve read in a long time\u2014she\u2019s a snappish, sharp old woman, more brittle than frail. Both her son and her husband are dead, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have any friends. The only person who visits her is a young gay man who volunteers at the home and calls forth some of Joyce\u2019s reminiscences. She could be my own grandmother when she refers to \u201cthe Filipina nurse\u201d or the woman across the table who dribbles food down her front at each meal. She\u2019s weak physically, bright mentally, but crippled by the guilt she\u2019s been dragging around with her for most of her adult life.Joyce tells us her story across several different timelines, and Brian Francis shifts us effortlessly between her soda-jerk era teenaged years, her motherhood, and the years between the deaths of her son and her husband, and her time in the nursing home. She touches on her infatuation with Freddy, her obviously gay schoolmate whose flamboyance and \u201cdifferences\u201d are whispered about and hushed up. Joyce sees him as an escape artist, someone not afraid to be un-Balsden. His suicide after leaving town and falling in with a \u201cbad crowd\u201d in Hollywood is greeted as almost inevitable by the people back home. Joyce\u2019s own naivet\u00e9 about Freddy\u2014he couldn\u2019t have been that way, things might have been different if only he had chosen her\u2014follows her throughout her life and her dealings with her own son. Joyce is left in Balsden, married to a man she chooses out of loneliness, visiting Freddy\u2019s mother out of a bizarre sense of responsibility, and becoming increasingly frightened yet stubbornly unseeing of her small son\u2019s \u201ctendencies.\u201d Along the way, we also meet her bossy older sister Helen and her best friend for life Fern, her across-the-street neighbour Mr. Sparrow, and her stalwart, silently suffering husband Charlie. Each character is authentic and three-dimensional. Each has his or her own fears and beliefs and heartaches.These aren\u2019t flashbacks but remembrances. Joyce is piecing together her own fractured life, living through her guilt and torn between what-ifs and inevitabilities. What if she had escaped Balsden? What if she hadn\u2019t been influenced by Freddy\u2019s suicide? Would she have been less hard on her son? Would she have allowed him to grow up to be who he wanted to be, without the terrifying desire to \u201cprotect\u201d him? We don\u2019t know, and neither does Joyce, because she can\u2019t see it happening any other way. This is her story and this is how it was. She couldn\u2019t have reacted differently in any of these situations, because how else could she have reacted?She\u2019s a reliable narrator to a fault: Francis has crafted her flaws flawlessly. This is a woman who drags the past around with her like a deadened limb. She can barely move for the guilt she feels, for the remorse toward her son, her husband, what could have been. Joyce cleaves to the idea that she is alone because she deserves to be, because she drove everyone else away.And this is a gutsy move: in many ways Joyce is supremely unlikeable. Even as you\u2019re reading through her understanding that what she did caused all of the destruction in her life, you want to grab her by her shoulders and shake her. Her unenlightened views on homosexuality, her meddlesome nature (no matter how well intentioned), and her ability to drive away and segregate her son, whom she adores and alienates by equal measures, are enough to make you scream. She is so 1950s small town. Her dry date squares, her inability to tell her kindly older neighbor that she can never eat all of the fresh vegetables he gives her, her stubborn refusal to see that homosexuality isn\u2019t an abnormality\u2026these traits are utterly true to life and utterly frustrating. She can have no redemption. Her loneliness is of her own making.Where the novel falls down a bit is in this mire of guilt. It can become, if not tiresome, then certainly tiring. Every page is Joyce telling us what a terrible mother and wife she\u2019s been. Metaphors and language are at times a bit heavy-handed as well. The parallels between Freddy and his mother and Joyce and her son are a bit too pat, a bit too coincidental. If their stories were told and no names were given, you wouldn\u2019t know which of the two women were being described, and this takes away from the rest of the well-crafted realism.Where the novel succeeds, beyond its exploration of the difficulties of being gay for most of the twentieth century, and especially in a small town, is in its portrayal of the very elderly. Freddy\u2019s mother in her nineties, and then a few decades later Joyce in her 80s, and everything they have to deal with, are portrayed in a heartbreaking and alarming way. The rest of Joyce\u2019s life has whooshed by, but she\u2019s stuck in an interminable morass of days in the last home she\u2019ll ever know, where the staff care only because they are paid to, the food is terrible, and the activities are banal. As the baby boomers age, and write about aging parents and growing older themselves, we\u2019re going to see more and more of this type of fiction. Joan Barfoot\u2019s Exit Lines and Sara Gruen\u2019s Water for Elephants explore similar themes.Brian Francis\u2019 Joyce is the most successful of any of these narrators. She is such a believable, perfectly rendered character, and her world of the nursing home is at once tragic and mundane. Joyce\u2019s is a sad, no-nonsense life, one that will break your heart but that is absolutely worth visiting."}, {"userName": "Susan Finck", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7739937-susan-finck", "userReview": "This was a different kind of book for me.

Had I read this book 10 years ago I would not have had the feeling that I was looking in a mirror, glancing at my future. \"I've been thinking that you can only ever deal with something with whatever means you have at that particular moment. I suppose one advantage in getting older is that you do have a better frame of reference. But you're also left with the memories of all those moments when you didn't know any better.\" Is it too late for second chances? I guess you'll have to read Natural Order to find out."}, {"userName": "Monica Penthor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53301090-monica-penthor", "userReview": "Story centres around Joyce Sparks who is mother to a gay son. She is a very controlling woman trying to fit her life into her pre-conceived notions. As a result her relationship with her son suffers as well as her relationship with her husband. To make matters worse she controls the relationship between her husband and her son as well, all the while being very self-rightous. As Joyce looks back on her life when she is living in a nursing home, she discovers that perhaps she did not do right by the people she loved most. Joyce is not a very sympathetic character. The author portrays her very well which is a credit to her writing ability."}, {"userName": "JoAnne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21903799-joanne", "userReview": "\"He once broke his wrist doing a cartwheel.\" Page 43 ( personal memory )\"You don't miss the things you never had.\" Page 52\"How people can be so different, even in families.\" Page 78 ESP in families\"Where had this fat come from?...Is this what happens to women after thirty?\" Page 142...or 40, or 50\"Just a schnauzer.\" \"I'd like to meet him.\" \"He'll likely pee on the floor.\" \"Then he'll fit right in.\" Page 196\"I don't think there's a lot of money to be made in cookies.\" \"Tell that to Mr. Christie.\" Page 267\"as painful as dreams are, at least I get the chance to see him again.

I have not read Brian Francis before, and was blown away by his writing skill. He is definitely in the same league as Margaret Laurence, David Sedaris and Alice Munroe. Wow! He is able to capture the emotions of people with such poignancy and humour. I cried and laughed as I read this book, which I consider the sign of a wonderful author. He understands the complexity of life and ageing so well."}], "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said, even though it wasn\u2019t my style. It was cut glass and silver. Something a movie star might wear. Is this what my boy thought of me? I wondered as he fastened it around my neck. He called me Elizabeth Taylor and I laughed and laughed. I wore that necklace throughout the rest of the day. In spite of its garishness, I was surprised by how I felt: glamourous, special. I was out of my element amidst my kitchen cupboards and self-hemmed curtains. I almost believed in a version of myself that had long since faded away.--From Natural Order by Brian FrancisJoyce Sparks has lived the whole of her 86 years in the small community of Balsden, Ontario. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything on earth you can\u2019t find in your own backyard,\u201d her mother used to say, and Joyce has structured her life accordingly. Today, she occupies a bed in what she knows will be her final home, a shared room at Chestnut Park Nursing Home where she contemplates the bland streetscape through her window and tries not to be too gruff with the nurses. This is not at all how Joyce expected her life to turn out. As a girl, she\u2019d allowed herself to imagine a future of adventure in the arms of her friend Freddy Pender, whose chin bore a Kirk Douglas cleft and who danced the cha-cha divinely. Though troubled by the whispered assertions of her sister and friends that he was \u201cfruity,\u201d Joyce adored Freddy for all that was un-Balsden in his flamboyant ways.\u00a0 When Freddy led the homecoming parade down the main street , his expertly twirled baton and outrageous white suit gleaming in the sun, Joyce fell head over heels in unrequited love.Years later, after Freddy had left Balsden for an acting career in New York, Joyce married Charlie, a kind and reserved man who could hardly be less like Freddy. They married with little fanfare and she bore one son, John. Though she did love Charlie, Joyce often caught herself thinking about Freddy, buying Hollywood gossip magazines in hopes of catching a glimpse of his face. Meanwhile, she was growing increasingly alarmed about John\u2019s preference for dolls and kitchen sets. She concealed the mounting signs that John was not a \u201cnormal\u201d boy, even buying him a coveted doll if he promised to keep it a secret from Charlie.News of Freddy finally arrived, and it was horrifying: he had killed himself, throwing himself into the sea from a cruise ship. \u201cA mother always knows when something isn\u2019t right with her son,\u201d was Mrs. Pender\u2019s steely utterance when Joyce paid her respects, cryptically alleging that Freddy\u2019s homosexuality had led to his destruction. That night, Joyce threatened to take away John\u2019s doll if he did not join the softball team. Convinced she had to protect John from himself, she set her small family on a narrow path bounded by secrecy and shame, which ultimately led to unimaginable loss.Today, as her life ebbs away at Chestnut Park, Joyce ponders the terrible choices she made as a mother and wife and doubts that she can be forgiven, or that she deserves to be. Then a young nursing home volunteer named Timothy appears, so much like her long lost John. Might there be some grace ahead in Joyce\u2019s life after all?Voiced by an unforgettable and heartbreakingly flawed narrator, Natural Order is a masterpiece of empathy, a wry and tender depiction of the end-of-life remembrances and reconciliations that one might undertake when there is nothing more to lose, and no time to waste.", "title": "Natural Order", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11290015-natural-order", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320482873l/11290015.jpg", "reviews": 112, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5781070.Brian_Francis", "name": "Brian  Francis"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Lgbt", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11290015-natural-order", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12836009-natural-order", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/745599.Fruit"]}
