But, the main character was SO annoying. No one person could possibly be that incompetent in every area of their lives: marriage, parenting, relationship with her own parents, business, romance. She was a failure at everything and she never seemed to learn from her mistakes.

Gruen is a good writer, but an editor really needed to slap her hand away from the crisis button during the review of this book. I mean, the main character is getting divorced, barely on speaking terms with her parents, oh wait, her father is dying so that helps things in that scenario, she has a teenage daughter running out of control (and she's a terrible parent naturally), she's heading toward financial ruin, she's sleeping with an old flame, she's afraid to ride again, she has acquired a horse under suspicious legal circumstances, she's flirting with a Frenchman, the French guy has a mustache, she's drinking too much and taking Valiums like they're canapes at a boring wedding--it's exhausting to read and with all that going on, who has time to give a crap about the characters? Although naturally it's pleasing to realize that, perhaps with Hollywood in mind, everything will be resolved by the final page of the book, when finances are going great, she's riding her newly acquired horse, she's reconciled with her daughter, mother and husband, has mourned her father's death (but not too much), etc., etc., yawn, yawn.Also, although Gruen is a good writer, this book is a textbook case of telling not showing.Disappointing."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "So it was hard for me to like the main character, Annemarie Zimmer. Even a little bit. She\u2019s self-centered, socially inept, and she flies off the handle at the slightest provocation. She\u2019s a walking nightmare, and yet she\u2019s not a complete lost cause. She does try, however miserably, and she always ends up failing, but there\u2019s something to be said for effort, right?There is something to be said for the tragic character, and in many respects that\u2019s exactly what Annemarie is. And if it hadn\u2019t been for Sara Gruen\u2019s deft hand, RIDING LESSONS might have been lacking. In fact, I might have turned away completely.But I didn\u2019t. My fingers pressed against my Kindle, as I turned page after electronic page, and I began to realize that Annemarie\u2014at least to a certain extent\u2014was a victim of her own circumstances, those from her past and those she had yet to face. She may not have been able to completely save herself, or her daughter, or in some cases even her family, but she was broken and flawed and she popped right off of the page as real as life itself.Sometimes that\u2019s what we need to see in life. And I was okay with that. If you enjoy engaging reads with characters you may not totally enjoy or completely agree with, you might enjoy this one well enough. If not, you may want to set your sights elsewhere.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina", "userReview": "Life is really too short to read books this damn dumb. When I pulled this book from my shelf and read the back cover I couldn\u2019t remember why the hell I\u2019d bought this book back in 2009. I\u2019m guessing I\u2019d just finished the author\u2019s Water for Elephants and liked it enough to give another of her books a shot. Also, horses are involved and I\u2019m a sucker for anything horse-related. Well, the horsey descriptions cannot make up for awkward writing, a moronic and odious heroine, and clunky romantic elements. Sara Gruen\u2019s Riding Lessons is the story of Annemarie Zimmer who was once an Olympic contender in equestrian sports, but, after a horrific riding accident at eighteen, refused to ever ride again. Now she is a 38 year old woman who has moved back home to New Hampshire and her parents\u2019 horse farm in order to put her shattered life back together. That\u2019s the concise summary of the book. What happens is, all on the same day, Annemarie (aka Dipshit) is laid off from her job, her husband tells her he\u2019s leaving her for a younger woman, she discovers her daughter is in danger of being expelled from school, and her mother calls her to tell her that her father is dying of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), a particularly horrible disease that gradually paralyzes the body but leaves the mind active and aware. As a reader I think, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a lot of crap to hit a person all on one day.\u201d But okay, I\u2019ll put aside my doubts and keep reading. How is our intrepid heroine going to deal with all this? In one word: badly.First, she packs up her surly teenage daughter Eva and moves them from Minneapolis to New Hampshire. Ostensibly this is to help around the house and see her father, but she\u2019s so horrified by his deteriorating condition that she avoids him and can barely stand to be around him. Okay, I can understand that this is difficult, but wow. Annemarie, you are officially a Dipshit and an asshole. Next, she walks in on her daughter in the bathtub and, after spending a certain amount of time creepily observing her daughter\u2019s \u201cimpossibly firm\u201d breasts and \u201cperfect, taut skin,\u201d she sees above one of her breasts a tattoo of a unicorn \u201cwith a radius of approximately one inch\u201d and freaks the fuck out (62). She attempts to yank Eva from the tub, causing the girl to fall backwards into the tub, screams at her that she is a stupid little girl and storms from the room to look up plastic surgeons to have this teeny tiny unicorn blasted from her daughter\u2019s perfect body. Uh, who\u2019s the child here? Damn woman, calm down. It\u2019s a tiny tattoo of a unicorn for crying out loud. Within twenty minutes (seriously, that\u2019s directly from the book), Dipshit storms downstairs, shouting for Eva to come here right this second because they have an appointment in half an hour to see a plastic surgeon. Um, okay, more eye-rolling on my part. Really? You have an appointment with a plastic surgeon today in 30 minutes? C\u2019mon. You\u2019re in New Hampshire, not freaking Los Angeles. And where the hell is this plastic surgeon who can see you in 30 minutes? Does New Hampshire have an office conveniently located nearby solely dedicated to seeing melodramatic psycho idiotic mothers? Luckily, Papa sees this and he consoles his stupid daughter, telling her that if she forces Eva to remove the tattoo, she\u2019ll probably be resentful and do something even more rebellious. Gee, ya think? Dipshit is astonished by this amazing insight and never hauls Eva to the plastic surgeon. From what I can see, Eva is not a bad kid. It seems that she is just acting like a teenager\u2014excited about something and talkative one day, surly and sullen the next. That\u2019s being a teenager. That\u2019s what they do. They also sometimes do things they know will piss off their parents and the parents should be wise enough to know this and be flexible enough to deal with it without freaking out. Dipshit is not this parent. Who knows about Roger, her missing husband, but Dipshit seems to have been an absent parent and even when she spent time with her daughter, she didn\u2019t seem to enjoy the experience all that much. All parents screw up and make mistakes, but Dipshit is too much of a child herself to deal maturely with Eva. This book has a lot of problems, but the poorly constructed characters is the biggest. I think Gruen meant for readers to have sympathy for Dipshit and to show how Dipshit is courageous and can face the overwhelming challenges life has thrown at her. However, Gruen has piled on way too many challenges for Dipshit and Dipshit is not facing them. I can understand Dipshit being unfocused and thrown off balance by her loss of a job and her husband leaving her AND her father\u2019s ALS, but c\u2019mon. She doesn\u2019t deal with any of it. She avoids her lawyer\u2019s emails and phone calls even though she\u2019s the one who initiated divorce proceedings\u2026and she still has thoughts such as, \u201coh, I\u2019m sure Roger and I can work it out and get back together.\u201d Um, then why do you avoid his phone calls and emails? Why did you file for divorce? Supposedly she wants to help her father, but she is horrified by him and can\u2019t face him so she avoids him. She picks fights with her mother (\u201cMutti,\u201d apparently German for mother/mom? \u201cPappa\u201d and \u201cMutti\u201d are names that both annoy me. I guess it just seems childish) about stupid stuff because she\u2019s an immature brat. When she tells Mutti she wants to help run the stables, Mutti tells her no because she doesn\u2019t have the training and it\u2019s more complicated than she thinks. Dipshit gets offended by this and responds with a smart ass comment, \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science!\u201d Cue the dramatic music: Dipshit fucks up managing the stables. I\u2019m not sure when she started managing the stables; from what the author has shown me of Mutti, she wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. But suddenly Dipshit is managing and Mutti is shuffled off-stage to take care of her husband. This doesn\u2019t make any sense because they have a male nurse who is there now almost 24/7 to help with Pappa and he zips around in a wheelchair so\u2026what\u2019s Mutti doing? Oh, yeah, the author needed to have Dipshit take over the stable management so she can show how demanding it is and add more difficulty to this woman\u2019s life. I\u2019m guessing that magically (with the help of a good man, there are two candidates waiting to be interviewed) she\u2019ll see she need to focus and bam! she\u2019ll become an amazing stable manager. Overnight. I guess because I will not make it that far. This woman is not a believable character. She was raised with horses, loves horses, raised her daughter to love horses and ride, and yet she mismanages her parents\u2019 business and doesn\u2019t seem to care if the horses have feed or shavings. When she is reminded for the umpteenth time by one of the stable hands that he\u2019s almost out of hay and shavings and has she ordered them yet?, she\u2019s horrified (only two days\u2019 supply left?!) and promises to call, but instead decides, oh yeah, now\u2019s a great time to read the divorce settlement I\u2019ve been avoiding for weeks. It\u2019s just so blatantly stupid. I mean, let\u2019s avoid discussing the fact that a stable like that (with thirty or so horses) would probably have hay and straw delivered automatically on a schedule so as to avoid the necessity of calling every month or so to place an order (not to mention if they\u2019ve settled on a fee and have paid for a year\u2019s supply in advance they would avoid the price fluctuations), why the hell would she procrastinate on that? Usually people procrastinate on stuff they have a reason to avoid. I can see her avoiding Roger\u2019s phone calls, avoiding dealing with the reality of her failed marriage by dodging her lawyer, but this is a simple order for vital supplies. It\u2019s very, very bad plot construction by the author. When the author has to contort the characters or the plot to make dumb things happen so that something else happens to further the plot and I can see the bones of the plot so clearly it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve written the plot outline myself, I\u2019m annoyed. I don\u2019t want to see the steel frame of the story\u2014I just want the story. If I can pick apart the story while I\u2019m reading it, it\u2019s bad writing. Here\u2019s the perfect example of what I mean:Now that Dipshit has suddenly and with no warning assumed management of her parent\u2019s horse farm (this includes stabling the horses, exercising the horses, employing stable hands and a trainer who gives riding lessons), she is under more stress. Her daughter, who has been around horses since she was a child and knows them very well, began volunteering with the local veterinarian (who also happens to be Dipshit\u2019s high school hottie sweetie) to care for rescued horses. One day, when Dipshit is dealing with a demanding client (whose complaint could have been easily dealt with and smoothed over), the hottie vet drives back with her daughter and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a problem. Dipshit, instead of professionally and politely telling Demanding Client that she has a family emergency and she\u2019ll be right back, yells at the woman to shut up, thus pissing her off. So what was the big deal? Oh, yeah, Hottie caught Eva smoking in the barn. Anyone who works around horses or livestock in general knows this is a bad idea (for readers who don\u2019t know: large quantities of stored hay and staw + burning matches/cigarettes = fire) and I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen, but really? Eva now suddenly is a smoker? And she\u2019s smoking around the rescued foals she\u2019s been so happy to take care of? I don\u2019t believe it. This is the poorly constructed plot device\u2014Gruen wants to put the stables in a dire financial situation. How to do this? Well, cause an important client to leave suddenly. Why does the important client leave suddenly? Because Dipshit is unprofessional with the important client. How does that happen? Insert artificial plot device\u2014Eva, who loves horses and has been around stables her whole life, suddenly decides to smoke in a barn. This is bad writing. Why not just let it happen organically? From what I can see of Dipshit and how poorly she is handling everything in her life, it wouldn\u2019t surprise anyone (except maybe Dipshit) if clients left due to her pisspoor management of the stables. But the author apparently needed the stables to be financially insecure right now (for some other aspect of the plot to fall in place\u2014I won\u2019t know because I\u2019ve stopped reading this crappy novel) so she had to artificially force it. I call a foul on you, Gruen. The other big plot of the book is the new horse she buys from Hottie. He rescued the horse because it looks a lot like Harry, the horse who died in her bad riding accident twenty or so years ago. She suspects the horse is Harry\u2019s brother, even though that horse supposedly died in a gruesome fire. She\u2019s obsessed with this to the point of looking like a nutjob. It\u2019s also kinda like\u2026is this important? I mean, in the grand scheme of your life right now, is discovering the true identity of this horse so important? Because I\u2019m pretty sure Dipshit is going to come out smelling like roses by the end of this book, she\u2019s probably right and something dishonest and evil went down with the horse\u2019s previous owner. But no fear, she\u2019ll fix the farm, divorce her cheating husband, make her daughter her new BFF, and marry one of the hotties (the other is the French pony-tailed trainer Jean-Claude. Yes, that really is his name: insert giggles here). As for the horsey aspect of this craptastic novel, Gruen gets a better review. I love horses. Love, love, love. I\u2019ve never gotten over my girly crush on them and I\u2019ve taking riding lessons (English style, no less) and I\u2019ve volunteered at a rescue farm that took in took in all sorts of animals, not just horses. So much of her descriptions of the stables and the rescued horses does ring true to me\u2014I\u2019ve helped take care of horses that were neglected and abused and it\u2019s horrible to see and heart-rending sad and makes me so angry I\u2019d like to do to the owners what they did to their animals, so I get that part of the book. And when Dipshit says that she loves the smell of horses, I get that too. Horses have the best smell in the world. There\u2019s nothing like working with horses. If I could manage it financially, I\u2019d quit my idiot job and spend all day mucking out stalls for free and consider myself lucky. So, that\u2019s the only part of the novel that strikes me as honest\u2014Gruen\u2019s descriptions of the horses and the stables and the feel of a horse and the intense and unreasonable love for horses. But other novels do it better, so I\u2019d rather re-read Molly Gloss\u2019s The Hearts of Horses or Walter Farley\u2019s The Black Stallion series. Those are better books."}, {"userName": "treehugger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123501-treehugger", "userReview": "I DEVOURED this book - from start to finish it took me about 3 days, and I'm almost through with its sequel.

As a character, she was very real, the situation...the jury's still out. Her character, I loved though. She was quite the alcoholic, never admitted it, but you count the number of times she was drinking or drunk and you would know it. She can't control her teenage daughter, neglected her husband until he left her, nearly destroyed her parents business, and refused to come to terms with the fact that her father had a degenerative, terminal disease and as a result, never says a proper goodbye to him.

Some of that may be the person reading who, the actress is just driving me up a wall. Everything is overdramatic.  Annemarie and her daughter seem pretty one dimension. I just want to shake Annemarie and say \"No wonder your husband ditched you and your daughter divorced you.

Because of this, I probably would have enjoyed the book much more if I were not an equestrian myself, since for me, the holes in the equine aspects of the story made the book as a whole less enjoyable.The book opens with the terrible jumping accident that killed her beloved horse and nearly left her paralyzed, and the accident would be believable if it weren't for the list of the horse's fatal injuries: \"...Harry's long pastern--the largest of the three bones between his hoof and foreleg--shattered into nine pieces.\" (This is believable, what follows is not): \"His scapula, sternum, and pelvis were broken as well, but it was the pastern that clinched it.\" It appears that Ms. Gruen flipped through a horse anatomy book and picked out names of bones--it is simply not likely or reasonable that a seasoned jumper would sustain all of those injuries. The broken pastern would have been enough to require the horse to be put down. Harry was also \"striped,\" indicating a very very rare brindle patterning in the coat. Another very far fetched element.Something else that is highly improbable is when the trainer, Jean-Claude, mounts a lesson horse at the family's stable, and proceeds to perform a series of dressage moves, which include a piaffe, which is believable, and then a capriole. A capriole is a very advanced dressage move performed by Lipizzan stallions in the tradition of warhorses--for a lesson horse at a training stable to perform the move is absurd. It made me think that Gruen attended a performance of the Lipizzan stallions, kept the program, and flipped through it to find elements for her book, no matter how far fetched.Another disappointment for me as an equestrian came from her lack of knowledge about rodeo events, when her love interest and veterinarian rescues an Arabian from being tripped at Mexican rodeos, and the vet goes on to state how it can't really be banned since \"cattle tripping\" is held at most rodeos. I live in the West, have been to many rodeos, and have never heard of or seen an event known as \"cattle tripping.\" There are roping events, but the least Gruen could have done is find out the correct names of the events.Gruen's activism steps in, and a sense of preachiness seeps in when the main character's daughter, Eva, throws a fit about the production of the replacement hormone, Premarin, which is made from pregnant mare urine. Writers have a certain obligation to make sure, even in fiction, that their subject matter is portrayed realistically, since most people's only exposure to things like FBI intrigue or equestrian events are only through the fiction books they read. Putting incorrect or improbable information out, even in the form of fiction, is irresponsible.Determined to not let these missteps deter me completely, as I very much enjoyed \"Water For Elephants,\" I kept reading. I may as well have not, since the writing is not spectacular, and the plot and characters are reminiscent of those in a Harlequin romance. The characters are all disappointingly flat, and the plot, while eventful (too eventful), was the stuff of made-for-TV movies, making the entire fiasco seem more of a puppet show for Gruen's pet causes than anything else.After \"Water For Elephants,\" I would have expected much, much better of Gruen than this.

So, if you like tidy endings with a beautiful red bow, you're not going to get that. Furthermore, Annemarie is not a competant parent. The issues with Eva (the daughter) are so sad and a constant source of frustration to her. Gruen is a good writer. I got lost in her prose, dialogue and story-telling abilities.

I sincerely hope that Water for Elephants is nothing like this, because if it is, I have no clue how it became a bestseller. The main character is what did it for me. I was expecting to read about a mom who, yes, was going through difficulties with her family, daughter, etc, but who still had some backbone at least. Annemarie definitely did not display anything like that, throughout the whole novel. She was no better than a teenager, and honestly, I thought her rebellious teenage daughter handled things, for the most part, better than Annemarie did. She whined and complained throughout the whole novel, and I was pretty sure that the story was going to end with her being diagnosed with a mental health problem, because she was a complete psycho at some points. Her not having a mental health issue was the one part of the novel that really surprised me. Perhaps if that part of the story had been better written, I would have like Riding Lessons more, but because of how much I disliked the narrator, it ruined the rest of the novel for me."}, {"userName": "Lacy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/660952-lacy", "userReview": "I read this because I'd loved Water for Elephants SO MUCH that I felt an overwhelming need to read other things written by the author.

Her husband leaves her for another woman, she is fired, and she returns to her parents' riding school to find her father is suffering from ALS. Oh, and her teenage daughter is an absolute witch.

I was reading the book and enjoying it and then I just had to go on Amazon to see what the other reviews said and once I read those, that's all I could think about when I went back to reading it. But - what I did like: the imagery. Chapter after chapter I could picture the horses, the barns, the riding lessons, the tack room, the stalls... I even imagined the trainer to look like the one I had in High School. In one of the chapters, describing a riding lesson, I could totally see myself on the horse, trainer walking beside me, telling me to post on the opposite diagonal. It was all familar to me, and so very easy for me to imagine. What I wasn't so fond of: The main character is a bit annoying. She had an accident at 18 which pretty much defines her life for the next 20 years... she continually runs from the reality of what happened and from having to move on from that. And... she really screws things up about 1/2-3/4 way into the book. And then that part is a struggle to get through because, but the end does get better. All in all, not a bad read, and enjoyable for me if for no other reason than it takes me back to my days of riding when I was in High School.I own this book"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381716-stephanie", "userReview": "probably would've rated less if i wasn't such a sucker for all the horse prose. of which there wasn't even ask that much. Annemarie's constant overwroughtness makes her a less than ideal narrator and makes it difficult for a reader to really absorb/process each of the problems she's got going on (kid, horse, divorce, new relationship, dying parent, failing family business, identity crisis, the whole book with the exception of her scenes with her mother feels like someone running around with their hair on fire). the plot is pretty formulaic, and for all the text she spends waxing rhapsodic about the horse(s) we get very little actual action / interaction with the animals themselves. i know, not every book about horses has to be all about the horses, but it would've been interesting to see a little more of Annemarie's relationship with the horses and a little less frantic shouting.it's good to see that Gruen refined her skill with Water For Elephants, where you get a much clearer dense of just how well she can write human-animal relationships as well as human-human, not to mention a much less stilted plot flow. still glad i didn't read this one first."}, {"userName": "Rhianon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/791857-rhianon", "userReview": "For me, the redeeming quality of this book was found in the horses. Gruen's portrayal of equine characters through the eyes of the human MC was authentic and spot-on.If nothing else, she did butt-loads of research -- but I'd like to step out on a limb (without knowing anything about the author) and venture a guess that she has at some point spent a less-than-healthy amount of time around the animals (in the opinion of a sane individual, which I am not). Having done so myself, the quality of the descriptions was sufficient to drag me in and pull me through the story, even though the MC started to seriously grate on my nerves after a bit. I wanted to know what happened to the horse and to hell with the rest of it.Don't know that I will bother with the sequel any time soon, and this one read wasn't near enough to make me a Gruen fan.

I loved Water for Elephants, so thought picking up another book by Sara Gruen would be a safe bet. What a disappointment. The story was totally implausible, the main character was extremely and unbearably annoying, and despite the mess that the main character made of everything, POOF! It was all fixed by the end of the book. The main character annoyed me so much that I didn't want her problems to be fixed. I had an uncomfortable feeling of almost wanting her to fail (which is very unlike me) as she was so selfish and self-centered that failing might have snapped her out of it. But, the author preyed on my love of animals to make me want a happy ending - my love for horses pulled at my heartstrings, and the only way for them to have a happy ending was for the main character to, also.Long story short: don't bother with this book.

Flawless, flawless writing. Flawless characterizations. But the main character.....just as patently unlikable and abrasive on the last page as she was in the beginning. There was character development, but she's just....so, so unlikable. The ending was really too good for what she had earned. She had earned a bittersweet ending, but wound up getting everything handed to her on a platter. Not satisfying at all.I would love to move on to the second book to continue reading about the secondary characters. But unfortunately, Annemarie is the main character in that one as well, and I just can't get myself to care enough about her to read an entire second book from her POV again.I'll definitely be picking up Gruen's other book, the one about the elephant, though. From the reviews, those characters are more likable, and Gruen really is an exquisite and brutally real writer. And I'll be hoping that she won't be writing many more books in this Annemarie series, because the sooner she quits messing with Annemarie, the sooner she'll move on to other writing projects, with, hopefully more likable main characters.Edit: I want to add, that this book was good. Really good. It gripped me. I stayed up until 5am trying to finish it before I finally collapsed. And I did like to a point, and sometimes even connected with, Annemarie. But geez, enough is enough. I think the author was going for a Bridget Jones sort of character, a lovable walking disaster, but she missed the mark by a long shot. Annemarie is a walking disaster, no doubt, but she really has no redeeming qualities, and there's nothing really likable about her, let alone lovable.

Then, at eighteen, a tragic accident destroyed her riding career and Harry, her beloved and distinctively marked horse.Now, twenty years later, Annemarie is coming home to her dying father's New Hampshire horse farm. Jobless and abandoned, she is bringing her troubled teenaged daughter to this place of pain and memory, where ghosts of an unresolved youth still haunt the fields and stables -- and where hope lives in the eyes of the handsome, gentle veterinarian Annemarie loved as a girl ... and in the seductive allure of a trainer with a magic touch.But everything will change yet again with one glimpse of a red and white striped gelding startlingly similar to the one Annemarie lost in another lifetime.
