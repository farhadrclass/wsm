LITTLE BEE was a powerful, keen, fresh, and original story that remains one of my most esteemed of 2009. GOLD has a similar architectural structure and captive writing style (but is in third person rather than first). The breaks within chapters headed in bold font are familiar, the soaring, poetic, exquisite metaphors and fluent writing resonates, and a young girl engrossed in Star Wars in order to cope (vs a young boy immersed in Batman in LITTLE BEE). However, GOLD's story, while thematically ripe, is prosaic, as well as so implausible at its heart that I lamented at the reductive and ultimately predictable turns of events.Kate and Zoe have been best friends for 15 years--they met when they were 19, as Olympic contenders in cycling, and now they are 32, both going for the Gold again, although Zoe has several from previous Olympics in Athens and Beijing, as well as National victories. Kate is married to Jack, same age, same historical introduction (all three met simultaneously), another Gold champ, and they have a daughter, Sophie, who is 8, and has leukemia. She was first diagnosed four years ago, but after the first treatment, had been in remission until now.****WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER(S) ALERT.***** This is my first review that requires a spoiler alert, but it felt necessary. So, here goes. For those who have already read the book, or don't plan to, here are the reasons I can't believe the thrust of the narrative:Cleave attempts to tacitly portray Zoe with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) due to the sudden, accidental death of her brother, Adam, when they were bicycling as kids. She feels responsible, and has buried her emotions. All her disturbing character traits are supposed to stem from there. She has betrayed Kate and Jack numerous times over the years, including an attempt to win Jack over when they first met, only because she knew Kate wanted him. She sabotaged Kate in a race by sending a text to herself from Jack's phone, and she slept with Jack (before Kate and Jack were married, but still...), and other invidious acts. Cleave inadvertently portrayed her with Borderline Personality Disorder--she fits a textbook case (I am also a psychiatric nurse)--a dangerous person to be involved with. She also has some Narcissistic Personality Disorder Traits.So, when Zoe gets pregnant from her one time sex with Jack (groan right there), she decides to go through with the pregnancy, at the advice of her coach, Tom, the almost-straw character inserted as much to telegraph platitudes as to coach the women. And then gives up the baby to Jack and Kate. Kate becomes the legal mother. However, Zoe is unstable and disturbed. In this case, Kate should have felt threatened from day one. Moreover, Zoe, in her present psychic state and track record--the behaviors she regularly displays, and the competition and envy she has over Jack and Kate's lives--would have played all sorts of mind games with Kate and Jack through the years regarding Sophie. What a fierce weapon for an unbalanced woman who tends to play dirty.So, Kate and Jack take the baby--oh, and the press believes that Zoe had a stillborn, and that somehow Kate and Jack gave birth. So, Kate and Zoe continue their \"friendship,\" no tension there about Sophie? The only tension seems to be when they race each other. Cleave, in what I consider a mistake, chose to save this fact about Zoe being Sophie's bio mother until near the end, in the penultimate chapters. That handicapped the narrative from any conversation that would steer toward this fact, all throughout the book, with all three of them. (But, ironically, this supposed secret from the reader was painfully obvious early on.) Yet, Zoe is present to support Sophie and the parents through these trying times with Sophie's leukemia. It feels false, renders the story as disingenuous. This doesn't affect Zoe emotionally, we are told, as Cleave gave her an out, which is Adam's death.Zoe has nothing to live for, so to speak, except her triumphs at the velodromes. Yet, the narrative starts being an apologist for Zoe, as the pages turn, softening her at convenient times. In 2012, as the two women cycle for the chance at a spot in London's Olympics, and Kate's last chance to finally win the Gold, Kate falls from her bike at the deciding race, and yet Zoe slowed down to let her catch up! And then Kate wins by 1/1000th of a second! So, now Zoe gets bitter and vengeful and decides she is going to battle for custody of Sophie and tell Sophie she is her real mother, while Sophie is hanging on for dear life at hospital? The only thing that stops her is she passes out when she sees how sick Sophie is.All of this--and, yet, not only does everyone live happily ever after, but Zoe, Kate, and Jack remain dear friends. Zoe is cured by dealing with her brother's death, and years later (2015), when Sophie is 11, Zoe is coaching the healthy Sophie at the velodrome to be a competitive cyclist. This is too velodramatic to believe.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT ******************************************Due to the contrivances and conveniences of character and story, the incredulous twists and turns that are telegraphed and predictable, it was largely unsuccessful to me as a story. Yet, I read every page! Cleave is a lovely writer of prose (although the dialogue was self-conscious and seemed aimed at the cinema), and his metaphors about time undulate elegantly throughout. His themes of success, loss, and the sacrifices we make for love are poignant, and at times emerge radiantly from the melodramatic soap opera. His writing (style) is as assured as ever, and his heart is in the right place."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4925621-julie", "userReview": "An alchemist is needed to make this gold!Such a disappointmentThe race was on! For me it was a race between throwing it across the room or getting to the finish. Only the fact that it was on my Kindle saved it being thrown. And only the hope that it would improve got me to the finish.I had been so eagerly awaiting this. I had read pre-release review and interviews, so I knew that it was a change of pace to The Other Hand (aka Little Bee) and Incendiary. But I did expect the depth, the empathy, the sharp observations, the bittersweet storytelling that I found in both of them. But that was not to be.The storyline followed the rivalries of Olympic cyclists. It gives backgrounds of the main protagonists via flashbacks. But the storyline itself is predictable and saccharine, and the dilemma seems so contrived. The language was often cliched and clumsy. Characterisation is set out at the beginning and doesn't get any development.Where the child in The Other Hand had cute characteristics, the child in Gold is cloying. I was amazed in both of the previous books at how well Cleave writes female voice, but in Gold I didn't quite believe in Kate. As a highly competitive athlete, she lacked verisimilitude. Pollyanna in lycra."}, {"userName": "Aryn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6415628-aryn", "userReview": "My screenwriter boyfriend tells me there is a certain way that stories are supposed to go, a certain formula of events, if you will. Read enough books, see enough movies, and one begins to really believe that. The trick to good story telling is to have stories go in the way that they are supposed to go without giving away, too obviously, where it is going. Gold reads in exactly the way the story is supposed to go. I could have told you from the first 50 pages where the story line should go, and away it went. Kate, Jack, and Zoe aren't cookie-cutter characters by any means and the plot isn't necessarily a cookie-cutter plot. However, the twists and turns that the story takes on it's track to the Gold, are like the strategic moves made by racers. The tone is set from the starting line, and it can only go a limited number of ways with the choices made by the cyclists on their quests for the Gold Medal.Don't let the predictability of the story sell it short, however. One cannot help but fall in love with eight-year-old, Star Wars obsessed, Sophie, who fights leukemia and tries with all her little might to keep her parents happy. One cannot help feeling for (and as a fairly bashful woman, also relating to) Kate, her mother, who chooses to miss both the Athens Olympics and the Beijing Olympics for Sophie's health. Zoe's harshness and betrayals, while terrible traits somehow make her a character that you simply want to hug and then slap; her fight to receive a Gold Medal overcomes even her humanity. Jack, Sophie's father, deserved a good shake - I think.In a lot of ways I felt as though I were reading a Jodi Piccoult novels. The way the story went is very reminiscent of her style; in some ways I was surprised - in a good way - that this was written by a man. Neither she nor Chris Cleave are fabulous authors but the can write a story well, with characters that you can believe and love. It's good book junk food: quick, easy, flowing, happy, \"correct.\"I received this ARC from Goodreads First Reads Giveaways."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I really give this book *6* stars ----(its sooooooooooooooooo GOOD)!!!!!I love the characters --the story itself-- and the writing.

On-the-edge-engaging-reading!!!!Zoe-Kate-Jack-Tom-Sophie are each characters you'll feel you know well. The author does an outstanding job with 'character-development'.

GREAT STORY!!!! Also: anyone who has enjoyed sports --participated in any type of competition will appreciate this story. (my gymnast years are behind me--but it was 'awesome' to read about the inner-athlete: remember & relate --and allow myself to fall into the lives of the people in *GOLD*. --There are family challenges, sickness, friendships, fear of aging and purpose, love, family, and the pure drive for living on the edge of perfection).A GREAT READ!!!"}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1147841-jackie", "userReview": "This is the story to three top athletes, bike racers on the Olympic level, and what drives them. This isn't really a sports story, though you do learn a great deal about the grueling training that these folks willingly endure. It's about team mates who are sometimes friends and other times not, with a complicated past and an even more complicated present. It's about parenthood, relationships, priorities and the sacrifices that are made for love, or fear. It's about celebrity and intimacy, of the trials of competition on your head and heart, and about figuring out who you are and remaining true to that. As the story unfolds the reader is slowly given access to these three people'shistories and mysteries and has a front row seat for their fight for the future that runs through a gauntlet of emotions that will not leave that reader untouched.

I really wasn\u2019t expecting to enjoy it, but I really should have known better \u2013 I\u2019ve read Chris Cleave\u2019s other two books. And I didn\u2019t just enjoy it, I absolutely loved it and didn\u2019t want it to end. I don\u2019t have a sporty competitive bone in my body, but this book really isn\u2019t about sport \u2013 it\u2019s about love and the things human beings do to each other. I thought the characters were wonderfully drawn \u2013 Sophie and her Star Wars obsession is an absolute tour de force, but so is damaged Zoe, Jack the consummate father, and Tom the trainer. The only one I struggled with a little was Kate \u2013 for a number of reasons, but mainly because she just seemed too \u201cnice\u201d to be involved in the competitive world. Others have told the story in their reviews but I\u2019d urge everyone to read this book and defy your expectations. Images will stay with me a long time \u2013 Sophie\u2019s experience with the conveniently placed Millenium Falcon had me in tears, as did Tom in the bath, and some of the musical moments were magic.

Here in this story we have the same argument in reverse. Zoe has everything wrong with her potential to get pregnant. Yet because of her deep unadmitted emotional feeling for Jack she becomes pregnant. So her emotional attachment could influence her body to become pregnant. The argument did not work for the Republican and it did not work here for me. I could not suspend my disbelief that Jack and Kate would take the baby.I could not suspend my disbelief that the Sophie would become critically ill at all the wrong times. Right before the Olympics and right before the big race. I could not suspend my disbelief when Zoe wins the second race after Kate had beat her in the first, nor that Zoe would demand that Kate get back in the race in the third race. This was just too much \"deus ex machina\" and contrived story line for me. I did skim through to the end and Sophie riding for Zoe as coach with Jack and Kate holding hands was too perfect. I like happy endings but this was ridiculous. This is the first book that I have given this low a rating to and I think it richly deserves it."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "Sh*t happens.Sometimes it's your fault. You make bad decisions. You decide to push when you shouldn't. You sleep with the wrong person. You have unprotected sex when you should have used a condom. You say hurtful things to someone when you should have kept your mouth shut.Other times, the sh*t is just the universe's random happenings. Your child gets cancer. Your mom commits suicide. A car runs over the only person who ever really loved and understood you.This story of Chris Cleave's is personal. I like personal. His first two books: INCENDIARY and LITTLE BEE used personal stories but had an overarching message. In INCENDIARY it was: Terrorism is bad, mmmkay? And in LITTLE BEE it was: refugees and immigrants are humans who deserve the same chances as natural citizens...mmmmkay? But this book had no message, and that made it better.Kate and Zoe have been rivals and (?)friends(?) in their quest for gold medal after gold medal in the Olympics. They race bikes. Kate is married to another racer and the \"third\" in their little triangle, Jack - another gold medalist.What's more important? Family or winning? Ah - not so fast. Sometimes winning and being a champion is the only thing that keeps a person going - keeps a person sane. Kate and Jack are watching their daughter, Sophie, die slowly of leukemia. Zoe is battling demons from her past. She either is crazy or is just a hairsbreadth away from crazy. Her tenuous and touching almost-friendship with Kate and Jack is frightening and realistic.Racing takes these people away from real life. Away from their problems. It's a release, an escape. It's a godsend. But new Olympic rulings have stated that only one of the women can compete in this year's Olympics. Who needs to win more, Kate or Zoe? And which woman, if she loses, will fall apart, or explode - bringing herself down and everyone around her down as well?Cleave thankfully changes it up in this novel by giving us some male narrators to go along with his usual female ones. Like always, he writes great women and I really had no problem believing what they were thinking and doing.One of the best aspects of this novel is the narration from Sophie, the cancer-riddled 8-year-old. The heartbreaking thing, the concept that shatters you is not that she's dying. It's not that she suffers, is sick, vomits, undergoes chemo, and faints. No. What wrenches your heart out is that she struggles so hard to be strong and brave for her parents. She feels like she always has to smile and say she's fine even though she feels like hell, because her parents are fragile and she has to protect them. In asking her to be \"brave\" and \"defiant\", in asking her to battle the cancer and never give in to the death that is consuming her - her parents are placing a horrible burden on the child. She sees their faces clench when she's in pain - so she makes sure to hide her pain from them at all costs. She knows they lose sleep with worry when she vomits - so she tries her damnedest to do it in secret when no one can hear. Instead of buoying her up with their constant encouragement, Kate and Jack have created an environment in which their child is afraid to express even her most basic fears and needs.But you, the reader, understand why they are doing this. You understand that they are trying their best - that they love Sophie beyond belief. They are such great people. Brave, flawed, and tired.This is the best aspect of GOLD. Even characters that are making questionable choices - you understand why they are making these choices. You understand their thoughts, their decision-making processes, their doubts, their hopes. Even when pleading with a character not to do something, you understand exactly why she or he is doing it.That is Cleave's biggest gift in this book - you like an understand everybody. There is no evil. There is no villain. Just messed-up people in messed-up lives trying to survive. Sometimes they do the right thing and you cheer for them. Sometimes they do the wrong thing, and your heart breaks for them. But either way, you understand them and care for them."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael", "userReview": "Zoe and Kate are world-class athletes; they have been rivals on the track from the very start but they are also friends. Gold follows the story of these two cyclists life leading up the 2012 London Olympics. Both women will be tested on and off the track, being pushed to their physical and emotional limits. The book follows the two through most of their professional career, starting at 19 all the way up to training for their final Olympic event. This is a strong character driven book, Kate is the nice one, she is a mother first and an athlete second who is always Zoe\u2019s heels. Zoe on the other hand is driven purely by the need to win and will stop at nothing to gain the advantage. Even the support characters are wonderful; from the bitter coach Tom, Kate\u2019s husband Jack who also is an Olympic cyclist and can be very cocky about his constant lack of competition. Not forgetting Jake and Kate\u2019s daughter Sophie, who while is suffering from leukaemia is constantly trying to remain strong to stop her parents worrying about her so much. Chris Cleave writes a wonderful book, this is a story full of passion, humour and tragedy. I was excited to read this book, I\u2019ve been eyeing it for a few weeks and when my local book club decided to read it, I finally had an excuse. I really love exploring the characters; Zoe was a real stand out for me, her flaws made her a character I wanted to read more about. To offset the dense nature of this book, Cleave did a wonderful job at lightening the mood, from Sophie\u2019s obsession with Star Wars to the humour with lines like; \u201cThe boys sat around and talked about Keats and fine bone China, or whatever they talk about before they are about to spend 8 hours racing each other\u201d.Gold is a deep bittersweet story that full of empathy, sharp observations and strong characters. Chris Cleave did a great job of balancing the novel out so it never felt heavy or too light. I think I even surprised myself with how much I enjoyed this book; it was such a joy to read. I\u2019ve even heard the Chris Cleave\u2019s other books are worth checking out and if Gold is anything to go by, then I\u2019m excited to read more."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532455-julia", "userReview": "There are quite a few very negative comments on this book. It just proves once again how different we are as readers and what our expectations are of a \"good read\". I gave GOLD 5 stars. I thought it was an excellent read that kept my interest level high all the way through. It is the story of 3 world class cyclists, training for the 2012 Olympics. The 2 females, Kate & Zoe are best friends and best rivals, competing on the same team for the Gold medal. The 3rd cyclist is Jack, who ends up marrying Kate. All 3 of these friends lives become so intertwined. Even though this is not a \"sports\" novel, per se, it does give insight into the life of an athlete, showing the intense focus, blinding exertion and uncompromising committment to the sport. It allowed me to feel some of that extreme nerve wracking tension and physical exertion without leaving my reading chair.Kate & Zoe are both 32 years of age now and are both training for their last and biggest race - the 2012 Olympics in London. Each of them wants to win the Gold, desperately. Kate has a very ill daughter, going through treatment for Leukemia. Does she give up her Olympic dream to put her daughter's health ahead of anything else? Zoe is a strange woman in the sense that she is aloof, has no real human companionship of any sort and is extremely intense. She will win the Gold regardless of the cost. She is completely obssessed.What happens to athletes after the Big Race and they are too old to continue? What is life like after sports when all you know is training to be the best?

I could tell that the book was well-researched; it was interesting to get a glimpse of the dedication and single-mindedness it takes to train for a sport at this elite level. (Side recommendation: a far superior book about professional dedication and training is Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff )The part that lagged was the exposition of the main characters' personal lives. Cleave took a page out of the Nicholas Sparks playbook with an overwrought, schmaltzy kid-with-cancer subplot. The sickness trumped any character development, and, of course, conveniently got worse at critical plot points. The central love triangle relied on tired character tropes, as well. The characters even spoke in cliches when arguing, joking, and communicating their feelings. I'd get it if Cleave was just trying to relay that these are single-minded athletes, not especially clever, eloquent people, but overall, it just felt like lazy writing."}, {"userName": "Jayne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259669-jayne", "userReview": "The first half of the novel was disappointing - I just kept looking for the Chris Cleave of Incendiary and Little Bee and could not find it.

They have been rivals and friends ever since they were on the elite training scheme together.Kate is married to Jack, another British cycling star who has been a gold medal holder in the past. With Kate they have a daughter Sophie, who is a Star Wars nut, but she is tragically suffering from Leukaemia. Kate and jack are flat out with her care and training and the strain is beginning to tell.All three of these athletes have a complex personal relationship with each other. Jack is physically and mentally strong, Kate is a top performing cyclist who has missed medal opportunities because of Sophie's health, and Zoe is strong and uses psychological intimidation on her rivals to beat them before turning a pedal.With the rule changes from the IOC it means that only Zoe or Kate can be selected for the Olympic sprint. As Sophie's health deteriorates, the personal pressure builds and the tension between them increases to almost breaking point in the race off they have to hold.Cleave has written a completely believable story based around three athletes in the velodrome. He has managed to capture the thrills, tactics and brutal speed that the sprint competition has. The complicated relationships between the thee characters means that the plot has the same slow moments of a race, along with awesome speed at certain points. Parts of the story are where he looks back at past events in the characters lives, filling in the detail for the narrative that is unfolding. It is very nicely done, as these sometime don't work well.Overall all it reads like the sprint race that the book is centred around; slow at times, moments of tension, and a truly breathing finale."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16060410-katie", "userReview": "Ninety pages in, I found this embarrassment of a sentence: \"Sex was cheap money that you could print on demand and use to buy a reprieve from loneliness till morning.\" Deep.

The only exception to this is when I want to double check that my reading of a murky plot point was correct. Gold was the first novel by Chris Cleave I\u2019d read, and I knew that he had a reputation for writing literate and popular books, so I was surprised when I found the opening pages of it so off-putting.Often my first impression of a book is the one that I carry through to the end of it, but there have been a few times when my initial impression of a book is overturned by what comes later. One other example of this is Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 \u201cThe Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which was tedious at the beginning but became riveting about a hundred pages in. Likewise, Gold grew on me. The plot became exciting and the characters better developed. After I turned in my review, I read some other reviews of it, such as the one in the New York Times, and although I didn\u2019t write this in my review, I agree with what they said that the sections about the cancer-stricken child feel manipulative. It\u2019s hard to write about sick kids with the appropriate touch that Lorrie Moore managed, for example, in \u201cPeople Like That Are the Only People Here.\u201dAnyway, here\u2019s my review that ran in the Dallas Morning News:Gold by Chris Cleave Takes Readers On a SpinBy JENNY SHANK Special ContributorPublished: 27 July 2012 12:18 PMChris Cleave\u2019s new novel, Gold, which tells the story of three friends involved in a love triangle competing to make the British cycling team for the 2012 London Olympics, recovers from its wobbly start.Gold opens with some flat descriptions, such as this of Zoe as she prepares to win the 2004 Olympic gold medal in sprint cycling: \u201cMagazines loved her. She looked good in clothes. She was beautiful.\u201d Cleave uses unnecessary words that adverb referees Mark Twain and Stephen King would blow the whistle on, and he inflicts several strained metaphors and clich\u00e9s, often involving the heart. Zoe\u2019s cardiac system is busy \u2014 \u201cher heart surged,\u201d and a few pages later, her \u201cheart was still snagged on the wire of the fence her friend had put up between them.\u201dBut you can\u2019t keep a pro like the international best-selling author of Little Bee down for long. Cleave writes of the physical experience of cycling at top speed with clarity and vigor. After the warm-up chapters, Gold takes off and develops into a gripping tale with many surprising turns on the way to its photo-finish climax.As the book opens, Zoe is in Athens, racing for gold, while her training partner Kate is home in Manchester. \u201cShe had shared a coach with Zoe and trained with her and beaten her in the Nationals and the Worlds,\u201d Cleave writes. \u201cAnd then, in the final year of preparation for Athens, baby Sophie had arrived.\u201d Adding to the sting of missing the Olympics is the fact that Kate\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Jack Argall, is also in Athens racing for gold, and we soon learn that there is some tortured romantic history between Zoe and Jack, and that Zoe, a psychological train- wreck, can never be trusted.The narrative skips ahead to 2012, when Sophie is 8 and suffering from leukemia. Zoe and Jack, now married, divide their days into four-hour chunks, trading off training for the Olympics and caring for Sophie. Cleave writes several chapters from the perspective of Sophie, who is obsessed with Star Wars and sees her fight against leukemia as the effort to fire \u201cthe Death Star\u2019s destructor beam into the limitless constellations of space and hit exactly the right target.\u201d The Sophie chapters are full of convincing details that prove Zoe\u2019s eventual realization that \u201clooking after a very sick child was the Olympics of parenting.\u201dCleave ratchets up the suspense as the British Olympic committee announces only one cyclist can compete in the 2012 Olympics. The mystery of the three cyclists deepens as Cleave reveals their pasts, detailing the grief that drove Zoe to become a Machiavellian competitor who uses clever tricks to destabilize her opponents, such as sending a text message from Jack\u2019s phone to hers that she knows Kate will see.As Zoe and Kate race to determine who will represent Britain at the Olympics and Sophie struggles through a health scare, the pages of Gold fly by, leaving the reader\u2019s pulse as quickened as those of the athletes.Jenny Shank\u2019s first novel, The Ringer, is a finalist for the High Plains Book Award in fiction.GoldChris Cleave(Simon & Schuster, $27)"}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "I feel bad about this. I know people are really excited for this book. And I expect most people will give this book 4 or 5 stars. But it had problems I could not get past. Gold is about 2 world-class cyclists who are training partners and friends in addition to being rivals. Zoe is cold and focused, Kate is warm and willing to sacrifice her sport for her family. Kate's sacrifices happen an awful lot as her daughter, Sophie, has leukemia.Cleave has in the past shown some pretty impressive plotting, and he uses a lot of flashbacks to tell his story here. The way he unfolds his story is quite good. It's the story itself that made me crazy. The characters are all focused on Olympic gold, and it just so happens that every single plot point along the way happens exactly at the time of the Olympics. The 4 years in between are just filler. As more of the story was revealed, I found myself more frustrated and feeling like I was being manipulated instead of watching a story unfold.(There's also a decent amount of suspension of disbelief required. I've never heard the names of any Olympic-caliber cyclists. I've never heard of them being on billboards. And the idea that the two best in the world would be so far above their competition that their only competition is each other and they happen to live in the same country and they happen to have the same coach and they happen to train together every day... well, it gets difficult.)Character was a problem as well. The Saintly Sick Child is an easy way to turn me against you. Young Sophie is completely selfless, cares only for her parents' wellbeing, and has an obsession with Star Wars that goes beyond obsession into just plain silly. And Sophie is just one example of the characters here who act more as cliches than people. Kate and her husband Jack are kind, caring, perfect parents. Zoe is troubled by her past and seems to have no redeeming qualities. And it's all a real shame because there are moments in the book that are quite good and the potential in a plot about two friends who are rivals is significant. Still, I don't suspect any of this will prevent it from becoming just as popular as Little Bee, if not more. I expect to be one of the few naysayers."}, {"userName": "L\u00e9nia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12130032-l-nia", "userReview": "Gostei tanto, tanto deste livro...

Anyone who passes over Gold for this reason is passing up on the chance of a whirlwind of a reading experience so don't let those miserable memories of despotic PE teachers put you off and give your brain a gentle work out in the process. So, let's set the (Olympic..) record straight, this is not a novel about sporting superhumans, even though they are pretty impressive...we dig deep and discover what makes real people tick when faced with adversary, when illness of a loved one brings you to your knees and you're powerless to do anything but hope that your child is one of the 9 in 10 who survive.Gold focuses on the experiences of five main characters - 8 year old Sophie who is fighting leukaemia, her parents Jack and Kate, Olympic cyclists preparing for the London games alongside their friend/rival Zoe and trainer Tom. All of the adults are nearing the end of their current careers and have one last shot at Olympic Gold whilst Sophie has the hardest fight of all, the battle to stay alive whilst undergoing aggressive treatment which lowers your defences even further. She uses her imagination and love of Star Wars to harness the Jedi force - anything which encourages a fighting spirit and a positive attitude is going to aid her in the ultimate battle - to stay alive. From the opening pages, I was fully engaged and committed to this story. Cleave doesn't pull on our heartstrings by thrusting sugary-sweet, put upon characters on the reader, they're all flawed, fully fleshed and make the same mistakes as the rest of us mere mortals. Sophie's story is presented in gritty technicolour - there's no soft focus when she experiences the side effects of chemo or as her last hair falls out. Kate and Zoe have diametrically opposed public personas when it comes to the media - Kate is the people's princess, Zoe, the wicked witch with a touch of glam. I loved how we are drip-fed snippets of their back stories to explain how they are what they are in the present day. Tom the trainer has made these cyclists his focus and his family for so many years but now he has to acknowledge the ravages of time and take another path, one which will put less stress on his dodgy knees. Jack seems to be slightly at a loss, a bit piggy in the middle at times.I was most pleasantly surprised by Gold - my only criticism is to do with the marketing of the novel rather than the novel itself. The whole device in the blurb about how this is where we normally tell you what the book is about but we're not going to tell you because you don't really need to know. For goodness sake, tell them what it's about and stop the superior self-importance. Gold is probably the closest I'm going to get to the Olympics but, more importantly, if we all had an ounce of the fighting spirit displayed by young cancer patients like Sophie, we'd all be winners.

I hated The Other Hand but decided to give this one a go because I was interested in the sports rivalry theme. Cleave actually does a decent job of getting into the minds of focused sports people and some of his descriptive passages are fine - especially those depicting the physical and mental processes of athletes during races.But...this is a schmaltzy, mawkish load of tosh, with one dimensional characters and a central friendship that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Single-minded, win-at-all-costs Zoe and lovely, simply wonderful mum and wife Kate are besties yet bitter rivals on the cycling track. Despite Zoe's constant gamesmanship, underhandedness and nastiness towards Kate, they somehow love each other. Cleave attempts to show this with some teeth-grinding scenes showing them getting along, but it's wholly unconvincing. Oh, and (spoiler alert) Zoe had a relationship with Jack, Kate's now husband, who she was too unstable to care for, hence Kate and Jack took her on. And what amazing parents they are, loving her to death and missing out on Olympic gold in so doing. As for the child, Sophie, well, she's ill, and Cleave is pretty adept at describing leukaemia and its horrendous side effects. But Sophie's obsession with Star Wars is a yawn-inducing element of the book, and in the end, I couldn't have cared less about her. And gnarled, wise old coach Tom, is a cliche of the worst sort. The scene in which he can't get out of the bath because of his bad knees is both embarrassingly unfunny and implausible. Cleave is fond of flowery lyricism, overwrought imagery and over-egged descriptive prose, which often jars, especially when it just appears in the middle of more prosaic narrative.Not good, not terrible."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2844056-lindsay", "userReview": "Zoe, Kate and Jack all emerge as talented young sprint cyclists, and go on to train and challenge at the highest level, with that ultimate aim, Olympic Gold. This story follows them as they prepare for the London 2012 Olympics, and throughout the novel we are taken back at intervals to learn what happened when they were young, to discover how they all first met, and what has happened at other key turning points in their lives, including Athens and Beijing, to bring them to where they are, and make them the people they are now. I was very moved by this story and by the people involved; the author conveys the private pain that can become a driving force for winning and success, but can equally be a destructive element in life. Zoe and Kate are both huge rivals and best friends. There is a fierce determination in the hearts of these competitors, but there is also recognition that there are things in life so much more precious, above and beyond any competition. It\u2019s a tense read at times, some heart-stopping moments both in and out of the velodrome. This is a poignant story, encompassing lives lived both at the peak of fitness and in seriously ill health, and it is beautifully written, full of humanity with all of its deep love and immense pain; I shed a few tears at the end, and felt I missed the characters; they, and the story, have stayed very much in my mind since finishing the book.Reading groups would find much here to discuss, from the demands that professional athletes place their bodies under, the rigorous training, the media scrutiny they face, and the real lives they live away from the spotlight, as well as discussing thoughts on the London 2012 Olympics themselves as they fast approach."}, {"userName": "M", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13167-m", "userReview": "There is a lot more wrong with this book than there is right, which is to say that while there are some touching scenes, it is overall really really bad.Chris Cleave, whose Little Bee struck me as rather overrated and overly cute, takes on the Olympics and kids with cancer.

What a nifty way to ensure that your readers will care about your characters without you having to, say, create characters. As to the Olympics, yet another cop out - hmmmm let's see, I will make a very driven character, and have all this tension built in as to whether or not she will win - voila! Sheer laziness.This book read like a soap opera - two women vying for a gold medal, AND the same man, and even the same daughter! Meanwhile Kate is the sweet girl who just doesn't want it bad enough while Zoe is the appallingly obnoxious stereotypical stop at nothing witch who somehow manages to be all cozy with Kate and her near perfect husband Jake. This was written largely in summary form with a lot of silly flashbacks that were written so self consciously I kept cringing.I give this two stars begrudgingly because at some suspenseful moments I cared enough to see what would happen, so that's something, I guess.

Yes it is about the athletes conditioning, dieting and training, which I found to be absolutely amazing, but it is about friendship and sacrifice as well.

There are few plot details in this review and no spoilers.Gold is, to put it simply, the story of best friends who are competing for the spot at their last Olympics. Always dramatic, sometimes tender, rarely amusing, Gold is less about cycling and medals, and more about surviving. This was my first Chris Cleave book and probably my last.Let me start with this: Gold had an amazing opening. I love the Olympics. I love the energy behind it that is unlike any other sporting event. This is probably why those opening pages drew me in. I really thought this was going to be a novel I really liked and was determined, right to the end, to enjoy it. I would say that Gold is worth reading, if only for that opening. It is succinct, breathtaking, and thrumming with an energy that just screams Olympia. You feel like you are slipped into Zoe\u2019s skin, and then Kate\u2019s\u2026and then you are abruptly ripped out of both of them and thrown into a lackluster drama.Zoe is a flat character and completely unbelievable. She irritated me the entire way through, and not in the skin-crawling way that a character like her should. She was just poorly written. Nothing about her made me want to hate her or like her or even root for her. She was poorly planned and seemed like a bad batch of drama stereotype cookies. She, probably more than anything else, dragged the story down for me. She made it heavy and unlikable.Kate and Jack were not much better. As a couple, superficially, they were believably and heartwarming. But that strength came more from their daughter, Sophie, than anything else, which I will discuss in a bit. Jack is flat as well, but with little spikes of energy that kept him from falling into the same pile as Zoe. Kate felt more realistic, but not much more alive. I grew tired of her narrative quickly. Helping none of this are the tangents Cleave will sometimes drop into. His language use seems naturally flowery, matching the tone of the story he wanted to tell. But it was irritating and distracting. I found myself having to go back a page and re-read everything because I had zoned out. What would knock me out of this period of BLAH would be the dialogue, however, which had everything I liked about the opening pages. I wish Cleave would have just\u2026cut half the book\u2019s confusing descriptions and tangents that don\u2019t fit into the plot. The dialogue is strong enough on its own that I would have enjoyed Gold so much more. The characters\u2019 internal monologues (save Sophie\u2019s) detract from their development, drag down the pace of the book, and make me wonder how his editor thought this was okay at three hundred pages, with plenty of those filled with useless mumbling. And now Sophie\u2026 Sophie, Sophie, Sophie. Sophie saved this book. Sophie is Kate and Jack\u2019s daughter, suffering through Leukemia and wanting nothing more than to be a Jedi Knight. I will add one quote from the book to this review:\u201cShe knew none of this was actually real, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t happening. On the rare days she was well enough to go into school now, school never felt real either. The other girls had moved on. They were into YouTube, and they thought she was weird for still being into kids\u2019 stuff. She tried to get into the things they were into, but the truth was that she didn\u2019t want to learn the dance moves from pop videos. She wanted to be a Jedi knight.\u201dSophie\u2019s scenes were the only ones to make me cry. She felt like a child, but a child who desperately didn\u2019t want to be a child. She was believable. She was sweet. She was sometimes obnoxious. Sophie. Saved. This. Book. She brought Jack and Kate and their relationship to life. She brought the story to life. I wish the entire book has just been about Sophie and Jack and Kate and their fight to overcome leukemia.But it wasn\u2019t. So I\u2019ll finish with a disappointed sigh. Maybe this was a poor book to start Chris Cleave with, but I don\u2019t know if I can stomach his other two with this one in mind. Was it a worthwhile read? For the positive things I\u2019ve mentioned, yes. If you want fluffy, tearjerky, London 2012 fiction, pick Gold up. If you\u2019re expecting high literature and impressive storytelling, grab something else. This was a \u2018pass the time\u2019 (or the salt) read."}, {"userName": "Kats", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4786937-kats", "userReview": "Chris Cleave is definitely one of my favourite living authors; a real wordsmith who knows how to make his characters truly complex and real, and the story lines engaging with the odd twist thrown in, and I've been anticipating the release of his latest novel since last autumn. However, I wasn't that taken with \"Gold\" when I was about a quarter into it. Firstly, the cynic in me didn't appreciate the timing of the book's release (\"coinciding\" with the dawn of the London Olympics) thinking \"oh no, here comes someone else trying to cash in on London2012\", secondly, the first few chapters read like a medium-brow chick lit novel, and finally, there was such an inordinate amount of product placement in the book, but particularly in the beginning, that I wondered if Chris Cleave, like his protagonists, was wrapped up in some sponsorship deals with Perrier, Twix and Adidas, or if it was meant to make the book more real. I don't know, but I didn't care for it. Once I had gotten over these three negative impressions, the story began to unfold, the characters, often looking 4, 8, 10, 13 years back into the past, took on additional dimensions, and I couldn't tear myself away anymore. Just like Cleave's other two novels, this is a story that has multiple layers, themes and ample food for thought, and its characters will stay on my mind for years to come. The research Cleave must have carried out is impressive; details on bikes, the racing sport, training and coaching incl. the athletes' diets and mindsets, furthermore on leukaemia and its treatments / side effects etc. The book is an eye-opener with regard to the lives of any high-performance athletes, so now, with only a week to go before the opening ceremony of the Olympics, my initial resentment of the opportunistic publishing date of the book has actually given me a timely appreciation for the work and involvement behind the scenes of every athlete who will have gained a place in the games. I did have a few doubts regarding the authenticity of some of the events; for instance, whether the number 1 and number 2 in the world, albeit racing for the same country, would actually ever have the same coach. Surely, the coach would have (as Tom does repeatedly in the book) a major conflict of interest. There were a few other things niggling me but not enough to spoilt the enjoyment of the book. As \"Gold\" was only published a month ago, the print and even e-book copies are still rather pricey, so I decided to use one of my credits on Audible instead, and what a flukey decision that was!! \"Gold\" is being read by Emilia Fox, one of the most stellar readers of all time, and one of my favourite TV actresses (\"Silent Witness\", anyone?!), and her performance of \"Gold\" was outstanding. She nailed Kate's Northern, Jack's Scottish and Tom's Australian accent in a flawless manner and even succeeded in using different voices for the various characters all without sounding ridiculous. Absolutely brilliant 5* recording!"}, {"userName": "C\u00e9lia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1152675-c-lia", "userReview": "Chris Cleave tem 3 livros publicados at\u00e9 \u00e0 data, dos quais apenas me faltava ler este Menina de Ouro. Recordo Pequena Abelha com muita saudade, por ter sido um livro fant\u00e1stico, que me emocionou bastante. Incendi\u00e1rio tamb\u00e9m foi um bom livro, apesar de me ter cativado menos. As expectativas para este livro eram boas, mas temperadas por essa leitura menos entusiasmante.Menina de Ouro \u00e9 um livro que conta a hist\u00f3ria de um trio de jovens talentosos no ciclismo, que veem as suas vidas pessoais e profissionais entrela\u00e7adas de formas por vezes pouco felizes. Zoe e Kate s\u00e3o duas atletas de top, com ambi\u00e7\u00f5es (e conquistas) ol\u00edmpicas, que se esfor\u00e7am todos os dias para manter a forma, mas com uma diferen\u00e7a fundamental: enquanto Zoe p\u00f5e a sua carreira acima de tudo o resto, Kate \u00e9 capaz de abdicar dela em prol da fam\u00edlia. Jack, o marido de Kate, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um ciclista de alta competi\u00e7\u00e3o, medalhado ol\u00edmpico, que luta, juntamente com a mulher, para conciliar a sua carreira com as exig\u00eancias da vida familiar, que incluem a filha de ambos, a pequena Sophie, que sofre de leucemia.Boa parte da hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 composta pela din\u00e2mica das rela\u00e7\u00f5es, por vezes dif\u00edceis, entre o trio, com v\u00e1rios saltos ao passado que ajudam a compreender muitas das atitudes presentes. Zoe \u00e9 uma personagem dif\u00edcil de compreender, e mesmo de ter alguma simpatia por ela, tendo em conta v\u00e1rias das suas atitudes. No final do livro, s\u00e3o-nos revelados detalhes do seu passado que ajudam a entender o seu comportamento, mas nem por isso fizeram com que aceitasse v\u00e1rias coisas que fez. Penso que esta compreens\u00e3o para com a personagem e os seus atos passa muito pelas nossas experi\u00eancias pessoais e pela capacidade que temos em nos abstrairmos delas. N\u00e3o tive grande sucesso com isso, confesso. No entanto, acabei por achar Zoe mais interessante que Kate, pela sua complexidade.Se soubesse que este livro inclu\u00eda uma crian\u00e7a a lutar contra a leucemia, provavelmente teria adiado a leitura por mais alguns anos. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 porque agora sou m\u00e3e, e estas coisas se tornaram mais dif\u00edceis, mas tamb\u00e9m porque j\u00e1 sofri na pele a perda de um ente querido para esta doen\u00e7a. Continuo a n\u00e3o me sentir capaz de lidar muito bem com esta realidade. Mas, ainda assim, prossegui a leitura, com esperan\u00e7a num final feliz. Sophie \u00e9, para mim, a melhor personagem do livro, aquela com quem \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel n\u00e3o simpatizar e n\u00e3o torcer para que consiga superar as adversidades.\u00c9 um livro bem escrito. Encontrei aqui o escritor que conheci em Pequena Abelha, mas o enredo, o contexto e as rela\u00e7\u00f5es complicadas entre o trio protagonista acabaram por n\u00e3o me cativar tanto como queria. Ainda assim, \u00e9 sem d\u00favida um autor para continuar a seguir."}], "description": "Building on the tradition of Little Bee, Chris Cleave again writes with elegance, humor, and passion about friendship, marriage, parenthood, tragedy, and redemption.Gold is the story of Zoe and Kate, world-class athletes who have been friends and rivals since their first day of Elite training.
