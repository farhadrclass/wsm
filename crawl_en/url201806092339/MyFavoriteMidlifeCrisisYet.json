The characters were amusing, and my heart really did go out to Gwyn with some of the struggles she faced, namely dealing with her aging father and fighting to overcome the scars of a horribly troubled relationship with her mother throughout her childhood. I wish the very ending was a little more definitive for Gwyn, but sometimes we have to take what we are given, which the author proved beautifully through the characters in this book. Overall, a good debut novel by Devens and worth the read."}, {"userName": "Angelina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4957433-angelina", "userReview": "What do you do when you have a perfect life- and uncover your husband's secret life? I found out what Dr. Gwenyth Burke decided to do. She is in her early 50s and dealing with dating craziness following a divorce. I tagged along with her two BFF's for the ride.I snagged this bargain Amazon Kindle book and laughed out loud from beginning to end. This book was such a joy to read!

I hauled it around with me for two days and couldn't get past page 120. That's unusual for me, so after much debate, I have decided to shut it down. Too many books, too little time sort of thing. Why didn't this book capture my attention? Well, for starters its too cutesy. I'm thinking she is trying to be an older, more wise Jane Green or some such author, but you just can't do that. I think this book was truly trying to be something it wasn't - older woman going back out into the dating world, had friends who were doing the same, they talk about their miseries, but good grief, nothing was happening for 120 pages. Went on an online date, it was bad. Really? I was hoping for something a bit more cerebral. If the author had lost the cute and just been real, she could have pulled off an Elizabeth Berg. But what I got was a few old cliches and two days wasted time."}, {"userName": "Crysta", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8198742-crysta", "userReview": "My Favorite Midlife Crisis ( Yet ) was on my list to read for a while and I am certainly glad that I did. Toby Devens is a clever writer and her characters are deeply thought out and likeable.I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about reading a book where the women were my Aunt's age, I certainly didn't want to think about her dating and sex life. But what I found in this book was that you get to really like the characters and their wisdom and restraint gained only through the years make them valuable to the story. I came away from this book with a smile. It is certainly a good summer book. Put it on your list!"}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5845323-cindy", "userReview": "This book was about three middle aged women (which I am member of this club) and their quest for romance while balancing careers, cancer and over indulged adult children. I think if the author had focused more on the friendships and the careers,and less on the token romance, there may have been more depth to the characters.This book had its moments, but overall it seemed to be a cross between Sex and the City 50+ style and General Hospital. Not my favorite genre."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117464-ashley", "userReview": "Interesting book. A nice mix of empowered female characters. However it seems to fall right into the common problem of many books about women in the single world. It pushes the idea that women are incomplete with out a significant other. It also makes a few points about how women fall for the guy who will break their heart and still want to stay with him. Overall it was a good quick read and not bad if you want something not too engaging."}, {"userName": "Michelegg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253691-michelegg", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book so much.
