{"ratings": 0, "userreviews": [], "description": "When Genna welcomes her son into the world she is stricken by his appearance. All the nurses in her small-town hospital are convinced he is cursed. How far will she go to spare him suffering? Praise for Her Harlequin Baby: \"Angela Meadon delivers a dark, visceral, deeply human story. In very few words, she manages to convey the pain of what should be a joyful moment turned horrific and sad. The ending, while heart-wrenching is inevitable and perfect. Well done.\" -Ken MacGregor \"...Meadon did an extraordinary job here. The tie-in with the disease and the tiger is compelling, frightening, and sad. This is a very memorable story, and told well.\" -Sydney Leigh", "title": "Her Harlequin Baby", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36192871-her-harlequin-baby", "average": 0.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1504724208l/36192871.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6565086.Angela_Meadon", "name": "Angela Meadon"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36192871-her-harlequin-baby", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29938785-strong-medicine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16207821-a-taste-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27419168-dead-ends-and-sharp-bends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18189279-the-patient", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29866534-dead-ends-and-sharp-bends"]}
