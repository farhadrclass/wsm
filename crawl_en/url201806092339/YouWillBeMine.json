While I did enjoy the book, I wasn't overly excited with everything going on. And once again, it's because I struggle with connecting to the characters. The storyline itself is interesting but the lack of character development hurt the story overall for me.As I said the storyline was interesting; Lylah and her friends start receiving anonymous letters that are addressed to a particular person. When each person starts winding up dead, things start pointing to one person. While I was able to easily figure out who the murderer was, it was still interesting to watch the mystery play out.Natasha does a good job of throwing in different aspects and people's reactions to things to keep the \"suspects\" list open to so many. I have to say that the mannerisms in which the friends die is quite gruesome and that will leave the reader doubting a lot of their suspects.I do enjoy Natasha's writing. She always keeps the story itself gripping and entertaining. I may only rate her books 3 stars, but I do enjoy reading them and will continue to do so.Overall, it was a good read for me. If you enjoy a good mystery and suspense thriller (and don't hate that you will possibly figure out the killer) this book will be for you. Just don't expect a lot of depth into the characters."}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19949830-taylor", "userReview": "Read this poolside yesterday and have a lot of thoughts.

This in no way influences my opinionFor me, Natasha Preston became an author to look out for after reading The Cabin. It had me hooked from beginning to end and the ending was absolutely shocking. So when Sourcebooks uploaded this to Netgalley, I just had to read it! This book had me guessing throughout, but there were some things that I feel were a little unbelievable, considering the situation.This book follows a group of six housemates at university as they begin to get notes and they start getting murdered. The police are trying to catch the culprit, but they don\u2019t seem to be getting anywhere. I felt like this book was obvious in the sense of who it wasn\u2019t. The characters had an idea of who they thought was the perpetrator from the very beginning and they often blamed this character for the events throughout the book \u2013 so obviously it wasn\u2019t the character that they thought it was. I think I\u2019ve been reading too many murder mysteries\u2026 I know the tricks of the trade\u2026 or the books.Whilst I knew who it wasn\u2019t, I had other suspects throughout the book. Both guesses turned out to be wrong and I only started getting an inkling of who it was going to be toward the end. The book left me guessing and I loved the way that the events were described and the ultimate ending and explanation that was given. I felt like the explanation was well thought out, but I would have liked to maybe have seen more of the relationship dynamic between the characters (I don\u2019t want to spoil it) to really give weight behind the actions themselves.I did feel like a lot of the actions of the characters were a bit unbelievable considering the circumstances. There was a lot going on with the murders etc. but the characters often acted pretty stupid and ultimately did things that were getting them hurt/murdered. Even after the first couple of times, they carried on acting stupid and it grated on my nerves.I would have also liked to have seen more of the relationship dynamic between the character they believed were committing the murders and the rest of the housemates. I feel like flashbacks would have been a great tool to add to the book to help give it that extra bit of depth with the characters themselves and the readers.Can we also just talk about that ending. I should have really guessed that an ending that shocking would have come from this author after reading The Cabin, but I forgot and it sprung on me. It has definitely left the future open for the characters and for the reader\u2019s imagination to run wild on what could happen next. It was a great way to leave it as either a standalone or even as something the author could come back and visit in the future with a follow up book.All in all, I enjoyed this book and the plot itself. I felt the murders were well planned out and the explanation was definitely fitting to the book itself. I absolutely loved the ending and would not be opposed to a second book! I gave this book 4/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Melanie Maloney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16631966-melanie-maloney", "userReview": "If you like a decent suspenseful serial killer novel this book is for you.

I've read one of Natasha Preston's books before (The Cellar) and loved the premise, but hated just about everything else. The same exact thing happened with this book. It makes me even angrier knowing this book had so much potential. If the characters were developed, it had better and more clever foreshadowing, and wasn't so drawn out, this could've been so, so good. The biggest issue: Every single character is a flat, cardboard cut-out of a person. I didn't care in the slightest when anyone died, because we knew nothing about them, none of them had any personality, and after the first murder, our main character gets over them pretty quickly. Lylah was no exception. I will say she was a better main character than in The Cellar, because she had at least some backstory, but was still very passive, whiny, and boring. She has a tiny \"romance\" with Chase, but its boring and seemed cheesy and inappropriate, right in the middle of all their friends being murdered. And of course, every single character is also the biggest moron on the planet. All of their friends are being murdered, especially when they go out to parties and things, and they STILL go out, every damn day. They go separate ways, and hang out with people, or go to bars, or parties, and it's SO. STUPID. Stay home! When was Sonny murdered? At the play. Where was Issac murdered? He goes out to meet a girl. When do they get an envelope filled with stalker pictures of themselves? When they're out having a ladies fucking night. And they even have police protection throughout most of the book and they still get murdered. It's like they're trying to die. Throughout most of the book, they have at least 6+ officers guarding them, but then for some reason they only have 1 for one night, and he gets killed? Why, all of sudden, did they drop having so many guards? And when they do have so many guards, how was Charlotte taken from her room? Nothing. Makes. Sense. Everyones stupid and the police might as well not be there for all the help they give.The writing of the novel isn't the worst I've ever read, but it could use some work. It is constantly telling, instead of showing. There were hardly ever descriptions. Every setting was grey and lifeless. Conversations were just plain dialogue back forth with no descriptions of how the characters were saying it, or what they were doing, or describing body language. Also, it was very repetitive, as was the plot. I might just be nitpicking, but characters ask one another \"Are you okay?\" a MILLION times in the novel. I went back and skimmed through the book, not even looking that hard, and counted 32 times it was asked. Even taking in the circumstances, it was said excessively and a bit unnecessarily. It'd be asked right after someone was murdered! Of course they're not okay!The mystery's what kept me reading, because I was constantly waiting for it to get better. It didn't.The whole time they suspected Jake, based on ZERO evidence! He tried to kiss Lylah one time, and has never shown any homicidal tendencies before, but sure! Now he's a serial killer! And It's even more frustrating because we as the audience know it's not going to be Jake, so the fact that it's stretched out for the entire book is infuriating. The same things happened over and over, and none of the events added anything to a story. All the murders, notes, and set ups led to nothing changing. No developments were made. So every scene was useless and had no stakes, and I, as a reader, wasn't worried because every incident ended in the same way. That's what I mean when I said the book was drawn out. If we'd cut all the scenes that lead to nowhere, put some actual stakes into the story, and added more descriptions, the novel would've been the same length, but much more dynamic.Now, I didn't necessarily predict who the murderer would be, even though I did suspect him, so that was a positive. I actually like Riley as the murderer but I would've liked it so much more if they'd really gone for it. The whole time, it's pretty clear that the murderer has romantic feelings for Lylah, leaving roses for her, and telling her that she'll be his. When he pulled her into an alley, he even BITES her. So did Riley have twisted romantic feelings for her? We'll never fucking know. The book was not scary in the slightest, but adding that nasty element would've actually given me the creeps. If'd they foreshadowed better, shown more of his relationship with Lylah, and just added more layers to his character than he had it would have been great. This had the potential to be very dark, and twisted, but it wasn't. The ending leaves it open for a sequel, where they might develop him more, but they should've done it in this book.If there is a sequel, I won't be reading it. At most, I'd google spoilers, just to satisfy the closure this book didn't offer."}, {"userName": "Kitkat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58619391-kitkat", "userReview": "Natasha Preston I was worried about this book because I hated Awake.

I was really taken by the synopsis of the book. It is a mystery and it sounded like it was going to be a page turner. However, I could not get passed the writing. It was not the greatest. It was very amateur writing and mind you I do realize that the audience is YA but, I have teens that I know would not be able to stand the writing.

Red Herring Jake. The hyperfocus on it being Jake from so early on was a deadass clue it wasn't going to be him.2. Audience is supposed to believe a panic attack Lylah has. Could have been written more believably, had the author ever experienced a true panic attack of her own, or extensively spoken with someone who's had that experience and taken notes to use in her writing.3. Character authenticity. Only Lylah, Riley, Lylah's love interest Chace, and suspect's brother Zak are really written in a way that is somewhat believable and given definitive personalities. Everyone else kind of blends into the background save for one or two defining character traits.4. Too much focus on Lylah's feelings and obsessions with Chace, and their unfolding relationship REALLY detract from the story in this case, rather than enriching it. If it was meant to usher the plot along better and help solidify Riley's actions as the stalking killer, it was done very clumsily.5. Pacing was...just what the heck was the pacing in this book supposed to be? Don't get me wrong, this is a quick read, but the pacing is jarring somehow.Wow. Wow. Just wow. I can barely process my thoughts because this just feels like a mess of a YA thriller novel.

They must have been fresh out of the police academy because they seemed so naive and stupid. \u201cHey kids, I know there\u2019s a psychopathic killer after you but you should continue to live normal lives so by all means, please continue to party hard.\u201d They seriously encourage these kids to go out drinking while they are being stalked! Then there\u2019s the crimson herring (so named because red herring is not strong enough to express HOW OBVIOUS it was that Jake was not the killer). He asked out the main character, got turned down, and that was enough to push him over the edge? It was ridiculous and there was nothing but circumstantial evidence against him, but what bothered me the most was that EVERYONE (and I mean EVERYONE, including the police!) referred to the killer as \u201cJake\u201d - with no evidence to support it! \u201cJake left me a letter,\u201d \u201cJake texted me,\u201d \u201cwhy would Jake do this\u201d etc etc etc. It was really unprofessional of the police to do this and it caused everyone to think that Jake was the killer early on - which of course made me not suspect him at all. The romance definitely felt a bit off to me. Their friends are being brutally murdered one by one, but they\u2019re talking about feelings and such? The romance also felt very youthful - like they were 12 years old rather than 19 or 20. She actually blushes to see him with a shirt off! At 19?? They were juvenile and I didn\u2019t like him at all.

First, I want to mention that the story concept was pretty sturdy; although, the plot was straightforward and overall basic. Preston's writing is mostly geared for teens, so I do understand the choice in writing style. Second, there was an enormous amount of spelling and grammatical errors (\"shot\" instead of \"shop\"?). At first I counted them, but I lost track because there were so many. Additionally, there was a large amount of repetitiveness. The main character has probably fainted or stumbled about a thousand times, and has mentioned their parents' death even more. Third, (I do realize this apart of Preston's style) the main character's thoughts were very cringe-worthy. Imagine the snarkiness of a teenager, and multiply it. At first I thought it was fine, but it evolved to me literally throwing the book to the floor (and not to mention some weird looks from others). I've read \"The Cellar\" and it has the same vibe, but it's justified since it's from a younger point of view. I feel like the book would gain about one star on my personal rating if those italicized sentences were gone. The book was mediocre, and was easily forgettable.

Several times, the author goes to type \u2018murderer\u2019 but instead says \u2018murder\u2019.

Despite predicting the ending, I did think \u2018that\u2019s a bit of a stretch to become a serial killer....\u2019 but alas, here we are. So Lylah refuses to kiss a boy a year ago, and that\u2019s the entire basis for why everyone thinks this poor Jake dude is the killer. Seriously... the only reason.

But it was a very sweet love story.If you are a fan of Natasha Preston or if you are just looking for something new to read I recommend this book!!"}, {"userName": "Megan Rose Robinson", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13316159-megan-rose-robinson", "userReview": "I was very happy within the first few pages to discover that this book wasn't based around a group of middle school teenagers, but is, in fact, based around a group of young adults in college. I felt this book was a mixture of the Scream movies along with the game Clue. For anyone who loves mysteries and horror books, I do recommend reading this. Preston does a great job in creating suspense and keeping you guessing. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Preston seemed to include questions of things that the readers had already known about simply to make sure all the characters knew the new updates. I would definitely reread this as it is a different and darker way to look at Valentine's Day."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238273-trisha", "userReview": "\"I can get you any time I want\"I liked that this was a bit gruesome and a bit silly. Kids away at college first get threatening messages, then one of them goes missing. From there, it's blood and horror and a lot of Valentine's day decor. In the midst there is still a love story (which is a bit of a distraction and doesn't add much to the story). I wish I'd loved it more but I guessed the ending too early and just couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to believe the kids would stay in college as they were each picked off."}, {"userName": "Jara Beaubien", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32600201-jara-beaubien", "userReview": "If you like murder mayhem and be scared then this book is for you, personally I read to get away from that kind of stuff but some do seem to love this kind of books and movies.Lylah and her friends are planing on spending a night together, guess partying is a way of letting stress out.
