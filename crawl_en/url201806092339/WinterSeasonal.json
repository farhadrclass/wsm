But, even then, when you stop to consider what Smith has done in this second book of her seasonal quartet, it is breathtaking! Ali Smith has her own unique style. Given her very obvious love for Dickens and all things Dickensian, I wanted to say her style is Smithsonian, but someone else has already appropriated that word. No one writes like Smith with such joy in words.At the Man Booker short list event in Cheltenham, Smith spoke about the difficulties of time in the novel. In a piece of music, several people can sing at the same time, and about different topics/times if that\u2019s what the composer wants. In a novel, we can only read one set of words at a time. And this is a frustration for some novelists.In Winter, Smith plays with this idea of time in a novel. This makes for a fairly complicated structure to the book which consists of multiple flashbacks and flash forwards. It can be tricky to keep track of all the different threads being covered.That\u2019s one of the things stories and books can do, they can make more than one time possible at once.Well, they can when Smith writes them.We are dealing with four main characters: Sophia, her sister, Iris, her son Art (Arthur) and a girl Art has paid to pretend to be his girlfriend for Christmas with his mother, Lux. Art needs a girlfriend because he has just broken up with Charlotte who was supposed to be spending Christmas with him at his mother\u2019s, but she is now, instead, sabotaging his Twitter feed to such an extent that he dares not turn on his phone.Lux is a fascinating character (somewhat reminiscent of Amber in The Accidental who arrives and disrupts a family occasion). Lux is, of course, both the bringer of light and a soap. And in this story the girl called Lux brings both illumination and cleansing. She is not British, but she came to the UK because of Shakespeare\u2019s play Cymbeline.Cymbeline, he says. The one about poison, mess, bitterness, then the balance coming back. The lies revealed. The losses compensated.And that\u2019s what Winter is about. Sophia and Iris have fallen out and not spoken for many years. Art has broken up with Charlotte. Then Lux happens.And, in the mix with this story of a family gathering (Christmas is in Winter and Christmas is about family gatherings), Smith flashes back and forwards to earlier times in Sophia\u2019s and Iris\u2019s history. Primarily, amongst many other historical references, she visits the Greenham Common protests and pulls them forward to today.It seems to me that one of the things Smith is trying to do in her quartet is ground or embed the events and attitudes of our current time in their underlying history. She wants to unite \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d because \u201cnow\u201d means very little unless you understand \u201cthen\u201d. In Winter, \u201cnow\u201d very much is \u201cnow\u201d: we cover events up to the summer of 2017.Brexit and its implications are still part of the story (Christmas and \u201cno room at the inn\u201d is paralleled with UK and \u201cno more room\u201d). Trump is part of the story.And, as with Pauline Boty in Autumn, there is a female artist. In Winter this artist is perhaps mentioned fewer times or in less detail, (Update: this comment comes from my ignorance of Hepworth - some basic research after reading shows that she is actually present, if not named, from the very beginning) but her role in the overall aim of the story is very clear. She is Barbara Hepworth:Yes, he says, and she does that, Hepworth, I think, puts the holes through what she makes, because she wants people to think about exactly what you just said, time, and ancient things, but also because she really just wants them to want to touch what she makes, you know, to be reminded about things that are quite physical, sensory, immediate, he says.Hepworth\u2019s work is like what Smith is aiming for (and, for me, achieving) in the way she seeks to unite past and present. In a comment on Hepworth, there is a quote that it seems to me applies equally to Smith\u2019s writing:She walks round the sculpture. It makes you walk round it, it makes you look through it from different sides, see different things from different positions. It\u2019s also like seeing inside and outside something at onceAnd also in a comment that could apply equally to Smith\u2019s writing, we read of KeplerKindred means family, what I\u2019m saying is he thought that truth and time are sort of related, family to each other.AndAnd he was a man who paid things attention up close as well as far away.Winter contains far more meditation on the season it is named after than Autumn did.That\u2019s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again.\u2026the shift, the reversal, from increase of darkness to increase of light, revealed that a coming back of light was at the heart of midwinter equally as much as the waning of light.I could write for hours about this book, but I cannot do it justice and the best thing is if you read it for yourself. Everyone should read it, especially the final quarter which made me laugh and cry in equal measure. One final quote which really made me laugh:The man who wrote the dictionary. Johnson. Not Boris. The opposite of Boris. A man interested in the meanings of words, not one whose interests leave words meaningless.And I haven\u2019t even talked about the floating head or the floating coastline."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "You're reading the book about the leaves again! It's not the same book. Same cover image, different season.So no leaves floating about in this one?No leaves. But lots of floaters.Like eye floaters?Those - and others.You do like your enigmas!Plastic floating across the oceans is no allusive enigma - it's very real.Oh right, serious floaters. I won't make the joke that was..Or floaters as in people with no fixed place to sleep.And this book is called Winter? Brrr...Or chemicals floating about in the atmosphere causing havoc in the food chain.Is there nothing fun in this Winter book. I mean, like Christmas?You want Christmas? This book does Christmas with layers. Layers of Christmasses one on another.Oh good! Any snow flakes floating about?Something white and granular at any rate. Possibly nuclear...Don't massacre Christmas on me please!To paraphrase the book, you've done it yourself.Me? I love Christmas! I especially love the games we played at Christmas.Games? There are games floating through these pages alright. Word association games.Oh, let's play a word association game. I'll begin: Robin!Hatred.No! You're supposed to say Holly or Berry or Red or something.I was thinking Red. Red as in hatred. Red as in tortured. Red as in massacred. Ugh! This book has warped your mind! I'll just pretend you said Red and I'll answer Green!Greenham Common! Nuclear holo...no! Stop! You're warping my mind now! Woof!Barking mad! That's what you are. And her.Ali Smith? You're barking up the wrong tree if you think she's crazy. There's no one saner. She can see the underlying fabric of our world clearer than most. Prove it.It's as if she's a torch on high beam, shining light into every corner of our time. She's even inside my head, directing her spotlight into the recesses of my memory (Grocer Jack!!) and then out through my eyes so that I can't but see the world more clearly myself. It's no accident that the characters with most insight in this book are called Lux and Iris.Ali Smith does sound clearsighted - and bright, and wise.Snap! There's a character called after Wisdom! Sophia. Though she's sometimes called Philo and she's a bit of a sophist.A philosopher, do you mean?.Well, a philosopher-lite perhaps, philo as in phyllo/filo pastry, according to her sister. There's a character called Art too. But Ali Smith makes him the most irrelevant of all the characters which is odd given the focus she usually gives to art in her books, and in this one too, in a way. Very odd indeed (I'm pretending to see what you mean). But do carry on.Well, I was reminded of various pieces of art from the beginning of this book. I kept thinking of a Brancusi piece like this one:and eventually a completely smooth one like this one:And they both reminded me of Barbara Hepworth's sculptures (which were mentioned briefly in Autumn), like this one for example:Or this one: Hmm. They are very beautiful but kind of enigmatic. What do they mean? Well, the thing is, Hepworth's sculptures turn up again in Winter, and they led to an explosion of understanding for me as a reader. I saw them as representing both books. What was absence in one, was presence in the other, what was loss was gain, what was missing was found. But neither book had a monopoly on the lost and found, or on the absence and the presence. Both contain both. And I came to realise that all the themes from the first were threaded through the second: the movement of peoples, the lies of politicians, the brutality of soldiers, the accumulations of useless stuff, sister versus sister, and, of course, art versus politics. So you were reading the same book after all! Yes! Both contain both. And when Spring comes out, I know I'll find a third layer of the same warp and woof. I can't wait to read it!"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Winter is the second book I\u2019ve read by Ali Smith (Public Library and Other Stories was the first one). Both times I had to recalibrate my brain according to the following rules in order to enjoy the reading experience:-Slow down \u2013 the book is short but you can\u2019t speed through it.-Give in to the lack of linearity \u2013 allow yourself to float and flit in time.-Open up to the impressionistic feel of the story and language \u2013 working too hard to understand what\u2019s happening seems to defeat the point.The book is told primarily through the voice and eyes of aging Sophia and her adult son Art. The hub of the narrative is a Christmas in England when Sophia, Art, Sophia\u2019s sister, and Art\u2019s pretend girlfriend come together in Sophia\u2019s house. Sophia\u2019s mind seems to be failing, so her thoughts skip to different time periods, all the while revealing her as challenging and prickly. Art is a tad odd too, somewhat awed and beleaguered by his mother, trying more or less to make sense and gain some control over his own life.In the background, contemporary news flows in from time to time, referring to Trump as the US president, suggesting political chaos beyond the personal chaos of these characters.I\u2019m not really doing Winter and Smith justice. Winter is not a book for everyone, but I really enjoyed the writing, the characters and feel of it once my brain fell in sync with the book\u2019s sensibility.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232880-simon", "userReview": "\u202aI\u2019ve so many thoughts I can\u2019t quite sum up the brilliance of Ali Smith\u2019s Winter other than by saying it\u2019s blown me away.

In which Sophia\u2019s perfectly honed minor-symphony modesty and narrative decorum complement the story she\u2019s in with the right kind of quiet wisdom-from-experience ageing-female status, making it a story that\u2019s thoughtful, dignified, conventional in structure \u2026. The kind of quality literary fiction where the slow drift of snow across the landscape is merciful \u2026. \nThe second in Ali Smith\u2019s seasonal quartet, which started with the Booker shortlisted Autumn. The basic plot is an unusual family Christmas reunion \u2013 Art goes to visit his mother Sophia: a once successful business woman who ran businesses selling third world craft items and then artificially distressed furnishings, with her business now failed she still has her huge Cornish mansion \u2013 one which she first visited when it was occupied by a commune including her now estranged older sister Iris, a long time social activist and rebel. Art, an insincere nature blogger, has just broken up with his environmentally active girlfriend Charlotte \u2013 and pays a Croatian girl Lux he meets at a bus stop to impersonate Charlotte for the weekend. She invites Iris to join them.Sophia opens the book by looking at a postcard of Eduoard Boubat's \"La Petite Fille Aux Feullies Mortes\" - the same postcard that Daniel Gluck in \"Autumn\" sent to a younger lady called \"Sophie something\" on a visit to Paris. Daniel himself is not named in \"Winter\" but a comparison of incident's described in the two books from Daniel and Sophia's viewpoints respectively, make it clear that Daniel is in fact Art's father.https://www.artsy.net/artwork/edouard...However more so than the overlap of characters, \u201cWinter\u201d shares many similarities in style and approach, with its predecessor and it is clear that Smith is treating this quartet (at least on the evidence of its first two elements) as a single body of artistic work.Similarities I observed between the two books-\tAn rhythmical opening chapter, clearly designed to be read aloud, with her the \u201cAll across the country \u2026 \u201c of Autumn replaced with \u201c \u2026.. is dead\u201d of Winter-\tThe extensive use of wordplay and punning \u2013 and a character who delights in this and expanding other character\u2019s appreciation of language, ironically (but presumably very deliberately given the immigration and Brexit ideas running through both books) in both cases a non-native English speaker. In Autumn, Daniel broadens the language of the young Elisabeth, in Winter Lux has a great grasp of English language and literature and her own name serves as a pun at one stage Lux/Lexiography. -\tA deliberate coverage of immediately contemporary events woven through the text (here \u2013 Grenfell Tower, Nicholas Soames \u201cwoofing\u201d at a female labour MP in the commons, Theresa May\u2019s \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d speech, the crowdfunding by the far-right of a ship to block immigrant rescues)-\tA concentration on one overarching contemporary theme \u2013 with Trump being the Winter equivalent of Autumn\u2019s Brexit vote-\tA distinct left-of-centre liberal bias to the political commentary, one which (in my view unfortunately in the days of social media echo-chambers) is only likely to reinforce rather than challenge the world view of Smith\u2019s readers. You will look in vain for any criticism of Labour politicians for example. -\tA link between past political actions and the politics of today \u2013 part of the concept of seasonality that Smith set out to explore when she commenced the quartet \u2013 the concept that our real energy, our real history, is cyclic in continuance and at core, rather than consecutive and how closely to contemporaneousness a finished book might be able to be in the world, and yet how it could also be, all through, very much about stratified, cyclic timeIn Autumn very deliberate parallels are drawn between the Profumo scandal and the Brexit vote \u2013 the concept of the lies of those in power. In Winter, the environmental and climate-change activism of Charlotte (Art\u2019s ex-girlfriend) and the refugee involvement of the modern day Iris are linked directly to the Silent-Spring inspired environmental activism of the commune where Iris lives many years before and her role in the Greenham Common protests. Interestingly the message here is much more positive than Autumn, that the abuses of those in power can overtime be overcome by year\u2019s of protest and activism.Smith\u2019s concept of cyclic time (and also perhaps the reason for the more positive take on events in this season) are bought together when Sophia is listening to Christmas music which \u2026 intrinsically means a revisiting. It means the rhythm of the passing of time, yes, but also, and more so, the return of time in its endless and comforting cycle to this special point in the year when regardless of the dark and the cold we shore up and offer hospitality and goodwill and give them out, a bit of luxury in a world primed against them both- A cover featuring trees and with trees appearing as an image throughout the book. This is no coincidence, as in an interview on the significance of trees for the quartet Smith says \nTrees are great. Don't get me started about how clever they are, how oxygen-generous, how time-formed in inner cyclic circles, how they provide homes for myriad creatures, how back when this country was covered in forests the word for sky was an old English word that meant tops of trees ... The sweetness they create. The things they help us create. The pollination they make possible, their utter (mellow) fruitfulness. Their gestural uprightness plus bendiness, their suppleness in all weathers. Their shelter. Their ingenuity with colours, and with looking after themselves seasonally. Their organic relation to books.\nIn Winter - the significance of trees is bound up with the importance of colour. Smith emphasises here that green (more specifically evergreen) is as much the colour of winter as white and also that green is an ancient colour (of moss and first) which pre-dates the other colours of nature. Again I feel that this is a nod to the more optimistic parts of the season that this book is starting to explore. I could not help seeing a link between the evergreen trees which maintain their colour through the winter months and the clear link Smith draws between the 70s Environmental protests, the Greenham common protests and the pro-immigrant and anti-climate change activism of the present day.- A concentration on a certain decade: 1960s for Autumn, 1980s for Winter (although perhaps less coherently than in Autumn given that Hepworth died in the 1970s so that the 1980s actions is around people visiting her studio rather than Hepworth's own life in that time). I understand Spring will be 1920s based and Summer 1940s based.-\tThe firm SA4A (Smith, Ali, Quartet, Autumn) serving as a symbol for the threat of faceless and almost unknown multinationals. In Autumn, we see SA4A as a quasi-police private security firm, here Art works for their entertainments division to enforce copyright on emerging artists-\tThe symbolism of fences and commons \u2013 in Autumn Elisabeth\u2019s mother is shocked by a fence erected on a common near her home (the fence serving a metaphor for Brexit), in Winter Iris chains herself to a fence at the very start of the Greenham Commons protests. I understand that for Smith one of the key stories in the book is the tale of the initial Greenham common protestors visiting a hardware store to buy chains and padlocks ........ and this set off for her the image of a chain reaction ... and her view that this initial small actions lead ultimately to nuclear disarmament. -\tA lady struggling with high-street bureaucracy \u2013 here Autumn\u2019s passport service of the Post Office is substituted by the financial advisers of high-street banks-\tA relatively unknown and now female artist \u2013 here the sculptor Barbara Hepworth (in Autumn the pop-artist Pauline Boty). Both artists died tragically (Boty of cancer Hepworth of a fire in her studio) and both could be said to be (unfairly) overshadowed by men working in the same field and broad style (Warhol and Henry Moore respectively) \u2013 with Smith looking to deservedly restore their reputation.As an aside I have to confess that for four years I attended a Cambridge college whose centrepiece was one of Hepworth's sculptures - Four Square (Walk Through) but that for years I falsely attributed the sculpture to Henry Moore (who also had a strong link to the college and was an honorary fellow)https://barbarahepworth.org.uk/sculpt...Finally it is fascinating to note that Barbara Hepworth was herself a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.-\tA male character with a past link to that artist and who collected that art. Daniel with Pauline Boty here substituted by Art\u2019s real father\u2019s love of Barbara Hepworth: a pilgrimage to Cornwall to see the studio in which she lived and died, leads to him meeting Art\u2019s mother-\tActual works of art of the artist figuring in the book and sparking a character\u2019s imagination \u2013 in the same way Elisabeth looks at a book of Boty\u2019s paintings, Art\u2019s mother views a Hepworth sculpture (I believe \u201cNesting Stones\u201d) owned by his father \u2013 more crucially she takes one of the two stones and brings it out from its hiding place in the present timeAs an aside the concept of two nesting heads is a recurring one through the novel - Art as a child with Sophie, Lux with Art, Iris and Sophie as children and then later as adults-\tThe character\u2019s reaction to the art serving as a very deliberate metaphor for what Smith is trying to do in her quartet. In Autumn, Elisabeth comments on one of Boty\u2019s paintings The cow parsley. The painted flowers. Boty\u2019s sheer unadulterated reds in the re-image-ing of the image. Put it together and what have you got? Anything useful? which echoes a question Smith asked of herself in an interview as she started work on the concept We'll see what happens. I have no idea how the reality will meet the conception. I'm looking forward to finding outIn Winter, Sophia comments of the Hepworth sculpture It makes you walk around it, it makes you look through it from different sides, see different things from different positions. It\u2019s also like seeing inside and outside something at once which is a perfect metaphor for how Smith's writing forces us to examine our world-\tReferences to classic literature, including by Shakespeare and Dickens; in Autumn The Tempest and A Tale of Two Cities, here Cymbeline and A Christmas Carol.-\tSet alongside the high-brow cultural references, the influence of TV light entertainment - in Autumn we had the game show and minor celebrity participant and clear Harry Hill influences; here Art\u2019s step-father was a sitcom star and at times Smith explicitly references an imaginary sitcom studio audience reacting to the action of the book -\tThe mixing of the real and the imaginary and the mixing of time periods.In Autumn much of the book is set in dreams, imagination or memory, and at times we are unclear even whose memory we are in or even how real the memories are \u2013for example much of the dialogue between the young Elisabeth and Daniel may in fact be Daniel merging memories of his sister\u2019s precocious wordplay. In Winter there are numerous memories and flashbacks - but the real imaginary aspect is provided by two floating elements seen only by one character. Sophia has a floater which then turns into a child\u2019s head, metamorphoses through an old man and a green man and then seems to ultimately transform into the stone that she has kept from Hepworth\u2019s \u201cNesting Stones\u201d. The disembodied head seems to have come to Smith as the concept of society \u201closing its head\u201d I voting for Brexit, but I also thought the concept of a head acting alone from is body could apply to Trump. More mysteriously Art sees a floating piece of coastline \u2013 possibly inspired by his sub-conscious guilt over a continual dream Charlotte had (and which was ignored by him) of quartering herself as a symbol for the possible break-up of Britain, possibly by her warning about the piece of coastline the size of Wales, imminently to break off the Antarctic shelf and possibly a nod to the inspiration Hepworth took herself from the North Yorkshire coastline of the family holidays of her childhood and which she later sought in the Cornish coast-\tThe concept of time-containers. When discussing the quartet, Smith commented But we're time-containers, we hold all our diachrony, our pasts and our futures (and also the pasts and futures of all the people who made us and who in turn we'll help to make) in every one of our consecutive moments / minutes / days / years In Autumn this concept was captured particularly in Daniel\u2019s dreams and his memories of his fleeing from Nazi Germany and of his brilliant sister killed in the holocaust. In Winter the concept is even more explicit. When discussing Art\u2019s visions of the floating coastline, Lux explains what she calls her own coastline. One of my mother\u2019s uncles was doing the family three thing when I was about ten and he showed me my place on the map of people he\u2019s made, I was down at the bottom, I looked at the names above mine, going back in time, all the centuries that the names meant and I thought look at all the people over my head, real people and all related to me, a part of me, and I know nothing, absolutely nothing, about almost all the people on that map \u2026. When I was seventeen, walking along a street in Toronto \u2026 I knew for the first time what I was, I am , carrying on my head \u2026 not just one container or basket, but hundreds of baskets all balanced on each other, full to their tops with bones \u2026 and they were so heavy .. that either I was going to have to offload them or they were going to drive me down through the pavement to the ground Later when saying farewell to Art and failing to persuade him to engage with his mother, she reacts to his assertion that he has nothing in common with Sophia with the angry comment[we as humans have] the chance to know where we came from. To forget it, to forget what made us, where it might take us, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know. Forgetting your own headGiving of course another explanation of the floating head \u2013 that it represents the dislocation of Art from his mother. And also interesting acting as partly a counter balance to the liberal, pro-immigration, anti-Brexit message of the story as Lux's argument partly picks up on David Goodhart's arguments in The Road to Somewhere: The Populist Revolt and the Future of Politics which ideas (much as I suspect Lux and Smith would hate to admit this) were behind May's citizen's of nowhere speech.- The examination of dysfunctional parent/child relationships. In Autumn of course Elisabeth and her mother - but here not just Art and Sophia (as discussed above and critiqued by Lux) but between Sophia and her own father. In a beautifully touching but achingly sad vignette - Sophia's father contacts her when she is a successful business woman, when he hears that Laika the space dog only lived for a few hours, as he still remembers how upset the child Sophia was at Laika orbiting earth for a week before dying. Lux also reveals to Sophia that the effects of the Yugoslavian wars have left her family \"war-wounded\" such that she cannot live with them.Overall I felt this was an outstanding novel and stronger than the already strong Autumn.In particular I felt that the tale was more nuanced. I have already commented above on Lux's reflections on the need to understand where we have come from. Interestingly, over time the Brexit-supporting business-focused Sophia (with her childhood sensitivity and worries, her brief affair with Art's father and resulting exposure to the art of Hepworth and others, with her run-in with some form of security services) emerges as a much deeper and rounded individual than she is seen by Art and initially by the reader, whereas the left wing anti-Brexit, pro-refugee Iris emerges as simply a serial rebel and protestor.Finally I feel that despite much of the despair Smith and the characters have with the contemporary world and politics - there is a quiet optimism building in this book, a hope that decency and goodness will prevail. The setting of the book, starting on the day of the Winter Solstice is important and Sophie one night reflects \nthe shift, the reversal, from increase of darkness to increase of light, revealed that a coming back of light was at the heart of midwinter equally as much as the waning of light"}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "OK I surrender. Upgraded to 5 stars as Ali Smith has made complete fools of us all, myself included.Everyone spent so long looking for micro-links between the two novels, no-one (at least not in any review on GR as at 9 November 2017) had spotted (other than as the merest teasing hint) the glaring and very explicit link between the two books - the Daniel-Sophie tryst in Paris that is in the first pages of Autumn and the last pages of Winter, complete with dates and details.The more mundane truth was, he\u2019d bought that postcard (Boubat! he took it) when he visited the city of love with yet another woman he wanted to love him but she didn\u2019t, course she didn\u2019t, a woman in her forties, a man in his late sixties, well, be honest, nearer seventy, and anyway he didn\u2019t love her either. Not truly. Matter of profound mismatch nothing to do with age, since at the Pompidou Centre he\u2019d been so moved by the wildness in a painting by Dubuffet that he\u2019d taken his shoes off and knelt down in front of it to show respect, and the woman, her name was Sophie something, had been embarrassed and in the taxi to the airport told him he was too old to take off his shoes in an art gallery, even a modern one.In fact all he can remember of her is that he\u2019d sent her a postcard he wished afterwards he\u2019d kept for himself.(from Winter)And she even anticipated my review of Winter when she wrote Autumn. The first line of the last chapter:\"It was early November, more like Winter than Autumn.\" Ali Smith, a true genius.---------------------Early November, still Autumn, an odd time to launch a book called Winter. The clocks have gone back, making it dark by mid-afternoon. Cold mornings make you wish you\u2019d worn a coat, but then overcrowded, overheated commuter trains made you wish you hadn\u2019t. And as the Halloween goods are cleared from the shelves, Christmas goods replace them and Slade, The Pogues and Jona Lewie are prematurely piped into packed shopping centres. But:\nThe thing about Christmas music that\u2019s particularly interesting, she thought to herself in a knowledgeable but not offputting Radio 4 voice as if in a programme on Christmas music, is that\u2019s it\u2019s thoroughly ineffectual, it just won\u2019t and doesn\u2019t work at any other time of the year. \nSo perhaps this just wasn\u2019t the right time for me to read this. One for me to revisit when it figures in the 2018 awards or perhaps in Spring 2019 when the third book comes out. But it felt like a re-working of Autumn from an author whose biggest strength has been her originality, with The Accidental thrown in as well. And this Irish Times review summed up the political side of the novel well (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/bo...)In lieu of a proper review (read those by Gumble's Yard, Neil, Eric or Robert for a more favourable take):My Ali Smith seasonal quartet bingo cardThe Edouard Boubat image which Daniel gave to Sophie and each character recalls in the opening chapter of Autumn and Winter respectively:The Barbara Hepworth (the cornerstone artist from Winter) statue from my old College, a piece of art the students were allowed if not encouraged to climb on and through, with the room in which I spent 1987-8 on the right hand side.

It is natural, an instinct, perhaps, to be filled with caution when surrounded by a cold, uninviting world, reshaped, reformed, redesigned, perhaps - even if it is the one we\u2019ve found ourselves in before \u2013 in one sense or another. Smith brings you into the season where life seems fragile; where you\u2019re looking at a world coated in ice, wrapped up in the \u2018fake news\u2019 reports of the day, and seats you at the family dinner table for a Christmas get-together when Smith\u2019s four main characters include a son - Art, his mother- Sophia, his Aunt, Sophia\u2019s sister Iris, and his make-believe / pretend Croatian-Canadian girlfriend, Lux, pretending to be his former girlfriend, Charlotte who broke up with him right before they were due to leave for this delightful holiday with his Mum.The thing about Art is that he lives more or less in his own world, oblivious to the world around him. Art has a blog \u2018Art in Nature\u2019 which he writes based on Google searches and stories he writes that are not strictly \u2018fact based\u2019 about his nonexistent visits to these spots. He also has a job working for a company researching copyright infringement. When Art and Lux / Charlotte arrive, Lux, whose very name speaks of illumination, she attempts to lighten Sophia\u2019s life, health, and emotions, and Sophia responds by sharing more of herself, her stories, with Lux than she has with Art. As Lux sees Sophia in \u201cnot-thriving\u201d condition, she convinces Art that they should call Iris, Sophia\u2019s sister. The sisters had a very contentious relationship in the past, but Lux is hopeful that Iris will help her sister. The four of them, not unlike the four seasons of the year, each unique and unlike the other, connected by some tenuous thread that binds them together in this moment in time. Tying this to Smith\u2019s Autumn are some of the political issues from the past and present time, also from Autumn there are some direct connections, some easily seen, others are slightly more hidden. An artist that was a significant point of discussion in Autumn is referenced, and another female artist features somewhat in Winter. A postcard / picture referenced. There are also some historically relevant social causes discussed, comparing the past to the present.

It will be among my top Christmas book recommendations going forward. (Well, I didn't get to read it until the U.S release after the new year.)  The book was all about Christmas: visiting family, guests, lights, snow, loads of food, holly, Christmas tree, \u2026 but none of these reminded me of a traditional picture-perfect white Christmas.  Art was visiting his aging mother Sophia, who was little more than a stranger in his life. To this deserted \u201cPsyche\u2019s House\u201d He brought with him a fake girlfriend, an under-the-radar Croatian immigrant Lux, after a fight with his real partner Charlotte. A dark house and an almost empty fridge signaled how much they were welcome. Out of desperation, they invited Sophia\u2019s long-estranged sister Iris, who arrived at the wee hours of Christmas Day with groceries and a star magnolia in a pot for a Christmas tree. There was no snow, or was there? How about the snowstorm picture Charlotte tweeted under Art\u2019s user name? Want something more surreal to spice it up? The holly woven through the doorknocker was gifted by a floating child\u2019s head in his mouth! The book was about love and relationship. Iris and Sophia, who were childhood confidants, grew up to become polar-opposites in their life pursuits. Could the brief stay of a detached son and a Croatian girl unversed with English clich\u00e9 help them recapture the lost sisterhood? How did Lux help Art discover his true self after meeting him for merely a few days? Sophia was able to bound with the floating head and Lux in no time; why didn\u2019t she have the will and the ways to reconnect emotionally with his only son? I\u2019d be remiss not to mention Sophia\u2019s on-the-moment romance with the love of her life. There was politics, with more breadth than in Autumn: refugee crisis, environmental protection, anti-establishment, Brexit, trump, even fake news. Unlike in Autumn, those topics were used more to define individual characters than setting the scene. There were cleverly-inserted symbols: snow, stone, chain, bird\u2026of course the surreal floating head and floating coastline in the big house. There was an overarching motives: death, frozen, winter. \u201cThat\u2019s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again. An exercise in adapting yourself to whatever frozen or molten state it brings you.\u201d The book was about major characters growing up and growing old. It was about Sophia and Art growing out of there innate ultra-sensitiveness, eventually on their way to reclaim it. It was about conflicts, one of them being between pragmatism and idealism, i.e. business-as-usual and let\u2019s-save-the-world\u2026 There were doses of nostalgia; businesses had more human presence and personalized touch in the past; museum visitors used to spend more time exploring exhibits than taking selfies. Time played a major part in the book. Several Christmases and other salient events in the last few decades, along with some imaginary ones in the future, were interspersed into what was happening at the moment. Time was the core of the book, the frame of the entire art piece. All of the above were crammed in only 322 pages? You bet. Ali Smith is a pro. All the beautiful elements smoothly flowed into each other, and the pacing was perfectly in sync with my own wandering thoughts. That said, the plot was fragmented and somewhat complex; this is not a book with a straight plot that some readers might prefer.Ali Smith gave the otherwise bleak winter the power to restore and rejuvenate. The book made me feel peaceful and upbeat.

Ali Smith, however, seems in Winter to be writing about Brexit and T.\u2014may his name forever be anathema\u2014as it happens. Really, barely a month could have passed between the time Lord Soames in the House of Commons wolf whistled at a rather attractive female member and when Smith began writing about it. The facts are so quickly appropriated and set down that they feel raw, unprocessed, piecemeal. This gives the novel the feel of a tabloid. I don\u2019t want my novels filled with current events. I read more than ever. now for novel\u2019s ability to create for me an alternative world. I don\u2019t read fantasy, but I can see why readers are drawn to fantasy now. I understand the need for escape and thus relief. I\u2019m not putting Smith\u2019s experiment down, but I do admit to not understanding it. Perhaps because I view it as reportage, which is necessarily short form, as opposed to long form narratives whose attributes bury one in a dream. John Gardener once wrote about how we read to be immersed in the dream. Well, there\u2019s no dream here at all. Instead the novel reimmerses us in the topicality I\u2019d thought I\u2019d put aside. In this age of news hitting you 24/7 from dozens of content sources, is this what we really want\u2014the news invading our novels too? I much prefer the sections set in the past, perhaps because there\u2019s some consensus on what those times mean. Unlike our daily unfolding outrages.By contrast, in Smith\u2019s Autumn the news was sufficiently backgrounded amid a wonderful story of a girl and an old man and how their lovely relationship evolves over talks of books and painting over 30 years.

The author floated a fact here and a bit of history there and I was never satisfied with the amount of information I got.

It has a bit of the comic flavor of the Thanksgiving movie \u201cHome for the Holidays\u201d complemented by a lot of internal monologue, flashbacks, and fantasies, all played out against the sobering background of a society polarized by Brexit, populist isolationism, the refugee crisis, and environmental issues. The two main characters, Sophia and her son Art (Arthur), have found narcissistic ways of coping with modern chaos and conflict. The mother, now in her 70s, and possibly on a path to dementia, has withdrawn from all her business and personal entanglements and mainly socializes and communicates with an imaginary friend in the form of a floating head of a child. Art lives his life in a different virtual world, making income from trolling the internet and TV media for copyright infringements and finding self-actualization as a blogger of poetical reflections on invented experiences with nature, which he labels as \u201cArt in Nature\u201d. His girlfriend has just dumped him over his inauthenticity and lack of focus on political issues. Because he has promised his mother to bring his new girlfriend home for Christmas, he stays true to form by opting to hire a woman he has just met to play the role of his girlfriend for the three-day visit to the rambling old estate on England\u2019s southwestern coast. That choice changes everything. The young woman Art brings, an 18-year old named Lux, is very perceptive and pragmatic and sees at once that Sophia is malnourished and in need of serious caretaking. She takes the initiative to invite her estranged sister Iris to join them. They have been out of contact for 30 years due to the conflict between Sophia\u2019s conservatism and Iris\u2019 history of radical political activism against nuclear arms and pollution, and her adoption of a hippie lifestyle, all of which Sophia sees as having contributed to the decline of their parents. Superficially, the jousting and then bonding between sisters makes this a traditional Christmas story of peace and reconciliation. But because with Smith we are in the hands of a maestro of literary play, we get served up for our delight a kaleidoscope of allusions, puzzles, conflations, and time loops. For example, Lux, is supposedly named after the window manufacturer Verilux, but her generous spirit reminds us that her name means light in Latin and that the Madonna is referred to as The Lady of Light. She is from an immigrant family and ignorant of a lot of idiomatic English expressions, yet she is very well educated in literature. She claims to have moved to England from the Canadian site of their settlement due to the brilliance she found in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCymbeline.\u201d I am unfamiliar with the play, but the details provided on its plot makes it sound like it evolves as a tragedy with lots of family conflict driven murderous greed and jealousy but then ends up as a romance with all the problems resolved. Lux reveals: I read it and thought, if this writer from this place can make this mad and bitter mess into this graceful thing it is at the end, where the balance comes back and all the lies are revealed and all the losses are compensated, and that\u2019s the place on earth he comes from, that\u2019s the place than made him, then that\u2019s the place I\u2019m going, I\u2019ll go there, I\u2019ll live there.In many ways, this tale makes the reader judge Art badly for his pretense and fakery and then gets you rooting for him as he progresses toward become a better, more engaged human being. It became clear to me that he is pretty much a hybrid between Sophia and his Aunt Iris, who cared for him for a long period in his formative toddler years. He is sensitive to the need for equality among diverse peoples but doesn\u2019t feel it his responsibility to get involved in helping them. He appreciates the beauties of nature and the value of reducing environmental degradation, but again fails to get engaged in their causes. We get to see the influence of Lux in helping him become more authentic and empathetic in his life. Even before meeting Lux, we begin to see his promise. For example, here is his distillation of the meaning of winter: That\u2019s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself and then how to come pliantly back to life again. An exercise in adapting yourself to whatever frozen or molten state it brings you.Here he begins to question the healthiness of living in the online world:His life online means nothing to those around him.When you look at it like that it\u2019s pretty much like it isn\u2019t really happening.Except it is.So which is the real thing? Is this library not the world? Is that the world, the one on the screen, and this, this sitting bodily with all these other people round him, isn\u2019t?As for the time loops I mentioned, Sophia leads us on a cycle of memories of notable past Christmases as triggered by church bells ringing in midnight of Christmas eve. The experience is a bit like the sense of being trapped in repetition in the movie \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d But she does experience a progressive difference. The spirit of peace on Earth and goodwill to men is getting harder to sustain in the face of changes in the world and dissolution of her family: She wants it to mean again like meaning used to mean.\u2026There is a new meanness in meaning.Maybe the prospect of delving into a woman\u2019s fantasy of a disembodied head as a companion feels like a deal breaker to you in terms of reading this book. I bet most of you could take it in stride. At one point she thinks of it as \u201cher very own Christmas infant\u201d, and in other ways the mute thing is source of joy to her: In any case, it just wasn\u2019t frightening, the head. It was sweet, and bashful in its ceremoniousness,\u2026Last night, as the head had amused itself by bowling itself down the hall runner at the cabinet to see how many of Godfrey\u2019s eighteenth century English pottery figurines it could topple each time by hitting itself off the legs of it \u2026By Christmas Eve, despite the head is beginning to lose some of its features, her empathy begins to be engendered in a general way: Had what happened to it hurt very much?It hurt her to think it. The hurt was surprising in itself. Sophia had been feeling nothing for some time now. Refugees in the sea. Children in ambulances. Blood-soaked men running to hospitals or away from burning hospitals carrying blood-covered children. Dust-covered dead people by the sides of roads. Atrocities. People beaten up and tortured in cells.For her to continue loving something that is becoming faceless is pretty eerie. Her mind makes a connection to the faces of saints and Madonnas being scratched out of many paintings by fanatical vandals during the Reformation: It was the demonstration that everything symbolic will be revealed as a lie, everything you revere nothing but burnt matter, broken stone, as soon as it meets whatever shape time\u2019s contemporary cudgel takes.But it worked the other way round too. They looked, those vandalized saints and statues, more like statements of survival than of destruction. They were proof of a new state of endurance, mysterious, headless, faceless, anonymous.This is part of Smith\u2019s narrative signature, to link the personal life to the aesthetics expressed in art. As I\u2019ve experienced in three of her other books she works the history of a neglected female artist into this tale. In this case, the art and artist chosen was not so well integrated into the story. Regardless, I loved the artistry of Smith\u2019s diversions and strange trajectory of morphing ideas that emerge as significant themes . Many readers will likely be less appreciative\u2014all a matter of taste and a playful attitude.This book was provided for review by Penguin Random House through its First to Read Program."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "A Winter ThawAutumn, the first volume in Ali Smith's tetralogy-in-progress, was #2 on my Top Ten list for 2017. At first, reading Winter, its successor (how fast she writes!), I was pretty sure that it would not reach a similar standard; it seemed haphazard and jokey, strung-together rather than composed. And yet my sadness at coming to its end makes me think again. If this is the scherzo of a four-movement symphony, it is one of those movements where the playfulness feeds into a lovely long tune, which is the true point of the composition.[Yet see comment #6.]I think I was influenced by James Wood's extended review in the New Yorker. I recommend it in that it offers an excellent overview of Smith's work to date. However, he focuses on two points that I now think are relatively trivial: the author's use of surreal elements, and her love of puns. As for the surreal, one of the characters imagines for a while that she is being accompanied by the disembodied head of a young child, and another sees a whole section of the Cornish coastline suspended above his head, but these are comparatively minor episodes within the whole. Smith's verbal legerdemain is more of the essence. \"Puns,\" as Wood rightly says, \"are part of the careless abundance of creation, the delicious surplus of life, and, therefore, fundamentally joyful.\" And, despite the bleakness suggested by its title, Winter is indeed a joyous book\u2014a scherzo, as I say. But so much more.A pause to summarize the story. There are essentially only four characters. There are two sisters, both middle-aged: Sophia, a former chain-store magnate, and Iris, her elder sister, an environmental and human-rights activist. There is Sophia's son, Art, who earns money by checking copyrights on websites, but writes a blog entitled \"Art in Nature.\" And then there is Lux, a young woman whom Art hires to pretend to be his ex-girlfriend Charlotte on his Christmas visit home. Much as the arrangement stretches credulity, it leads to moments of great beauty, as Lux proves able to soften Sophia's paranoid defenses, bring about a rapprochement with her estranged sister, and enter into an intimacy with Art that is all the more special for being non-sexual. What seemed at first to be an unduly complicated story, jumping all over the place in time and focus, ends in utter simplicity.Yes, Wood is right about the puns. On the train down, Art uses the word \"idiolect,\" a term that Lux does not know. Later, he applies it to himself, in a very perceptive self-portrait:\nNot an idiot. An idiolect. That\u2019s what he is, a language no one else alive in the world speaks. He is the last living speaker of himself. He\u2019s been too blithe, he\u2019d forgotten for a whole train journey, for almost a whole day, that he himself is dead as a disappeared grammar, a graveyard scatter of phonemes and morphemes.\nBehind the word-play (for everyone in this novel is very, very smart), this is a picture of a man who has forgotten how to feel, even how to live, a man mired in winter. The opening page of the novel, in Art's voice, makes this very clear:\nGod was dead: to begin with.And romance was dead. Chivalry was dead. Poetry, the novel, painting, they were all dead, and art was dead. Literature was dead. The book was dead. [\u2026]\nIt turns out, thought, that this too is a word game; Art is sitting at a computer entering different terms into Google followed by \u201cis d,\" and noting how many come up with \"\u2026is dead\" as the first item. But\u2014and here's the point\u2014this nihilistic cleverness does not go unchallenged. Beyond all the many things in the contemporary world (and the book is very contemporary) that make January 2018 a winter in more senses than one\u2014a general callousness towards the environment, immigrants and refugees, and the retreat from global engagement represented by Trump and Theresa May\u2014there is a much more positive view of the season:\nThat\u2019s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again. An exercise in adapting yourself to whatever frozen or molten state it brings you.\nAnd that, ultimately, is the point of the book.======After Art tells her about his vision of the chunk of cliff hanging over his head, Lux shares her concern with Iris:\nAfter you came out here, when you were asleep. I said, Art is seeing things. And your aunt said, that\u2019s a great description of what art is.\n Another pun, but it points to one of the greatest joys of reading an Ali Smith novel: that its story has a parallel life in its references to art of all kinds, painting, sculpture, and music. And, as was the case with Autumn also, it offers a time-capsule into the cultural world of the sixties, seventies, and eighties. There is even a theme song of sorts, the German folksong \"Muss i denn,\" which Iris and Sophie first heard sneaking out to see GI Blues in 1960, sung by Elvis Presley. Listen to it on YouTube: not only is it a reminder of how young and almost beautiful Elvis was in those days, the tune itself is a ear-worm that sticks with you for the rest of the novel.Among the other songs that are mentioned is \"Mary's Boy Child,\" as sung by the Swedish duo Nina and Fredrik. There is a live studio recording of this from 1958 that I suspect Ali Smith has been watching. For the two are shown, improbably, on an airfield. Perhaps the planes in the background are for passengers, but they look awfully like American bombers. Which provides a segue to Iris's involvement in the Women's Peace Camp, set up in 1981 outside the RAF base at Greeham Common in England, to protest its being used for American cruise missiles. Amazingly, it remained in situ until 2000.I offer three more images without explanation, but as a companion for those that read the novel for themselves. They are only a few examples of the pleasure that is to be had reading with Google Images and YouTube by your side. Even when the references seem random, there is a kind of rightness about them\u2014the simple harmony of a Barbara Hepworth sculpture, for instance\u2014that says more than even Ali Smith's words can. I mentioned my feeling of being swept up in a musical scherzo, but that is only one of the two contrasting tempi of this novel. The other is a quiet continuity that extends beyond the lives of the two generations seen here, and suggests that, however topical its subject, however audacious its political commentary, the heart of the novel is timeless.Ethel Walker: Portrait of Miss Barbara Hepworth (detail)Barbara Hepworth: Two FormsCanada Warbler"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32647049-jennifer", "userReview": "I think this is very, very good and I love it very, very much.

I envision appreciating it more if I reread it once the series is completed.Perhaps Winter suffers in comparison to Autumn for me because there is no rendering of a lively, enticing (real) personage, such as Pauline Doty; though Barbara Hepworth and her art are used as a similar (though not as frequent) device in Winter. Perhaps the fictional Lux was supposed to fill that void, though she didn\u2019t do so for me. More than anything, though, the novel felt a bit too didactic (especially the Christmas dinner conversation of the sisters Iris and Sophia), generally a cardinal sin for a novel. We are taken through July of this year (\u201cChristmas in July\u201d?) so maybe it\u2019s just I feel overly familiar with all that\u2019s happened lately to read of it in a novel. It\u2019s said a novelist needs distance to write of climatic events, but it\u2019s also said that rules are made to be broken. If anyone can get away with breaking the so-called rules of novel-writing, Ali Smith can. I loved the nods to Dickens' A Christmas Carol, so it's an appropriate time to be reading this and many thanks to my good friend Cathrine for my being able to do so. Here\u2019s another bit of enjoyment: In the first pages, I was intrigued at the mention of a postcard of a Boubat photograph, as I felt it had to be the same postcard from Autumn, wondering if it will be a link throughout the series. Now that I\u2019ve just gone back to look for that photograph in Autumn, I'm excited about a mentioned name I\u2019d forgotten (easily enough, as so has another character, or at least he\u2019s almost forgotten).(Also to be enjoyed: the way the spines of Autumn and Winter look next to each other on the shelf.)"}, {"userName": "Eric Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson", "userReview": "Continuing on in her ambitious season-inspired chronicle of our times, Ali Smith opens \u201cWinter\u201d with the statement \u201cGod was dead: to begin with.\u201d She continues on ringing the death bell for everything from modern day conveniences to systems of government to states of being. These pronouncements act like a wry commentary on the uncertainty many people now feel as citizens in a precarious world despite all the apparent advancements of civilization and culture. It\u2019s also a clever play on the opening of Dickens\u2019 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d and his declaration of Marley\u2019s death as a precursor to the chilling introduction of his ghost. Just as Dickens was a fierce critic of social stratification, Ali Smith\u2019s writing critiques the way in which society has become increasingly economically and politically divided. This new novel continues with some of the same themes as \u201cAutumn\u201d, but focuses on a Christmas reunion between a nature blogger named Arthur or \u201cArt\u201d, his mother Sophia who is a successful businesswoman and his estranged aunt Iris who is a political activist.

How much their history matters, both individual and with each other. How they don't always say what they mean but the others see through it. How grumping between two people can easily shift into a shared song, because their history has such a strong pull.And all the wordplay here, almost too much, almost groan-worthy. Art is... dead? Autumn is hailed as \"post-brexit\" but Winter continues in the present day, perhaps more of a retreat to an old country mansion to point out the absurdities that all of us are forced to endure, from parliamentarians barking at female members to Trump declaring the return of Christmas in the middle of summer."}, {"userName": "BrokenTune", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune", "userReview": "God was dead: to begin with.And romance was dead.

No, imagine being haunted (if there were such a thing as being haunted, rather than just neurosis or psychosis) by the ghost (if there were such a thing as ghosts, rather than just imagination) of a flower. Ghosts themselves weren\u2019t dead, not exactly.What a beginning, eh? Much like Autumn, Winter also starts with a version of a Dickens quote. Unlike Autumn, however, Winter seems to follow Dickens' Christmas Carol in other aspects, too. We have a Christmas setting, an apparition of a head that haunts Sophie, one of our characters, and we have scenes switching between the past, present and future. And then of course, we have Lux, also a main character but she acts like one of the Christmas spirits - a catalyst, if you like, that presents all of our main characters with questions that make them reflect on themselves and how they interact with the world around them. Art(hur) is a young man working for a tech firm, hunting down copyright infringements on the internet. He's also a blogger and has a Twitter account with about 6000 followers, but the problem is that nothing he writes about is anything that he really cares about. In short, Art is a representation of the fake.When Art epically falls out with his girlfriend Charlotte before the holidays, he cannot face going home to see his mother for Christmas without the much advertised Charlotte and ends up hiring a girl he meets at a bus stop to pretend to be Charlotte for a few days.What could possibly go wrong?Well, ... There is a Christmas family argument - several actually - which is not helped by Art's aunt Iris also visiting, and she had not been on speaking terms with Art's mother for several years. In fact, it seems that the sisters could not be further apart in any ways imaginable, and both of them are suffering for it.The family get-together is set against the background of Smith's chronicle of 2 or 3 years, and is very much picking up on current affairs and topics and news items that have hit the headlines over that time.I say that Smith created a chronicle because that is the impression I got when reading again about refugees in the Mediterranean, fake news, propaganda, politicians, technology, and narcissism:Me, me, me, Iris says. It\u2019s all your selfish generation can ever talk about. I\u2019m going to tweet about it in a long scroll unrolling itself out of my mouth like in an illustration of a dandy by an eighteenth century satirist. No, I mean like a president. I\u2019ll do it presidentially. I mean a fake president, I\u2019ll do it fake presidentially.Winter is also about hibernation, the forgetting of the who, what, why. The forgetting of history. The questions of whether we need to know where we came from to know who we are and what defines us. Is it background or is it aspiration? Does it matter?And when you\u2019ve done telling them that, she said, tell them what it\u2019s like to come back here, when you\u2019re a citizen of the world who\u2019s been working with all the other citizens of the world, to be told you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere, to hear that the world\u2019s been equated with nowhere by a British Prime Minister.Winter is definitely a story of division, and Smith underlines all of this with factual events and quotes, which makes for depressing, infuriating reading.However, Smith doesn't rant but weaves it all together in the story of her characters, and even attempts to show a way for Art's family to work on bridging that division - not in a happy ever after kind of way as Dickens original story, but in a way that at least creates a platform for communication. It isn\u2019t a good enough answer, that one group of people can be in charge of the destinies of another group of people and choose whether to exclude them or include them. Human beings have to be more ingenious than this, and more generous. We\u2019ve got to come up with a better answer."}, {"userName": "Bianca", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29843800-bianca", "userReview": "I noticed this one on Audible, so I purchased it, despite having wished for it on NetGalley (but who knows if and when I'll hear back from the publishers). Anyway...Winter is the second offering in the SeasonS quartet. As it was the case with Autumn, it's quite interesting, very contemporary and a bit confusing at times. (I'm not 100% sure I understood the symbolism, especially when it came to a child's detached head seen by sixty-something-year-old, Sophia. Was it mental illness, loneliness, dementia? Not sure I elucidated that aspect of the novel, if any of you did, do let me know. I guess it can be interpreted in many ways.)Sophia's son, Art, is a twenty-something, kind of clueless guy who's very contented with himself, one of those people who doesn't stand for anything, he doesn't hate anything, but neither cares or loves anything. He's got a blog, Art in Nature, and works for a copyright company, being paid to dob in copyright infringers he discovers while surfing the internet.His girlfriend, Charlotte leaves him, so in order to avoid explaining to his mother about his now ex-girlfriend, Art hires Lux, a girl he met at a bus stop, to pretend to be his girlfriend. Lux is a very interesting girl, who turns out to be very intelligent, knowledgeable and resourceful. She's Croatian-Canadian, but had to interrupt her studies after running out of money. Thanks to the instability brought on by Brexit, she's unable to find decently paid jobs, so she sleeps wherever she can find shelter, including in libraries or on friends' sofas. Lux challenges the oblivious Art, who despite writing about nature, never goes in nature. Art's nature is all fake. It was obvious in Autumn where Smith stands when it comes to Brexit. It's plenty apparent in this novel as well, although in a more subtle way. Again, Smith brings to our attention another female artist, this time, the sculptor, Barbara Hepworth. While the name was unknown to me, when looking up her sculptures, some looked familiar. There's plenty to analyse and chew on in this novel, despite its small size. It's not perfect, but it's oh so interesting. I'm looking forward to reading Spring.NB: Melody Grove, the narrator of this book was excellent."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Ali Smith wrote this book fast, and I think that is how she intends us to read it, at least at first. We slow down when her images and meanings start to coalesce on the page and we suspect there is much more to this than the twitter-like, depthless sentences that don\u2019t seem like they are adding up to anything. Afterwards, an image emerges. What is more suited to tweeting than a Canada warbler?The story, as such, is that a young man breaks up with his girlfriend Charlotte right before a Christmas he\u2019d wanted to bring her to his mum\u2019s house to introduce her to his mother. He finds a substitute girl, who happens to be waiting at a bus stop, rather than go through the humiliation of saying he no longer had a girlfriend. He pays her\u2014Lux she is called, though he\u2019d never asked\u2014to stay the three days of the holiday.Art grew in the course of this book into a grander vision of himself. He writes about nature, the churn of seasons, in a blog he calls Art in Nature. Though he rarely writes anything political, he is thinking about making his work a little more political, like the \u201cnatural unity in seeming disunity\u201d of snow and wind, \u201cthe give and take of water molecules,\u201d and \u201cthe communal nature of the snowflake.\u201d He, Art, is not dead at all, though he is being crushed by his ex-girlfriend Charlotte on Twitter.Charlotte is pretty clear-eyed:  The people in this country are in furious rages at each other after the last vote, she said, and the government we\u2019ve got has done nothing to assuage it and instead is using people\u2019s rage for its own political expediency. Which is a grand old fascist trick if ever I saw one\u2026the people in power were self-servers who\u2019d no idea about and felt no responsibility towards history\u2026like plastic carrier bags\u2026damaging to the environment for years and years after they\u2019ve outgrown their use. Damage for generations. Plastic carrier bags? This is where Smith shines, making her argument so clear and relatable and yet so absurd. She\u2019s funny. She\u2019s right and wrong at the same time, like most of us. Like Art. Smith draws environmental degradation, suggesting chemical drift in the air can settle like snow, like ash, like slow poison on our lives. She compares the influx of refugees fleeing for their lives in the Mediterranean to exhausted holidaymakers using their friends\u2019 recommendations on the \u2018best places to stay.\u2019Many images float around this book, inviting us to make connections: Iris-eye, art-Art, stone with a hole in it-eye, stone with the weight and curvature of a breast-Mother Nature\u2026once we begin, we start looking for these parallels everywhere. Lux\u2014 she had some kind of luxurious brain, a luxurious education studying what she wanted (like Shakespeare, violin, human nature), and the luxury of floating through the world unencumbered and unafraid.Lux is an out-of-body experience, an angel who appears and disappears; a Canada warbler. Lux is grace. Lux brings the two sisters together and reminds them of their shared history, of love, of the importance of struggling to create bonds. Lux tries to convince Art to stay after the three-day Christmas holiday to talk, late at night, to his mother. At first he refuses, but when Lux says she will help, he looks forward to it.Soph, Art\u2019s mother, is not crazy but prescient, depressed, and old. The word Sophia in ancient Greek and early Christian times meant wisdom, and clever, able, intelligent. Iris, the sister from whom Soph was estranged, is not a religious do-gooder but is targeting critical needs to save what\u2019s best of the human race. She is named for Iris, the Wind-Footed Messenger of the Gods. Her presence signifies hope. Smith is also concerned with truth, and at some point Lux points to the notion that the truth of a thing may be confused with what we believe to be true. Is there objective truth? This question has been argued since time immemorial. It is back with a vengeance, and must be adjudicated daily, moment-by-moment within each of us. Art in Nature continues to exhibit itself throughout the novel: a female British MP is barked at by the grandson of Winston Churchill, who is also an MP. He says it was meant as a friendly greeting, she accepts the non-apology. Smith interprets this incident as snow melting on one side of furrowed ground in slanted winter sun. It turns out the stuff Art writes in his blog material is invented. Lies, one could say, but close enough to real to sound remembered. This novel has a lot to do with art and politics and what the difference is between them.Iris writes  & th diff dear Neph is more betwn artist and politician\u2014endlss enemies coz they both knw THE HUMAN will alwys srface in art no mtter its politics, & THE HUMAN wll hv t be absent or repressed in mst politics no mtter its art x IreAli Smith\u2014and this is only the second novel of hers I have read\u2014seems a skilled interpreter of our lives. She is involved in the struggle, and has enough understanding to recognize #MeToo began with the Access Hollywood tape; the rest, on both sides of the Atlantic and around the globe, is fallout. She doesn\u2019t want us to lose hope, but recognizes the route to betterment is long and arduous, which is why she occasionally blows a Canada warbler off course in the middle of winter to thrill us with what is possible."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "But we were wounded, I was wounded, all the same.

The man who wrote the dictionary. Johnson. Not Boris. The opposite of Boris. A man interested in the meanings of words, not one whose interests leave words meaningless.\u201dIn Autumn, the first part of her seasonal quartet, Smith uses the themes of memory and representation as an undercurrent throughout the whole text (\u201cAnd whoever makes up the story makes up the world, Daniel said. So always try to welcome people into the home of your story. That's my suggestion\"; more on that in my review). In \u201cWinter\u201d, Smith now asks how authentic these memories and representations are: How wide is the gap between art and nature?The basic storyline is simple: Arthur (\u201cArt\u201d) splits up with his girlfriend Charlotte. He had promised his mother Sophia to introduce Charlotte to her over Christmas, and because mother and son have a difficult relationship, he now does not want to discuss the breakup with her. Out of an impulse, he asks Lux whom he coincidentally meets at a bus-stop to join him as \"Charlotte\" when he visits his mother over the holidays \u2013 for 1,000 \u00a3. When they arrive at his mother\u2019s house, they encounter that Sophia is in a terrible physical and psychological state and Lux calls Sophia\u2019s estranged sister Iris to help. The book talks about the developments within and between the four characters and features many flashbacks, foreshadowing and subtle connections to Autumn.Central ideas extrapolate from the fact that Art writes a blog entitled \u201cArt in Nature\u201d, in which he does indeed talk about nature, but, as Lux finds out, many incidents he writes about are made up. And not only that: After their break-up, Charlotte hijacks Art\u2019s blog and twitter and puts out numerous factual errors about natural phenomena to destroy Art\u2019s reputation \u2013 but the number of subscribers rises, and Charlotte\u2019s creation of an alternative nature (yes, that\u2019s the link) has bizarre repercussions in real life (including some heightened degree of fame for Art and monetary gain for Art\u2019s family). As a side note: Ironically, Art\u2019s day job is fighting copyright infringements for a major company, so he pays his rent by defending originality to the advantage of the economically powerful.But not only the making of the present, the memory of the past is also contested: Art hardly knew his step-dad (a gay man who lived a lie) and knows nothing about his biological father; his mother remains lonely in her memories of Art\u2019s father; Sophia and Iris are constantly fighting over what happened in the past and who is to blame for what; Art himself is unsure what happened in his childhood, many of his memories are sketchy. At some point in the novel, Smith refers to the legacy we are all carrying on our shoulders \u2013 in her story, she asks what happens when this legacy contains voids and becomes partly unclear. Her references to Brexit and especially Trump hint at the fact that the history and legacy of nations can also become contested (e.g. the discussion about Civil War monuments), and that there are direct effects for the present. What do these contortions and blank spaces do to our lives, to our nations? In the end, it remains unclear whether the story of Sophia and Art\u2019s father will repeat itself with Lux and Art. And there is one more thing that I like to point out in this context: With both Lux and Charlotte, Art discusses the idea of choice \u2013 when others take decisions that you might perceive as wrong (e.g. regarding the environment, Brexit or familial relations), can you just say \u201cWell, it\u2019s their choice\u201d? When is your choice not to step in the wrong choice? These discussions tie \u201cWinter\u201d closely to Autumn, because both books refer to the question how you write your own (hi)story.I could go on and on about many other hints, symbols and minor plot developments in the story, but then this review would turn into a dissertation-length text (Smith clearly offers enough material to do this). Let me finish by stating that my hope for \u201cSpring\u201d and \u201cSummer\u201d is that those installments will also feature Daniel (one of the main characters in \u201cAutumn\u201d who shows up (sort of) in \u201cWinter\u201d as well), or people who were heavily influenced by Daniel (like some of the protagonists in \u201cWinter\u201d) \u2013 he is the most endearing character of the whole cast, and the way he unleashes the magical forces of art upon the real world is truly powerful. I am sure we will hear more about the connection between art and our lives in the two final parts of Smith\u2019s wonderful seasonal quartet."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "[bring about reconciliation in such a short span of time (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Peter Boyle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle", "userReview": "Another Ali Smith novel, another three star rating for me. And the reason is this: for all the wit and ingenuity I admire in her fiction, it never truly moves me. Her work appeals to my head more than my heart.So this the second instalment of Smith's Seasonal Quartet. Winter: a time to pause and take stock of things. Now in her sixties, Sophia Cleves lives alone in a cavernous Cornwall mansion. All is not entirely well with her - she is barely eating or sleeping and lately she has been seeing visions of a disembodied head. Her son Arthur comes to stay for Christmas. He is unhappy too - he has just broken up with his girlfriend and hires Lux, a girl he meets at a bus stop, to take her place for the visit. And to complete the family reunion, Sophia's estranged sister Iris turns up, bearing a bounteous feast. The pair haven't spoken in years, but maybe this impromptu gathering will kindle a thaw in their simmering rift.The structure of the novel is scattered, like fragments of memory. Sophia thinks back to her childhood, happy recollections of bunking off school to see an Elvis film with Iris. She also remembers how the activism of her older sister divided the family and particularly enraged their conservative father. They are like chalk and cheese, especially in their political views, but also in their personalities: Iris is warm and friendly, while Sophia is guarded and at times caustic. She has more than a hint of Scrooge about her. But it wasn't always this way. She knew love once, with Art's father, however fleeting it was, and recalls her euphoria at their first encounter: \n\"She has met a man who knows about Dante, Blake and Keats, who can speak like words are themselves magic things, and who apologized to her, who sensed that she has feelings and who bowed to them, who has looked at her through holly leaves and described all sorts of things to her, described art, poems, theatre, described the green dress of hope.\"\nThe sprawl of the plot allows Smith to hold forth on many subjects: Art, nature, the sorry state of modern Britain. Once again she wowed me with the size of her brain and her daring narrative acrobatics. But I found the story a little too aimless and unaffecting to fully love."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "That\u2019s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again. An exercise in adapting yourself to whatever frozen or molten state it brings you. \nAh, this is exactly what I warned about in my gushing review of Autumn, a book that spoke to me deeply and particularly: Winter is quite a good book, Ali Smith explores many of the same issues in the same ways as she did in her earlier volume in the Seasonal Series, but without a direct connection to my own idiosyncratic pleasure centers, this one didn't excite me as much. Still a good read from a master of postmodern storytelling:And here instead\u2019s another version of what was happening that morning, as if from a novel in which Sophia is the kind of character she\u2019d choose to be, prefer to be, a character in a much more classic sort of story, perfectly honed and comforting, about how sombre yet bright the major-symphony of winter is and how beautiful everything looks under a high frost, how every grassblade is enhanced and silvered into individual beauty by it, how even the dull tarmac of the roads, the paving under our feet, shines when the weather's been cold enough and how something at the heart of us, at the heart of all our cold and frozen states, melts when we encounter a time of peace on earth, goodwill to all men; a story in which there is no room for severed heads; a work in which Sophia\u2019s perfectly honed minor-symphony modesty and narrative decorum complement the story she\u2019s in with the right kind of quiet wisdom-from-experience ageing-female status, making it a story that\u2019s thoughtful, dignified, conventional in structure thank God, the kind of quality literary fiction where the slow drift of snow across the landscape is merciful, has a perfect muffling decorum of its own, snow falling to whiten, soften, blur and prettify even further a landscape where there are no heads divided from bodies hanging around in the air or anywhere, either new ones, from new atrocities or murders or terrorisms, or old ones, left over from old historic atrocities and murders and terrorisms and bequeathed to the future as if in old French Revolution baskets, their wickerwork brown with the old dried blood, placed on the doorsteps of the neat and central-heating-interactive houses of now with notes tied to the handles saying please look after this head thank you,well, no,thank you,thank you very much.The above (overly long) excerpt was chosen not just for the wintry imagery and the po-mo self-awareness, but also because of the book's recurring theme of recurring atrocities, and the power that the people have in protesting a government that doesn't work for you: whether violently, as in the French Revolution, or nonviolently, as in the Greenham Common protests that Smith asserts changed Britain's nuclear weapons policy. Of course Sophia would rather be a character in a more straightforward type of novel; perhaps something by Dickens \u2013 but despite the midwinter setting, something more A Tale of Two Cities than A Christmas Carol; there will be no ghosts here, but severed heads abound. And as in Autumn, Shakespeare is invoked: I loved the image of Art squirming as Lux summarises the plot of Cymbeline for his family (because, not being familiar with the play himself, he assumed she was making it up), and I snorted when later, Art gives this same summary to a Shakespearean expert and he preens as she admires his insight (and surely this ties back into women artists everywhere and the men who take credit for their work). In a related thread about the recurrence of history and the debt we owe our ancestors, is this bit about a young Croatian-Canadian woman's reaction to seeing her family's genealogy stretching back hundreds of years:\nI was seventeen, walking along a street in Toronto and I stopped and just stood there in the middle of Queen Street because the day went dark all round me even though it was the middle of the day, and I knew for the first time I was, I am, carrying on my head, like a washerwoman or a waterwoman, not just one container or basket, but hundreds of baskets all balanced on each other, full to their tops with bones, high as a skyscraper, and they were so heavy on my head and shoulders that either I was going to have to offload them or they were going to drive me down through the pavement to the ground.\u00a0\nThis all ties in with Brexit and efforts to expel illegal immigrants and aren't we all one family anyway? There are references to Trump, to Teresa May, Syrian refugees, and the Grenfell Tower fire; with an ageing hippy character, we read the voice of protest, but also recognise the subtext of plus \u00e7a change. Just as Autumn explored the art of Pauline Boty, Winter introduces the work of sculptor Barbara Hepworth (with Smith seeming to suggest that her own writing should be seen in the same light as Hepworth's art; as something that \u201cmakes you walk round it, it makes you look through it from different sides, see different things from different positions. It\u2019s also like seeing inside and outside something at once.\u201d) I liked that Art is a writer of terrible blog posts, and I loved that Daniel from Autumn makes an appearance as a younger man. \nThat's life, and time, for you.\nThere's politics, art, feminism, and a traditional plot, but Winter didn't blow me away. (Actually, I'd say that Moshin Hamid handled similar material much more ably in Exit West.) Four stars is a rounding up and I happily await Spring."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert", "userReview": "Honestly did you think I would give less than five stars to an Ali Smith book?Winter is the second part of of Smith's seasonal quartet. As always she stuffs a lot of themes so actually reviewing her books are a bit difficult.As the title states, the book takes place during wintertime, A season where things die. The setting of Winter is during the winter solstice and more specifically, Christmastime, which means that the days are dark. As of the book's writing Britain is in it's Brexit phase and Donald Trump has been elected, it is indeed a dark time. The remaining themes Smith explores in the novel also emphasise that there are dark days ahead. The opening three pages of Winter drive this point in an extreme way.The main theme is family as the focuses on a rather disjointed family coming together for Christmas celebrations. There's Sophie (meaning wisdom) her politically minded sister Iris, Arthur or Art ( as with Autumn art, as in painting, plays a role) who pays a Croatian refugee called Lux (light) to join him and pretend to be his girlfriend (bit of a Buffalo 66 situation there) as the Christmas season unfolds the family start to uncover secrets from the past which unites them and provides them the courage to face the future instead of hiding in their own insecurities.As for other major themes IT plays its part through various episodes. In one scene Sophie is trying to withdraw money for the Christmas meal but she is directed to an ATM. Her son Art is an armchair nature blogger and seek outs copyright fringes as a day job. I think Smith is pointing out that technology is something to hide behind easily and create a shield for our real selves or blocks out the human side of social interaction.As with Autumn Smith mirrors events that happened in the past with current events, thus cementing that history does move in circles, or like the seasons, it moves in cycles. This is done through the character of Iris. In the 70's she protested nuclear weapon manufacturing, which is a problem now with North Korea threatening to nuke the world. Iris' father is a racist and cannot understand why Britain allows immigrants into its country , something which is still topical. Smith ties the 70's and 10's worldviews intelligently.Autumn focused on the Artist Pauline Boty, while in Winther Barbara Hepworth and Ethel Walker are the featured artists. Hepworth's paintings prove to be crucial to the plot development and also serves as a statement that art may not be dead in this dead time but exists in other forms.The person who unites the family is Lux, the Croatian refugee who actually know about British history but does not understand cliches. s her name suggests she is the light, the one who makes the family make peace with each other and this theme of unification and strength for what the future holds is Smith at her most poignant. Indeed Winter is a pessimistic book but it is not a downer. I am sure I have missed out other important themes. After all, one cannot read an Ali Smith once and expect to absorb everything. I mean I am still pondering the symbolism of the floating head (does it tie in with Hepworth's rounded sculptures?) or the floating coastline (the destruction of land?) I don't know but I will say that Winter is an angry (don't worry there's a good amount of funny set pieces and puns) book and while it provides an excellent companion to Autumn, I think it is the stronger book due to Smith's openness on certain topics."}, {"userName": "Trudie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie", "userReview": "* 3.5 *I just read back over my thoughts on  Autumn  to confirm I was indeed more taken with that novel than the subdued admiration I have for  Winter . It's not that this is lacking in all the traits of Ali Smith I have come to admire - wry humour, the exuberant love of words, art, literature, sharp political and contemporary observations, slightly unhinged characters.I read the books in this seasonal quartet much like viewing a work of collage, the text assembled like cutouts from contemporary sources; the Grenfell Tower fire, the far-right crowdfunding an anti-rescue boat, Trumps address to the Scouts of America, mixed in with passages on  Cymbeline , sculptures of Barbara Hepworth, lyrics from \"there was an old lady that swallowed a fly\" and numerous other culture references it is fun to tease out. Then there is the inestimable wordplay. It's all fantastically interesting taken individually, but this time the way it was all pasted together seemed less dazzling.The problem as I see it is the central characters. In  Autumn  the relationship between Daniel and Elizabeth was just so sweet, it provided a warm heart to the novel, and kept me going when the novel flew about in time. In  Winter  we have the elderly sisters Sophia and Iris and Sophia's hapless \"Art in Nature\" writer son, Art. I didn't find much joy in them, they seemed rather more like caricatures to hang insightful riffs from, as opposed to characters I enjoyed spending time with. Which is a shame. Ironically the one character I grew to love the most, was a disembodied, wordless floating head, which I found unaccountable hilarious during the first part of the novel but it then turns to stone and disappears, and with it I think a little of my interest unfortunately.There is little doubt this is an enjoyable stylistic masterpiece and a snapshot of Britain in early 2017 but I thought this was a little  too  much style at the expense of, readability (ducks head from all Ali Smith fans ).However, I am sure I might grow to appreciate this book more upon a reread and especially within the context the completed seasonal quartet."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa", "userReview": "I was chomping at the bit to read this book after having really enjoyed the first in Ali Smith's seasonal quarter Autumn, and had planned it out as my first 2018 read. Unfortunately though, this book didn't quite hit me in the same way that its predecessor did, and it didn't meet the extremely high expectations I had for it (based on the plethora of 5 star reviews from booktubers).I think my main issue with this book was that it was a little more experimental in nature than Autumn. A mysterious disembodied head, a random piece of floating coastline... was there a point to these two elements? If there was, I missed it. And that's okay, they were still entertaining, but I just feel like there was a lot more depth and hidden meaning here that I just fundamentally didn't get.I also found that although there were more characters in Winter, and they were definitely colourful, I didn't really feel like any of them were fully realised. Lex came across as a manic pixie dream girl to me, and I did find my mind wandering during some of the extended conversations between Iris and Sophia.I still enjoyed this book though. Ali Smith's writing is as usual beautiful, and she really knows how to write an opener, that's for sure. Early January was the perfect time to read this, even though it's after Christmas, because the commentary on nature felt like it fit perfectly with these frosty mornings we've been experiencing. And of course I'm excited to see what Spring and Summer have to offer."}, {"userName": "Canadian Reader", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader", "userReview": "I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this second book in Smith\u2019s seasonal quartet. Her earlier volume in the series, AUTUMN, was rich, allusive, and playful, but the parts didn\u2019t cohere. WINTER is a longer book\u2014even the chapters are lengthier\u2014and the parts mostly work together to make it a more satisfying reading experience. The book centres on a family\u2019s Christmas gathering at a large house in Cornwall. Four characters\u2014two of them: estranged sisters in their seventies\u2014are the focus. All are cleverly, symbolically named, and their back stories are fairly well developed. We have chilly, anorexic Sophia Cleves, formerly a self-made, workaholic businesswoman. Living up to her schizophrenic surname, she has mostly split herself off from others (as well as her own emotions) but then, surprisingly, shows herself to be capable of clinging almost as fiercely. There is her colourful, iconoclastic, larger-than-life older sister, Iris, formerly an anti-nuclear demonstrator at Greenham Common, who is now engaged in work associated with migrants. Finally, there is Sophia\u2019s thirty-year-old son, Art, who pretends he\u2019s a nature writer (though he never in fact immerses himself in the natural world) and who regards writing about things he has actually experienced with horror\u2014why, that would be too authentic, too real: where is the Art in that?! When he has a falling out with his girlfriend, he pays a stranger, a young girl named Lux to stand in for her and accompany him to his mother\u2019s house in Cornwall. Once there, Lux (herself a Croatian immigrant and refugee) \u201csheds light\u201d on almost everything that concerns this family\u2014including the current turmoil roiling through Britain and Europe. In the end, I don\u2019t think any of Smith\u2019s characters is terribly credible. It is particularly hard, for example, to imagine Sophia as a spontaneous young woman who once had a lover, the father of her son. However, Smith performs magic here\u2014either that or hypnosis\u2014 because it all seems to work, at least while you\u2019re reading. I accepted the arrangements and the surreal occurrences as a matter of course, as though I was watching a Shakespearean drama (a TEMPEST or a DREAM) unfold. I was willing to suspend my disbelief.I will leave others to discuss the themes and motifs in the novel, except to note that numerous current events are woven in. There are references to uncivil goings-on within British parliament, the shooting of a Labour Party member by a far-right fanatic, and the \u201cAmerican President\u201d\u2014his appearance at a rally and at a boy scouts\u2019 jamboree. Readers of AUTUMN will be delighted to know that WINTER is linked to the previous book and that a picture begins to form of the ways in which all four books might ultimately connect. Winter is cold and dark. Associated with death and the possible aftermath of nuclear war, it is also a season of frosted beauty. What will happen in SPRING when the blanket of snow melts . . ."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "I love Ali Smith, or perhaps the idea of Ali Smith, and the concept of her seasonal quartet which began with Autumn. I was helped by other reviewers to understand the references to Elvis and a pair of obscure Swedish singers. Other reviews have commented on the word play and the surreal or what some might call \u201cmagical realism\u201d in the novel. A reader can enjoy reading (though that doesn\u2019t seem the right word when describing reading this particular novel) Winter for these elements. Others may have discussed the four characters \u2013 Art, his mother Sophie, his aunt Iris, and his pretend girlfriend Lux \u2013 who offer so much to think about. But for me, the power of this novel was its commentary on the current state of the world. This is why Iris was the pivotal character for me in my reading of the book.Iris is a \u201clefty\u201d and feminist. There are short scenes at the Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp in the early 1980\u2019s. This 2013 article from The Guardian describes the important of Greenham Common was that it changed the nature of protest.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2...In my reading of the last 50 pages or so of the book, Smith\u2019s radical message and challenge came through. The absurdity of a bus full of twitchers ( birdwatchers who travel long distances to see a rare bird to add to their lists) chasing a glimpse of the elusive Canada Warbler is contrasted with a newspaper article Art spots someone reading on the Tube. The article describes crowdfunding to send out boats in the Mediterranean to stop Italian rescue boats trying to save the lives of refugees. As an American who works in Washington DC (although not for the federal government) in the Age of Trump, sadly I can imagine that such a thing could happen. I recently heard that the US Border Patrol routinely destroys water left by humanitarian groups in the southwestern desert for lost migrants https://theintercept.com/2018/01/17/u...and in a turn that shouldn\u2019t have surprised me (but it left me shocked) now humanitarians are facing federal criminal charges for leaving water.https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/n...I grew up with a brand of Catholicism that was influenced by the Berrigan brothers, Catholic priests who were sent to federal prisons for burning Draft Board records of young men about to be sent to Vietnam in 1968. The lesson I learned was that breaking the law can be seen as a way to preventing a greater evil. Should the parent who steals food for his/her hungry children be punished? Some, including me, would say no. The Berrigan Brothers and the Women at Greenham Common were people whose actions I would support.Smith provides a juxtaposition of images of twitchers invading the quiet Christmas at Art\u2019s family\u2019s home and the Women\u2019s Peace Camp at Greenham Common. Smith sees a world that is less humane, and truly more absurd in 2017 and she clearly makes this point in the final two pages. This is why I love Ali Smith."}], "description": "The dazzling second novel in Ali Smith's essential Seasonal Quartet \u2014 from the Baileys Prize-winning, Man Booker-shortlisted author of Autumn and How to be both.Winter? Bleak. Frosty wind, earth as iron, water as stone, so the old song goes. The shortest days, the longest nights. The trees are bare and shivering. The summer's leaves? Dead litter. The world shrinks; the sap sinks. But winter makes things visible. And if there's ice, there'll be fire. In Ali Smith's Winter, lifeforce matches up to the toughest of the seasons. In this second novel in her acclaimed Seasonal cycle, the follow-up to her sensational Autumn, Smith's shape-shifting quartet of novels casts a merry eye over a bleak post-truth era with a story rooted in history, memory and warmth, its taproot deep in the evergreens: art, love, laughter.
