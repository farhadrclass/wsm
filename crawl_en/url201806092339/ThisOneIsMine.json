Maria Semple, a former TV writer for shows including Arrested Development and Mad About You, has a flair for humor and quirky use of words. These elements are apparent in This One Is Mine, but the story itself is so loaded with unlikable characters making nonsensical decisions that I read the book with feelings of detachment and apathy.This One Is Mine centers around two lead female characters. Violet, formerly a successful TV writer (hmmm... a stand-in for the author?), is now a stay-at-home mom to a mostly invisible toddler. And what a home! Violet is married to hotshot music executive David Parry, and they live their life in an architecturally significant mansion, with private in-home yoga lessons, cars to die for, and a nanny whom the couple -- despite their self-image as super-PC and sensitive -- refer to by the nickname of LadyGo, due to her rudimentary use of the English language in sentences such as \"Somebody ask and lady go, I'm a friend of the band. Lady who plan the party? Lady go mad.\"Violet may be an at-home mother, but she's rarely at home. She is unhappy, constantly on the verge of tears, and always flying off in pursuit of some activity that involves driving around LA and avoiding sights that might make her cry. Why no one has noticed that she needs therapy and medication, I have no idea. During a random drive through the city, Violet encounters a down-at-heels, dirty, drug-addicted bass player and launches without a second thought into what may be the world's most unlikely and ill-advised affair. Teddy is, to put it mildly, kind of gross, not just physically, but in attitude as well. In their brief early encounters, Teddy manages to use every racial slur possible and engages in incredibly unsexy sex talk -- yet Violet is smitten, to the point of obsession and at risk of throwing away everything else of value in her life.Sally, our other point of focus, is David's younger sister, a single woman in her thirties who desperately wants what Violet seems to have -- a successful husband, a beautiful home, a life of ease and celebrity. Sally latches onto Jeremy White, a sports handicapper on the verge of stardom, seeing him as her golden ticket. As his career rises, Sally willfully (or, you might say, stupidly) overlooks his assortment of quirks and oddities in order to fulfill her dream of the good life. And we're not just talking odd habits. The warning signs around Jeremy are pretty much there for all to see, in gigantic blinking red letters, but Sally's relentless pursuit of her ideal life doesn't allow her to see them.Naturally, nothing works out for anybody. Violet's affair implodes. Sally gets her man, but at what price? The book culminates in a few very unbelievable turn of events, as characters make one stupid decision after another. Coincidences mount, terrible outcomes ensue. The characters learn lessons and become better people for it. Um, really?This One Is Mine is full of unhappy people, who seem to thrust happiness away with both hands as they grab at people and circumstances which can only end up as the worst possible choices. Healthy attitudes and though-processes don't exist in this world. David is actually the only likeable character present, as we get a sense of his compassion, his devotion to both his wife and sister, and his ability to forgive. Other than David, we spend much too much of the book watching unbalanced people make terrible decisions and ruin their own and other people's lives.Where'd You Go, Bernadette had its share of quirky and not-so-likeable people, but they were balanced by the book's satirical tone, as well as by having teen-aged Bee as a relatable point-of-view character. As a reader, I cared about Bee's well-being, and saw the other character's through that lens. Even the most selfish or clueless characters ultimately revealed a deeper core.Not so in This One Is Mine. Neither Violet nor Sally are sympathetic characters, and I couldn't find a point of entry for caring about either of them. The selfishness of their world views, the unending spending, the world of the ultra-rich -- all served to further distance me from the drama. In the end, I found it hard to have patience with the characters or the book as a whole, as reading This One Is Mine largely consists of watching the two main characters selfishly mistreat the people in their lives. The ending was much too neat for my taste, as Violet and Sally end up chastened yet improved by their ordeals, bonding through calamity, and ultimately stronger for it all. None of it worked for me.(View this and other reviews on my blog)"}, {"userName": "HFK", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52263626-hfk", "userReview": "It has been a shitty week. My husband's brother's wife has been diagnosed with cancer, they kept it under the radar until now when it seems she is not gonna make it after suffering severe side effects from the treatment but also due to multiple metastasis. There is two pre-teens about to be motherless. Luckily my friend's mother is doing good with her cancer and with its straining treatment.My mother had a spinal surgery, and as an result she eventually developed a pulmonary embolism, which I managed NOT to notice because I have been so swamped with obligations, work, training, studying and general life of a family with kids that my brain does not function anymore due to exhaustion: fast pulse, shortness of breath while resting and when moving, calf pain, dizziness etc.- yeah, I actually missed THAT despite it to be one of the common complications I am most aware of by practice, and classic case of it, too. I needed me a solid timeout to gather my remaining brain cells, and drop a lot of obligations but also give myself time to relax and do what I most want to do: read a fucking book.What would be a better way to spend a miserable week than to read a book about miserable people? Sign me in as nothing really cheers me up more than to dwell inside a human chaos - a common result among our interactions. This One Is Mine dives right down the business of unhappiness. Or rather finding happiness and yourself in a situation where narrators are, or are heading to, in a place that is deemed as the happiness goal inside modern societies - family, money, husband, wife, children, success etc. But, it is also about women behaving badly (or rather what is deemed as bad behavior, unlikable behavior, selfishness and whatever else you can come up with), doing things that make people feel uncomfortable and questioning, and most likely judgemental, too. Violet is one of the characters who, seemingly, has it all - a kid, a nanny, a husband with tons of money, gorgeous house, intelligence, successful career she left behind. Her marriage is in a rut, and there is no route to communication.Sally is one of the characters who, seemingly, do not have it all and is down of her luck in many ways but has the desire to achieve everything Violet has, and nothing stops her achieving that goal - a rich husband. Teddy is one of the characters who is in the gutter, and there is always a reason why people are in a place like Teddy is. This is one of the harshest facts of life. David is one of the characters who is good person gone rogue - an asshole who treats his wife badly, but does he really do that or is it a case of marriage gone bad for no other reason but lack of communication and missing the connection that once threw him on his knees.When enough is not enough - when what society deems as happiness, having it all, is not what makes you find yourself, nor is it what makes you find your happiness. This setting alone is something that inevitably makes all these characters unlikable, annoying, angering - all the negative things, without much good within. And I like it. Sometimes marriage is not fixed by discussion, by using a shrink or just walking through the bad phase. Sometimes it is irrational behavior, self-sabotaging and selfish acts that brings you over the edge of losing it all. Sometimes this is the only way to save something, sometimes only way to want to go back to something worth of saving for. Or sometimes happiness is opposite of everything a person should, by the acceptable silent rules, want.And surely this triggers a lot of readers who want the world and life to be a neat, rational and logical walk on the sand, but life is a fucking mess. And that imperfect mess is what Maria Semple manages to serve for a dinner tonight.I was not offended by this book (as an Asperger, I did not find the handling of it to be cruel, insensitive or offensive as it de facto presents attitudes that many do have - that is a real life, not an sugarcoated fantasyland) but savored it as a work that brings certain, and quite common, attitudes and beliefs to the surface for us to chew on.I do not think This One Is Mine is far from a real life, not at all. I do not believe it is an over the top characterization of similar people, but it is more in-your-face way of telling a story of people, attitudes, needs, wants and ways they live their lives from a POV that is often neglected by the fear of making your whole book look like a miserable parade of total jerks. Even when those total jerks are real, and far from anomaly - just humans living da everyday life."}, {"userName": "eb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39755-eb", "userReview": "Repellent. Ludicrous plot twists, dreadful writing, and despicable characters--each and every one of whom is so poisonously racist that I can't help but wonder if Semple, like her fictional creations, is less than loving to her own army of immigrant laborers.

She is bored with what her life has become. Once vibrant and full of life (her rock and roll manager husband David used to call her \"Ultra Violet\") Violet is now a stay at home mom. Sure, life is good, she hand-picked the house they live in and money is certainly not an issue, but Violet has lost her zip. Their toddler Dot has become an anchor holding her back from living, and she still has not lost the baby weight around her middle... and possible her thighs... and for sure her rump... and David? Well David is busy being David. Closing deals, running around the country.....So when Violet meets Teddy, small time rock and roller with a bad boy image who seems to take an interest in Violet, she suddenly recalls a bit of her old spark...Then there is Sally, David's sister who is determined to land the perfect husband on her schedule. When her eyes land on Jeremy who she foresees hitting the big time soon, she sets her plan in motion. FAST motion... as in she has given herself a few weeks to meet (yeah, did I mention they had not met yet?), fall in love and get the ring... er, I mean get married.Both women throw caution to the wind and disaster awaits around every corner.So... This One Is Mine. It has been a long long time since I have disliked a book so fully. From the very beginning I found Violet to be spoiled and selfish... yes, I agree her marriage needed work - but she never gave it the opportunity to work. Poor poor Violet *laced with sarcasm*And then there was Sally. Almost more unlikable then Violet. Almost. Depends on the chapter. Selfish and determined to have her way no matter who was in her path. Sally's actions time and again throughout the book were not funny to me, but despicable, horrifying, and just down right gross. There was nothing - NOTHING redeeming about her.... each page made me groan a little more.Now I don't have to like characters to enjoy a book.... but this one left so little to even hope for I just turned page after page hoping there would be something... but in the end, I found nothing. I was reading this at our cabin recently and another girl from my book club was with me... I was about 50 pages in front of her and she kept asking, \"does it get better\".... it did not.My only found in the book was 3/4 of the way through when an event went terribly wrong and by this time my mind was so filled with the sick that was Violet and Sally that I evilly wanted to rejoice.... but then... even that poofed out before I was satisfied.Now I get that this is a harsh review, but it is an honest one. I loathed this book. Now, if you look at Amazon reviews... I am in the minority, others loved this and found it hilarious. I do not get these people. :) Perhaps they were thinking of a different book...Now all that said... this author has a new book out called Where's You Go Bernadette that I have been hearing good things about. I have this one on my shelf and plan to read it soon. A few in the book club have started this one on their own and have said it was good."}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/736024-nic", "userReview": "After enjoying Where'd You Go, Bernadette so much, I decided to try Semple's earlier novel. It may be even more vivid and memorable than Bernadette. It's a strange story of a successful Hollywood couple whose relationship goes off the tracks when Violet becomes a fulltime mom - a role clearly more mundane, isolating and un-creative than people like to admit. Violet starts a relationship with a down-and-out ex-junkie musician that is believable, exhilerating and somewhat outrageous.The parallel story is of Violet's sister-in-law, a diabetic fitness entreprenuer determined to \"marry up\" and out of crippling debt. Some of the most entertaining fiction comes when believable character behave in ways that are hard to believe - making bad decisions that continually shock and delight the reader. This One is Mine is a romp of a study in bad female behavior and I relished its frankness and humor. I wanted these characters to end well, and savored the journey of bad decisions and their consequences. Fun, shocking, but not without heart."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam", "userReview": "A modern day Anna Karenina full of fabulous houses, people and celebrities.

Semple is a former writer of superb t.v. shows such as Mad About You and Arrested Development, so already you know you're in good hands in terms of realistic relationships, smart dialogue, and zany situations (two words: sweat lodge - could not stop laughing!). Done, done, and done. David Parry, a music producer in Los Angeles, at first glance seems like an egotistical, career-driven jerk. Violet Parry, his stay-at-home wife, has help with a nanny and anybody else her husband's millions can buy. Despite being rich and pampered, however, Violet finds that her connection with her husband has grown distant and being a mother to her toddler is not fulfilling enough. In the midst of Violet's existential crisis, she has a chance encounter with alcoholic, down and out musician Teddy Reyes. Their ensuing affair upends everything and everyone in her life. David, Violet, Teddy, and David's sister, Sally, all seem like shallow Hollywood stereotypes - the uncaring husband, the lonely housewife, the bad boy musician, and the Type A bitch. They are all lost in a way in the beginning of the book. Yet to my surprise, as the story progressed and Semple revealed surprising depth and complexity to each of them, I became fully invested in their plight. This is not a shallow book about shallow people - but in the end, a book about how even in our most misguided moments, we still have the ability to find our way to where and with whom we belong. I knew I was in for something different when This One is Mine opened with a poem by Hafiz which is so beautiful that I just have to reproduce it below. The book also ends with a poem, fittingly enough. Someone putYou on a slave blockAnd the unreal boughtYou.Now I keep coming to your ownerSaying,\"This one is mine.\"You often overhear us talkingAnd this can make your heart leapWith excitement.Don't worryI will not let sadnessPossess you.I will gladly borrow all the goldI needTo get youBack."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "My Thoughts:I've decided to change things up a bit with this review. First, I want to say upfront that I thought the writing was wonderful. I think Maria has a real gift and her talent is immense. Please keep that in mind, as I'm sharing my thoughts with you of this one, that I'm not attacking Semple whatsoever! I would read another book written by her in a heartbeat. I just have MAJOR ISSUES with the characters and their behaviors throughout this story. So here it goes-Synopsis from Goodreads:Violet Parry is living the quintessential life of luxury in the Hollywood Hills with David, her rock-and-roll manager husband, and her darling toddler, Dot. She has the perfect life--except that she's deeply unhappy.My take on it: Violet is a spoiled brat who expects everyone else around her to make her happy. She doesn't realize the sacrifices that David has made in order for her to live her swanky life. Also, Dot can speak wayyyy to good for a toddler...sorry!Synopsis from Goodreads:David expects the world of Violet but gives little of himself in return. When she meets Teddy, a roguish small-time bass player, Violet comes alive, and soon she's risking everything for the chance to find herself again.My take on it: David works all of the time trying to keep up with Violet's whims. She wanted to renovate a house, he bought it for her. Whatever she wanted he tried to do. She decided that she hated the grind of writing for television, so David told her that she could quit if she wanted...so she did. Then she finds that she just can't keep herself occupied. She becomes bored until one day she meets loser Teddy. She's attracted to him why?? I don't know why!! That's the question I kept asking myself. From the author's description he comes across as a dark latino that never takes a shower and grooming isn't exactly his forte. Why would she risk her marriage for this recovering drug addict/alcoholic????? This is the part of the book where I found myself getting royally pissed. Would you have unprotected sex with someone who A) is a recovering drug addict and B) who has Hep-C?????????? I wouldn't even have protected sex with them. Even if my entire body was covered in a body condom!! I have a hard time with infidelity and I was in no mood to be giving Violet any passes on her behavior. I could care less if her husband hadn't talked to her in a few days...big deal. You're either in or you're out!Synopsis from Goodreads:Also in the picture are David's hilariously high-strung sister, Sally, on the prowl for a successful husband, and Jeremy, the ESPN sportscaster savant who falls into her trap.My take on it: I wasn't that wild about Sally. She seemed like a major manipulator to me. I felt sorry for Jeremy and recognized early on that he had some issues in regards to dealing with people. But Sally only wants one thing- someone to take care of her and that someone better have money. I just thought she was shallow and therefore I did not like her.Synopsis from Goodreads:For all their recklessness, Violet and Sally will discover that David and Jeremy have a few surprises of their own. THIS ONE IS MINE is a compassionate and wickedly funny satire about our need for more--and the often disastrous choices we make in the name of happiness.My take on it: David is a stand up guy. I liked him and really could understand how driven he was to succeed. He loves his family but at times has a hard time jumping into the mix and just relaxing. I think Violet and David needed to communicate, but instead they seem to have fallen into that \"Hollywood marriage\" thing....you know, have your person call my person sort of relationship. David is a solid person and good thing for Violet that he is this way because through it all he stands beside her. I think she is one lucky fickle wife.Final Thoughts:I'm not going to tell you that I loved this book, but I am glad that I read it because it really did stir up some strong emotions. Just ask my son...he heard me yelling and calling Violet some shady names while I was reading it. I do believe Maria has a great future ahead of her, but I hope her next book's main character isn't someone that I wish to burn for all eternity in a fiery pit of hell!"}, {"userName": "Jim Loter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2436192-jim-loter", "userReview": "Since this book's been out a while I don't think the world needs another recap of the plot. I liked the book a lot. I am rather fascinated, though, by reading other reviews on this site and seeing how many of them contain a variation of \"I know I don't need to 'identify' with or 'like' the characters in a book, but still...\" and then go on to trash the book because of the unlikable characters.I love unlikable characters - or, I should say I love \"broken\" characters, which this book is full of. These people are not evil; they are struggling - struggling to understand themselves, to cope with loneliness, to learn what love really means as an adult, and to find peace in a world that has an extremely thin definition of \"acceptable.\"Each main \"unlikable\" character in the book operates under a crumbling concept of what happiness is, or what the conditions for happiness are: marriage, motherhood, financial success, addiction recovery, predictable routine.... And yet they are still miserable and feel cheated. Each character takes a long and often damaging trip to get through to the other side, which is often not a place they thought it would be. I wonder if people who \"don't like\" the characters in this book (and fault the novel for giving them a space) are reacting that way because they recognize too much of themselves in these troubled people....

Well-written. I read it quickly, and wanted to know what happened with the characters, but I wouldn't totally say it was good. The novelist used to write for TV and some of the scenarios are really funny, and there are many touches of current life that are humorously worked into the plot (for example, Asperger's syndrome, food allergies, tattoos, yoga all play parts in the story). The characters are deeply flawed folks trying to find happiness, but much of the book made me uncomfortable--one climactic scene almost had me throwing the book down--I didn't want something serious/tragic to happen amidst all the nonsense. The whole idea of rich white woman unhappy with life running into arms of the ex-junkie, hep- C positive bass-playing handsome mexican--if its all tongue in cheek, fine, but is it? I wasn't sure- Definitely cringing while laughing. Very HBO/Showtime in terms of the depiction of California/Hollywood life--I enjoyed parts of it while I was reading it, but when I was done I kind of felt like how I feel after reading a tabloid People or Us--kind of nauseous..."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/2.5 StarsViolet Parry is going through a mid-life crisis.

Semple also was a writer on Mad About You, a television show I would rather stick a hot poker in my eye instead of watch. While This One Is Mine didn\u2019t make me want to go to the extremes of blinding myself, I did not much enjoy it. There are humorous moments and I enjoyed the character Teddy. However, the others were so absolutely 100% unlikeable that you can\u2019t hide them under the guise of satire.

David is much admired, successful and driven \u2013 while Violet has given up her career as an Emmy-winning writer after the birth of her daughter, has plunged her entire savings into the house she wanted to refurbish and now feels trapped by her home, motherhood and marriage. Meanwhile, David\u2019s sister Sally lives as a ballet workout trainer, organises children\u2019s parties, struggles with debt and diabetes and is desperately on the lookout for a wealthy husband. Both Violet and Sally will have their entire lives changed by a man. Sally by Jeremy White, the up and coming sports caster, and Violet by a chance meeting with Teddy Reyes; bass player, alcoholic and definitely not financially in her league.I imagine that many people will struggle with this book, as the characters are not immediately sympathetic. David appears brash and insensitive, frankly, Violet seems to have nothing to complain about, and Sally seems so one-minded about marrying a successful man that she comes across as more than a little crazed by material desire and a quest for security regardless of the cost. However, this is a novel which is worth persevering with, as it has so much more depth than first appears to be the case. As Violet falls bewildering in love with Teddy Reyes, she stands on the brink of losing her marriage, family and lifestyle. Sally, meanwhile, plots and plans for Jeremy to propose and give her the success and wealth she craves. The author paints a less than flattering portrait of LA and its citizens, although, of course, beneath the surface people are far more complicated than they first appear. Despite appearances, both David and Jeremy are both more complex and resilient than Violet and Sally realise, and there will be many twists and turns before the end of the book. I began unsure of whether I would enjoy the storyline and characters \u2013 but, by the end, I was sorry to finish. This would be ideal for reading groups, with so much to discuss.

This One is Mine by Maria Semple is not at all the chick lit book I thought it would be. Ms.Semple has previously written for such prestigious television shows such as Arrested Development, Mad About You, and Ellen. Now, if I am being honest, that probably worked against her for me as I did not have a positive view of any of those shows. Nor has that changed. However, the quality of her written word in this novel is impeccable. I can forgive her sitcom indiscretions.This One is Mine is written from the perspective of Violet Parry. She is an intelligent former career woman who has married well and slipped into a life of boredom sprinkled with new age cliche-sauce (yoga & RIE parenting to name a few). She is married to the famous David Parry who is a music manager extraordinaire who proudly earned, \"8 million dollars last year.\" Somewhere along the line Violet loses her way and begins to spiral out of her perfect marriage with the relectunt help of one Teddy Reyes, a bass player with no future and a whole lot of luggage.Ultimately it all comes together nicely at the end of the book. I was expecting some vapid Hollywood BS when I opened this book and was pleased to read such a well written novel. This book has a lot working against it when I opened it.

But naturally all is not what it seems as Violet becomes increasingly depressed and finds solace in a low life ex drug addict named Teddy.Meanwhile, Sally- David's sister, wants to get married and live a rich and fabulous life, something like what Violet has. I love the contract between Sally and Violet, each striving for what they don't have but want. The author is brilliant at criss-crossing the lives of the characters until they are intertwined and unexpected things happen. I was sad to see this end.If you are looking for a modern story set against the backdrop of Los Angeles with tragic and quirky characters, well written and intriguing, this is your book!"}, {"userName": "John Norman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141355-john-norman", "userReview": "I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette? and loved it. So I had to see what else Semple has written.This One is Mine is pretty weak. The characters are shallow (I know, this is arguably the point of the novel) but it is a bad sign when characters have serious diseases (I don't think I'm spoiling it) but you can't really sympathize.But I'll say this:This book should be the poster child for presses not giving up on authors after a weak first novel. Having read this, I would never have expected the explosion, wit, and generosity of Where'd You Go, Bernadette? This novel has some similar obsessions: E.g., architecture, critical junctures in a woman's life, wanting to escape a husband, for better or for worse: But it just doesn't gel. The novel was weak enough that I couldn't finish it with 40 pages to go; but I saved it for a flight and managed to finish it off.The upshot: If you loved Bernadette, you can safely skip this earlier novel.And let us hope that Semple's next one is as great as Bernadette!"}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237104-audrey", "userReview": "Former television sitcom writer Maria Semple offers a witty and wise look at a few individuals struggling with the California dream gone awry. Violet Parry isn\u2019t adjusting well to her positions of stay-at-home Mom and go-to girl for her egocentric husband, a rock-and-roll manager. Having given up a successful career as a television writer, she seems to have lost her way when she meets a scrappy young bass player, Teddy. They have an instant rapport that leads her to pay for an expensive car repair - and much more. Her younger sister-in-law, Sally, has decided she will snag a successful husband and sets her sights on soon-to-be ESPN star Jeremy White.

Semple's dialogue scenes are perfection. She captures emotion like none other, and manages to encapsulate the scope of American culture within that context. Perfect? No. The story was broken into alternating perspectives of two female characters, sisters-in-law. I skipped the story of one of them, except where necessary to get the complete story of the other--that's how unlikable I found one sister, the secondary story. I wonder why Semple put her in a starring role ... and chose the format she did? The story of the three principals--the powerful music manager, his wife, and her junkie lover was riveting.

I found it difficult to relate to or like any of the characters which includes Violet Parry, a wealthy yet self-pitying, former successful TV writer and husband David, a music industry mogul, who has an anger problem and mocks Violet at every turn. His pet name for her used to be \u201cUltra Violet\u201d but she\u2019s a watered down version of her former magnetic self. And then there\u2019s David\u2019s younger sister, Sally who is the least favorable character. Sally is a former ballet dancer who\u2019s only dream now is to land a rich and famous husband. When she meets Jeremy, an up and coming sports announcer, she convinces herself and Jeremy that they\u2019re in love and should be married\u2026immediately. She\u2019s so self-absorbed that she doesn\u2019t realize that he has Autism.One day while spending money on frivolous things, Violet meets a scruffy, starving artist named Teddy who openly admits to having a former drug problem and hepatitis C. Instead of steering clear of him, Violet chases him like Pepe Le Pew, the French skunk from Looney Tunes. It\u2019s obvious to everyone but Violet that her feelings are one-sided. Toward the end of the novel she realizes how wrong she was about Teddy. \u201cDo you realize what you\u2019ve done to me? I grind out my days with husband and child, but by night, I\u2019m yours. I\u2019m yours but you don\u2019t want me. Thanks to you, I\u2019m a ghost, drifting through life, craving something I\u2019ll never taste again\u201d (174). I wanted to shake sense into Violet and scream at her- \u201cIf you\u2019re bored, why not do something useful like write a novel? Or volunteer somewhere? Or spend time with your daughter? Or travel?

And I didn't think I would. I adored Where'd you go Bernadette? and I was kind of looking for the same voice in her debut but was turned off by the beginning. I thought oh jeeze. This is kind of cheesy and racist and snotty but something in the writing- the unique snobbery that Semple nailed brilliantly in Bernadette was still there a little in Violet.Basically it's a tale of the Boo Hoo rich white lady bored in her life as a once writer of television in Hollywood but now is a stay at home mom who is more just stay at home than mom since she shuffles little Dot (i just love that name for the baby) with LadyGo the nanny. Anyway, Violet is married to David Parry, an uberfamous band manager or something like that. They have millions but Violet isn't happy. But there is some saving grace in her eliteness that is splashed on each page. There is some likability and so much humor not unlike Bernadette.  Violet has an affair and David finds out and all the while parallel to Violet's story is Sally's story, David's diabetic sister who marries a guy for money and later finds out he has asbergers. It was definitely candy for my brain and I enjoyed 99% of it.

Neither really works.From a chick lit perspective, what I'm looking for is well...something light and funny. And while I get that the story was *trying* to be funny, it felt like it was trying too hard. The whole thing was written in a very affected way, with character so loathsome it was hard to find the least bit of sympathy for any of them.(SPOILER: The plot revolves around Violet, a stay at home Mom who's farmed out all of her duties to a woman known as LadyGo - yeah, she's not even willing to call the woman who's raising her kid by her real name. Violet is bored and eventually decides to start an affair with an IV drug user who's involved with another woman and doesn't particularly like her. But, hey, she's still determined to have the affair anyway.)So amusing beach read, it isn't.And for something literary, well...I'd expect good solid writing. And the writing in \"This One is Mine\" is both, as mentioned above, very affected and kind of rambly. There are no deep insights (other than that maybe Semple knows some terrible people who she's basing the characters on) and no deeper meaning that I can discern. It's just really bad trash.I'd strongly recommend something else instead. Maybe \"Bridget Jones\"? Or a good romance?

It is the story of a young woman, Violet, married to a very successful man (David), living the life of an induldged \"at-home\" mom. She learns what is important to her after getting involved with a recovering alcoholic/drug addict. I just didn't find anything relatable in the plot at all.

(She gave up her career as a television writer to start a family.) She\u2019s got it all: a successful husband, David, who\u2019s a rock-n-roll manager, a beautiful daughter, financial security, a massive house with staff, and yet she\u2019s miserably unhappy.Then Violet meets Teddy Reyes, a bass player who\u2019s battling his own demons. She becomes immediately infatuated with him, even with all his faults. Teddy is epitome of the-one-to-stay-away-from. He screams DANGER in every possible way. Although Violet isn't oblivious to the warning signs, she just chooses to ignore them. I found myself screaming at Violet \nNO! Don\u2019t do that! What were you thinking?!!\n There were a lot of red flags that she just blatantly ignored. Teddy's past and vices don\u2019t deter Violet, instead it only makes her want to help him in every possible way. (And made me want to smack her.) But he sparks her sexuality in a new and different way and she doesn\u2019t want to lose that. She's looking to find herself and she tries doing so with Teddy as her vessel.Sally, Violet's sister-in-law and David\u2019s sister, has had a rough life. Having been a type-one diabetic since she was three, she\u2019s always had to look to David for financial support and she\u2019s determined to cut that string. Unfortunately for Sally, she has a massive debt thanks to a good-for-nothing ex-boyfriend. Now she\u2019s single, which to Sally is unacceptable and just won\u2019t do. She is on the prowl to find her future, successful husband and only the best will do. Enter Jeremy. He\u2019s basically what Sally is looking for, even with his weird quirks, and the two date and later get married. Sally makes a poor, selfish decision (for all the wrong reasons) and jeopardizes their marriage.Teddy\u2019s presence in Violet\u2019s life brings these characters all together. Everyone\u2019s paths seem to eventually cross and intertwine with Teddy\u2019s. Makes you wonder what if Violet and Teddy never met...? Reading This One is Mine wasn't at all what I had expected from reading the book blurb. This is not your typical novel about an extra marital affair. These are not your run of the mill characters. These characters are gritty, shallow and fun to read. Their lives are like a train wreck; you're afraid to look at the horrific mangled mess but your curiosity gets the best of you and you have to take a peek. I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next, and to see where these character's lives were going to go. I may not have agreed with Violet\u2019s choices but I certainly wanted to know where her two feet were going to land. Violet is one character that I won\u2019t soon forget.Semple has a great ability to take a simple, streamline plot and turn it into an unforgettable story.

The two are at odds through most of the story, each misunderstanding the other and resenting aspects about each other.Violet seemingly has it all. A gorgeous house in the hills above LA; a full-time nanny; and money enough to buy almost everything she desires. So why is she so unhappy, disgruntled, and vulnerable to Teddy Reyes, the somewhat seedy musician who gives her a bit of attention? Is it, perhaps, because her husband is so focused on giving her everything that he doesn't really notice her? Or that he only wants her to listen to him, but fails to reciprocate?What woman wouldn't feel neglected, since women mostly want to be understood? However, for whatever reasons, Violet is unable or unwilling to express her needs.Then we have Sally, whose story alternates with Violet's...She just wants a lot of the same things that Violet already has. A rich husband and enough money, since she's plagued by credit card debt. She is also diabetic, a bit neurotic, and extremely demanding, but hey, what guy wouldn't want her? She manipulates constantly to achieve her goals.David, caught in the middle, seems totally clueless and feels misunderstood and unappreciated. Then, for whatever reason, he seems to get a clue and does an about-face, even though he has discovered his wife's affair. For someone so successful, he seems to have few people skills. Or maybe it's just women he doesn't get.What I most enjoyed about \"This One Is Mine: A Novel\" were the rich details that painted the LA lifestyle in such a way that I could visualize it. I could picture the homes, the clothes, and especially the characters. I liked that none of the characters were picture-perfect. Violet was still a tad overweight from the pregnancy; Sally was thin and could have been attractive, but her personality rendered her tense and almost fake; and Teddy\u2014well, he is portrayed as someone scuzzy and a little bit unclean, which is how I viewed his character.I also liked the part in which Violet and Sally actually begin to talk to one another and clear up some major misunderstandings they have.I didn't really buy David's turnabout, and found it a bit unbelievable, but it did bring the story to a tidy conclusion.This is a book for those who enjoy LA stories, or stories about what is going on behind the perfect fa\u00e7ade that cloaks the rich and famous. I would give it a 4.5, deducting a bit for how the story ended."}], "description": "Violet Parry is living the quintessential life of luxury in the Hollywood Hills with David, her rock-and-roll manager husband, and her darling toddler, Dot.
