One of his books was very popular back in those days, long ago, when I worked in a bookstore. One of the bright lights of Canadian literature, and I'd entirely missed him.And now I can say I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get here. Because this is a very good book indeed.

If You're Going Epistolary, Go Epistolary! -- The immediacy of letters and journals were a high point in A Good Man, so high, in fact, that the decision to leave them behind and enter other modes of narrative kept ripping me out of the world Vanderhaeghe was creating. Let me immerse, Guy. Quit fucking with me.2. Nothing is Terribly Original -- The plot, at least, is like an IKEA instruction sheet. It's a polite, Canadian, Cormac McCarthy where the violence is present but suspended behind a skein of reserve. And though there is one mild surprise, it doesn't effect the familiar trajectory of the tale as I hoped it would. 3. Don't Be So Damn Readable -- I wanted to be mad at Guy and his book, but he is so compelling, so insinuating, so virulent, that he works into my mind like a fever, and I find myself eating through his pages with an ease and passion I usually only feel while making love. Guy, you are a beautiful, talented, bastard.Which leads me to my praise:1.If You're Going Epistolary, Go Epistolary! -- Or instead, maybe you can just throw all convention to the Manitoba / Montana blizzard and do a little bit of everything, messing with tense, perspective, narrative voice and anything else that suits your whims. Pull me out of the narrative, then drag me right back in, just to prove you can. I kneel to your arrogant assurance and skill, Guy. You know what you're doing.2. Nothing is Terribly Original -- But that's the point isn't it, Guy? You aren't trying to reinvent the Western or the love story or the novel of violent men or the Canadian prairie epic or the historical novel. You're just telling a story. A story we all know and love. And you want your readers' expectations to be fulfilled, albeit in beautiful ways. Well ... you succeed. 3. Don't Be So Damn Readable -- Because when you are -- as you are -- I have nothing to complain about, much as I try.I really liked this book, in case you weren't able to tell. And while I think it could be truly great with a few changes, I would also hate to see Guy Vanderhaeghe change a single word. It isn't the most beautiful, transcendant novel, but damn is it a good read. I didn't want it to stop. I loved its strong woman. I loved its tortured protaganist. I loved its troubled sidekick. I loved its fucked up and all too human antagonist. I loved its play with history. I loved that I didn't want it to stop.This book deserves a CBC series, though I doubt it will see production. What a shame."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "Sitting Bull the MysticI love the Western genre and \u201cA Good Man\u201d is a wonderful addition. The story centers on a young man, Wesley Cash, from an upper middle class Canadian family who begins his career as an army officer. He leaves the army due to an undisclosed tragedy (cleared up later in the book) and becomes a Canadian Mountie. When that doesn\u2019t work out quite the way he wanted he decides to move to Montana and become a rancher. In Montana he\u2019s finally able to put down roots. As would be expected in a Western there\u2019s a love story and a bad guy who enact a vengeance plot. The love story is fairly good; the vengeance plot was less successful. What is great beyond all imagining is the unfolding interplay between Canada, the US and the Native Americans on both sides of the border and the dispute about the last remaining parts of the continent that remain unclaimed; the only place the Native Americans can call home. Our hero, Cash, acts as an adviser to three major players in the dispute. The descriptions of the politics and the characters involved are absolutely fascinating. Sitting Bull comes alive in a way I\u2019ve never encountered before. Canada is referred to as the \u2018old lady\u2019s country\u2019 and Sitting Bull is entreated to listen to the grandmother\u2019s words. \u201cA Good Man\u201d is almost worth reading if just for these sections. I could have done without the over the top bad guy.This is the third in a trilogy by Vanderhaeghe but it stood up completely on its own. Based on the descriptions of the other two books I don't see any overlap of characters."}, {"userName": "Eric Wright", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4025401-eric-wright", "userReview": "At the beginning, I had trouble getting into the story. It seemed slow, with long bits of narrative and new characters. However, it quickly captured my interest. The time period, ten years after the US civil war and shortly after the massacre of Custer and his men at Little Big Horn helped to make it a memorable story. The setting in the wild west of Canada and the US, with modern day Alberta and Montana chief places added to the intrigue as did the cast of strange characters, some historical, some original. There is the willful and unpredictable Major Walsh whose sympathies with the Sioux seem destined for tragedy. There is Sioux Chief Sitting Bull and a host of lesser chiefs of his people and other tribes. There are confederate conspirators, Fenian revolutionaries, officers of the North West Mounted Police, American generals, and scheming politicians. But most menacing of all is Michael Dunne, a huge man with a genius for murder and mayhem. The story of Wesley Case and the object of his love, Ada Tarr is woven into this narrative of swirling conflicts and competing characters. Can Wesley shake off the clutch of his wealthy father, escape the terrible memory that haunts him, and win the hand of Ada without falling victim to Dunne\u2019s terrible wrath? Vanderhaeghe\u2019s amazing grasp of the period: Canadian and US history, medicines and products of that era, and Indian culture adds to the experience. The only thing that prevented me giving it a 5 out of 5 was the sometimes overblown narrative."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "A fine-looking western just rode into town from up North, and you\u2019d best take notice if you know what\u2019s good for you. The Canadian writer Guy Vanderhaeghe has been publishing best-sellers and winning national awards for decades, but American readers have mostly shrugged and looked away, despite praise from Annie Proulx, Richard Ford and a posse of reviewers who\u2019ve been trying to scare up a broader audience for this Saskatchewan novelist.His latest, \u201cA Good Man,\u201d concludes a fantastic historical trilogy set on both sides of the long, blurry border that runs between Canada and the United States. Along with its predecessors, \u201cThe Englishman\u2019s Boy\u201d and \u201cThe Last Crossing,\u201d this new novel canters through the Old West, offering a chance to survey our history and our national myths from the more nuanced perspective of our giant, wary neighbor. Rather than a series, these three novels form a triptych about North America in the second half of the 19th century, a vast exploration of the battles, negotiations and migrations that swept up immigrants, Indians and settlers. Each of these three books has its own focus and tone \u2014 you don\u2019t have to read them all or in order \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for strapping historical fiction with morally complicated characters, hitch a ride here.\u201cA Good Man\u201d opens in the wake of Gen. George Custer\u2019s defeat at Little Bighorn, a shocking interruption of the country\u2019s centennial celebration of 1876. The Sioux feel emboldened; the United States is \u201chaving fits of hysterics,\u201d and Canada worries it could become a casualty of America\u2019s redoubled efforts to solve its Indian problem once and for all. (Memories of Washington\u2019s land grab in Mexico are still raw.) The first chapters serve as a kind of Union Station from which plot tracks run off in several directions. It\u2019s a structure that could easily pull a novel apart, dragging us across miles of exposition or leaving us stranded on the rails of some dull subplot. But Vanderhaeghe manages these various story lines with agility, filling in historical detail without losing speed, jumping from one line to another without losing us and finally drawing them all together without losing his credibility.Unless you\u2019re a serious student of U.S.-Canadian history, you\u2019re bound to feel enlightened by this dramatization of long- forgotten tensions involving our two countries. Vanderhaeghe describes brokers who troll through Canadian bars looking for naive young men to serve as substitutes for well-to-do Americans in the Civil War. He uncovers the network of spies that flit back and forth across the border. He shows how deftly \u2014 for a time \u2014 the Sioux manage to play their Canadian hosts against the Americans. And he introduces us to Irish militants who use the United States as a safe haven for attacking the British just over the border.But what makes \u201cA Good Man\u201d so captivating is the way Vanderhaeghe draws us through this complicated puzzle of international and racial conflicts while keeping his story grounded in the intimate lives of ordinary people. His central character and sometimes narrator is Wesley Case, a conscientious young man set on reinventing himself. Haunted by a shameful military error during the Battle of Ridgeway \u2014 an 1866 conflict between Canadian troops and Irish American radicals attempting to invade Canada \u2014 he\u2019s determined to be a good man, to live a life of rectitude and honor at a time when ideas of law and order are still \u201cnotional and shaky.\u201d To start anew, he resigns from the North-West Mounted Police and breaks off contact with his overbearing father, who dreamed of buying him a seat in Canada\u2019s Parliament. Instead, Case intends to \u201croll the dice and become a rancher.\u201dVanderhaeghe knows his way around this tense psychological territory (\u201cThe Last Crossing\u201d featured a similarly tyrannical father), but what\u2019s surprising here is the element of romantic comedy. Case\u2019s struggle to manage 1,000 acres in Northern Montana gradually gives way to a charming love story \u2014 a touch of Jane Austen with Mr. Darcy in a cowboy hat. Despite Case\u2019s determination to smother his remorse in hard work, an unlikely woman in town catches his eye and manages to melt his priggish attitude. If you know the work of the Seattle writer Ivan Doig, you\u2019ll recognize this blend of romance and rectitude set against the crushing labor of ranch life.That courtship gives the novel its warmth, but \u201cThe Good Man\u201d never loses its lightning and thunder. For one thing, there\u2019s a creepy villain slithering through these pages: Michael Dunne, an aggrieved man with a photographic memory, a diagnostic interest in human nature and an unstoppable drive to get what he wants. \u201cHe likens himself to water,\u201d Vanderhaeghe writes. \u201cIt finds a way around every obstacle because it is patient.\u201d From the Civil War to the Indian attacks to the Irish skirmishes, Dunne finds a way to turn every conflict to his deadly advantage. When Case inadvertently crosses him, nothing will satisfy his thirst for revenge.Case, meanwhile, is not as eager to withdraw from politics as he claims. By offering to serve as an informal liaison between Canadian and U.S. officers dealing with the Sioux, he keeps himself at the flash point between the two nations. His Canadian contact is the historical figure Maj. James Morrow Walsh, a North-West Mounted Police officer who befriended Sitting Bull and played a critical role in the country\u2019s Indian relations. Indeed, there are moments when Case\u2019s front-row seat on history seems too improbable, as though he\u2019s both Forrest Gump and George Kennan, offering strategic advice to the Americans, Maj. Walsh and Sitting Bull. And these two larger-than-life figures of the late 19th century come close to wresting the novel away from Vanderhaeghe\u2019s fictional hero. Sitting Bull, exhausted and harried, burdened by responsibility for his ragged people, moves through these pages with melancholy eminence. And Walsh, a man of rash passions and indissoluble loyalties, becomes the novel\u2019s tragic \u201cgood man\u201d \u2014 disgusted by both countries\u2019 treatment of the Indians, but unable, ultimately, to protect them from either government\u2019s genocidal pragmatism. Admittedly, there\u2019s a certain slackening in this final novel of the trilogy, a bulging of the waistline that wasn\u2019t noticeable 15 years ago. Vanderhaeghe has an omnivorous appetite for diversions and tangents that might exhaust some readers, but for that broad storytelling magic that lets you sink into the past and the lives of rich characters, he\u2019s still one of the very best.http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "News of the disaster at Little Bighorn reached the Eastern Seaboard shortly after July 4, and not just any ordinary July 4 but the grand celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Republic. A country feeling its oats, flexing its muscles, vigorous and rich, cocksure and confident, has seen the impossible happen, the unthinkable become fact. Sitting Bull has spoiled their glorious Centennial, pissed on Custer's golden head, the head of a genuine Civil War hero, the head of someone who has recently been touted as a future President of the United States. Somehow a wedding and a funeral got booked for the same hour in the same church.\nThis is the atmosphere in which A Good Man begins: Sitting Bull and his band of Sioux have humiliated the American military and disappeared. At Fort Walsh on the Canadian side of the western border, Wesley Case is waiting for his term with the Northwest Mounted Police to be up (a fact made possible by his estranged and wealthy lumber baron father having bought out his contract with the Mounties) when his commander and old friend, Major Walsh, enlists Case to become his envoy to his American counterpart, Major Ilges of Fort Benton, a hundred and fifty miles to the south in Montana. As Case had decided to become a rancher in the vicinity of Fort Benton, and since he can recognise the importance of smoothing the correspondence between Walsh and the American that he despises, he accepts the challenge. In this way, A Good Man ( and The Englishman's Boy and The Last Crossing before it) does for Canada and the U.S. what Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy did for Mexico and the U.S. -- setting a work of epic sweep on the fluid border between two different countries, two different cultures, at a time when that border doesn't seem written in stone and the Americans can't be trusted to not attempt to move the border as it suits them.When Sitting Bull finally appears on the Canadian side of the \"Medicine Line\" seeking sanctuary, Major Walsh is sympathetic and shows great respect for the Sioux leader who proves himself to be more holy man than warrior. Walsh finds himself under pressure from the Americans to treat Sitting Bull as a dangerous terrorist who is probably hiding out just long enough to rally other tribes to his cause and plan a renewed attack against the States. Despite wanting to help the Sioux, Walsh is under orders from Ottawa to give them nothing, to let them starve (and hopefully go away before the Canadian government is forced to come to a decision about what to do with them). I found the entire thread about Sitting Bull and the other Natives to be compelling and, ultimately, sad -- if the American solution to hunt down the Indians and take their land and move the survivors to Reservations sounds brutal, the Canadian stance of ignoring the problem, refusing to put money into setting up Reservations, had much the same effect (and has led to where we are today, a hundred and fifty years after the treaty process began, and a staggering number of agreements yet to be reached).Wesley Case, through diary entries and the eventual revelation of a written confession of sorts, describes his upbringing and young adulthood in what were then Canada's power centers, Ottawa and Toronto. This civilised and privileged life makes for a nice contrast to the wild frontier existence he encounters later. Especially fascinating is his recounting of the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raids -- the notion of a bunch of kids being led into battle by pompous brats whose Daddies bought their commissions in the Militia, going up against Civil War veterans who are fighting passionately for the cause of an Irish homeland, makes for tense and exciting reading (and also is an interesting contrast to the sympathetic view of the Fenians held by some of the characters in Jane Urquhart's Away). A misjudgement during the battle will haunt Case throughout the book and taint his budding romance with the very strong-minded, very married, Ada Tarr. Another instance of cross border shenanigans is described by the mysterious Michael Dunne; a character who thinks himself more clever than everyone around him but whose low station in life causes him to be used and discarded repeatedly by men of wealth and power. As a young man, Dunne was hired to help the \"crimpers and substitute brokers\" who came up from the States to Toronto -- those looking for volunteers (or at any rate those who could be tricked into volunteering) to take the place of rich Yankees in the Union army during the Civil War. From there, Dunne infiltrated the Fenians, working both sides for his own profit, and after he, too, falls in love with the alluring Mrs. Tarr, a sequence of events is initiated that would make a worthy plot for a Coen Brothers movie a la Fargo.The writing in A Good Man is muscular and masculine, but not in a way that I found off-putting; it is intelligent and literary, but not given to fancy prose. There is also much humour, especially in the character of Joe McMullen -- I laughed out loud at his story of Fancy Charles and the lovely Lurleen. The fact that McMullen made for Fort Whoop-Up when he was injured -- a place I know well from my years of living in Lethbridge, Alberta -- placed the main events of this story firmly within the limits of my own experience, making it feel even more like the story of me and my people. I loved this book -- it made Canadian history come alive, and as anyone who has been half asleep during Canadian History in high school would tell you, that's no small feat."}, {"userName": "Doreen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8083149-doreen", "userReview": "This literary western, longlisted for the 2011 Giller Prize, is set in the late 1870s, primarily between Fort Walsh in the Cypress Hills of southwestern Saskatchewan and Fort Benton in Montana.The protagonist is Wesley Case, a privileged intellectual who seeks to escape the political manipulations of his lumber baron father. After stints as a soldier in Ontario and as a member of the NWMP at Fort Walsh, he decides to take up ranching, purchasing property near Fort Benton. He also becomes a diplomat, serving as an informal ambassador between Major James Walsh, the commander of Fort Walsh, and Major Guido Ilges, the commander of Fort Benton, the nearest American military detachment. Exchange of information between Walsh and Ilges is crucial. Chief Sitting Bull recently decimated General Custer's troops at Little Bighorn, but no one knows what the Sioux will do next. Will they make another attack on Americans? Will they migrate to Canada and, if so, how will the Canadians react?The book is not just about politics; there is also romance and mystery. A love triangle develops between Case; Ada Tarr, an independent-minded widow; and Michael Dunne, a thug-for-hire whom Case encountered in the past during a mysterious event which has left him burdened with guilt.The characters are fully developed. Through flashbacks one learns about the past of most of the characters. As a result, the \"bad guys\" are humanized, and the \"good guys\" are not faultless. There is interplay between personal stories and historical events, the latter explained in terms of how they affect the characters. Both personal and historical dramas are fraught with uncertainty, so suspense is abundant.Canada - U.S. relations are examined from a historical perspective. Tensions exist between the newly formed country of Canada and a post-Civil War U.S. Questions of security taint relationships between the neighbours: the Canadians have experienced Fenian raids originating in the U.S., and the Americans fear further attacks by Indians after regrouping in Canada. Canadian and American attitudes to native people are differentiated, attitudes that are somewhat exemplified by Majors Walsh and Ilges. The Americans favour a genocidal approach while Canadians emphasize peaceful resolution of problems. That is not to say that Canada's treatment is exemplary since tribes are starved into submission!In terms of narrative structure, this novel is strictly conventional, but it possesses a depth and complexity that makes it a very satisfying read. It may lack the experimentation some readers crave, but The Good Man is definitely a good read - this opinion from a reader who prefaced her earlier review of The Sisters Brothers by admitting her dislike of the western genre.Please check out my blog (http://schatjesshelves.blogspot.ca/) and follow me on Twitter (@DCYakabuski)."}, {"userName": "Rhiannon Ryder", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3290187-rhiannon-ryder", "userReview": "Guy Vanderhaeghe is a fellow Saskatchewanite, and long ago when I was attending the University of Saskatchewan, he used to teach a creative writing course. Although I didn't ever take the class (I was a total chicken shit), I did buy his then latest book for my grandpa- The Englishman's boy. He loved it, and after he passed away the book came back to me and has spent the past few years sitting on my shelf waiting for me to get around to reading it.Imagine my surprise when the hype around A Good Man started and I realized that it was the end to a trilogy of frontier books that started with The Englishman's Boy? In A Good Man, Guy Vanderhaeghe weaves the story of the American and Canadian dealings with the Sioux and Sitting Bull, after the battle with Custer at Little Bighorn, together with the fictional story of Wesley Case. An ex-north west mounted policeman, Case has settled down to ranch and is helping American Major Ilges and Canadian Major Walsh communicate about the movements of the Sioux. No small task as the two can barely stand each other and need some major inter-mediating. This was a totally engrossing story with really nicely layered characters and was a fascinating study of several men and one woman, their struggles, their loves, and their disappointments. By weaving together third person narration, and first person letters, you come to know all the players intimately, while getting a sense of how historical moments of significance unfolded around every day people. Likely to appeal as much to the lover of westerns as the lover of literature, or even the lover of history, A Good Man is a story with many levels to it. The art of Guy Vanderhaeghe\u2019s writing is that he excels at them all. Canadian History might have been a boring grade school subject, but A Good Man might just make you want to give it another try.Among many other awards and accolades, Good Man was longlisted for the 2011 Scotiabank Giller Prize."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4751251-geoff", "userReview": "Took me a while to get into this one, but it paid off by the end. It felt slow, and the connections between characters were not always apparent. The trouble to get into it pays off in spades. Vanderhaeghe may write some of the finest Canadian fiction out there, although his interest in the colonial period is certainly not \"Canadian.\" Vanderhaeghe's interest in borders shows repeatedly in this novel, as in many of them. The artificial boundaries that separate states, the enforcement on them, and their impact on the native peoples that had to negotiate the governments on each side. The last chapter was profoundly depressing and the last words were words of joy. Joy punctuates great hardships, a theme in the book. Few complaints here at all, and highly recommended.

The history featured here is of Sitting Bull and the Sioux, and how the Canadians/British and Americans differed (or perhaps did not differ) in their treatment of the First Nations. Readers do not need to know this history going in; all is explained very ably as the story progresses.Meanwhile, Vanderhaeghe's fictional characters are all compelling. Northwest Mounted Policeman Wesley Case begins the book with an extract from his diary, setting the stage and promising the revelation of past secrets. We follow him through his stint at Fort Walsh, his dealings with Major Walsh (an impetuous, generous sort with regard to the First Nations who tells truth to power and whom Wesley feels compelled to keep out of excessive trouble), his adventures as a rancher in Montana and the troubles that ensue when romance starts to brew. Ada Tarr, the object of his affections, is a principled, pragmatic woman who will do what she has to in order to survive. And then there's Michael Dunne, originally hired by Ada's first husband to protect the family from a former client of his (the husband's), who then develops an unrequited crush on her and becomes a dangerously unhinged pursuer.The writing is gorgeous and deserves extended contemplation and reflection. Some passages ought to be read multiple times before continuing. Battle scenes are vividly rendered, without too much gore, just enough to remind you that combat is not pretty. There is also a small dose of bawdy humour in this book, not too surprising given that the setting is the Wild West and it is not entirely civilized.In addition to history, the book deals with morals and feelings of guilt and responsibility. The characters all strive to do what they feel is the right thing: Wesley wants to make it on his own without help from his wealthy father, Major Walsh wants to help the Sioux in spite of what his bosses say, Sitting Bull wants to help his people as well. Which of these, if any, is the titular \"good man\"? Someone asked Vanderhaeghe this question during an interview at the International Festival of Authors, and he said it is up to the reader to decide. Read the characters' stories, consider their situations, and pass your own judgement.Recommended for fans of westerns, historical fiction set in Canada or the United States, and those who enjoyed Vanderhaeghe's other work.This book first came to my attention via Terry Fallis, on his Twitter feed, and was eventually longlisted for the Giller Prize."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4626387-linda", "userReview": "I just can't get over the fact that I refused to read Vanderhaeghe for so long. I don't even remember why now. But I recommend him to anyone who likes a sophisticated author.His Western trilogy (which starts with the Englishman's Boy)isn't really a trilogy in that it does not involve the same characters across a period of time. It IS a trilogy in that it deals with the same section of the country - the American and Canadian West - across a period of time. Occasionally a character will appear in the next book, but only secondary characters, like a bartender. The same town, Fort Benton, is the location for all, however.This book involves a main character who is rich, can't seem to finish anything he starts (don't I know a lot of people like that!), a widow whose marriage had been to a man who basically wanted someone to \"play\" with his 16-year-old daughter and ran from conflict, and a deeply disturbed man who was a spy for the Canadian government in their war against the Fenians who is also quite delusional. Both men are in love with the widow, Ada, but Dunne - the delusional one - has deluded himself that she is in love with him also. When he finds out she is seeing Case, he plans a devious revenge.I always learn something from these books. I am not very familiar with Canadian history of this period. I knew several bands of Native Americans took refuge in Canada during the Indian Wars, but how the Canadians and Americans worked together to solve the \"problem\" of the Indians travelling back and forth between the countries (no Bureau of Immigration then!) was a complete mystery to me. I was also totally astonished to discover that Canada was \"invaded\" between 1860 to 1890 by Fenians (fanatical believers in Irish freedom from Britian) who lived in the U.S. During the Civil War, American \"recruiters\" also went to Canada to recruit men to fight for the North. AND Southerners formed groups that lived in Canada and crossed the border to attempt sabatoge in the North. Of course, now I'll have to do some followup reading on both.As well as the history you learn, Vanderhaeghe's characters are multidimensional. Case, the rich man, has a \"secret\" ib his past which haunts him constantly. Ada is a highly educated woman who reads George Eliot and is basically a feminist in a small town where gossip spreads as easily as butter. Dunne has some real reasons for his suspicious and delusional beliefs. And Vanderhaeghe never quite gives you the ending you think is coming.These are wonderful books and I wish there were going to be more of them dealing with this area of the country and this time period. I guess I can only hope."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17330988-james", "userReview": "The purpose of that thing? ... Joy. Nothing but pure joy.A Good Man transports the reader back to 1876 and the last days of the Wild West: Sitting Bull has defeated General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn, the war against the Plains Indians is rapidly drawing to its bitter and bloody end, Irish revolutionaries have attacked Canada from the USA and agitate for further action. Among this sweep of American history, there is interwoven another more personal story: that of Wesley Case, former Northwest Mounted Police Officer and now would-be cattle rancher, and his romance with Ada Tarr - the former wife of a lawyer in Fort Benton, Montana. With a well-developed and varied cast of characters, including Confederate sympathisers, members of the Fenian Brotherhood, Sioux tribesmen, and the people surrounding Case and Tarr, Vanderhaeghe compellingly weaves history and personal lives together to create a deeply moving novel, thematically focused on the notion of the \"Good Man\".As to whom the title refers, there are many characters whose actions could be deemed \"good\" in some way. Major Walsh struggles in vain to raise awareness of the Sioux's plight in Canada but is undone by his own headstrong nature; Wesley Case aims to do the right thing by Ada and Walsh but he his haunted by actions during the Fenian Raids; Chief Sitting Bull desires only the safety and well-being of his people but cannot withstand the concerted American and Canadian attempts to get him to surrender. All of these characters are burdened by dreams and tragedies, both historic and personal, and it is testimony to Vanderhaeghe's skill as a writer that each one is deeply sympathetic and flawed. As in \nThe Last Crossing\n, he is able to get into each of the character's heads and write each one in a distinctive voice and manner. In A Good Man then, the reader is rewarded with a personal yet sweeping epic that chronicles the end of the West and the birth of Canada as a nation, a novel that is at its heart a love story but in its soul, a mediation on our own actions, their consequences, and what it means to be \"a good man\"."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4721168-shana", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars, very surprising as this isn't at all my usual genre. In this wonderful literary western, \"A Good Man\", Guy Vanderhaeghe intertwines the story of the American and Canadian dealings with the Sioux and Sitting Bull. Starting shortly after the battle with General George Custer at Little Bighorn, you are introduced to the fictional character of Wesley Case. Wesley is an ex-Canadian Mountie who is trying to get away from the clutches of his overbearing and money loving father. Wesley's mother has also recently passed away leaving him with hardly any one whom he can confide in. Wesley goes to Montana where he has settled down to ranch much to the dismay of his father who wants him to get involved in politics. He is also helping American Major Ilges and Canadian Major Walsh converse about the movements of the Sioux. It's a nearly impossible task because the two men can't stand each other. During all this Wesley is trying to deal with the shame that is brought onto him from when he left his career in the military. While in Montana Wesley Case meets Ada Tarr, the wife of a local lawyer and they develop a friendship that grows into love.The most intimidating character of all is Michael Dunne, a huge man with an intellect for murder and chaos. He is also in love with Ada Tarr.There are also other fascinating characters such as confederate conspirators, Fenian revolutionaries, officers of the North West Mounted Police, American generals and as usual crooked politicians. This genre of book is not usually what I'm drawn to, but \"A Good Man\" was a great book. I really enjoyed the main storyline of the two men, one woman, loves and heartbreaks. This book is likely to be loved by lovers of literary novels, westerns or even lovers of historical biographies and historical romances. I was pulled in during the first chapter when Wesley is describing one of the last times he spoke to his mother and how she looked. It was so real and genuine.Highly recommend! 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5981899-yvonne", "userReview": "Guy Vanderhaeghe is a wonderful writer. This is the third of his trilogy set in western Canada, in around 1863 or later. Had to return the book to library so am relying on memory. A Good Man is set after the American Civil War, and just after Sitting Bull beat General Custer at the battle of the Little Big Horn. The North West Mounted Police at forts in Saskatchewan and Alberta are to keep a watch out for the Sioux arriving in Canada. The Sioux are fleeing the Americans who want the Sioux to surrender themselves and go to reservations across the country. The Sioux believe that the Great Grandmother (Queen Victoria) will treat them honestly and with the respect they deserve. The plight of native civilizations, particularly the Sioux, the Nez Perce and less famous tribes are a parallel storyline throughout the book, whose history at the hands of Canadians and Americans is shameful and hideous. Sioux eventually starved to death in Canada and they were left with no choice but to surrender. This once incredible, brave, productive nation, their millions of buffalo slaughtered in a very short time, reduced to begging. With their food source gone, the Sioux, were easier to control. But I digress and am close to a rant. So moving on.The central character is Wesley Case, the son of an Ottawa politician, a man determined to embark on his own course, his own way. He leaves the Mounted Police to become a rancher. He had come to the Mounted Police after being discharged from the army under 'less than honourable circumstances', meaning the general rumour was his father had bought his discharge. Keenly aware of the perceptions about himself, Wesley is determined to work hard, and prove that he can succeed without his father's help or money. Along the way he falls in love and the book actually morphs a bit into a love story and a mystery. But along with that are other amazing characters, and a keen glimpse into life in the Canadian west in the 1860's. A hard, and often dangerous life. Enlightening read and satisfying ending."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3687330-kristin", "userReview": "I put this down. Now that I've read and worshiped The Sisters Brothers by Patrick DeWitt, I'm on the prowl for \"literary westerns\" and winners/runners-up for the same awards that book received or was nominated for, etc. -- some other books along this path have been grand indeed, but this falls in with those that are what I, as a non-old-man, think of as \"regular westerns.\" Maybe The Sisters Brothers is a western for girls, akin to flavored cigars. I don't know. In any case, I felt some of the intriguing and soothing atmosphere of the west of bygone days wafting up from the pages, as with all westerns, but as with all such westerns, that wasn't enough to hold it aloft. There was a lot of extraneous information irrelevant to anything. The setting was vague. Maybe it's because I'm not Canadian, but it's insufficient to just say we're in Ottawa or Toronto. I don't know what that looks like now, much less what it looked like in the 1800s. I imagine it to be fairly foresty, but we're told (kind of?) that it's like a scrubby desert. I'm confused. Also, I don't care about the minuscule details of armies and regiments and generals. I mean, really the minuscule details. Finally, we're told that this is some guy's journal, a \"little book\" he was given. But the actual book is GIANT. It would take like, 900 little journal books for that to be the case. The narrator also wanders and goes nowhere cohesive, and then the guy says something like, it's because I'm just starting a journal, I'm rambling, sorry. Seems like a cop-out on the part of the author to explain away their difficulty in beginning a book. All of that said, I estimate that people who like \"regular westerns\" would probably find this one exceptional. The optimal reader with the best experience reading this book will have a lot of time on their hands, have infinite patience, and enjoy sprawling amounts of disconnected details and wandering stories free from the constraints of plot."}, {"userName": "Virginia Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333268-virginia-campbell", "userReview": "\"A Good Man\" is the finale in Guy Vanderhaeghe's masterful trilogy which began with \"The Englishman's Boy\" and \"The Last Crossing\". The unrest and tensions of the era following the American Civil War are reflected in the inner conflicts of Wesley Case and Michael Dunne, who both love the widow Ada Tarr. After leaving an unsatisfying and unsettling military career, Wesley Case begins life anew in the Great Northwest and finds himself entangled in the clash between the United States Government and the Native Americans. Adding to Wesley's own unresolved issues are his complicated feelings for Ada, and his unease over the dark, disturbing persona of Michael Dunne. I love history, and that is one of the reasons that I have been a lifelong reader of historical romance. I know that some readers state that they want a romance, not a history lesson, but I think the two go hand-in-hand. The setting of the book, the era, culture, social mores, religious beliefs, fashion, art and literature of the times all affect the way the characters would develop as people. Therefore, they are very important elements of the story line details. I appreciate the amount of research and love of subject an author invests into a well-written historical romance. While \"A Good Man\" may be considered by some to be historical fiction with an element of romance, it is a wonderfully told tale with word imagery that is a romance all of its own. I will definitely seek out more beautifully written works by Guy Vanderhaeghe.

This book did not grab me. I could not find a single character that I liked or respected: not Case, not Ada. Most of the supporting characters, and they were numerous, I found despicable. Only towards the end do we get Walsh and Sitting Bull, who resonate with self-knowledge and confidence. The protagonist of a novel, and such an ambitious one, requires traits that the reader can relate to: to be likable, interesting, exciting, intelligent, insightful, etc. Even a villain must be able to appeal in some way to the reader. Without a connection to the characters in some way, a novel cannot succeed. I found neither Case nor Ada attractive or appealing, and certainly their relationship was dry and without an iota of passion. Even after living together, they talked and acted as respectful strangers, without the mention of love or desire...and the reader had to wait for 270 pages for the affair to even begin. Dunne, the villain, a crazy man for whatever reason, added little interest, even at the denouement. So I failed to connect with this novel in a profound way I'm sorry to say. My guess is that Vanderhaeghe struggled with this one and failed to unite it as a work of art. There's a story there, lots of people,action, and history. But I f we don't like the actors, and they are unable to emote passion, then no amount of colorful action and adventure can bring us to our feet."}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "A Good Man is the third and final novel in Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe's trilogy of stories set in the nineteenth century Canadian and American west. It combines fictional characters with real historical figures including Sioux chief Sitting Bull. The novel takes place a decade after the end of the Civil War and shortly after Custer's defeat at Little Bighorn and gives a brilliant portrayal of life at the end of the old west. It is a story of love and revenge, of betrayal and politics, of Fenian incursions and military missteps, of relations between Canada and the US (which seem very similar to those existing to this day), and of the brutal and cruel treatment of the Sioux at the hands of both governments.Although a work of fiction, A Good Man stays very true to the history of the period and gives a beautiful portrayal of life at the end of one of North America's most fascinating periods. The writing is clear and crisp and the characters, both real and fictional, are so well-drawn that the reader can't help but feel involved in their lives whether it is the small details of ranching in Montana or the horrors of battle. Mr Vanderhaeghe has won many awards for his writing and deservedly so. I can honestly say I was completely blown away by this book. It is the kind of novel that raises important moral questions while telling one heck of a good story and leaves the writer thinking about it long after finishing the last sentence."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2855304-jeanette", "userReview": "A Good Man is the final book in the Guy Vanderhaeghe's trilogy about the Fort Walsh area of southern Saskatchewan. The good man is Wesley Case who advises Major Walsh on what is happening in the Fort Benton area of Montana. Walsh asks Case, who had been in the NWMP, to be the intermediary between he and Major Guido Ilges at Fort Benton. Both countries were dealing with the Sioux and were taking a very different approach. Many of the Sioux had moved across the border into Canada where they were treated better and where Chief Sitting Bull is befriended by Walsh. Walsh is a multi-dimensional fully developed character showing his strengths and weaknesses. Michael Dunne has connections to the Irish Fenians and is happy to sell his services.

Each can be read as a stand alone book.A Good Man take you through the life of a man who came from a broken home of priviledged family and his journey did not sound much different from men today who have tried to find their way through life. He has a great perspective of the different cultures between Americans and Canadians along with their politics. I found is manipulation of getting information from both the Canadian and the American military overseers fasinating. Some would call this spying but I don't think it had anything to do with loyality to one country and I will let others come to their own conclusions.Being historical fiction and not having the knowledge of the details around the events of this book has created a curiousity to read the historical accounts.I would recommend this book to anyone, actually all three books."}, {"userName": "Richard Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3501898-richard-thompson", "userReview": "Like Vanderhaeghe's previous two novels, this one is set in southern Alberta and Montana in the late 1800's. This one focuses on Major James Morrow Walsh of the Northwest Mounted Police and his relationship with Sitting Bull in the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.The central character, Wesley Case, is the son of an Ottawa valley lumber baron and political mover and shaker. When, as young militia officer, Case disgraces himself at the Battle of Ridgeway (Through Case's story we learned about a part of Canadian history that we were only vaguely aware of: the Battle of Ridgeway and the Fenian raids.) his father fixes things by sending Case west as a junior member of the NWMP. But Case was friends with Walsh in military college and Walsh is eager to enlist Case as an adviser in the political wrangling that he (Walsh) finds himself in dealing with the Americans over \"the Indian question\".Very compelling writing.

This is Vanderhaeghe's third and last book about the Cypress Hills/Montana area in the late 1870's, after the battle at Little Big Horn and the ensuing uncertainty about Sitting Bull and his intentions. We meet Wesley Case, a Canadian ex-soldier, ex-Northwest Mounted Police, and current Montana rancher at Fort Benton, as he begins his career as a go-between for Major Walsh north of the border and Major Guido Ilges at Fort Benton Montana Territory. Each is approaching the Indian Problem differently and each needs to keep apprised of the others intentions. The 'good man' is many of the characters - Case, Walsh, Ilges, Sitting Bull.
