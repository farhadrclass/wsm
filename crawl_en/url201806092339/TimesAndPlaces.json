What an adventurous and free-spirited woman. Although she grew up in a middle-class mid-western family, she definitely seemed to think the world was her oyster and she made the most of it. Without the aid of the silver spoon, she traveled the world second and third class, but always with style. This chick had pluck - the likes of Kate Hepburn or Beryl Markham. This is the first book of her's I have read, but it has made me want to read the lot, which I believe is considerable. Don't understand why she isn't more well-known. Found she is the mother of Amanda Boxer, the English actress."}, {"userName": "Ellery", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12874933-ellery", "userReview": "Was so excited to read something else by Emily Hahn- but it turns out I already read this under the title \"No Hurry to Get Home\" - good excuse to re-read that one I guess."}], "description": "", "title": "Times And Places", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/999589.Times_And_Places", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336604823l/999589.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/269227.Emily_Hahn", "name": "Emily Hahn"}], "type": ["Biography Memoir", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/999589.Times_And_Places", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560929.No_Hurry_to_Get_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560930.China_to_Me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1019079.Leonardo_da_Vinci", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481750.The_Soong_Sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1019096.Cooking_of_China"]}
