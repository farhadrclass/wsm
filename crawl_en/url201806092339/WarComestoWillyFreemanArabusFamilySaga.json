Imagine having these challenges and making unimaginable decisions to solve these challenges, now at your current age. Picture in your mind, being a scared, lonely, and outcast adolescent at the young age of 13 without any parents to guide you during tough situations. Imagine at first hand, watching your father get killed with your own two eyes. Unimaginable right? Well, it\u2019s not for Willy Freeman. This is the pain and agony that Willy Freeman had to suffer and endure at young age of 13. \u201cWar Comes To Willy Freeman\u201d is a fictional novel written by James Lincoln, and Christopher Collier. It is a novel that will engage you from start to finish. It tells of a 13 year old girl ,Willy Freeman, during the Revolutionary War. This novel can be disheartening to some, but also adventurous, and breathtaking. Willy Freeman was a young girl who witnessed the death of her father during the Revolutionary War in Connecticut. He was killed by the Redcoats. After witnessing her father\u2019s death, and upon her return home, she found that the British had taken her mother captive, as a prisoner in New York City and now she is on a near death mission to find her mother. Willy, disguised as a boy, begins her long search for her mother and luckily finds a safe house at the famous Fraunces Tavern, during her search. But even with the help of Sam Fraunces and her fellow worker, Horace, Willy knows that on her quest, being a black, female, and a free slave, leaves her open to great danger at every turn.This novel has many interesting, and somewhat accurate historical facts, and issues that took place during the Revolutionary War. For example, the role of the Patriot versus the Loyalists, the function of the prison ships in New York Harbor, and the rights of free slaves. It also addresses the relationship between master and slave, black and white, the rights of male versus the rights of females, and the utmost important, good versus evil. A very interesting section in this book explains how Captain Irvers, a slave master, refuses to have the doctor treat Willie\u2019s mother because, he says, \u201cIt's a waste of money.\u201d This is an example to show that the life of a slave during the Revolutionary War had no worth. Willy\u2019s mother eventually dies because her illness was not treated. I most certainly enjoyed the end of the book because Willy won her case for freedom against Captain Ivers. He wanted to put her back into slavery, but he could not because she had her freedom papers, which are legal documents. She showed her freedom papers to her lawyer, and she stated to him, \"I have my freedom papers right here sir.\u201d Willy pulled the document out and gave it to the lawyer. He read them, and stated to the slave owner, \u201cShe's right, you can't put her back into slavery.\" This was one of the highlights in the book.\tOne a scale of 1-5, I rate this book a 3. The content of this book can be seen as brutal because it explains the horrible, oppressive treatment that the slaves endured during the time of the Revolutionary War; therefore, I do not recommend this book to people who are sensitive to this issue. In addition, I should also advise those who are sensitive to the use of racial slurs to be aware that this book uses the derogatory language and slurs that can be offensive, to describe slaves during this time period. This novel is well-written and engaging and depicts the era of the Revolutionary War through the eyes of a young black girl. This novel is also rather sad, and left me in the state of disheartening feelings. I would recommend this book to those who really want to know what life was like as a 13 year old slave during the Revolutionary War, and to those who have a great interest in the Revolutionary War and its effects on a black adolescent during that time. Overall, this book was a great adventure, even though most of the time Willy's life was hard. The ending was the absolute best part and I'm glad I finally read a book with a good ending. This book is a great adventure story and I recommend it to anyone who likes books that are adventurous, dramatic, and compelling."}, {"userName": "Volkert", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8550890-volkert", "userReview": "Despite some unnecessary rough language, and negative portrayal of Christians, this historical novel shows a slice of life during the American Revolution as seen through the eyes of a black girl whose father is killed and whose mother is kidnapped by the British.

Do you? Well let me introduce this chiller book, \" War Comes to Willy Freeman\" to you. To me, this book was very well brutal, a little overated, and dejected ,but overall this book was prime.  This books takes place in the 1700's around the Revolutionary War and in New York. It's importance to the story is how she survived on her own throughout the cold winters, found a place to rest, food, and water while her mother was gone(although Mr. Fraunces took care of her when she was working at the tavern). Willy wanted her mother back, but the British didn't decide if they were going to release the kidnapped when the war is over or keep them and turn them into slaves. So, when we won the victory they decided to realease them. Then, she found her mother back at Captain malignant, women-beater, and inconsiderate Ivers sick and looking to die. Her dad died in a war when she was there with him and when she went back to the tavern she was gone. So a neighbor told her what happened, that the British kidnapped her and told her to get her things and come stay with her. This type of Conflict is person vs. person because she she's trying to fight Captain Ivers about slavery and her mother dying all because he didn't want a doctor there in his house.  I think it was very inconsiderate of captain Ivers to let her mother die like that. For example, in the text it states,\" Uncle Jack shook his head.(and stated)\"Captain Ivers don't want no doctoring for her. He says it's a waste of money.\" I was very outrage at the fact, wait. First of all, how can be so cruel that you can just sit there and let a person die and not even try to help? Second of all, he was being a cheap skate because he has a lot of money talking about it's a waste of money it won't make a difference because he'll make twice the money tomorrow than it will cost to pay for a doctor. Why did he get mad when she smack and scratch him she had a right you just let her mother die I would have did worse? How would he feel if somebody let his mother die? Sometimes we as people have to put ourselves in other people shoes and think about what they're thinking about.  I thought that the ending was a very good part of the book because she won her case on Captain Ivers with the lawyer Mr. Goodrich. He couldn't put her back into slavery and he couldn't put her uncle Jack in jail for hitting him when Captain Ivers hit Willy because she hit Captain Ivers. Although, if I were the author I would have put in the book that she sued him for her Aunt, Cousin Dan, and Uncle Jack's freedom and sued for money. In the book it says,\"I have my freedom papers right her sir. I pulled them out and gave it him. He read the and said, she's right, you can't put her back into slavery.\" So, she free and living with Mr. Fraunces and Horace (her crush).  On a scale from a scale 1-5 I rate this book three because it got boring at some parts and the only way I will rate a book 5 is it has to be on the adroitness and never get boring stay on top at all times. I would recommend this book to My Social Studies teacher Mr.Barth because it's a social studies book and I pretty sure she read it, but just in case she didn't read it yet I recommend this book to her. So, ii hope that you learned that your not the only one that went through the things that Willy went through being a 14 year old girl and having a kidnapped mom and have to go 2 or 3 years without see her, almost having to deal with slavery, and having to deal with a slave owner trying to put you back in slavery and him being your slave master. NEVER BE CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2887923-jason", "userReview": "(Writing Art Book Review)Almost all of the books in world have many different kinds of events in the books. The events in the books are mainly divided by two sections, positive and negative events. The one of the books that contains the one of the negative events is \u201cWar Comes to Willy Freeman\u201d The reason why I am saying this is that you might not want to imagine that you were in middle of the war between America and Britain, and your mom was taken away by British and your father got killed during the battle. But that\u2019s what the main character of \u201cWar Comes to Willy Freeman\u201d experienced. Some books have very positive events to the characters; therefore, some books do not have positive events and have negative events instead and one of them is this book. Uncomfortable, you feel the bad events happening to the main characters in the book. So you also probably not want to imagine being the main character of \u201cWar Comes to Willy Freeman\u201d, but on the other hand, you might want to listen and think it as your own thing. This book will show about how the main character\u2019s determined spirit accomplishes her trial during the American Revolutionary war, 1775.\tThe main character, Wilhelmina Freeman (people call her Willy), a teenage girl but disguised as a boy, loses her father by the war. British soldiers took her mom away to another place. Willy Freeman\u2019s life had changed forever by her father, Jordan Freeman. Willy and her family members were slaves but after her father made the regretful decision to he sign up for the war to fight for America, so their owner gave them freedom. Jordan Freeman, Willy\u2019s father sacrificed himself to get his family out of the slavery by taking extreme risks, and dies as the result. Betsy Freeman, Willy\u2019s mother, was taken away by the British as a prisoner. \tAll of these bad events brought Willy Freeman a lot of themes such as hardship, loneliness and anger. This seems really hard for a teenager girl to conquer this situation. But Willy did not give up on herself even when she was left alone. She did not give up; by begin to make a journey to search for her mother. This shows that she is trying to accomplish her problem with her hard spirit that ready to take risk just like what her father did.\tFew years later, when she finally achieved her goal after her tough journey, she recognized that all of her hard work she had done and her hopes have crumbled to nothing. The reason is that her major goal was to find her mother, she heard that her mom died because of her new master\u2019s unfair behavior. But Willy, stood against the master who actually killed her mother to show the truth, so she can get him arrested. Her Uncle\u2019s friend, a lawyer, helped Willy so she could have succeeded.\tAlthough, the ending was not what the main character expected to be, you might realize that, that is not the whole point of this book. So the actual point of this book was that do not give up easily even if you get a hard problem or trouble and try to conquer the goal. This means that try to use the theme of hardship and determined mind which are the main themes in this book. So this book taught me that if I never give up something easily, then I can win another thing that is more important than what I actually want."}, {"userName": "Xiaojuanwu", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1647219-xiaojuanwu", "userReview": "Imagine you were in American Revolutionary war time, your mom was taken away by British and your father was killed fighting in the war, what would you do now? That was exactly what happened to Willy Freeman in this book. It was uneasy to disguise she was a girl. However, She was a brave and determined girl. As the war happened, she became alone after she came home helping her dad fighting the war and discovered her mother was disappeared. She was scared and confused not knowing what to do, but she was mature that she knew she had to survive and look for her mom. She sailed alone on the sea that her father had a boat left on the beach to New York finding her mother. She wasn't scared even she had caught by the raiders or British during her journey. She was daring that she lied she was a boy in order to escape away to look for her mother. In additon, she was thoughtful that she went to ask for help from her aunt and uncle, which they were slaves of Captain Ivers. Willy had thought about to stay with her aunt and uncle but they couldn't keep her and Willy didn't want to give up searching her mother either. She decided to continue searching her mother no matter what. She didn't care even it was hopeless to find her mother. She was very positive to herslef that her mother was alive. When she got to New York, she met a friendly man Sam Fraunces. He had helped her to get information about her mother. He let Willy work for him in a tavern to earn some money for herslef. Unfortunately, Willy was unfortunate after she found her mother but full of happiness that all slaves were freed. In this book, the character Willy had inspired me. She was a girl who survived from the dangers that she had been through. If I were her, I wouldn't think like her to look for survival for myself. From this book, I learned a lesson from Willy Freeman. Whenever we encounter an obstacle, we need to be brave and persiistent face it until it ends. The further we go through the situation, the more we will feel relived. If we are afraid to face and never want to solve the problem, we are stacking the difficulties more and more every day. They will bother us and make us overwhelmed. At last, I would highly recommend this book who is interested in reading historical books because that is the genre of this book or people who never know anything about American Revolutionary War. After I read this book, I actually had a better view of how struggle people were during the war and how the society was shaped in such choatic. It's hard to live in a society that is having a war and seeing the peopledie or land is colored of blood. When I read this book, I could see how these slave were treated in the past. I feel I'm lucky living in this century. I feel appraciated of everything this world has giving me."}, {"userName": "Julie Decker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker", "userReview": "Willy's father dies, she decides she needs to go look for her mother. With options being very limited for a teenage black girl during the slavery era--even in the free states--Willy chooses to dress as a boy and work in a tavern while researching her mother. But she is being pursued by a man who believes slaves should never be free. . . .The book is fairly well told and the ideas are compelling. The actual storytelling style is a little overly declarative, frequently--we hear about what Willy is doing without staying connected to how she feels about it, so sometimes there's a feeling of just observing what's going on rather than being involved in it. It does a good job highlighting the terrible oppression experienced by someone who lives at the intersection of three rights-limited identities--black, female, and below the age of majority. I was not all that convinced by the fanatical pursuer going after Willy himself."}, {"userName": "Summer C", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51872628-summer-c", "userReview": "I used this as a Literature Circle book during my Revolutionary War unit. The other 2 books used in class were My Brother Sam is Dead and Johnny Tremain. The story is of a young girl (who can pass as a boy - hence Willy) whose father is killed by the British. Her mother is taken away by the British and suddenly Willy is left alone. She travels to Connecticut to see her aunt and uncle and then goes to New York City to find her mother, who she thinks may be on a British prison ship. Willy gets a job at the now historic Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan (open for school trips). The book was quite good and brings in a lot of interesting issues, like Patriot spies in NYC versus the loyalists, the prison ships in NY Harbor and life as a free slave during the war. A few bad words. You should clarify at the beginning that New London is in Connecticut.
