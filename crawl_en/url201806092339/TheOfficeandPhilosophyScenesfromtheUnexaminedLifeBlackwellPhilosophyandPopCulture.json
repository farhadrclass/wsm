I've been working my way through some of the _____ and Philosophy books. This one was particularly good as the philosophical ideas discussed were more relevant to normal, everyday life in the work world. Hmmmm, there's an idea: The Office and Philosophy might be a tad more relevant to an office worker than Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy. Go figure.There's a wide variety of ideas addressed here, logical paradox, Platonic and Aristotelian views of love, business ethics, sexual harassment, affirmative action, and others. You have to be interested in or enjoy The Office to understand the references, so the target audience is limited to fans. But if you are a thinking fan, then this will be an enjoyable book for you."}, {"userName": "Macky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64223577-macky", "userReview": "\"The Office is not a show that will teach you how to confront your own mortality. No show will. Even this chapter won't. At most, philosophy (the discipline) and The Office (the show) might force us to rethink some of our assumptions about human existence. The rest is up to us. You will die. And so will Michael Scott\""}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/850761-trish", "userReview": "Even though I'm only reading articles based on the U.S. version (The British version is on my long list of \"Shows to Watch\"), this is taking forever to get through because I read the essays in short spurts, mostly during lunch breaks at work. Also, I'm a little conscious when I catch myself laughing at the quotes, scenes, and other references. I've never taken a philosophy class so relating broad and, at times, difficult philosophical concepts through the show is extremely helpful in understanding them. Analyses of Michael Scott are the most fascinating because his lack of social awareness and other characteristics (or \"faults\"- depends on how you look at it) provide complicated insights on \"the unexamined life.\""}, {"userName": "Kristiana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163908-kristiana", "userReview": "As part of my continuing quest to add meaning to television shows, I read this book. I skipped over the essays on the British Office because I haven't watched it and it did get a little boring towards the end with discussions on sexual harassment and the like, but overall it was really fun. It seemed like the contributors actually watched the show."}, {"userName": "Renzhong", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9755323-renzhong", "userReview": "The insights of the various authors along with various references to the TV show made it an interesting read, but unfortunately I did not agree with all the arguments and saw flaws in way some were presented."}, {"userName": "Eve Parker", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2274998-eve-parker", "userReview": "The Office is my favorite show so I bought this on a whim.

This book--jammed full of paper--unites philosophy with one of the best shows ever: The Office. Addressing both the current American incarnation and the original British version, The Office and Philosophy brings these two wonders of civilization together for a frolic through the mundane yet curiously edifying worlds of Scranton's Dunder-Mifflin and Slough's Wernham-Hogg. Is Michael Scott in denial about death? Are Pam and Jim ever going to figure things out? Is David Brent an essentialist? Surprisingly, The Office can teach us about the mind, Aristotle, and humiliation. Even more surprisingly, paper companies can allow us to better understand business ethics. Don't believe it? Open this book, and behold its beautiful paper... Join the philosophical fray as we explore the abstract world of philosophy through concrete scenes of the unexamined life in The Office. You may discover that Gareth Keenan is secretly a brilliant logician, that Dwight Schrute is better off deceiving himself, that David Brent is an example of hyperreality, and that Michael Scott is hopelessly lost (but you probably already knew that!).", "title": "The Office and Philosophy: Scenes from the Unexamined Life\n      \n          (Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture #8)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2601194-the-office-and-philosophy", "average": 3.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348365675l/2601194.jpg", "reviews": 10, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/845558.J_Jeremy_Wisnewski", "name": "J.
