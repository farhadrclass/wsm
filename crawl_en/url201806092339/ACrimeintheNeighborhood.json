So far I have read 18 out of the 20 winners and only two disappointed me: Kate Grenvlle's The Idea of Perfection and Zadie Smith's On Beauty. As you can guess A Crime in the Neighborhood is a (1999) Baileys winner.Part Philip Roth and part Harriet the Spy this is an interesting tale disguised as a mystery.It's 1972 and a boy has been murdered. Also there's Watergate and Marsha Eberhardt's parents have split up. In the middle of all this mess a new neighbor moves in and Marsha tries to use her sleuthing skills in order to find out if the neighbor is the murderer.The actual murder is a mcguffin. It's dealt with quickly. A Crime in the Neighborhood is more a commentary on how people react when there is a crime in their vicinity. Gossip, rumors, secrets. In other words this is a tale about suburbia, something which was a common theme in the late 90's and early 00's in both literature (The Virgin Suicides,White Teeth, The Corrections) and in film (the Virgin Suicides,American Beauty,Happiness, Donnie Darko). However due to Marsha's deadpan narrative this novel is not a product of it's time but stands out as deceptively complex coming of age story. Reality and Illusion collide nicely and this makes A Crime in the Neighborood compulsive reading."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7126530-carol", "userReview": "While I was reading this book, I kept having to remind myself that it was a novel and not a true story. Berne drew me right into the story from the get-go, and I had to keep flipping back to the front cover to assure myself of the fact that the book was indeed a novel."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "You know you're getting on a bit when a novel set in the early 1970s can be described as a period piece! This is set in suburban Washington DC in 1972/3 around the time Watergate was developing. It won the Orange prize in 1999 and has been compared to To Kill a Mockingbird and Hitchcock's Rear Window. Don't get either of these comparison's, because in my opinion it is not that good. The story is narrated by nine year old Marsha, looking back as an adult. Marsha, it soon becomes clear is a spectacularly unreliable narrator. Marsha parent's are splitting up because her father has had an affair with one of her aunts; the absent father is a \"presence\" throughout the novel. Marsha's two siblings are older, twins and tease her, so she is very much alone. She also has broken her ankle and so watches events as they unfold.As her father leaves, a new neighbour moves in next door, Mr Green, a single, middle-aged and balding man who Marsha instantly dislikes. Then a child is murdered near the local shopping mall, a child Marsha knows (but dislikes). There follows a description of the tensions in the area, the responses of the local community and the search for the killer. Marsha keeps a diary and puts all the newspaper clippings in it. As time goes on Marsha becomes convinced Mr Green is the killer and she tells the police.Marsha is not at all likeable and feels just a little too knowing for a nine year old at that time. Although the novel is fairly short, I think it would have been better as a short story. the scene setting and feel just don't add enough. There is a general haziness about the whole thing and I am not even sure Marsha was nine; she could have been ten or eleven.Much of the story is based on the cruelty of children, the pervasiveness of rumour and the scapegoating of stereotypes. However, I'm not sure the story went anywhere and it wasn't memorable."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "This book is not only a powerful crime novel, but also a nostalgic trip down memory lane that follows a character coping with the horror that strikes the place they call home."}, {"userName": "Kimba Tichenor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18772957-kimba-tichenor", "userReview": "Perhaps this book deserves a 4. But the many comparisons made to To Kill a Mockingbird meant I had very high expectations for this book, to which it simply did not live up. The book has neither the poignant message of Harper Lee's book nor the same quality of prose. Instead too often it rambles. It is not a bad book, just not the great book I anticipated based on comparisons made."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/906247-jean", "userReview": "A crime in the neighborhood. It's 1972, the year Nixon went to China and the Watergate burlary happened. And in a suburb of Washington, D.C., a 10-year-old boy is molested and killed in the woods behind a mall. The narrator is 10-year-old Marsha Eberhardt. She tells about the spring and summer of 1972, when her father left her mother to run off with her mother's sister, and a Mr. Green moves in across the street. The language is fantastic; I could see and smell and hear the sounds of a summer night and feel along with Marsha the unspoken desires and fears she went through. I was reminded initially of To Kill a Mockingbird, only from the point of view. The rest is unique and wonderful and worth your while. The ending asks more questions than it answers, mostly, \"Why do people do the things they do?\" It's a great novel and I'm not sure why it isn't more famous. I have a feeling I'll be thinking about it a long time."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2454580-anne", "userReview": "From the moment I began reading, I found it hard to put this book down. A compelling story told about a crime committed in a quiet suburban neighborhood in the D.C. area, set during the time of the Watergate scandal.

One of the best novels I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "I was disappointed with this book. It was listed as one of the top 10 crime novels by Kirkus Reviews, so I expected it to be good. It was OK, but not fantastic and the ending was left up in the air. The premise behind this book set in Washington DC in the 1970's is the effect that a murdered twelve-year-old child has on the entire neighbourhood. It was a hot summer in 1972 when young Boyd Ellison went missing. His body was found a day after, and the entire neightbourhood is put on an alert. It's the first time a violent crime has occurred in this quiet suburban neighbourhood. The story is told through the eyes and voice of young Marsha. Marsha is only 9, but she's an observant child, and she takes on a surveillance of her strange new neighbour, and becomes convinced that he was the one who killed Boyd. Marsha and her family are going through some difficulties of their own as their father has just recently left his home and left the area. Marsha's mother is trying to hold what remains of her family together when this crime occurs. Ms. Berne depicts 1970's suburbia very convincingly. It was like going in back in time reading about summer and all the things that occur in neighbourhoods in the summer. Her character development is good as well, but unfortunately I found it difficult to like any of the characters in the book. Even young Marsha's character and her intentions come into question. There is never any resolution to the case, and there is no happy ending to this book. In fact, I felt vaguely depressed when I finished. That is never how I want to feel when I finish a book."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/601557-matthew", "userReview": "What's great about this book is the way it plays around with an unreliable narrator, something that's signalled right at the beginning of the novel. However I think that, although short, the book is too long for the story it contains and has to be padded out. This seems to be a result of the limitations the narrative perspective imposes-- if we can't know any more than the child, and she isn't well informed, then there isn't too much to tell. Also, the Nixon/family breakdown parallels are done in quite an obvious way. Still, good fun to read, and a challenge for the old brain."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1743704-lisa", "userReview": "In the summer of '72, in the D.C. suburbs, 10 year old Marsha tires to make sense of a word that is becoming increasingly uncertain. On a national level, and in her neighborhood, a boy is molested and murdered. Throughout the summer Marsha watches the building hysteria in the neighborhood, and record. There are so many great things about this book that I wish I could rave about it, but it left me lukewarm. What's right with it? The author has a good ear for dialogue. Her character development of both her minor and major characters is excellent, especially in the case of the protagonist's mother,perhaps the most likable character in the book. The story is set in the early '70s in the Washington, D. C. suburb near Bethesda, MD. I spent the latter '70s in the suburbs of D. C., but in Virginia. In truth, I did not even live in the States until the mid '70's. However, from living among Americans abroad, and later, living in the general area Berne is describing, she hits the right tone and paints a vivid setting that captures the era. The main thing that is wrong with the book is it is too long to have a real sock in the jaw impact. Part of that is because of the protagonist. She is an observant child, watching everything in the neighborhood. \"Rear Window\"-like she is rendered partly immobile because of a broken ankle. She spends most of the summer watching and recording the goings on of her neighborhood into her journal. Fine, if this was an interesting child, but she isn't. One blurb compares her to Scout Finch. No way! I think she is more like Frankie from A Member of the Wedding, perhaps one of the most annoying characters in my reading history. Marsha describes herself as a child who was rarely seen, but always on the edge watching any tense or emotional situation. In her home she spends her time eavesdropping, spying on her siblings and searching their rooms. Spying & prying. I can't get over a real dislike for the girl who was not at all interesting, but a creepy, morbid little ghoul. I generally like creepy characters, but this kid is a creepy bore. As for the other children, they aren't much better. Granted Marsha is dealing with some difficult times. First, her father has left her mother, for her mother's younger sister, no less. Mom is trying to figure out how to go it alone, and actually making fine work of it. Her siblings don't care for her and exclude her. Her neighbor who is the closest in age to her is maybe more of a creepy kid than she is. So virtually friendless and dealing with the break-up of her family and a broken ankle, you can have some sympathy for her. Still, when it comes to the heart of the book, I just kept thinking of other authors who have tapped this same well with more chilling impact, Lillian Hellman & Ian McEwan come first to mind."}, {"userName": "Shane Plassenthal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22843686-shane-plassenthal", "userReview": "This is not a mystery novel. It is not a crime novel. Instead, it is a moving drama filled with much angst, beautiful and evocative writing. Berne's novel, while light on the suspense and mystery, is instead a portrait of what happens when a family falls apart and it's repercussions upon the children. A complex tale of the danger a rumor can have and the willingness of society to persecute the wrong person. The period is brought to life with Berne's descriptions. Anyone in the market for a smooth, dark and meaningful tale should read this book.Not to be missed!"}, {"userName": "Yogesh Sharma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55022896-yogesh-sharma", "userReview": "I got recommendation of this book as one of the all time top 10 crime fiction novels.

I get that the slow monotony of the summer had a lot to do with the boredom and restlessness and maybe even unknowing dwelling on the father's absence which ultimately led to Marsha's actions but it was just too drawn out.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. This book perfectly describes a suburban summer in the 1970s when - after a mind-boggling crime has been committed, and after the child protagonist's father has run off with her mother's sister - reality is out of order, and all the normal rules and conventions seem to have been suspended. Every little detail is suddenly overcharged with potential symbolism. Even the tiniest random occurrence could be a sign, or a solution. But life isn't that easy or straightforward, and with the characters of the mother and daughter temporarily by themselves in the house and at such odds, I found myself at a loss because it was impossible to take sides. Of course we are presented a subjective point of view and an ordering and weighting of events that goes with it - but I'm probably closer to the mother's age now (and probably even older), and I do get this other perspective. Anyway, I enjoyed the writing a lot. The scene about the children and the praying mantis is somehow a central event in this book for me, and I'll probably remember it from time to time. [No spoilers] Stomach heaving, I drew closer and stared, wanting to get even closer, to peer right into those alien eyes. What I felt, as I stared at that mutilated insect, wasn't pity; it was closer to a lost word between revulsion and desire. I wanted to put the praying mantis into my mouth. (p. 116) There was only one passage that I resented, quite early on in the book, that suggested, quite explicitly, that the boy who was raped and murdered might have \"asked for it\". And no. I disagree strongly, whatever the circumstances. Nobody is ever \"asking for it\", no matter what they wear, no matter how they behave. The blame is all on the aggressor's side.

The characters of the narrator and her mother are interesting; the characters of her siblings the supporting characters are not very interesting. I started out liking the book a lot but it started to fizzle for me about halfway through. There was a rather mundane resolution to most of the conflicts. I wish I could have found out more about the mother and their relationship. Being that it was written In the perspective of a child, that wasn\u2019t really possible.Despite all that, I have to admit that the story and the book have been staying in my mind a lot, even several days after finishing it. What happens to the suspected antagonist in the story is tragic, and there is an element of crime clearly connected to one child in the story if one looks at it through a trauma-informed perspective that is not noticed by the adults in the book or recognized for what it is.
