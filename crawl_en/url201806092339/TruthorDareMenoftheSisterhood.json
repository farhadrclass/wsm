The guys are hitting their stride and getting in the nitty gritty. When the villains are involved in child trafficking the men don't hold back on their revenge.New friends are made, a new mission going forward is decided and they have found their own peace when it comes to what they do.Of course you cannot leave out Cyrus or Lady and her pups. They have their own roles to follow.

Three children are found in an isolated area. Joe Espinosa picks them up and arranges a meeting with the rest of the crew. In an effort to protect children that are victims of human trafficking the team must be one step ahead of the organization. It was a little difficult to follow all of the characters and I thought the book was slow moving. I received an advanced copy of this book from Goodreads Giveaways for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17385248-jeanne", "userReview": "I have to say at times I wonder why Fern Michaels continues some of her series as they seem to falter . . . this is NOT one of those times!

Then after the pardon, it switched to the older ladies, and retired men. I read a few of those. This was the guys, and Maggie, and the wonder dogs. The theme was a worthy read, about child trafficking. The statistics were horrific. This in intolerable for everyone, that so many children, and young teens disappear from our country, for a very short life, and a terrible existence. These people from kidnappers, to the man at the top, should be publicly executed. I gave this a 3 .5 It got off track at times into unrealistic story telling. I love dogs, and they can be warriors, but controlling your actions, and thoughts? I felt that distracted from the serious nature of the book."}, {"userName": "Heather Warner", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70896861-heather-warner", "userReview": "I won this book in a giveaway on Goodreads and thought it was a decent book. It had a good story/mystery/adventure that I enjoyed. I found it difficult though to follow all the different characters-I think reading the previous books in the Men of the Sisterhood series is very necessary to really get the full understanding of these characters. I liked the psychic dogs and will have to read the previous books to get the full story on them! A hard topic on the trafficking of children handled very well, excellent ending and closure for characters. All in all-a good book I would recommend with the caveat of strongly recommending reading the rest of the series first!"}, {"userName": "BookGypsy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76392189-bookgypsy", "userReview": "This is The Men of the Sisterhood series.

Now their male allies, the Men of the Sisterhood, have formed a top-secret organization of their own, with the same goal of helping the helpless and righting the wrongs of the world . . .\n \n When the call comes, the Men of the Sisterhood drop everything to help their friends. This time it's Cyrus, their four-legged hound dog and unofficial mascot. While member Joe Espinosa is driving along an isolated country road with Cyrus in tow, he catches a glimpse of movement in the woods bordering the road and notes Cyrus pawing desperately at the car window. As soon as he pulls over to investigate, Cyrus bolts out the door and leads Joe to three children clustered together--bedraggled, silent, and scared out of their wits. As soon as he has brought the children to safety, Espinosa arranges an urgent meeting.\n \n Charles, Abner, Jack, Dennis, Harry and the rest of the crew gather at BOLO headquarters to hear a shocking story that confirms their worst suspicions. Many more children are still in danger. But in order to protect and avenge the victims, the team must use more cunning than ever before. With so many vulnerable young lives at stake, one mistake would be too many . . .  Praise for Fern Michaels \"The Men of the Sisterhood series has it all . . .
