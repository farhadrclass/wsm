As Blah tries to figure out what to do, Identity takes the first steps toward a holocaust of epic proportions. Can the Dystopian Duo evade the scores of bounty hunters, the Law, and the Papanazi on their trail and continue their holocaustic ways?Dr. Identity is forty-seven kinds of f*cked up and thirty-one flavors of awesome. You know how people describe something as something on steroids in order to denote magnitude? I hate when they do that. Dr. Identity is Snow Crash with a jetpack on its back, absurdism turned up to 111, crack igniting its bloodstream, and a steady stream of severed and mangled limbs trailing in its wake.D. Harlan Wilson protrays a dystopian world of useless academics, trends that move at light speed, and a mass-media even more brainless than they currently are. Dr. Identity acts as the raging Id of Dr. Blah Blah Blah's repressed ego, taking him on an odyssey of ultraviolence.I can't hope to mention all of the things I loved about this book. I caught references to a lot of favorites, like Neuromancer, Snow Crash, the Hyperion Cantos, and all sorts of comics and movies. I loved that the Bobafett model of jetpack was the best on the market, that Bug Eyed Monsters attacked people who spent two much time shopping in Littleoldladyville, and that Dr. Blah Blah Blah read a Hardy Boys novel while Dr. Identity was murdering one of his student-things. Funny how both of my two most recent Bizarro reads mentioned The Hardy Boys. I loved how the congressmen said \"Bring it on\" or \"Horseshit\" rather than \"Yay\" or \"Nay.\"That's about all. I'm drawing a blank on what to say next. Suffice to say, Dr. Identity is one hell of a Bizarro thrill ride and should appeal to fans of Philip K. Dick, cyberpunk, and distopia.

The following review is an email I sent to D. Harlan Wilson shortly after I finished reading the book.]I finished reading your book last night. It\u2019s bizarre. It defies explanation. It will scare people away [...] and nobody will know what to do with it. This is a good sign. Things that are easily categorized are easily forgotten, so people who read this will have no choice but to assimilate its memory into their subconscious and somehow live with the consequences. I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s a great trip. My heart was pounding after I read it.\u201cDr. Identity\u201d seized me by the neck, slapped me a dozen times and fucked me up the asshole while it recited Vogon poetry with the voice and eloquence of the Cheshire Cat singing Jabberwocky. The experience was suffocating, painful, guiltily pleasurable and at the same time suicide-inducing and melodiously gorgeous (in that order).There is no back story. Little world building. No gradual process to bring the reader into this world. No explanation of why the world is the way it is. No inclination even if this world is supposed to be seen as a real place, a real future, a distorted view of the present, or even anything at all. It forced me to look in the chaos and energy of the events for something to ground my sanity, instead of relying on character development and back story.You have written a living, breathing, surreal monster of nonsense that the brain will struggle to organize. The brain hates chaos, and it will look for patterns in the chaos so it doesn\u2019t get caught in an infinite loop. Because of this tendency of my brain, I got the feeling that I knew exactly what was going on. Somewhere in the chaos and raw energy there seemed to be purpose to the events. On the edge of comprehension, maybe inside a node of my reptilian-derived brain structure that even Freud did not imagine was there, the mechanics, dynamics and hyperphallics of this world *made sense.*I enjoyed reading it. The energy it contains is incredible and the ending feels appropriate. The hopelessness, mindlessness and total chaos of life in Bliptown...it\u2019s enough to make anyone insane. It\u2019s funny in a very dark kind of way. I loved chapter one, the lecture scene (damn student-things!). The lobster was great, too. The childproofed dragon vehicle that shot Spaghetti-O\u2019s made me laugh, and the newscast was perfect. The questions he asks Dr. Blah's wife-thing all in one breath are exactly the kinds of questions I've come to expect from reporters! And don\u2019t forget the politician scenes haha. Then there\u2019s the schizoverse sequence. It\u2019s downright interesting to read about a place where people\u2019s animal nature is blatantly out in the open and anything goes. Can\u2019t quite put my finger on why it\u2019s there, but it fits in...somehow.I\u2019m trying to take the book\u2019s advice and judge it on the surface. But since my brain is too weak to handle chaos without order, it seems to have sorted it into something like: this is a vision of the future wherein the world has descended into mindless consumerism. This has robbed people of any sort of purpose for living, except to stay alive to keep working in their pointless jobs so they can keep their bank accounts full so they can buy more and stay alive so they can keep working... Life has no meaning anymore. Pleasures of the flesh and even pleasures of the mind have become irrelevant. Because of this, there\u2019s no value on life in this world. No sense of right or wrong, and without it no line between logic and reality. All that\u2019s left is media, advertising, consumption, violence, and sex--surrogates for real meaning in life. (And yet, society hasn\u2019t stopped functioning even though it\u2019s going nowhere and existing for no reason. It just muddles on and on, like it always has.) To combat this purposeless existence, people employ robots to face it for them, so the real people can hide in even more consumerism or lusts of the flesh. Our main character\u2019s two halves (representing his Id and his Ego) react differently to this kind of world. The Ego, the part that represents higher-minded desires, seems crushed by it. He doesn\u2019t know how to survive where there is no sense, leaving the Id--his deepest, inmost animal desires--to survive for him. But even Dr. Identity is defeated by this world of fickle, media-focused consumerism, advertising and disregard for life itself. This is a society that has crushed both sides of the human mind (higher reason and animal pleasures) leaving nothing to live for but the chaos of media and fads. And in the end, all they can do is be assimilated by it. So if life comes to a point where it means nothing, does reality mean nothing? But instead of asking this question (or making it the moral of the story), the book shoves this chaotic society up our asses and forces us to smile for the camera. Or perhaps this is a distorted vision of the present...?There\u2019s so much going on that maybe it doesn\u2019t have one particular interpretation, if any at all. For all I know the book may be just a random, sanity-bending stream of consciousness onto which I\u2019m projecting some kind of meaning. Although I\u2019m confident about Dr. Blah as the Ego and Dr. Identity as the Id, and the effect this kind of society has on them. I dunno.The great part about this book is that I don\u2019t *have* to understand it. I kept reading because of that nagging feeling in the back of my head that somewhere deep down I sensed that I understood everything that was going on. But it\u2019s like trying to see a tree in twilight. You can look at it from many different angles and it seems to change shape every time. It\u2019s changed my reality. I like having my reality changed. It gives life meaning.Although honestly I don\u2019t know if I would have made it to the end unless I had read your short stories as a prerequisite. I remember that I tried to read a book called Flow My Tears The Policeman Said, by Philip K. Dick. I made it about halfway before I gave up because there was no world building, nothing made sense, and the characters were shallow and pointless. \u201cDr. Identity\u201d feels deeper than that book ever did, but I\u2019m glad I was prepared for it.And it\u2019s definitely not an Oprah book :-)I hope this is somehow useful to you.

The book is set in a city of the future where trends come and go at the speed that it takes a bullet to leave a gun. It's the sort of place where the box set for a season of a television show would be released a minute after the first episode is finished broadcasting. And most of the inhabitants are disguised as someone or something else.I can't recall a book (or movie for that matter) more violent than this one. It puts the kill count of any Arnold Schwarzenegger movie to shame. But the violence is cartoonish rather than disturbing.Most of the book is a chase sequence with the occasional pit stop. Dr. Blah Blah Blah is a hesitant Mallory Knox to his Mickey - Dr. Identity, his android simulacrum who teaches is literature classes when he's not feeling up to it and has been programmed with the balls to do everything that Blah feels the urge to do but never does because of his inhibitions. In this case, it's all about murdering the people who get on his nerves. Dr. Blah must be very easily annoyed.Pursued by the Papanazi, a group of maniacal photographers competing to give the public what they most desire - snapshots of the \"Dystopian Duo\" in action, the two criminal take us on a whirlwind tour of the city, a locale that throws science fiction, fantasy, and surrealism into a blender and mixes them into a hangover cure where anything can happen after you take your first sip."}, {"userName": "Jeremy Maddux", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302917-jeremy-maddux", "userReview": "I am simply drunk on words after studying this paper monolith extracted from a timeline of raw information, free from the shackles of prestidigitation and the eternally recurring Hero Cycle. Though Wilson's philosophical and hypertextual riffs and digressions can still be found in this one, they flow so well against the backdrop of this intellectually honest action movie/buddy comedy that you don't even mind the detours through the Schizoverse where you can watch the Ids of every single person in the universe die for eternity or Littleoldladyville where imaginations are sold to experimental college students in all colors, styles and models, and even ebonics have attained brandhood under the rule of technocorporations.I also found a codification in this incredibly verbose tome of why exactly Wilson practices his technique in the style that he does:\"The primary reason for this aesthetic is flagrant: such a broken, scatterbrained multiperspectivalism will reflect the fragmented, schizophrenic, technosocioeconomic landscape of the comic\u2019s diegetic reality.

Harlan Wilson transports us to a future world that is openly recognised as science fictional, like in Blade Runner, but on steroids.Dr. Identity is a wacky satire of everything about the current socio-economic climate that could be satirised. Elements from today are twisted into sick parodies of themselves, and the result is one seriously fucked-up, and yet, perhaps sadly, recognisable world. Advertisements, materialism, the press, consumerism, government, economy, academia, fetishised violence, celebrity, all are caricatured and ridiculed in this fantastic world.Papanazi press and pig cops, governments that hang themselves, speculative weapons that can be kept in black hole-esque pockets, to a computer generated world known as the schizoverse (where your Id can go and gratify itself by indulging in ultraviolent tendencies or sexual promiscuity (maybe both at the same time) are all the norm in Bliptown, a seething metropolis of advertisements and jetpacking commuters, surrounded by rainforest full of imaginary creatures, creatures that none-the-less, would rip you to shreds in minutes.Wilson leads us on an ultraviolent tour-de-force the likes of of which we haven't seen since Mickey and Mallory Knox graced our screens. The over-the-top violence and gore are beautifully rendered, and really don't seem out of place in the crazy world Wilson creates. Featuring speculative weapons that turn assailants (and innocent by-standers!) into cubes of meat or reduce them to cosmic soup, as well as ridiculous nazi editors, and lecturers that dish out capital punishment to student-things for being stupid, late or just rude, Wilson's future dystopia is never short of murder, so much that its almost a piece of performance art. A graceful ballet of blood and guts pirouetting off of the page and splashing your sense organs senseless.The culprits of the murder spree are a schizophrenic plaquedemic named Dr. Blah Blah Blah, and his 'ganger, an android named Dr. Identity, which happens to know scikungfu and be a complete psychopath. Anti-heroic to the extreme, and yet more likeable than 99% of the other characters populating the book, Dr. Identity represents what happens when somebody like Dr. Blah Blah Blah, an under-appreciated, under-achieving, self-loathing man gets an opportunity to fulfil the desire to perfect themselves. There's a reason capitalism blocks the flow of libido, channels it. Dr. Identity is the embodiment of that reason.The single criticism I have for the book, is that the end felt like it came a little too soon, but maybe that was just the sadist in me being disappointed that all good things must come to an end. It certainly made sense, the resolution couldn't really have come any other way, but it still felt like Wilson just stopped writing, and thought, let's go and have a nice cup of tea after that amphetamine fuelled spasm.If Deleuze and Guattari wrote novels, they'd still pale in comparison to D.

Is it the best or my favorite? I\u2019m not sure, but I have to say Science Fiction fans have not had a laugh riot like this on their hands since Douglas Adams got bored with his own books.The novel is about a professor (Dr.Blah Blah Blah) in a quite absurdist future that has to go on the run after his substitute doppelganger decided to slaughter his class. On the run in Bliptown where time doesn\u2019t always move forward or you must shop in stores where bug eyed monsters attack you for not buying fast enough provides a hilarious and inventive back drop.The level of creativity and invention that appears on every single page is what makes Dr. Identity a must read.

What did I THINK? A few chapters into this and I wasn't thinking, as much I was panicking. Then eventually came some thoughts through the adrenaline-rush of emotion: Just who exactly is this D. Harlan Wilson? And more pertinently to the panic, how did he know about my personal academic existence - or my student-things - to capture it all so perfectly in this bizarro vision of Corndog U, Dr. Blah and his colleagues? What else did he know?The start of this was like reading about my last semester, yet he wrote this thing in 2007 - or prior! Is D. Harlan Wilson a time lord? Is he watching over my shoulder right now, taking notes for his next expose? Or is that his eyes I see peeking under the door. Maybe that's just the neighbor's cat again? I don't know. I just don't know. For all I know D. Harlan Wilson is just as fluffy as Mister Tittles. He's certainly just as enigmatic. I found his webpage on the Internet, but I don't know if that all is reality either, if he exists at all, if he is human, or Dr Identityesque. Heck, I read this thing on a Kindle, not even physical, feel-it text and pulp, just some electronic ether that vanished and appeared with each flick of a finger. So I'm not even sure if this really exists or if it was just my imagination. So many books. D. Harlan Wilson has messed with my head, and this novel was one wild ride. From photos I know I was going bald prior to starting this. Otherwise I'd pin that on him too. The beauty of \"Dr. Identity\" is just how close to real it seems. Yes, it is bizarro fiction, chocked-full of absurdity. It feels so odd, weird, and foreign, passing at breakneck speed like a crazy-assed dream. But its power and relevance lies in the fact that underneath all of that absurdity are bits of truth, of insight and meaningful satire. For each moment of randomness or silliness there is something serious accompanying, buried within - whether with a nod to science fiction tropes, technology, philosophy, politics, education, etc. At such a short length, and with such a 'trivial', chase format of plot, it is quite astounding how much meat Wilson manages to pack onto the skeleton. A lot may be up to interpretation, a lot I'm sure I missed, but there's a great deal there for those who care to look. And what a zany fun jaunt it is. This type of fiction is admittedly not my favorite kind of thing. I probably won't read everything out there by Wilson, but when I'm in the mood for this genre, I know this is the place to turn. His shorter works may be more accessible to people new to bizarro, it is hard to keep up with it over the longer form. To Wilson's note, the fault lies in this reader, not Wilson's writing, which manages to keep everything engaging even for a novel.

It became a very cliche and corny exercise.After I stopped laughing, my enjoyment for the book slowly drained away to boredom. The writing became very fast-paced and read like a huge info-dump.
