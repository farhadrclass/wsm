I am not one to LOVE \"Christian\" fiction, but this one was so well written, and the plot was very interesting, not one I had ever read about before. It is the story of a group of teens on a mission trip that goes horribly wrong. I thought the narration was excellent and it ended without tying up every loose string, which seems so sitcom-like. The characters each reacted a different way to tragedies, especially what they believed about God. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a believer and wants to learn a little about Indonesian culture."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7102344-kara", "userReview": "Wow. That was my first thought upon finishing this story. As much as I enjoyed Ms. McKay's memoir, this book.....well. It stayed in my brain for hours afterward, even amongst the craziness of airplanes, airports, baggage, seeing my family, etc., and didn't turn off until I fell asleep that night. Even almost two weeks later, this story haunts me. I think I'm going to have a hard time putting it into words, it was that amazing! I'm really going to try to not spoil much of this story, as it truly needs to be experienced from start to finish with no idea of what will come. What these teenagers go through, what they see and experience, it changes them. In ways they would never have imagined and cannot explain to anyone else who wasn't there. Even you as the reader find it hard to to come to grips with the fact that while this is a fictional story, it is also so steeped in reality; in what human beings are experiencing and doing to each other even right now half a world away from you. Cori realized that Christians and Muslims don't get along, but she had no idea exactly how fearful these groups are of each other and what that fear will cause them to do. She's a teenager whose life has been simple and comforting and stable. When that stability is ripped away, she finds out exactly how strong or weak she really is. As do the rest of the group. Left with a 17 year old guide and his baby sister, off they go to try to get home to their families. What they see, how they react, how they survive, their story will make you laugh and make you cry. That's a credit to Ms. McKay's wonderful writing. You get sucked into this story and experience it as if you are right there part of this ragtag group of teenagers.Ms. McKay doesn't shy away from describing death and disease and pain, but it never gets too gory. She also throws in little bits of humor here and there which nicely breaks the tension, for you and for the characters. And it doesn't end with everything all fixed and everyone happy. It is a happy ending, but also a real one. You may stop reading about these characters, but you can picture them stumbling on and making messes and living life. Also while this may be a christian book, it really can be enjoyed by anyone. Because what goes on in third world countries should upset anyone, no matter what they believe."}, {"userName": "Elevetha ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11828657-elevetha", "userReview": "[Sure I can imagine that she left and then came back and her and Kyle became the cutest couple in town, but what did I get?

As the teenagers are on a missions trip overseas, their world becomes forever turned upside down by a quasi-civil war.

The symbolism between the psychological issues the teens in the book encounter and what any individual who has been involved in mission or foreign aid work is apparent ... whether it is feeling guilty for putting on a new sweater, feeling selfish because you went a day without thinking about what \"they\" are enduring overseas, or losing motivation to pursue life goals that all of a sudden feel insignificant.

For Cori and a team of Christian teens, building a church in Indonesia sounds like a fun project. After an overly long prologue, McKay describes how they journey to the island of Seram and bond with the Indonesian villagers. However, even as they put the finishing touches on the newly built church, Muslim and Christian tensions flare, culminating in a horrific tragedy witnessed by Cori and her friends. They flee through the mountainous jungle, hoping to escape the escalating hostilities. McKay's carefully chosen words, devoid of unnecessary sentiment, lend power to her story. The external hardships the characters face on their trek are secondary to the internal struggles they battle over how a loving God could let terrible things happen; and why their sacrificial choice to give up a summer to help others would cost them more than they ever dreamed. While written from a Christian perspective, McKay gives an evenhanded treatment to Muslims, showing that violence and hatred transcend religious boundaries. This is one of Christian fiction's best novels of the year. (Sept.) Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I found out about this book on a Facebook page for Former Teem Missions Members. I had always wondered if someone had written a book about their own experience or a fiction based on a Teem Missions summer. Low and behold here it is. This story is about a girl who decides to go on a mission trip to Indonesia but first has to go through a boot camp in Florida, which I as I said before attended myself. It was fun to read about it in a book to reminisce with someone else in a way of the same experience. However I did not experience what the teens went through later in the story. But I can truly identify with the relational side of it. After spending 2 months with the same people working, sleeping and eating together you bond with them and then at the end of the summer you have to separate from them. I liked how each of the team members where in different places spiritually and how their faith or lack of came out when tragedy happens because that is what happens your faith is put to the test. I don\u2019t read much \u201cChristian\" fiction because a lot of it is just fluffy. This one however is not.

Things were complicated and confusing with her boyfriend, Scott, so she signed up to go on a ten-week missions trip to build a church on a small island in Indonesia.After several weeks on the island, the church is completed, but an event leaves the group of teenagers away from their team leader and his wife for a few days. No biggie. However, during those couple days, a conflict that has been festering for years erupts between Muslim and Christian villages on a nearby island. The result? The new church gets burnt to the ground, the villagers are mercilessly slaughtered, and the teens are stranded in the forest with the pastor\u2019s seventeen-year-old son.The group must hike through the forest, find a way off the island, and get to the airport on the same island where the political and religious violence is occurring. The team goes through many trials and difficulties, questioning all the things they thought they knew. This has to be one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read (and I read a lot).

It has a Christian theme but the references to God/prayer fit well with the story line. The main character, Cori, is conflicted about her belief in God- a conflict that surprisingly seems to be stronger by the end of the book than at the start. I have noticed a lot of books, supposedly written from the perspective of a teen, carry way too much adult emotional weight and thought- this book does not. I really felt as though I was reading a teenagers point of view.

This book is everything that's wrong with the Church. In this book, God is a background object that is used as a prop when convenient; there is no growth in the main characters--just anger, numbness, and activism.

I give it three stars because it is about a youth group (possibly the only teenage drama I've read since middle school required reading of \"The Outsiders.\" So although I am not a fan of the teenage genre it was well-written so I did not give up early. And I am glad, because it got better as it went along.  The first third is about the teenagers and the Christian outreach bootcamp (2 stars probably because I am 57 years old). The second third is about getting caught up in political religious violence while overseas on the outreach (4 stars). The third part is about coming home and struggling to make sense of it all (6 stars). The talking and processing with a psychologist, writing her story to deal with the grief, reintegration, culture reentry process and discovering how she fundamentally changed as a person was outstanding. This last section was very insightful, very accurate (having gone through a cultural re-entry process myself and accompanying my children through it as well) and very well written.  Most of the good material on dealing with trauma and culture reentry that I am aware of are academic or journal articles. But having the narrative of the story and the vicarious experience of what the author detailed through the book really helped me identify feelings, grief and the disconnect in my personal identity that I experienced, and even still experience to a certain degree, in my own significant cultural experience and cultural reentry process.  On the very last page (about the author) I discovered she is a psychologist. So it makes sense why the last section is so accurate and well-written. Her grandmother informed me that she is Australian but grew up in many countries overseas as her father is a World Bank economist. So her multi-cultural insights and experiences referred to in the book are real."}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10711235-katy", "userReview": "Even though this was fiction, it felt so real!

Basically, the prologue starts with a girl named Cori in the present day. Then the first chapter starts almost six months earlier, and Cori is telling the story of her 'real life' events. Then with less than five chapters left, the story returns to present day. I was not really expecting to like this, especially because I basically knew nothing about the plot line. In the end though, I really did like almost everything about the book. I only had two real problems with the book (which is the only reason it got four instead of five stars), the first being the ending. To me, the ending of a book is one of the most important parts of the book. Endings are usually not done well, so I really love a book that is ended well, but I just did not find this ending satisfactory. I just didn't like where the characters were sitting with each other especially the relationship between Cori and Kyle. The second problem was the romance. I would say that from the very first chapter, I could sense a strong romance on the horizon. This pressed me to read faster, in my eagerness to read some juicy romance. I saw the romance right away, but here's the thing. Imagine you are a dog. Your owner (The book) is holding a treat (romance). Your owner makes you come closer to get to the treat. You go, but the treat goes farther away. But you keep chasing it even as it moves farther away. Sometimes I felt this entertaining, but sometimes I was just really frustrated, because I really wanted the two characters to have a nice romance, but no matter how far I read, they didn't really get closer together, which was really frustrating. Near the end, the romance got significantly better, but it never got very deep which I had been waiting for, and turned out to be a huge disappointment. Other than that, the plot was a really cool thing to read, and I liked how after the story was over, you got to see the way that Cori kind of went into depression, and tried to hide from everything. I kind of wish there could be a sequel to this, just so I could read about the characters again (mostly Cori and Kyle). The bond that they formed during the story was really cool, and I really do want to read more about them."}, {"userName": "Shyla", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225350-shyla", "userReview": "Just finished this book.

But, I was left empty-handed in the end. The reason for this being, I believe, the author's utter failure to present a realistic view of God. She portrays the human experience with great skill, but God is way off in the distance, an unknowable, mysterious being. Does God feel distant when we go through times of sorrow? - Yes. Does it have to stay that way? - No. As we throw ourselves upon Him in despair, seeking Him and His Word in faith and trust, we begin to grasp the depths of His love and the beauty of His holiness. And we are filled with hope and peace as we carry on towards His light. I believe Christian fiction is an utter failure if it does not in the end point me back to God and His beauty and does not leave me with hope. What is the point of just presenting what is in suffering without showing me what it could be?I hate preachy books; I don't want every page filled with Bible verses; I despise clunky Sunday school lessons camouflaged in a \"novel.\" But I do expect a Christian author to leave me with hope, to inspire my imagination and stir my heart.
