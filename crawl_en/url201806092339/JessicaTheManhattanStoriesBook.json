Both books are swift, enjoyable reads. \"Jessica\", however, seemed a bit too simplistic. The pacing of the book seemed uneven- at times the author would get caught up in tedious, somewhat bland dialogue involving unnecessary detail, while other times she would graze over major plot elements (EG: the major life changes going on with Jessica's father in law and the father in law's love interest at the end of the novel were both barely acknowledged). There were some grammatical errors in the book as well. Considering the Kindle version is only .99, I will read the rest of the Manhattan series. It is a light, entertaining read that is definitely worth the dollar, as long as there isn't some unrealistic expectation of a grand piece of literature."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7026114-anne", "userReview": "Another awesome book by Donna Mabry!

As much as Jessica loves her father, she fears that she'll spend forever as a lonely old maid because he's the only single person left in her group of friends. Her fear of being alone is what convinces her to marry a despicable man named, Zachary Belk. Her father warns her, but Jessica hopes that love may change him. After her marriage, Jessica's life takes a complete upturn. Her marriage is terrible, her husband is a monster and life is continually bleak for her. Not only that, but she's transported from Manhattan, NYC to Manhattan, Kansas! I loved how human Jessica was painted -- she made mistakes, but they were realistic. I loved how Jessica went from being a cautious, wallflower to an empowered woman. It focused not only on self-empowerment, but female friendship and the unconditional love of family. Even though there were quite a few characters, I truly felt that all their storylines were wrapped up neatly. Zachary Belk successfully made his way onto my list of worst fictional males! :PThe writing was sweet, but simplistic; almost as if you were peering into someone's ancient memories. Something that bothered me were the grammatical errors. They were often very distracting and rudimentary. I understand that there's no editor with self-publishing, but I think the work should have been assessed prior to publishing."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62719213-tiffany", "userReview": "I had to stop at chapter 6.

Fortunately, her father takes safeguards in her marriage and in his will to safeguard her inheritance. She is a strong, intelligent woman who is not beaten down by her husband's infidelities and gambling problems. I felt great admiration for her in divorcing him in that day and time. However, shortly after the divorce, she finds out she is pregnant, and allows her ex-husband back into her life to try to give the baby a father, and they move to Manhattan, Kansas to live in a house her husband has won through cheating a person at cards. Although, he falls back into old patterns and causes her to become nearly destitute, Jessica finds ways to survive and go forward. The book takes place in the early 1900's and portrays vividly the stock market crash and it's effect on so many people, including the wealthy. My favorite part of this novel was the character of Jessica---a very admirable woman who acted with intelligence and strength in a day when this was not expected of women."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10285365-donna", "userReview": "I have to admit I stopped reading this book when I realized Jessica was portrayed as a perfect Christian wife who seemed to accept her philandering worthless husband whom she knew was just that before she married him but thought she should marry him anyway because no one else had asked and in her time a woman has to be married. Her father warns her, she insists when she has children that will somehow make up for all her marriage lacks. He is marrying her for money and status, and her father knows it and so does she. I'm sure she gets herself above all this but the way it is written I just lost interest in this woman who seems to have no unkind or selfish thoughts, let alone deeds, and I could not relate to her at all, allowing herself to be used as she is. I may go back and finish it. I was excited that there are more books in this series. But right now I need to read about a strong woman who makes decisions for her well being above a lousy husband."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4889357-crystal", "userReview": "I love historical fiction and was excited to read this one in particular because my grandmother grew up in rural Kansas. I liked the writing style but I had an odd thing happen: I was more interested in the secondary characters than the protagonist. Spoiler alert: Jessica was a total doormat and while the author tried to tell us that she was a strong woman...no. Her actions were weak. Her husband who basically bankrupted her to get divorced came back and asked her to leave with him and she actually went?! Pregnant or not, that was pathetic. Then she doesn't freak out when her ex shows up after everyone believes he's dead the night before her wedding to a good man. She had no reaction at all. Total doormat/robot. There was no depth to her at all! I also felt like the whole last 1/3 of the book was ridiculous. I found myself not caring what happened to Jessica because she sucked so much. I wish we could have heard more about Caroline or Father Belk or Mimi."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/299904-fran", "userReview": "As with Maude this book is \"ok\". It was a little hard to watch Jessica putting up with her worth less husband and coming back for more and more of his nonsense. You would think that most women would never take him back after he left the first time. What I found most confusing was that Jessica showed how strong she was when she had to provide for her and those she lived with. She was the epitome of a strong woman. But, when her husband came along the second and third time she was the weakest woman ever! That definitely was hard to read.And of course there was the ever predictable \"happy ending\".

Just as I think I might respect her for creating an independent life, she decides to try again with him and heads to an unknown town in Kansas. Gee, What could possibly go wrong? Despite her stupid choices with this man, Jessica is a saintly, too-perfect character: she is talented, loved by all, and, except when it comes to her husband, never makes mistakes.

The main character, Jessica, acts in a manner inconsistent with her education and life - she marries against her father's will, to a man who she knows is a scoundrel, because she is afraid of being an old maid at age 25. She is incredibly wealthy, and lives independently from the beginning of her marriage, but she keeps taking back her cheating, abusive spouse, whom she has no feelings for - and never had. Multiple times. And her husband just won't go away. The characters felt wooden, and I formed no attachment to them.

Women did not have the right to vote. They couldn't work outside the home or seek employment without permission from their husbands. What a hard life for Jessica once she met and married that scoundrel Belk. It's a worthy read because she has to use all resources to get around these obstacles during those years of poverty.

I didn't really like it, but I did finish reading it and I didn't despise it either so that is something. It is almost written like a melodrama with our heroine, Jessica, and a dastardly devil, Zachary. The only difference is the heroine pulls herself up by the boot straps every time the dastardly devil takes her down. I wanted to like the story of a strong woman, but she is too naive. The writing wasn't that great either. Too detailed in places and states the obvious too much. This is available from the Kindle Lending Library and is the first of a series.

Believing that true love will never come her way, she settles for the man she sees as her last chance to realize her dream, handsome, charming, ne'er-do-well, Zachary Belk. Jessica\u2019s father, one of the most successful businessmen in 1860\u2019s Manhattan, warns her that he isn't a good prospect for a husband. Jessica seldom goes against his advice, but Zachary is the only man in New York who has courted her. His own firm is on the edge of bankruptcy, and he desperately needs a financial lifeline. Jessica believes she is only being realistic when she agrees to be Zachary\u2019s wife, but she soon finds out her carousing husband doesn\u2019t share her hopes for domestic life. The stock market crash of 1869 changes all their lives. Born into wealth, Jessica never had to ask the price of anything. Now the cost of simply putting food on the table is the first thing on her mind when she awakes every morning. Jessica must adapt drastically to being penniless. She calls upon her faith in God, her friends, both old and new, and her own determination, not only to survive, but to find peace, happiness, security, and a real love. This is the first of three novels in the 'Manhattan Stories' saga. It takes the reader from the opulent drawing rooms of Manhattan, New York, where fortunes are made and financial empires can collapse without warning, to the frontier cabins of Manhattan, Kansas, where everything, including true love, is possible.
