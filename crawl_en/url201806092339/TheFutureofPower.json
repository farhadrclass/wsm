Unfortunately, this book treads no such 'new' ground. Nye focuses on what he defines as smart power, which is to say, the optimal mix of hard power, soft power, and other fun powers like cyber power. The concept seems tautological - the best mix of power is the mix of power which is best. Honestly, this book feels like Nye had one of his kids' tuition bills coming due and needed to pump out book related to his theory and field with some current issues attached for selling power.There is nothing in here you cannot extrapolate from Nye's earlier and more influential work along with a decent \"intro to international relations\" book."}, {"userName": "Siroos", "userReviewDate": "Apr

And while he and President Obama forged ahead on trade deals and wink-to-the-press bromides of cooperation, many Americans are not so optimistic about what China's rise means. In a recent poll, 61% view China as \"a threat to American jobs and economic security.\" One increasingly hears the sotto voce warnings that our children will soon be learning Confucius at the feet of our new Chinese overlords.Then again, maybe not. For geopolitical prognostications of a less alarmist varietal, with nuanced notes of optimism about U.S. ingenuity and leadership, try \"The Future of Power.\" In it, Joseph S. Nye Jr., Harvard professor and National Intelligence Council chair under President Bill Clinton, has distilled wide-ranging observations on how the power game will work in the 21st century and why America is poised to remain No. 1 if it plays it smart and heeds his advice. Whether it's navigating the political waves of the Middle East or the diplomatic dance with China, the book offers a generous batch of insights.Nye is famous for coining the phrase \"soft power,\" the foreign policy application of the old folk wisdom about winning more flies with honey than with vinegar. Now in his new book comes an updated catchphrase: \"smart power, the combination of the hard power of coercion and payment with the soft power of persuasion and attraction.\" It's push and pull, carrots and sticks; the recognition, as Machiavelli would say, that it is truly best to be loved and feared.But what's really new is that this is the 21st century, where power is more multidimensional, more diffuse and hence more complicated. On top of nations and armies, there are more sprawling multinational corporations, more and more powerful nongovernmental organizations and disruptive terrorist networks.And most important, there is the Internet, which is upending traditional power relations faster than people can write books about it. Take Egypt. Online activism played a key role in mobilizing anti-government protesters. Power doesn't just grow out of the barrel of a gun anymore \u2014 it also grows out of a Facebook wall post and a Twitter feed. But only if 1,000 people pass it on.In such an environment, Nye writes, leaders \"need to think of themselves as being in a circle rather than atop a mountain.\" Forget about power over others; the 21st century will be all about power with others, about organizing coalitions and solving collective action problems. \"The world is neither unipolar, multipolar, nor chaotic,\" he explains, \"it is all three at the same time.\"And yet while the electrifying possibilities of diffusion have complicated the picture, nations still have the most resources, which still makes them the stars (for now). And no nation combines hard and soft power like America, whose open, innovative, democratic culture plus military might should keep it in first place in the Nye power rankings for years to come \u2014 assuming its leaders are smart enough to convert those resources into lasting alliances and international orders and not squander them on brash bullying.By contrast, Nye assesses China as far weaker. Its political system lacks legitimacy, and the \"Chinese economy faces serious obstacles of transition from inefficient state-owned enterprises, growing inequality, massive internal migration.\"Nye is a savvy and respected analyst, and he doesn't disappoint here. He's grappling with the hardest of questions, and though \"The Future of Power\" can at times read somewhat meanderingly, it's the best kind of meandering: a learned journey through big ideas of what power means and how it is ever-evolving."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1011730-matthew", "userReview": "A fascinating book, full of suggestions for how the next century could go.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and co-founder of neoliberalism within international relations theory in 1977\ue004, Joseph S. Nye, Jr. (1937) is widely noted and highly acclaimed for his development of the field of political science\ue004. Nye gained particular significance for coining the term \u2018soft power\u2019 in his 1990 book The Power to Lead\ue004. The concept suited demands of the current global power system so remarkably well that it was quoted by political leaders as disparate as Barack Obama and Hu Jintao\ue004. Combining knowledge on the classic notion of hard power and the newly coined soft variant, Nye in 2011 begun to explicitly advocate the strategic and target-specific combined utilization of the two according to a concept he baptized \u2018smart power\u2019\ue004. The following essay seeks to expound Nye\u2019s ideas on the dimensions of hard, soft, and smart power. In the first place, a concise outline of the definition and elaboration of all three concepts will be provided. In the second place, a few points of criticism will be given in a review of both the applicability of the general theory to the global political system and the specificities of primarily soft power that Nye sometimes tends to ignore.Power as influenceIn an era in which global power becomes increasingly diffused and states are no longer the only primary actors on the global stage, defining the notion of power is both necessary and incredibly complex. Nye assumes the perspective that power constitutes \u201cthe ability to get what you want\u201d\ue004, siding with mainstream social psychological approaches to the topic of power\ue004 that view power as the influence one individual or a group of individuals is able to exert over another. At its core, power is contextual in nature: influence is always exerted within a specific scope \u2013 the actors within the power relationship \u2013, and relates to certain topics \u2013 the domain of power. In global politics, Nye distinguishes two takes on power: the resource-based approach, based on an actor\u2019s military and economic provisions; and the relational approach, entailing the ability to influence an actor\u2019s behaviour. Three relational strategies, or \u2018faces\u2019, are identified. The first face is based on the coercive functioning of threats and rewards to prompt an actor to perform a desired behaviour. Slightly more subtle in its workings, the second involves the ability to set an actor\u2019s agenda, thereby limiting both the actor\u2019s options and the scope of relevant topics. The third face is the manipulative: the ability to shape an actor\u2019s beliefs, perceptions, and preferences; or, phrased differently, dominance over a certain discourse\ue004. These faces of power are loosely linked to the three dimensions in general power types: hard power, soft power, and smart power.Hard powerHard power is the first-face, resource-based approach central to realist political theories, and entails coercion and reward in its strategy to influence. Hence, hard power may be defined in terms of economic, military, and institutional resources. The power of many significant global actors, and primarily the US, hinges upon a superior military supported by steadily growing and high-level economic performance. With regard to conventional military power, American resources, and therefore potential for intervention and hard-power display are virtually unequaled throughout the world \u2013 a reason for a plethora of actors to attempt strategies that render conventional tactics close to defunct. Economically, however, the rise of the BRICS\ue004, and China in particular, may increase the need for the USA to assume a more co-optive stance in global relations, especially given the shift in power emphasis from military to economic global significance.Soft powerSoft power approaches, depending on the appeal emanating from a specific actor, have recently increased in significance. Over the past decades, the wide dissemination of information and possibility of communication across the globe has spurred not only global trade, but international interaction in unprecedented ways\ue004. These developments led to a wide diversification of global actors, and hence the inclusion of NGOs, TNCs, global activist movements, and terrorist franchises like al-Qaeda in Nye\u2019s power equation. Along the same lines, however, it increased the ability of states to exert mostly undetected influence in the form of soft power, divided in a direct and an indirect causal model\ue004. In the first model, states use resources to attract government elites, which in turn leads to favourable elite decisions. The second, somewhat more contentious, uses resources to attract or repel publics, influencing elite decision-making through influence of the environment. Smart powerSmart power is the target-specific application of coercion and subliminal, often unnoticed attraction like the immersion in an attractive culture, and hence simply the combination of soft and hard power. Counter-insurgency stragegies like those developed by Petraeus and McCrystal in Iraq and Afghanistan, simultaneously featuring crackdowns on terrorists and winning the broad support of the general population, are one prominent recent example\ue004. Most state power, however, contains both building blocks and ensures careful exploitation of these options. The USSR targeted resistance with coercion, but devised a complicated system of Party rewards for the obedient, and its effective domestic propaganda added greatly to the government\u2019s legitimacy\ue004. American soft power spreads through the world-wide consumption of Coca-Cola, through the USA\u2019s dominance at the Olympics, and through Hollywood movies and detectives often depicting the benevolence of the FBI and CIA; but it also spreads through the use of the military for training or aid in case of humanitarian disasters. Typically a soft-power application of a hard-power resource, the latter once more depicts the distinction between hard and soft power to be merely the difference between two building blocks. Only when combined in a target-oriented manner can these lead to the effective exertion of power in interpersonal, domestic, and interstate relationships. In an era of diversification of situations, both the number and the type of targets grows, boosting the appeal of attractive narratives in the power approach to current global developments. General criticismDespite its thorough nature, Nye\u2019s analysis fails to answer a couple of questions. With regard to his general theory, he partially disregards the danger that an increased soft-power approach may call for propagandic measures. These may undermine the US\u2019s own ideals of liberty and democracy by limiting the number of perspectives available in its domestic discourse, as well as call for a redefinition of freedom which now seems mostly defined in terms of non-coercion. In addition, the US\u2019s democratic narrative, prompting dissenting factions in other countries to elicit violence in an occupying government and hence implicitly forcing the USA to intervene, may prove dangerous to itself,. This already happened in Kosovo\ue004, and it is not unlikely that this partly accounts for the recent developments in Syria.On the other hand, one could raise ethnic concerns about the ease with which Nye talks about military power and intervention. As soft power implies making people want what they do without either civilians losing their lives in the process or sowing the seed of discontent and preparing the ground for popular uprisings, one could argue that soft power approaches should always be favoured to the exertion of hard power.In addition, although shortly touching upon it, Nye does not elaborate on the increasing dominance of other narratives besides the American, like the Chinese, the Brazilian, and the Indian. Will the development of other narratives lead to a clash of narratives akin to the clash of civilizations predicted by Huntington\ue004, or will growing economic interdependence cause integration of these types of discourse into a hybrid global narrative?Specific criticismsThe following entails criticism of some of Nye\u2019s specific ideas. Firstly, although briefly mentioning it, Nye does not translate the significance of domestic societal openness to policy recommendations\ue004. Secondly, the role of the United Nations Security Council in establishing international law has almost become insurpassable even for the US, and the relatively less resourceful Russian Federation is given the possibility to exert a greater influence through the UN than might otherwise have been the case. In addition, apart from a few remarks on colonialism, Nye fails to include Sub-Saharan Africa, with its great potential in both human resources and raw materials, in his power equation, seemingly assuming the African continent will, despite its incredible population growth and increasing search for affirmation of its global relevance\ue004, not be a force to be reckoned with within the coming half-century. Lastly, Nye\u2019s offhanded response to the potential risk the rise of China poses to American dominance may be a bit too premature. With markets for Chinese products rapidly growing in Africa and other developing regions as well as in China itself, the PRC may capitalize on these markets to support its economy . Having reached a point at which it is more than able to compete with the US, China may then decide to dump its dollars, causing the collapse of the American economy, thereby solidifying China\u2019s leading economic role. ConclusionIn The Future of Power, Joseph Nye gives an adequate account of current global developments and the types of power prompted by changing relationships. He correctly indicates that the lines between hard power and soft power are blurring now traditional hard power resources are utilized to enhance a state\u2019s soft power. The distinction between the three types, however, is one of more theoretical than practical use. The integration of both types of power tailored to the needs of specified contexts is necessary to win the hearts of populations while simultaneously eliminating immediate risks; and co-optive stances may prove more beneficial than coercive. However, Nye\u2019s America-centric approach causes him to disregard the rise of Africa, the threat China may pose, and the role of the UN in global power balances. Soft power, conceptually, also harbours several paradoxes to the American narrative. Despite the impossibility of predicting the future of power, Nye\u2019s account needs to answer a few more questions before being truly balanced."}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1395086-jimmy", "userReview": "The Future of Power was written by the man who coined the term \"soft power\" in the 1980s and is an expert on foreign affairs. \u00a0Joseph S. Nye Jr. first gained acclaim when he founded, with Robert Keohane, the idea of neoliberalism, as it relates to international relations. \u00a0It is one of the two major approaches, with neorealism, that govern the field. \u00a0Borrowing from the wikipedia entry, neoliberalism is \"a school of thought which believes that states are, or at least should be, concerned first and foremost with absolute gains rather than relative gains to other states.\" \u00a0Neorealism is a theory \"that says power is the most important factor in international relations.\" \u00a0Nye's work with neoliberalism led to his development of the term \"soft power.\" \u00a0His definition boils down to this excerpt from his book on the subject, called Soft Power:\"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries \u2013 admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness \u2013 want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power \u2013 getting others to want the outcomes that you want \u2013 co-opts people rather than coerces them.\"All of this matters for The Future of Power because Nye advocates that the strongest America will maintain it's ability to utilize soft power. \u00a0He does not support the notion that America is in decline but does not say that the idea is impossible. \u00a0I learned a ton from this book and found it relatively reassuring about our place in the world. \u00a0Read it if you are interested at all in international relations."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria", "userReview": "Nye postulates that as countries and states vie for influence (a.k.a. power) they have turned to hard power (military might) and soft power (persausion, cultural influence) and that now more than ever states will have to rely on balance of smart power (hard and soft) to get what they want.Why I started this book: One of my many library downloads that is due next week.Why I finished it: I'm listening to books as fast as I can because all my holds came at the same time.

In The Future of Power, however, he doesn\u2019t try to cross any new conceptual frontiers. Instead, he offers a lucid summary of his thinking on the \u201csources and trajectory of American power,\u201d including distinctions of between hard and soft power, the changing nature of power in the modern world, and inevitably, whether power is something the United States now finds itself running short of. In many ways, power feels like a blunt instrument: it seems pretty easy to recognize when it gets used, whether for or against us. Yet, as Nye demonstrates, power is inherently relational and contingent, and for this reason, remarkably hard to pin down. \u201cA policy-oriented concept of power depends upon a specified context to tell us who gets what, how, where, and when,\u201d Nye writes. An observation that, not coincidently, parallels Harold Lasswell\u2019s classic definition of politics. Hard power is push, in Nye\u2019s formulation, soft power is pull. In a kind of Hegelian dialectic, he offers up the concept of smart power as \u201cthe combination of the hard power of coercion and payment with the soft power of persuasion and attraction.\u201dNye identifies the \u201cthree faces\u201d of power: \u201ccommanding change, controlling agendas, and establishing preferences.\u201d The first entails coercion, and aligns most closely with the popular conception of power as the ability to bend others to our will. The second face is more cooption than coercion \u2013 determining what issues are either on or off the table, and therefore even legitimate topics for discussion. The third face of power is the least visible \u2013 the ability to shape an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s beliefs and outlooks without any apparent outside pressure or direction at all.After examining military, economic, and soft power \u2013 and the ways in which their boundaries blur and overlap \u2013 Nye looks at how the nature of power has changed in the modern world. He emphasizes that a chief characteristic of our networked, globalized, cyber-spaced world is not a diminution of state power so much as a diffusion of power in which nation states must share a far more crowded stage with the proliferation of NGOs, global corporations, social media, and Internet-empowered groups and individuals whose interests range from human rights and the arts to terrorism.The power game continues, Nye stresses, even if it has become much more complicated, especially with the new dimension of social media. Nevertheless, states will continue to be dominant players in the international arena. Twitter and Facebook aren\u2019t going to bring regime change to Syria or Iran, nor will Google be permitted to deliver uncensored information to the Chinese people. Still, these governments can\u2019t afford to dismiss the networking and information power that these services represent.Nye dismisses much of the simplistic talk about the decline of American power as confusing two very different phenomena: an absolute decline in power, and a decline relative to a new rising generation of states. He then offers judicious assessments of the strengths and vulnerabilities of the BRIC nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China \u2013 plus Japan and the United States. His conclusion: \u201cDescribing power transition in the twenty-first century as an issue of American decline is inaccurate and misleading.\u201dNye concludes with a set of \u201cState Smart Power Strategies\u201d that reject the unilateralism of the Bush Administration for \u201csuccessful strategies in the new context of power diffusion and the \u2018rise of the rest.\u2019\u201dWe are a great power, Nye observes. Not it\u2019s time to be a smart one as well."}, {"userName": "Adrian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7061202-adrian", "userReview": "Joseph Nye's timely and informative analysis addresses all the questions one may have asked about the ambiguous term Smart Power and contrasts the various forms of power, whether it is economic power, hard power, or soft power.Smart Power refers to a combination of all the above, with the addition that each is used prudently. In the wake of the 2003 Iraq War, the 2008 Global Recession, and the ubiquitous speculation of so called American decline, Nye presents an analysis of the US strengths and failures, and the policy recommendations for the way forward.Unlike many contemporaries, Nye is careful not to exaggerate the rise of China, taking a broader analysis into the reality that the current rate of Chinese economic growth cannot last indefinitely due to China's internal contradictions and demographics, and that the US is unlikely to be surpassed any time soon as the world's hegemon. Rather, Nye, much like Fareed Zakaria, constructs the emergence of a multipolar world, and although with the US likely to remain at the top for sometime, Nye believes that regardless of the leadership in Washington DC, a more multilateral approach to world affairs will come about.This is much a book about the present and the forms of power as it is a divination project into the future of power. Nye explains the limits of economic power, such as the ineffectiveness of sanctions, the limited power of economic weapons as powerful as oil, and how the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo could not have lasted much longer, due to Arab dependence on Western Markets, and US Security Guarantees.Soft Power is an altogether different concept, relying on the cultural and ideological attractiveness of a nation and its behaviour. This takes many forms, ranging from the attractiveness of a country to foreign students, the popularity of its cultural exports, or the reception of its hosting of major events, such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Nye cautions that the imprudent use of hard power, such as the 2003 Iraq War, and incidents such as Abu Ghraib and the ongoing prison at Guantanamo Bay have been detrimental to American soft power, and has had an adverse affect on the psychological dimension of warfare, serving as a means of terrorist recruitment.To students of political science and international relations, Joseph Nye is a familiar name, and this latest volume is a welcome addition to the reading lists of political and current affairs enthusiasts, both old and new. Nye's book is a much needed update to international relations theory that is essential reading, regardless of however acquainted one is with the global system."}, {"userName": "Aaron Terrazas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5161513-aaron-terrazas", "userReview": "An insightful examination of how influence (both people and institutions) happens. Nye popularized the idea of \"soft power\" during the 1990s and this unravels many of the myths than have emerged from popular usage. He builds upon growing interest in the role of networks and non-state actors in inter-state relations and takes a critical (although hardly nationalistic) view of claims about an American decline in world affairs. Rather, he argues, the tools the US had traditionally excelled at are fading in effectiveness.\"Some of my favorite quotes:\u201cStructuring markets is more important than imposing sanctions and providing aid. Very often, policies that promote open market structures and diversification of sources of supply will turn out to be more effective in denying economic power to suppliers than mercantilist efforts to lock up supplies through ownership,\u201d (80).\u201cFor governments to succeed in the networked world of the new public diplomacy, they are going to have to learn to relinquish a good deal of their control, and this runs the risk that nongovernmental civil society actors are often not aligned in their goals with government policies or even objectives.\u201d (108).\u201cThe speed of Internet time means all governments have less control of their agendas.
