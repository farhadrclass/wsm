What began as a detailed and seemingly thoroughly researched study of American foreign affairs sadly began by the Nixon years to seem merely generalised and opinionated.But without doubt it was the worst example of proof-reading that I've ever encountered: errant commas, dollar signs transposed by random numerals, non-sensical sentences (in one case the word 'create' is replaced by 'cremate') not to mention unnecessarily sloppy colloquialisms. Arguably the insouciant editing and inelegant prose gives the text a degree of accessibility however this was certainly not the 'classic' I had been led to expect."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3223980-sarah", "userReview": "THERE ARE SO MANY F*-#KING TYPOS IN THIS BOOK. Apologies for the profanity, but dear Lord, who edited this thing?! Paragraphs split in the middle of a sentence, misspellings, random commas, missing capital letters....someone was clearly asleep at the wheel in proofreading this thing. Beyond just typos, there was also a lot of bad or confusing phrasing and awkward sentences that really brought down the level of the book, stylistically. So one star off for some poor writing.The other star I took off because, especially toward the end of the book, the author interjected his opinion a little too much, which just didn't seem appropriate to the type of book this was. He also sometimes tried to be poetic or make a point and exaggerated actual historical fact when doing it, which bothered me. For example, introducing the chapter on the September 11th attacks, he wrote about how little Americans cared about the flag prior to 9/11: \"Strange now to remember how we used to take the America flag [yes, that's not my typo, my edition of the book has it as the \"america flag\"...] for granted during the Cold war. It was omnipresent--even planted on the moon--but never truly appreciated as a banner of unity....[the flag] offered no dazzle or meaning. It was a blase symbol that life in the United States was business as usual.\" And then he goes on to talk about how much meaning the flag gained after 9/11. Um, what? Sure, the flag was imbued with a lot of extra sentiment and meaning after the attacks, but I think the idea that the flag basically meant nothing to Americans before the attacks is ridiculous. Quite a few of our most iconic national images feature the flag (raising the flag at Iwo Jima, the moon landing) and our national anthem is ALL about the flag (\"oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave/o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\"). I thought that was bad history and bad writing. That, plus the fact that the author sometimes made opinionated judgments about certain presidents and policies, made me take off another star.But this was a pretty great summary of American foreign policy in the twentieth century. It's concise, it includes a ton of information, and generally it is decently balanced and objective in its conclusions. It's a very readable book once you get past the typos. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't know much about American foreign policy. It's a great overview, and I don't regret reading it."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36943208-paul", "userReview": "When I think about my experience reading \"Rise to Globalism,\" the one word that comes to mind is \"fair,\" in the sense that the authors don't take a politically partisan stance to Republican or Democrat administrations. This book achieves three purposes:1) Show the reader how the US emerged as the world superpower, tracing the route from 1938 to the present;2) Subjectively grade each president and his administration on their foreign policy objectives and whether or not they were achieved;3) Help the reader understand the US's place in the world and potentially understand where the country (and the world) is headed.This book is oriented to those who have trouble understanding how and why the US became the preeminent superpower in the world and for those who might be afraid of overly academic writing. At the same time, the authors draw from a variety of sources and provide a section for extended reading that allows the reader to delve deeper into specific affairs.I started reading this book as a kind of prep for the foreign service exam (it is on the suggested reading list of the State Department), didn't manage to finish it in time for the exam, but continued afterwards and I can say that I have gotten a lot out of it. I recommend it for anyone interested in US foreign policy and also anyone preparing for the same exam (there was one question specifically that I would have gotten wrong if not for this book!)."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/701137-jonathan", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I actually remember the precise moment that I first picked it up. I was in college. Some of my friends and I were walking down, I believe, 7th Avenue between Irving and Judah streets late on a Friday night. We had just left the pizza parlor, walking back to our cars, when we passed a bookstore on the east side of the street (I don't know if it's still there). The store was closed, it's green awning drawn back over the peeling green door frame, the lights were all out; but, there was this rack of books outside the doorway with a sign that read \"free\". I remember stopping, thumbing through the books, thinking that \"there's never any good books left out for free\". My friends were walking off ahead of me, and I was just about to stop picking through the books. Then I saw a little red paperback book with this funny gold emblem on the cover. I read the title, \"Rise to Globalism: American Foreign Policy Since 1938\", and thought, \"now this sounds interesting, I might as well take it, it's free anyways\". It turned out to become one of my favourite history books, and one of the few books that I have read more than once. At the time I first read it, the book helped fill in some questions that I had about American history, and led to many more questions. I can almost argue that this book, and the curiosity that it spawned in me, resulted in my decision to pursue a degree in Political Science."}, {"userName": "Tara deCamp", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5921418-tara-decamp", "userReview": "This book is a decent survey of US foreign policy post-WWII.

This is a book that tracks foreign policy from 1938 (I read the title because I'm super smart, yo) through the election of Barack Obama.Many Americans can feel that history is often this unrelated mass that is difficult to attach to today's policies. They don't understand the complicated international relationships (both good and bad) that American finds itself beholden to at present. Globalism ties it all together. For that reason, I couldn't recommend this book more highly for those familiar with American history texts and those looking to maybe dip their toes in the water. In 1939, on the eve of World War II, the United States had an army of 185,000 men with an annual budget of less than $500 million. America had no entangling alliances and no American troops were stationed in any foreign country. The dominant political mood was isolationism. America's physical security, the sine qua non of foreign policy, seemed assured, not because of American alliances or military strength but because of the distance between America and any potential enemy.The book is written in a reasonably casual tone, so readers will not get lost in the pedantry. My one complaint would be the liberal bias that begins to appear in the final chapters. I'm a liberal progressive and I did vote for Barack Obama. I remember the optimism and upheaval that overcame the country in the months leading up to and following Obama's first term election. That being said, in a book that sticks very closely to policy, I think many conservative readers will be bothered by the liberal tone that the book takes at its current end. Perhaps in future editions this will be tampered down. Oh wait! Two complaints. There were a significant number of typos throughout the book. It was frankly an unacceptable amount. BUT! They didn't take away from the content. If you're someone who really really cares about a perfectly edited book, well, this one might make you tear your hair out.--Horny Teens--Yo, what up, home dawgs? This book here? It's basically a dating manual. You want to know what a bad breakup looks like? Just read about the strategies taken during the Cold War. You thinkin' 'bout gettin' a side piece?

The success of Ambrose's book may rest in his ability to provide critical judgments of American foreign policy within a balanced framework. As a survey it functions admirably.On contentious issues, Ambrose seems to straddle controversy and approach the golden mean. Yet his conclusions are often critical of American attitudes and actions. The chapter on the beginnings of the Cold War, for instance, offers a critique of mutual U.S.-Soviet intransigence over the settlement in East Europe. At first glance it appears to be here that Ambrose locates the origin of the Cold War, in mutual hostilities which offer enough \"blame\" to go around. Though he notes that \"there is no satisfactory date to mark the beginning of the Cold War,\" he strikes a note of inevitability by pointing out that \"Russia controlled Eastern Europe. This crucial result of World War II destroyed the Grand Alliance and gave birth to the Cold War.\" (93) If one reads further, a more critical note becomes audible.Ambrose makes clear that it is certainly understandable that Americans would have been outraged at Soviet actions in Eastern Europe, since \"they shut the West out completely. By any standard the Soviet actions were high-handed, their suppressions brutal.\"(98) The Soviets had every right, however, to expect to control that region as its sphere of influence. The illusion of omnipotence, the false belief that America could influence events even in the Soviet zone is ultimately the \"cause\" of the Cold War. Truman was the first in a long line of Cold War presidents who would fail to differentiate between American influence and power.\"American influence would never be as great as American power. Over the next two decades American leaders and the American people were forced to learn that bitter lesson. American power vilas vaster than anyone else,' s, but in many cases it was not usable power and thus could not be translated into diplomatic victory. Vietnam would be the ultimate proof of American inability to force others to do as she wished, but the process began much earlier, in 1945, with Truman's attempt to shape the course of events in East Europe.\" (105)What differentiates Ambrose's criticism from that of many of the revisionist writers of the New Left is his lack of a thoroughgoing critique of the American system in his survey. His criticism remains at the level of tactics. In the instance of the beginnings of the Cold War, Truman failed to be sufficiently realistic about Eastern Europe. One senses that Ambrose believes FDR could have done a better job of \"dealing\" with the Soviets.Stephen Ambrose's chapter on the Korean War concentrates on President Truman's approach to the conflict. Ambrose credits Harry Truman with the institutionalization of the Cold War, a process whereby the strategy of containment was instituted on a global scale. In a manner strikingly similar to Gar Alperovitz, he argues that the Korean War provided the pretext under which Truman solidified America's position in Europe. This Asian war provided the excuse Truman needed for rearming America and NATO (to include Germany). Despite the Europe-fist overtones of the Truman-Acheson strategy in NSC-68, the vision of containment was becoming increasingly global.The Korean War provided the context in which a major shift toward globalism took place. Yet the process of instituting vhat one revisionist on WvJI had called \"permanent war for permanent peace\" was not without its difficulties. The primary difficulty with the process of institutionalization was that this regularized approach to a high level of peace-time preparedness was quite foreign to the American mind.\"Containment had never been very satisfying emotionally, built as it was on the constant reiteration of the Communist threat and the propaganda line that divided the line into areas that were free and those that were enslaved. Millions of Americans wanted to accept their Christian obligation and free the slaves. Other millions waned to destroy, not just contain, the Communist threat, on the grounds that if it were allowed to exist, the Cold War would go on forever, at a constantly increased cost.\" (181-2)Within this context the conflict between MacArthur and Truman over vlar aims in Korea takes on added importance. MacArthur, seeking to roll back Communism in Asia, questioned the very strategy of Truman's policy of world-wide containment of Communism. Reflecting the popular American frustration with containment, MacArthur became an instant popular hero after his dismissal. Truman, hmvever, won out in the end. Despite tactical defeats, his strategy of containment had been implemented on a global scale. America was in it for the long haul."}, {"userName": "Joe Ruvido", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61168788-joe-ruvido", "userReview": "Let me qualify my rating of four stars for an otherwise excellent book that weaved a story of America's FP from FDR through Clinton. Perhaps the rating is unfair of me, but I simply can't get past the fact that in the final chapters Ambrose and Brinkley pull the tired right wing blame of Clinton for 9/11, saying that Clinton enforced a no-fly zone above his 2nd inaugural in the wake of the Atlanta Bombings but didn't expand their use which led to 9/11. The blame came out of nowhere, and showed their age. They wrote the book's best chapters when they were younger, but when it came time for the edition update that included 9/11 they just couldn\u2019t bring themselves to fully blame the Bush administration for ignoring Bin Laden\u2019s threats after being in power for 9 months before the attacks. Of course we need to look at history in bigger terms than 9 months, but reaching back to this \u201cpolicy failure\u201d in \u201996 is straight out of talk radio. At best, it is an attempt at equivalency and \"fairness,\" but any honest person would not equate the actions in the wake of the Atlanta Bombings with the blatant ignorance of \"Bin Laden determined to attack US,\" under Bush. They also missed the point about the protests against US actions in Latin America. When H.W. Bush sent troops in to Panama to depose Noriega there were protests in the US against US involvement in Latin American affairs. The authors jovially point out the \"hypocrisy\" of anti-war protesters, whom the authors think would be happier CIA invasion to depose a Noriega instead of boots on the ground in Panama. This misses the point entirely - the people against the war in Panama were ALSO against the CIA's deposing of democratically elected leaders in Latin America like Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala and Juan Bosch in the Dominican Republic. I found the attack a cheap form of \u201cwhataboutism.\u201dI learned so much from this book to be overcome by these two petty inconsistencies. For example I never realized how much I admire General Eisenhower. I had heard his Farewell Address about the Military Industrial Complex before, but I didn't realize that he had deep fear of war \u2013 not just of the widespread destruction that nuclear weapons would cause, but also of boots on the ground in foreign countries. I think the authors did a great job explaining the thought process that each stakeholder went through when making the decisions. In spite of their later placating of the Bush/Cheney administration, they were rightfully critical of Nixon for sabotaging the peace talks in \u201968 in Vietnam which hurt the Humphrey campaign.

Chapters on Truman and Eisenhower are deeply engaging and decidedly neutral; however by the time Ambrose rolls into the Kennedy and Johnson, Globalism makes some questionable statements and employs some (perhaps outdated) source choices. Examples include:--Historical sources: Despite some criticism of President Kennedy's actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the authors rely heavily on his brother Robert's posthumous work \"Thirteen Days,\" and conclude that the President was \"the honor graduate of the Cuban Missile Crisis class.\" More recent scholarship, including this brilliant Atlantic piece from 2013 (http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a...), have seriously undermined Robert Kennedy's somewhat hagiographic narrative, yet Rise to Globalism's authors appear to readily accept (and even quote) from this source. --Factual Questions: In describing the transition from Carter to Reagan, Rise to Globalism calmly asserts that there was \"Western economic boom\" in the second half of the 1970s (stagflation?), followed by a massive recession and a rise in interest rates in the early 1980s. They then partially credit the rise in rates to the \"previously unimaginable level of American deficits, as Reagan simultaneously cut taxes while increasing defense spending.\" I'm certainly not an economic historian, but everything I've read tells me that the late 1970s were decidedly not a \"boom\" for the West, and that the inflation figures previously cited were far more related to President Carter's Federal Reserve Chair appointee Paul Volcker (he raised Federal Funds rate to 20% by 1981). --His coverage of Iran/Contra: reading Ambrose' narrative, it's almost impossible to tell that Congress concluded Reagan didn't know all the particulars of this foreign policy event. Ambrose writes in such a way as to portray Reagan as a mastermind of details (which he was decidedly not), places Iran/Contra on par with Watergate, and even questions why Congress simply didn't impeach Reagan (which would be odd, considering the same Congress found that Reagan himself did nothing illegal). He concludes that the scandal left Reagan's Administration \"seriously crippled.\" A mere three pages later, Ambrose begins to talk about \"the great triumph of Reagan's foreign policy\" in his \"arms-reduction treaty with the Soviets.\" For a crippled administration, they recovered rather well. These are just a few examples, and perhaps I'm being too harsh, but this type of conflated or dubious writing has always made me nervous. Again, an enjoyable read, but I'm certain that if I noticed details like the above, a more advanced historian would pick up far more."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63384708-rachel", "userReview": "Excellent overview of US foreign policy since WWII.

Before really getting into the Xs and Os, however, I thought it imperative that I familiarize myself with currents of thought regarding the foreign policy of the US of A. Given that setup, I eventually found myself grabbing a copy of \"Rise to Globalism\".Much like US foreign policy in the 20th Century, this book appears to have conflicting identities. I mean to say that to give this book an overall rating is difficult in that it has its four star highs and two star lows. Taking that into account, I decided to give \"Rise to Globalism\" a three star average rating for the reasons below:The book starts out strong with a very factually-based presentation of the thoughts, motivations, and actions of US policy makers starting with the presidency of FDR and the outbreak of WWII. We quickly move on to the Truman administration and kick off a path that blazes largely through the Cold War and the move/counter-move nature of foreign policy in a bipolar war.I found a lot of the conclusions from the first half of the book to be apt and quite informative for someone who had a basic grasp of the history, but perhaps was missing the connecting links behind the scenes. The information on the Truman and Eisenhower presidencies in particular was both wide in scope and deep in analysis and set the rest of the read up to be a net positive.Unfortunately, once the Kennedy and LBJ administrations find their ways into the story, things begin to move incrementally away from a presentation of pure fact to a bit of a mix of facts and opinionated conjecture. While that was bound to happen as the authors got closer to their own lived-through biases, it did induce a number of eye rolling moments from this reader as analysis transformed from a summary of connections to critiques of the goals and accomplishments of presidents.Add into that a slew of grammatical mistakes, and what was at start a promising survey of US foreign policy lost its luster if even a little bit. Given that most of the book was readable, I won't hold the authors wholly accountable, but it is an annoyance to be sure.With all of that said, I still feel as though I came away from reading \"Rise to Globalism\" a more informed individual and one ready to find more specified reading on the subjects covered.

The first several chapters were an enjoyable read and Ambrose certainly seems to have done his research. I did try to keep in mind that no matter how objective an author attempts to be, there will always be some form of personal opinion involved in the process, perhaps most noticeably in deciding which sources to use. So as I stated I was going along enjoying the book, minus the grammatical errors, and then Ambrose states that Reagan made a deal with the Iranians that he would supply them with arms if the Iranian government would hold on to the American hostages until after the election - which Reagan did end up winning. Now, I am by no means a huge Reagan supporter but this struck me as very unlikely. I did some digging on my own and sure enough, these claims were never substantiated. Whether or not these claims are true Ambrose, as a well-respected author, should not have presented this as fact. Mention the charges yes, but to say...\"Actually, Reagan had made a private deal with Khomeini (religious leader of Iran). If the Iranians would hold the hostages until after the election, the new Reagan administration would pay ransom for them in the form of arms for Iran. Khomeini badly needed the weapons for his war with Iraq, so the deal was struck.\" (301) It was at this point I decided not to finish the book; if an author will so blatantly produce unsubstantiated claims as facts then I do not believe that author is credible."}, {"userName": "Harold", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1962408-harold", "userReview": "I asked a history professor to recommend a good book about recent American History, after telling him I had no history background but read a lot of popular biographies and histories. This was the book he recommended. It is not typical Stephen Ambrose -- history as a story, and visa versa. While not being overly scholarly, this is the tale of American foreign policy in the cold war -- how did it start and what kept it going. The story of the beginning of the cold war is straightforwardly told, interesting and understandable, and provides a great backdrop for understanding American policy for the remainder of the cold war, and up to the present. After that, the book has a tendency to get preachy. Generally, to the extent that I recalled the history -- this isn't ancient history after all -- or had read a lot, I tended to agree with their assessments, but they were also unnecessary and superfluous, and not beyond question.Still, all in all, it was as good a course in the history of the cold war as I was likely to read.

Ambrose does cover most major American foreign policy initiatives, but he does so from a distinctly realist perspective, focusing predominantly on the games played by the so called \"Great Powers\" - most notably Russia and China. While this /focus/ is arguably justifiable, Ambrose would certainly have benefited by spending more time discussing the effects of US policies on the citizens of affected countries. For instance, he spends a significant amount of time discussing US policy in Nicaragua and the Iran/Contra scandal, but very little time on the perspective of Nicaraguans or the overall effect of US involvement in Nicaragua.tl;dr: solid basis for a study of US foreign policy from a realist perspective. Would benefit from more localized perspectives and coverage of lasting impacts."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4714889-michael", "userReview": "If you have zero knowledge about US Foreign Policy before the 1st Bush White House, then this book is not a bad primer. You wont find a great amount of detail about any single event but dont get this book expecting that. If you want a book about the Korean War, for instance, then buy a book about Korea, like Halberstams The Longest Winter. Rise to Globalism is a survey book, a Birds Eye view of history, as one person wrote. The portions covering Iraq and Afghanistan arent valuable really. Too brief, too rushed, without much valuable insight. The book suffers from too many editing errors which get progressively worse in later chapters, almost to the point of undermining the quality of the initial chapters and the entire book, really. Really deserves about 3.5 stars, since the latter part of the book, from 1993 on, sort of gives up."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12941864-dave", "userReview": "I was assigned this book in college and I pretty much skimmed it for class. Over 15 years later I decided maybe I should read it for real. I learned that it was updated with the assistance of Douglas Brinkley who is an excellent historian/writer. The chapters are divided into specific historical periods of huge influence concerning US foreign policy. Ambrose who was one of our greatest historians wrote this book in an easy flow. There aren't a billion quotes or talk of \"troop divisions\" or an inundation of military speak. Rather you get the goods on our role since 1938. We have been busy. He also has a section at the end that recommends some of the finest books for further reading concerning the periods he wrote about.This is a book for the college freshman or the history buff. Excellent read."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9871117-scott", "userReview": "I like to consider myself a fairly cultured and learned person who is up-to-date on most current affairs. I was deeply humbled at how much history I didn't know. I realized my knowledge of US foreign policy and world history (after WWII) was surprisingly limited to the perspective of my high school US History teacher. This book empowered me with knowledge. It's discussions are fairly brief and lively, but I do not have the sense that I am missing out or getting a skewed perspective of US foreign policy or contemporary world history. I really salute Ambrose for a wonderful read. Highly recommend to anyone who knows that, for instance, the Suez canal was a crisis -- or maybe even that it was a crisis in Egypt -- but who can't explain much more than that."}, {"userName": "Aimen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22523784-aimen", "userReview": "Before Chapter 2 even begun, my eyes were drooping. I feel bad reviewing this so harshly but this book has become my night time lullaby before I go to bed. I think the authors totally knew what they were talking about, missing information- sure, but it was mostly all knowledgable. I just had a very hard time getting through this book. Some parts were written like a story and was captivating but then all the explicit detail just had me zoned out. Overall? Not a good read, for a class or a normal day. It has many interesting facts and well written background but unless you're very very very very interested in boring factual, history- then you might not like this book.Plus I didn't like that the authors were constantly calling countries females.

The ninth edition of this classic survey, now updated through the administration of George W. Bush, offers a concise and informative overview of the evolution of American foreign policy from 1938 to the present, focusing on such pivotal events as World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, and 9/11. Examining everything from the Iran-Contra scandal to the rise of international terrorism, the authors analyze-in light of the enormous global power of the United States-how American economic aggressiveness, racism, and fear of Communism have shaped the nation's evolving foreign policy.", "title": "Rise to Globalism: American Foreign Policy Since 1938", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9151085-rise-to-globalism", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1311648403l/9151085.jpg", "reviews": 117, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5882.Stephen_E_Ambrose", "name": "Stephen E.
