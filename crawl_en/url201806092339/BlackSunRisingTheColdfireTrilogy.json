C.S. Friedman seems like an endearing author; her writing style can be lazy but it can also be interestingly quirky. so i feel we should spare the rod and spoil the child, a little bit at least. but only after a firm discussion!SLIGHT SPOILER: in the very beginning of the book, some creatures attack the lovely and saucy sorceress supreme Ciani and mind-suck her powers away. various characters assemble to journey into a sinister, uncharted land in order to find the nasty & subhuman culprits, deliver some payback, and so release Ciani's powers. okay, let's just get it out there: it is absolutely unacceptable that a bunch of random non-characters (including a father and his 2 daughters) and 1 major character have to die pretty horrific deaths, all so that some sexy enchantress can get her powers back. for chrissakes, her life was no longer in jeopardy! and PTSD that changes sex appeal into mousy forgetfulness just isn't a problem worthy of a body count. even worse, apparently the primary members of the party are automatically willing to just toss everything to the wayside and go on a deadly quest. things like a fianc\u00e9e, religious orders, and a magical Forest... all because:(1) an Awesome Sorceress should never be parted from her Awesome Powers.(2) a couple evenings of flirty banter can really impress a warrior-priest. oh come on! it was just some nights of convo and fine dining. they didn't even bone. he just \"has a feeling about her... could this feeling turn to love?\" UGH! hey asshole, is your spiritual calling so fragile that you'd give up everything so some wizard you barely know can continue to remain extra-powerful? who cares? both the egalitarian and the God-lover in me freaked out about this whole rationale.(3) apparently some piddly promise to protect said sorceress, made by an immortal vampire-sorcerer to a pleasure demon (best 2 characters), is enough to just up and change your entire life and go on a dangerous quest and maybe die. this is a guy who mainly spends his time hunting down various virgins stranded in his magic forest (to feast on their fears etc), which no doubt keeps his hands full. it was just so nonsensical. hey Idiot Vampire! why are you even on this stupid quest? you prey on humans. Ciani barely even likes you pal, she's the warrior-priest's gal! so, anyway: awesome character; absurd character motivation.(4) as far as Ciani herself goes, apparently \"She's Quite a Woman!\" - at least that's what multiple character say repeatedly, much to my annoyance.so that's it for the eye-rolling parts. they are a big part of the novel, even enough to give it 2 stars. but there's a lot of intriguing stuff too. the novel is set on a far-flung world in the far-flung future, a world where some natural energy source called \"the fae\" literalizes everyone's dreams, fears, desires, etc. so on this world you have to exercise a lot of emotional/mental/spiritual control. supernatural creatures do exist, they gain lives and personalities, and often want your blood and/or booty. simple magical devices work if you really, really believe in them. things like guns are more problematic because if you have any doubts, your gun is just going to explode in your hand. and faith now truly and tangibly works. thousands of people believing in something can actually create something super-powerful - like an impregnable-to-demons church! or... HELL! Hell exists because people believe in it, uh oh. and so do pleasure demons, which isn't so bad. in this world, people have varying levels of ability to work the fae and some folks like The Amazing Chiani are born with natural aptitude. the fae itself is also fascinatingly divided into different sorts of fae, based on which type of natural energy source they derive from, and they each have their own unique properties, abilities, weaknesses. for instance, there is earth fae. and the fae that comes from light. or the absence of light. or even from tidal forces - my personal fave. it was all so interesting and carefully developed and new to me that - complaints aside - it all still sorta worked."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "5.0 to 5.5 stars. C.S. Friedman is one of my favorite authors and I have never read one of her books that I haven't loved. I am in the process of re-reading her books after first reading them many years ago and I started with this one. The first book of the \"Coldfire\" trilogy, this book takes place on the planet Erna which was colonized by people from Earth over a thousand years ago. When the colonist first landed on Erna, they discovered the \"Fae\" which is a natural force that causes the thoughts of people (conscious, subconscious and unconscious) to manifest themselves physically. Thus the initial colonists were almost completely wiped out by creatures created by the Fae out of their darkest nightmares. Now, 1200 years later, the survivors live in a medieval like society where sorcerers and adepts help keep the Fae at bay. This concept of the Fae and its power to make manifest the thoughts of humans was fascinating and got me hooked on the story right away. In addition to the Fae and the many other original concepts explored in the book, the story also introduces the reader to two of the best fantasy/science fiction characters to come along in a while: Damien Vryce, the warrior priest, and Gerald Tarrant, the undead sorcerer.This is epic science fantasy at its best. Highest Possible Recommendation!!!"}, {"userName": "Mpauli", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8323869-mpauli", "userReview": "With Black Sun Rising, author C.S. Friedman transports us into a world of darkness, where your fears can manifest themselves to haunt and hunt you.Erna is a planet humans from earth reached via spacship and settled onto. This sounds like SF, but is just a backdrop for a dark fantasy novel.The society wasn't able to hold up to the level of progress of a spacefaring people. So, the atmosphere is more of a gothic victorian world. Think Bram Stoker's Dracula and you have a good picture.Eevryday life is affected by eartquakes, that are way more frequent than on our planet, the cycle of three moons and the omni-present earth-fae, particle-like creatures that can be manipulated to do magic.But the darkness is not only invoked by the setting, it comes right down to the characters. There is Reverend Damien Vryce, whose love for the adept Ciani will bring him to the point, where he has to ask himself how far he is willing to go to help Ciani in regaining her memory that was taken by a demon.Ciani herself has to struggle with the loss of her power and memory and needs to find a way to go on.Then there is Senzi, Ciani's business partner and friend, who longs to have power comparable to Ciani's.And finally we have Tarrant, the dark Hunter with the mysterious past and a vast amount of power.All of those are being confronted by one question: How far will you go to fullfill your deepest desire? The answers to this question is what makes this book so dark and bittersweet.I enjoyed this book a lot, although there were a few dragging parts I could have done without. The book ends in a good place and provides a glimpse of what to expect in the next installment."}, {"userName": "Ivan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31294609-ivan", "userReview": "This was great.Main plot has been seen many times.Fellowship travels to the hearth of darkness for good cause, in this case to restore hot sorceress power.Their travel will take them across Erna, planet who creatures and natural laws are shaped but it's inhabitants both conscious and subconscious mind.Erna itself is biggest reason for my high rating as it's one of most fascinating setting I came across.While this book is technically sci-fi (Erna is colonized planet) book play mostly plays out like heroic fantasy, in that way it reminds me a bit of first Dune book.One big annoyance that I have to mention is above mentioned hot sorceress.She starts as sassy badass but as soon as she losses her power she turns into frightened damsel and becomes very annoying for the rest of the book.She isn't annoying as some female characters in heroic fantasy can be (like Vin, Ce'Nedra, Nynaeve) but next to interesting fairly well flashed out characters characters like the priest Damian, Hunter and my favorite pleasure demon she really sticks out."}, {"userName": "Kris43", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076969-kris43", "userReview": "Im having a hard time with rating this. If I were to rate the world building and magic system, I would give it 5 stars, they are absolutely brilliant. This has strong sci-fi elements mixed with fantasy. The whole thing is happening in distant future. Humanity has moved to this planet that is totally different from planet Earth. It has something that at first looks like magic.It is inhabited by sentiment forces who feed on human emotions/blood/semen and can be tapped to fuel various things. But they can also be a unintentional corporal manifestation of our fears, darkest desires, nightmares, suppressed longings. They even evolve and in time become as we perceive them. They are called fey and respond to strong emotions, desires, focused prayers...or natural adepts. At first humanity had no idea of any of this. So you can imagine our horror when a first glimpse of our own ugliness became tangible and started shoving its true nature.... You know that one about abyss gazing back? Here it also walked, talked and wrecked havoc. All of our own making.Naturally humanity freaked and founded The Church to combat all these 'demons' and unholy abominations. It's Something between inquisition, warrior monks and witch hunters.Now moving on to this books weakest points. In my opinion they are characterization and character development and some mayor logical holes in plot and motivation. Some characters seemed a bit 2d and I couldn't always understand and relate to their reasons for doing stuff. Also sometimes as the plot moved on, I couldn't always answer why this was happening. Or why is it happening this way. You know, logical holes? If they are to big or to many of them the whole thing doesn't fit.So you can see why I'm having problems rating this. On one hand the world is stunning but characters and plot suffer for it at times. I wish I could give it 3,5. Because 4 seems to much and 3 not enough."}, {"userName": "Ben Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4615338-ben-johnson", "userReview": "Black Sun Rising is a brilliant setting with a mediocre story. A warrior-priest and his companions track a demon in order to restore one of their member\u2019s memories, but are forced into an alliance with perhaps the greatest evil of all: the former Prophet, damned by his own church and driven into a dark pact which brings both power and a vampiric curse. The novel sets up a variety of interesting themes but concludes its bloated story with cliches, a disappointment given the great world-crafting of C.S. Friedman.Black Sun Rising takes place on Erna, a planet whose original human colonists were driven back to the dark ages by the mysterious energy known as the Fae. The Fae both is and isn\u2019t magic in the traditional sense: while it is used for common wizardly purposes, it is also a product of Erna\u2019s ecosystem that grants human thoughts and, most dangerously, fears corporeality. Many humans have learned to Work it for their own uses and a few, known as Adepts, are born with the ability to both see and control the Fae effortlessly.Ciani is one of these Adepts, but she loses her powers in an attack by a mysterious group of demons for a somewhat poorly explained reason. Damien is a zealous priest of the Church who vows to restore Ciani\u2019s powers. He is accompanied by Ciani\u2019s assistant Senzei, who doesn\u2019t do much except be sad that he wasn\u2019t born an Adept as well. These three characters are all fairly one dimensional: Damien clings to black and white morality, Ciani has a thirst for knowledge that precludes morality, and Senzei just wants to be powerful.However, they are joined by a much more interesting person: Gerald Tarrant, Fae-vampire. Tarrant was a powerful Adept who finally turned the tide in the struggle against the Fae by founding a Church to discipline humanity\u2019s subconscious and thus limit the Fae\u2019s manifestations. However, the Church eventually damned all sorcerers, and so after death he will go to a hell that he has literally created from the Fae. To avoid this, he murders his family to make a pact with ambiguous dark forces that grants him eternal life and devastating powers in exchange for life as a literary cliche.The narrative is mostly told from Damien\u2019s point of view, and the book is at its best when dealing with Damien\u2019s conflicting emotions regarding his Prophet-turned-Vampire. Damien hates Tarrant with a religious passion but needs him as a weapon in his quest to help Ciani. He is forced to compromise his stark moral judgments, and enters areas of gray morality kicking and screaming. Likewise, the narrative needs Tarrant as a foil for the relatively simple characters to play off of, and as the only interesting character in the story.Black Sun Rising begins with Tarrant\u2019s savage murder of his wife and children, and Friedman does a good job of inserting enough instances of his savagery throughout the narrative to make you feel bad for liking him. But as the story develops Tarrant loses his mystique. He becomes more and more Dracula as his nature is explained, and the instances in which his powers are limited in order to generate tension feel contrived. Tarrant preserves his grip on what little humanity he has left by clinging to a personal sense of honor; he is the Honest Abe of vampires, for he will not tell a lie or go back on his word. His adherence to his self-imposed code is the primary way that the narrative justifies his involvement with Damien and his companions, but this mostly feels artificial.At one point in the story Tarrant is badly hurt and needs to drink blood in order to heal himself. Ciani is the only one with enough blood to spare, but Tarrant won\u2019t drink it because apparently he takes the form of his victim\u2019s fears, and Ciani is most scared of a demon; therefore, if he drinks her blood he will become a demon and attack. He has also sworn not to hurt Ciani. Hence the awkwardly contrived predicament. So he has to stay weak, and the protagonists can\u2019t rely on his powers, and thus narrative conflict is born. It\u2019s a strained way to go about generating tension because the author wants to preserve sympathy for Tarrant. I say, make him drink her blood. Make him go crazy and attack her. Kill her, for all I care (like all the other characters, Ciani not especially likable). Let Tarrant deal with the collapse of his artificial humanity and let\u2019s see what happens. Powerful moments in literature come from those kinds of severe shocks to a character\u2019s worldviews, and this novel does not go far enough in that regard.Rather than potent character development, Tarrant\u2019s preceding dilemma results in more of the run-of-the-mill action that bloats the novel to almost 600 pages. Some of the action is great; the scene in Tarrant\u2019s forest realm is particularly well done in it\u2019s dark aesthetic. But there are also scenes of earthquakes, and confrontations with various demons that presumably are manifested fears but seem to be generic fantasy tropes, and treacherous nighttime marches that, while none are boring per se, comprise action fodder that doesn\u2019t add much except reading time. While the time invested in the book lends itself toward investment in the book\u2019s characters, the character\u2019s developments over the narrative don\u2019t seem to warrant it. It feels more cheap substitute than effective strategy. Certainly the characters develop and change, but it could have been accomplished in a more efficient (and effective) way.As might be apparent from the preceding paragraphs, I enjoyed the set-up for this novel but was let down by the execution. The book primarily deals with the cliched theme of the corrupting influence of power, and near the end the book becomes almost pedagogical in this regard. It\u2019s disappointing because this concern is not as unique as the setting is capable of. What compelled me the most was the ecological nature of the Fae; as a product of Erna\u2019s ecology, I think it would have been interesting to explore more of humanity\u2019s relationship to the environment. For example, what does it mean when a religion\u2019s reality is fundamentally linked to one planet in a galaxy full of them? Where is the division between humanity and ecology when nature can manifest human fears and desires, and when evolution is driven by human perception? This is only the first book in the series, so it\u2019s possible that some of those questions are investigated later. I just find them more compelling than the cliched \u201cpower corrupts\u201d theme, and wish they had been the focus from the start.Worst of all, the seeds are clearly sown for Tarrant\u2019s ultimate redemption from his life of evil (I\u2019m guessing in some sort of grand sacrifice to save Erna). While this isn\u2019t bad in and of itself, it just feels too familiar. I want an evil character who stays evil. I want the series to take the moral ambiguities that so stressed Damien and drive them to an even greater extreme, an extreme that truly challenges Damien\u2019s world-view and which cannot be ignored. As it is, Damien is able to preserve his moral compass; I want Tarrant to obliterate that compass as Damien is forced into deeper and deeper reliance on Tarrant\u2019s evil. I want Damien driven to the brink of insanity, maybe over the edge, and then I want to see how he responds. Friedman doesn\u2019t take enough chances in Black Sun Rising, and I\u2019m hesitant to read another two 600 page books just to see if she will later on. Who knows, maybe I\u2019d be pleasantly surprised by the sequels. But with so many other books waiting to be read, I\u2019m not rushing to find out."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Okay...this is another I'd like to give 3.5 as it's got to be above a 3 but I didn't care for it as much as I have many of the books I've given a 4.It has an interesting \"world system\". I don't think the term \"magic system works well here as it all has to do with the planet or world on which the action takes place. (To say more would of course entail spoilers). This book might be more accurately called \"science fantasy\" rather than epic or high fantasy as it's built around the assumption of an earth colony that arrived on this planet and then had to deal with the forces on and of the world of Erna that they were in no way equiped to understand or handle.I found this book at times to be of the \"neither fish nor fowl\" variety to some extent. I liked the idea(s) that it's built on and the world building though I'm not sure the introduction to this world and it's specialness was done all that well. It's an attempt to inculcate the needed details into the narrative without doing a lot of plot exposition atop the storyline, plot and dialogue. A good way to do things when it works. here I think it bogged down a bit and often (for a while in the early chapters) had the reader going\"okay...now how does that work?\" Still it does eventually get roughly laid out and while we still have a lot of nebulous edges and loose ends to the system i assume she means it to be that way. A great deal of the plot is that humans are \"still after all this time\" trying to understand and learn to work with the plant's forces.I found that while I got to know the people in this book the only one I really \"liked\" all that much was the priest Damien. I was never drawn into the \"feeling\" I think I was supposed to have for the others. This was the third time I'd set out to read this book. It wasn't that I \"disliked it\" I'd say I really \"liked it\" (I mean I gave it 4 stars based on my 3.5 liking) but I just never got heavily \"involved\" in it. On both prior occasions I laid it down and got involved in reading other things and just, never got back to it. that almost happened this time. I'm always into more than one books at a time and , true to what happened before I got into a few others and this one just didn't \"cry out to me\" to get back to it. I did as we are reading it in a group and as I said, it's \"pretty good\". I enjoyed much of it...I just can't say it really \"drew me in\". I could have lived without getting to the books end.I have the two books following this one on my shelf and I will (hopefully) get to them \"before too long\". I don't know. I have a huge to be read pile of books, so we'll see. I'm just thankful for the abundance. After all too many books is better than not enough. They are such fragile things.Okay, not a bad read, well written, enjoyable and interesting (mostly). As I said, 3.5...rounds to a 4."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: I have mixed feelings on this book. Sometimes it was a 2 star, sometimes 4, and in the end I settled on 2.5 rounded up. I wanted to like it more than I actually did.Audiobook: One of the things that attracted me to doing this book was how much I enjoyed R.C. Bray as the narrator of The Martian. He's quite good here, but at some points he's \"too good\". What do I mean by that? Well his voices for some of the characters are so spot on the description as to be jarring, and I'd spend most of the time focused on my irritation at the voice over what was being said. Thankfully those characters didn't talk very much.The rest of the time he was quite enjoyable as a narrator. I don't think those voices were enough to detract from his narration as a whole. I think audio's a good option here. Hopefully you won't find those same voices as grating to your concentration as I did. \nFull Review\nThis one wasn't on my radar at all before a friend suggested it for a buddy read. It sounded like an interesting mix of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I was thinking maybe something along the lines of Star Wars.This book may as well have been straight fantasy however. There is very little science to speak of. Apparently humans have settled another planet and found a way to harness it and some of the creatures who live there as a form of magic. Technology as we know it seems pretty non-existent.After a pretty intense and interesting prologue, I found the early parts of this book quite slow. Things did pick up later, but then I'd find myself growing distracted/uninterested in what was going on. This made for a very uneven pace to the story. That may be in part due to my general dislike of most of the characters. The book describes Damian as a warrior, but in truth he's a paladin. When paladins aren't off heroically saving people in need, they seem to spend their time judging everyone else who can't live up to their lofty standards. Damian isn't quite this bad, but he does have his moments.I initially was the most interested in Cianni, but her character development throughout this book was not to my liking. Her assistant mostly got on my nerves.The most interesting character was the Hunter, but he's was very hard to like for many of the same reasons that made him interesting.I'm very much a fan of character-driven story, so when I don't connect well with the characters, it almost always hurts my enjoyment of the book.The world building, and the magic systems were both pretty interesting. They felt pretty unique from most fantasy I've read, and that's always hard to do.Overall I felt like the pacing issues and my general dislike of the characters cost this book at least a star, possibly more. A strong ending and interesting world building helped to make up for things.I'm still unsure if I'll continue on with the series. The ending has peaked my interest to know what comes next, but for now I'm not going to be rushing out to pick up the second book."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44434125-dawn", "userReview": "A re read for me. Read this back in the early '90's and completely forgot everything.The good:I liked the writing style in that it is very descriptive and shows more than tells. Tarrant and the priest were well developed and complex characters and I loved them both.The world building was fantastic..beyond fantastic! The pace was steady with good conflict and I did not skim.The bad:MC Ciani was a useless and underdeveloped charcter. She was not used to her full potential. I cared nothing about her which nearly ruined the entire story since it was her that was supposed to be the driving force behind the group's entire journey and the risks they decided to take for her with their lives. I didn't feel the \"love\" the priest had with her and didn't feel her importance as an adept or friend to Senzei. I kept wondering why these two care about her so much? Why did Tarrant care about her? Lame lame lame....I was expecting her character to become this awesome poweful source that would save them all.. and it never happened. The author could have eliminated her character completely and I wouldn't have noticed or cared.The ugly:The \"romance\" between Ciani and the priest was horrible...Non existant! They met, they fucked, he supposedly loved her, she lost her memory, forgot about him..never said she loved him, and when she got her memory back..still didn't give a shit about him. He leaves her behind and chalks it up to.. \"we are too different people from two different worlds.\" If there was more than an entire paragraph within the whole book dedicated to their \"romance\"I'd be surprised.Why have them even together? It was unnecessary and pointless.Lastly, I felt no sense of urgency or fear. No feeling of being on the edge of my seat. There was a definate lack of emotional impact.Overall:I enjoyed it for the most part and plan to continue the series out of curiosity.Would I recommend? If you are a die hard fantasy lover and can get this book for free or low cost then yes. If you like romance or are looking for a kick ass heroine.. then no.Safety: Blood, gore and violence.

The story is all over the place. The book begins with a certain premise and plot, but completely jumps into another plot and this keeps happening with addition of more characters and concepts that after a certain point it just becomes too much for a reader to take.2. You don't give a damn about characters.We get introduced many characters in this book, but as the plot keeps jumping all over the place we are not introduced to a single character properly.Also what drives these guys, is the big question I have and not a single character answers this question for me.3. What exactly is genre of this book?I don't mind when author mixes his genre but there has to be some solid foundation and rules of how things work in his world.The biggest issue was I did not get after reading almost 80% of the book how exactly things work on Urna, neither was I interested in finding out.I give this book 1 star."}, {"userName": "Pax", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1063493-pax", "userReview": "I finally made it to the end of this awful book, mostly by skipping about eighty pages in the latter half (figured out what I'd missed within five repetitive pages, and no need to slog through) and then skimming the rest.All in all, this writer had a good idea, some fun character interplay potential and NO EDITING. As in, where was her EDITOR??? This could have been trimmed to less than half its dense, repetitive mass with such greater impact. Apparently this is part one of a trilogy -- the rest of which I shall do without, thank you -- and she probably could have gotten all three books into one really great novel and been done with it.All well. I hung on, though I don't usually do so with writing this bad. I guess my devotion to female sci-fi writers was my undoing in this case.------Fun mix of sci-fi and fantasy. I had read the prologue of Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson, and felt the entire time I'd fallen into a bizarre world of male sci-fi. Then, I opened this up, read the prologue and nearly laughed with delight at the utterly female writer-ness of it.It's pretty good so far, though she does that switching narrator thing so often that it gets a little annoying. Some fun mysteries yet to be figured out.Okay, further along now. About halfway through actually. This book is so slow that it is nearly painful. Definitely not riveted, which seems a shame since the concepts are very fun and full of potential, and even her turn of phrase is good. But the PACING, oy.

Back then I used chain-read Andre Norton but I can tell you very little about as it has been mostly eradicated from my memory to make room for all the plotlines of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Therefore I can\u2019t tell you if C.S Friedman writes badly or whether she is in line with other fantasy writers and what is considered the norm in the genre.\u201cShe kneed her unhorse gently into motion again and tried to lose herself in memories of her family, as a means of combating the uneasiness that had been growing in her since she left the Bellamy household nearly an hour earlier. Her daughter Alix, barely five, had already [...]. Tory, nine, had [\u2026]. Eric, the oldest [\u2026]\u201dThis is not a very sophisticated way to introduce characters (very minor ones as well), almost as bad as having the characters look in the mirror to describe their looks. So there is this sort of lazy writing and there are characters who say every other page \u2018God help us\u2019 or \u2018gods help us\u2019, depending on which denomination they belong to. But that\u2019s nothing, it could still be a four star read because the world, in which the nature produces currents which respond to psychic stimulus and can take a physical form, is a fascinating and intricate one. There is an outline of a religious conflict between the old religion (based possibly on Christianity brought to the planet by its colonisers from Earth) which rejects any use of those magic-like currents and all the new religions invented on the planet which pretty much base themselves on the fae \u2013 the currents. But instead of this fascinating story of high politics, religion and magic, we have a lame tale of a girl, Chiani, who lost her special powers and a group of men who, for god (or gods) know what reason decide to help her get them back, even if it means risking their lives.We have the priest who has a bit of a crush on Chiani, which is why he decides to ruin his career and go against everything he believes in just to help her, while still acting like a self-righteous prick when he is forced to accept help from someone who seems to be not a very good person at all (we will call him the Lesser Evil). The Lesser Evil puts up with the self-righteousness of the Self-Righteous prick and generally acts in a very honourable way and is the most interesting and three-dimensional character, which is quite funny because he is supposed have no human soul left in him. I don\u2019t know how Friedman managed to make her inhuman character the most human of them all but it probably wasn\u2019t intentional.Oh, and there is this one more character, so superfluous that you can\u2019t help but wonder if he is going to be killed off somewhere along the way.The four of them set off to get Chiani her magicks back. Chiani\u2019s motivation is obvious but the rest of them follow because of some peculiar mix of honour debt, loyalty, and simply having hots for her. The fact that they are actually saving the world (and therefore themselves) at the same time seems to constantly escape them, when focusing on that would just make a lot more sense and make their motives logical.In the end it\u2019s a fairly enjoyable read but you are left thinking that there is a better story happening somewhere else in that world."}, {"userName": "Chris ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956959-chris", "userReview": "There were some good elements of story here, and some good world concepts. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The prose is choppy, full of adverbs and redundancies. If I had to hear \"he smiled grimly\" one more time, I was prepared to gouge out my eardrums (I listened to the audio, obviously). The plot drags on and on. And on. And on some more. Events take forever to set up, and then when something does happen, I'm like \"what the hell? Where did that come from? Should I rewind? Oh, Hell no. I don't care.\"I didn't like the characters, for the most part. There were three main ones: Gerald Tarrant, a fairly interesting anti-hero; Ciani, the female protagonist, and Damien, the male protagonist. Well, I liked Gerald Tarrant pretty well, was indifferent to Ciani one way or the other, and I disliked Damien.The dialogue was pretty horrible too, and probably the reason I didn't like the characters. They sounded like heroes from a bad B-movie and even Tarrant sounded more like a Scooby-Doo villain half the time than a normal person. So why 2 stars rather than 1? Well...I didn't hate it. I just didn't care for it much. I've heard great things about this book and the rest of Friedman's series, so there's a chance I'll continue some day.

No idea why - it just doesn't click with me.It is written emotionally - don't get me wrong, it isn't a romance or anything, but I much prefer a style that is more matter of fact and way faster paced. So all these things don't make it a bad book at all - they just mean it isn't the perfect book for me!The plot itself is interesting and the prose is fine, even if it isn't my favorite.

Having completed this novel I admit that I am slightly torn about it as an entire experience. On the whole it is not quite as great a read as other novels I have rated four stars, yet at the same time there are large patches of the novel which are five star quality. These patches unfortunately mix with the three and two star patches. The biggest - issue - I had with Black Sun Rising, and the biggest drawing point of the novel, is that compared to other similar fantasies it is very alien. It features a world - Erna - which humanity has colonised in a distant future and upon which a new religious Church has been established. Centuries after the initial colonisation, Erna proves to be a difficult land for the people of Erna to truly settle. This is due to the mystical natural force which exists strongly throughout the planet: the fae. The fae is a force which responds to emotion, both good and bad, and shapes reality around it - leading in some places to the creation of demons and other nightmares. The magic system of this world stems from the fae as there are certain individuals who can manipulate it. Some can only learn to Work the fae as a power source, allowing them abilities to influence individuals, Heal individuals and Know things within the minds of others. In other words the fae acts as a physical supernatural presence within the novel's worldscape. Others are born with a more natural ability to See the fae around them and wield the power of that fae. However, while the fae is neither good nor evil, there are some currents within this fae which can only be channelled with more darker acts - such as human sacrifice or regular blood-letting. It is this conflict between good and evil which is nicely balanced and provides fascinating challenges within the plot.The plot itself follows the efforts of a priest by the name of Damien and his companions as they set off to find a group of monstrous creatures who have sucked the memories and powers of the adept Ciani. Along their journey they form uneasy alliances and discover secrets about the fae and about those who manipulate the fae that could alter the course of Erna's future. Unfortunately the book itself does end with a sort of cliff-hanger promise, yet I am intrigued enough to want to read on.One of the elements I disliked in the book was the romantic entanglements. Mainly in that there were several archetypes played upon such as 'respectable woman goes for bad boy' - even though that relationship was not particularly one of romance, as much as a master/apprentice relationship that hinted at something sensual. The other trope that was played upon was the whole idea of the 'heroic jealous male', with him sensing the rivalry for the affections of the aforementioned woman, from all the other men around him. Personally the way this all worked out in the writing seemed to convey a kind of twisted sense of love and I wasn't quite sure the author had a particular sense as to what she wanted to so with these ideas. In other words, to me, it felt as if the author had become like a fan and had fallen for certain ways of 'shipping' characters together.One of the other issues in this book is connected more to the prose than anything else. As can be common in fantasy, the themes and ideas overwhelm the ability of the author's writing and many phrases and descriptions are reused with annoying regularity throughout the plot. However, until fantasy can be recognised for its great literary ability again this will continue to be part of the norm.That aside this is a remarkable effort of worldbuilding. At times the book feels like a science fiction novel (without the guns, the spacecruisers or the technology) and at other times it feels like a solid fantasy novel. It is a use of disparateness and similarity that creates a world utterly alien and at the same time vaguely familiar, a world of nightmare and dreams. If you want to enter a reading experience with a world such as this featured within it then give this book a try."}, {"userName": "Neda Stojkovic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3337077-neda-stojkovic", "userReview": "I slogged through about half of the book, thinking maybe it will get better - I heard a lot of praises for this trilogy, so I expected something quite different. But I give up. I'm done. No more.One reason why this book gets two and not one star is the magic system, which is interesting, if confusing - humans can use, consciously or unconsciously, natural forces of the planet Erna (called fae) to, well, do stuff, like materialize fantasies or nightmares, or change reality in accordance to their purpose. So we have quite a different natural world then on Earth - evolution works according to the need of the creature, and humans unknowingly with their research created their rival species on the planet. Not the Star Trek story here - humans immediately tried to commit genocide, causing rakh (said species) to flee and try to protect themselves, creating demons which plague humans. Or something.So, that's the good start.Then we have our main characters - kind of vampire/evil fae/ex-human, priest (faith is the weapon of mass destruction here), chick/ex-adept in magic and kind of sidekick of the said chick go on a quest, searching for stolen...I don't know...adept-ness of the chick (she can't do magic anymore). Ok, good. There is even kind of girl-rakh, though I didn't follow that through. What I don't understand is why every character in this book just have to be so damn unlikable. Every time I kinda try to like somebody, he/she just do something to make me mad (or indifferent, honestly, I didn't think that possible). Or he/she isn't there anymore. I don't like the chick, I don't know why her co-characters like her, and why they want to help her. We don't know anything about her, except some vague things about her vitality, and some flirty stuff whith the priest, all vague. Really. Kind-of-vampire had some promise, but not much charm. Priest has the personality of a brick wall. And sidekick...I almost forgot that he is in the book. So they travel, and thare is some kind of fight, and I thought, yay, now we'll see some good, quality character interaction, and maybe author will permit us to get to know them all a bit. And then...kind-of-vampire and chick just go. Puff! Somewhere.And that was the last straw.

It's kind of difficult to rate this book. I loved some things and I disliked others. The world-building and the magic system are really original and well-written and the characters are quite complex and well-developed, but sometimes the plot itself bored me. All in all I did like the book but there are some things that bothered me. First of all the book felt really slow. I mean, I get why all these pages were needed, but at the same time I was bored anyway sometimes. I also had problems with Ciani; she pissed me off so freaking much and what bothers me most is that I don't even know why!I liked the other characters though, which helped because otherwise I don't think I would have been able to enjoy Black Sun Rising like I did. I also appreciated that all the characters were complex and well-developed and even if I had mixed feelings about them I would still be impressed by Friedman's skills as a writer. The magic system is extremely interesting. The fact that the fae is a natural force and the biggest part of this system is unique and something that I'd never really heard of, which was a pleasant surprise. However I admit that while I was impressed with it I didn't love it. I think that that's the reason why I liked Black sun rising but I couldn't bring myself to love it: I was impressed with Friedman's ideas, but that doesn't mean that I actually liked them all.

We've barely been introduced to our main characters when suddenly they are thrust into their Designated Quest, supposedly in part because of the deep feelings two of the characters apparently formed for each other virtually overnight. Also, I couldn't tell if one character's Secret Identity was really supposed to be a secret from the reader or not, since it seemed glaringly obvious to me from the beginning, so the unraveling of that particular mystery by the other characters struck me as tedious.
