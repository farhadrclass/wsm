I loved Deirdre sass and her fire but I would have probably loved it more if she had been a warrior like Marie. Deirdre was by far the most mature and dynamic character out of the three girls. (Marie, Riona & Deirdre.)I loved the prophecy! I enjoyed watching on how that played into everything. I read and read and read. And enjoyed the ride. I liked how they kept God in there but they didn't over do it. Alric was gold. I was thoroughly impressed with how they showed that he had a mistress. Like yeah him as a 'heathen' would have had one.Ricbert was a messed up little 'ish' like come on? Your own mother \"makes your blood boil.\" (aka turns you on) You know that's just sick. Ethlinda was persistent I'll give her that to hold a grudge for 30 years. I live with and sleep with the man you wanted to kill. Well three claps for you my friend.I thought it was splendid that Winsor showed spiritual forces at work.I was wondering where Cairell was all that time. Like he was Deidre's whole reason for traveling and after a while he just fades into the background.Cairell trying to killing Alric for defending his sister's honor. Three claps for you sir.All in all REALLY good book. Read if 1. You like Christian fiction. 2. You like non-smutting romance. 3. Historical Fiction."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642306-dawn", "userReview": "While this one isn't my favorite of this series (that belongs to the first book), it is still an engaging read. I can't say that I really adore the characters either. But the fight for Christianity in the early centuries of Ireland was well done. It's still a book I don't mind rereading when the mood fits me, and that was the case this time. I love how Alric changes once he comes to know Christ as his Savior.Anyway, it's still a good read, rich in historical details. I recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction, all things Celtic, Linda Windsor's other books.Rating - 3.5 stars really."}, {"userName": "Megan Lewis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21509850-megan-lewis", "userReview": "Hmmmm. I thought many thoughts while reading this book about what I would say in my review. Part of me is hesitant to give only 2 stars because I did enjoy the book, however it falls short of other books I've read and enjoyed. Firstly - the cover is atrocious. The book is better. So, don't judge the book by this cover. And don't just take my star rating or review as the final word - read it for yourself. Secondly - the writing was mediocre. Often I found myself a bit lost in the story because the author did not set the scene well enough for the audience to follow along. Certainly, many parts were well written and captivating, but I've read books with far better writing. Thirdly - the storyline was rather predictable, BUT it was intriguing enough to keep me to the end. The story could have benefitted greatly from some foreshadowing. A little bit of shock-factor would have been good - by that I mean, I would have appreciated a moment where I went \"I can't believe I didn't see that coming!\" It's not impossible, as many books as I've read (even recently) my favourites gave me that shock. Truthfully, I read this book because I enjoyed the first in the series \"Maire\" when I read it several years ago. I was not entirely disappointed, but my expectations were not entirely met either."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26546888-april", "userReview": "Windsor writes a beautiful, adventurous & captivating conclusion to The Fires of Gleannmara series! This story and it's characters had me eagerly devouring the pages, and staying up way too late last night to do so! Our hero and heroine encounter many hardships and assaults, the likes of which surely try ones faith. The question is will you trust Him in all circumstances? Is God truly your Refuge, Hope and Shield? These are things that will be played out in the story, along with several other insights into faith and love.I will admit this story needs better editing ... I am not sure if the transition into an Ebook caused the problem or not. But there were several places where the period was left off at the end of a sentence. A little confusing at times but it did help that the next sentence still had the first word in caps. Really not a big deal and easy to overlook, especially as the story was so wonderfully told. Bravo on a wonderful series and great conclusion!Overall I give it 4 & 1/2 Stars,"}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9576361-gloria", "userReview": "A fitting end to the trilogy: all three heroines found fitting husbands in their times. Alric was alerted to the ship with the ransom for Dierdre's brother by a mysterious merchant. Alric's family has undercurrents of treachery as his step-mother has hated that his father loved the slave that was Alric's mother along with other things from the past.Dierdre refuses to believe that God wants her to marry Alric until she was given an uncommon spiritual gift to convince both her and the priest, Scanlan. However, her growing love is tempered by the fact that Alric still does not trust God, but believes that their marriage might bring political advantage. The ending reveals who it was that told Alric about the ransom and the author gives some supernatural scenes near the end of the book."}, {"userName": "Margaret Chind", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226769-margaret-chind", "userReview": "This book was mostly fabulous. The last few chapters were not quite wonderful, but the rest of the book was really enjoyable. I literally was giggling at some points and even gasped at others. This is the third in a series and where the first book was great, and the second was not so thrilling this one was a very adventurous and pleasant read. It even has a twinge of remembrance to  Bride Most Begrudging that I found humorous and fun. Deirdre, Princess of Gleannmara is a wonderful woman of God and throughout the book she gives me more and more hope and guidance of the idea of what a prayer-life could really be like if you try and do not despair. Jeremiah 29:11 is the main theme written throughout this book and it is a wonderful one."}, {"userName": "Jeni Enjaian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4680796-jeni-enjaian", "userReview": "I remember being slightly disappointed with this book the first time around. After absolutely falling in love with the second book in the series, this one would have had to have been pretty spectacular for me not to rank it lower than the second. I never really got into the story or developed any affinity for the characters.Unlike the previous two books, the miracles in this book stank of deus ex machina. They really did not make sense either. Alric's conversion felt a little too forced even though I could see how Windsor structured his background to lay the seed. In the end it just felt a tad too unbelievable which is really disappointing because of the \"height\" of the second book and because this is the final book in the series.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, just not quite as much as Maire or Riona."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30209178-rebecca", "userReview": "\"Deirdre\" is the third book in the \"Fires of Gleannmara\" series and a book I highly recommend. The story starts off with Deirdre sailing to Albion with ransom money to try to save her abducted brother. Of course along the way things don't really go as planned as her ship is captured by Saxon pirates. Deirdre is given the ultimate challenge to 'love thine enemy' though she would love nothing more than to run him threw with a sword. This is the first book I ever read by Linda Windsor. She has the wonderful talent of combining the historical, the romantic and the physical and spiritual battles all into one book."}, {"userName": "LizetteMonet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20443480-lizettemonet", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book. It was the very first book in the series that I read, and I liked it SO much that I wanted to read Mair and Riona. I read this around 15 years old. I tried reading it now without rolling my eyes, and I couldn't. Lol. The writing is gorgeous and really captures the time and space of Ireland. The story telling was right on, but my tastes has changed over the years and its kinda hard for me to get into these romantic fairy-tale type books. I recommend it though, for anyone whose interested in a spin on Irish folk tales."}, {"userName": "Karijean31", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642447-karijean31", "userReview": "I am done with the triology finally. I like her books because at the beginning the male character is heathen and disbelieving of God and by the end of the book, the character has taken a journey of growing and changing and is believing of God. The journey's were a lot of fun and of course that journey is taken with \"their love\" and the women are all beautiful and wonderful. I'm so cheesy. I can't get enough of that kind of stuff...plus no swearing.

It was a good story but for some reason I could only get interested in certain sections of it. The story seemed to drag a bit. It could be because of my editing my own book right now.

The illegitimate son of a Saxon king and an enslaved Scottish princess, Alric no more believes in his mother's deathbed vision of his \"kingdom\" than he does in her Christian God.
