Had I paid a trade paperback price for this, I would have been out of my mind with disappointment.Gray Montgomery is a Dallas cop working undercover, and off the record, to avenge his partner's death on the job. Faith Malone is the office manager at Gray's new job at a Houston security firm, and her mother is the suspected killer's accomplice. Gray takes this job to get close to Faith to see if she's in cahoots with her mother.While tapping her phones and invading her privacy illegally (how romantic) the two begin a flirtation. You see, Faith is looking for a dominant man to call all the shots in and out of bed and Gray is looking to do some shot calling. Slam dunk, right? Of course not. Naturally he has to fight his attraction. Why? I don't know. We're never really given a reason. So Faith goes after him. Wicked submissive of her, amirite?To be fair, Gray does call Faith on her topping from the bottom, but the book gets no less silly. The mysteriously rich sex club owner Damon, on a short, professional acquaintance, offers his Galveston beach house for her solo use for a week (and sends her there via chauffeured Bentley) so she can think about her Gray dilemma. Uh-huh. Sure.Right after she leaves, Gray's partner's father shows up in Houston all lathered up about the suspected killer being nearby. Gray and the people her works with, aka the Cast of Future Heroes, hatch a plan to set a trap to catch the bad guy, who's after Faith to try to kidnap and ransom her. Gray is then sent to Galveston to \"protect\" Faith with the command from her father to not tell her about all this trouble (foreshadowing should be subtle, this screams INCOMING BIG MISUNDERSTANDING, no?)What follows is some light D/s play, some backdoor action, a borderline creepy threesome with her friend Micah and enough showering to drain the Great Lakes. Banks' falls into the trap of telling rather than showing when she writes sex. There's a lot of play-by-play where she tells us what cocks are doing to body parts and a major lack of emotion and reaction. Gems include, \"He continued to thrust against her until finally he stopped....Then he eased out of her body with a gentle pop.\" So. Not. Hot.The conclusion to the suspense has more gaping holes than a porn actress after a gang bang. What the hell was Mick on about by leading the bad guy to Galveston? Why was he so mean to Faith? Did the bad guy actually kill Gray's partner? Why was Gray unarmed? Why did the bad guy leave Faith where she could escape? Why would Faith believe an armed madman's word over Gray's and who the hell asks questions of an armed madman? Surely her relationship drama could've waited.All told, this book was a chore to read. The secondary characters were woefully underdeveloped, the D/s rather vanilla, the sex tepid and the prose dry. It was a disappointment, as I enjoyed the Samhain books of hers that I read. I doubt I'll read book two, unless I win a copy of that as well."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "4 \u00bd stars \u2013 Romantic Suspense/Erotica/BDSM/M\u00e9nageThis is a rather deep look into the makings of a Dominant/submissive relationship that encompasses both sexual and emotional fulfillment with a satisfying romantic suspense plot thrown in for extra measure. The H/H, dominant cop Gray and sweet, natural submissive Faith, are very likable characters, as are all the secondary characters. There are several hotties (sex club owner Damon and fellow security agents Connor, Nathan, and Micah) that I hope to see as lead characters in future books in the series, especially yummy Dom Micah. Although it\u2019s scorching hot, with some light bondage, a m\u00e9nage, D/s play, and minor details described of various public escapades being performed at a sex club, there\u2019s nothing overly kinky, and the story and character development aren\u2019t hindered by the frequency and duration of the erotic scenes.If submitting to a dominant man means experiencing an over abundance of orgasms, being physically and verbally worshipped, decadently bathed, and lavishly pampered, having my hair brushed and played with, eating extravagant meals that are prepared for me, and getting tons of naps...just tell me where to sign up...Sweet Surrender indeed! 4 \u00bd stars!"}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestFirst, can I just say that I love how on the back of my edition it says \"mature audience\"? Like someone who isn't mature is going to throw up their hands and be all, \"Whoops, I'm out.\" Just like how nobody ever lies on those websites that ask, \"Are you really 18?\" (Fun fact: once, when I was sixteen, I attempted to access an adult fanfiction site and a dialogue box popped up asking me if I was 18. Being the honest person I am, I clicked \"no.\" I was booted and blocked from the site. Because yay, honesty.) This warning on the cover was just the first sign of the glorious things to come. (Tee-hee, come.) And while I could totally take advantage of all the opportunities for giggles this book offers oh-so-temptingly, I have turned over a new leaf. I am going to try very hard (tee-hee, hard) to be mature while writing this review, because I no longer have to lie on internet pop-up dialogue boxes. I am a mature audience.***WARNING: SPOILERS AND MATURE CONTENT******Are you over 18? Y/N?***\u00a0 I'd heard that the Sweet series was a more \"realistic\" portrayal of BDSM than the Grey series, and while that's not necessarily setting the bar super high, the concept of a bunch of loosely connected story lines revolving around a high-class BDSM dungeon/play room/etc. did sound interesting.SWEET SURRENDER is about Faith, a woman who wants to be dominated and have a man call all the shots. Gray Montgomery gets involved with Faith because the man who killed his cop partner is associated with Faith's degenerate mother. The father of his partner, Mick, thinks that if he manages to get close to Faith, he'll learn more about the man who killed Gray's partner and be able to get revenge since neither of them really believe that the police department is doing their due diligence. Since this is a romance novel, you know that Gray is going to see Faith as more than a means to an end, though. Unless by \"end\" you mean \"that booty.\".SWEET SURRENDER has an okay start, but quickly dive bombs into serious problem territory. I'll be the first to admit that I'm no expert in BDSM, but I have some friends who are into it, and I've also looked things up on Google. And based on my limited knowledge, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm fairly sure that this is a very poor reflection of what the BDSM community is like. It's more like an idealization of what the 1950s \"Shut-Up-Honey-A-Man-Is-Talking\" male was like.Well, it wouldn't hurt to read up on it. At least then she'd have a better idea of how to find this elusive creature: the dominant male.God, she made it sound like an endangered species. But in today's world, she supposed they were. A dying breed. Emasculated by a politically correct society (26).Was she just another woman all too willing to give up control in the bedroom, live for the fantasy then forget the whole thing the next morning? It wasn't as if he hadn't had his fill of those women.Oh, they were more than willing to play a role, one that only extended to the bedroom, but when it was over with, they became a completely different woman.He wasn't into pretend shit. He wasn't some damn puppet to have his strings pulled then be put back on the shelf until it was time to play again (52).1. Isn't \"fantasy\" exactly the point in BDSM? From what I was given to understand, I thought it was about release (and not necessarily just sexual release).2. What he's talking about is total power exchange, which isn't reflective of what all dominants want.3. He's kind of an asshole - and a judgmental one, too.\"More women wouldn't mind a man being the proverbial man of the house if he didn't abdicate his responsibility. If he took that responsibility seriously\" (82).\"Men love a submissive woman,\" Damon said simply. \"Even when they say they don't\" (188). This isn't even about BDSM, but for Faith, the two ideas are one and the same. Dominant = household provider who makes all the decisions. If that's what people are into, then cool, you know, whatever floats your boat. I'm all about that choice. BUT, I find it incredibly problematic to suggest that female empowerment comes from women having \"no choice but to step up to the plate\" because \"a man isn't willing to accept responsibility\" (82). Sometimes women want to step up to the plate because they want to step up to the plate and men have absolutely no involvement in the equation.At some point, Faith goes to The House, that swanky BDSM club, and gets a tour from Damon, who is actually pretty respectful and sexy AF. (His book is the next one - and since I bought the whole series, I'm hoping that it's better than this one was. You better not ruin Damon, Banks!)While on her tour, Faith sees two men having sex:When the first man gently moved his lips over the other man's cock, Faith's pulse began racing. The sight should repulse her. Something told her that it should, but just as quickly she discounted that absurd notion (117).Um. Why should that repulse her?While snooping in Faith's house, Gray sees the appointment for Faith's tour in her planner and decides to crash the party. He kicks out the Dom working Faith over and takes over. Afterwards, they talk about it - or Faith tries to. Gray tries to brush her off and then says:\"Don't be crude, Faith. It doesn't suit you\" (137).By this point, I am side-eying Gray - GRAY, GREY, I sense a theme...men named after colors are controlling dicklords - like nobody's business. I really don't find the controlling, stalking, possessive alphahole stereotype attractive. I know some people do, but I don't - usually. Not here, certainly. And Gray isn't just a garden variety alphahole. He's the professor emeritus of Alphahole 101:\"Can we stop with all the touchy-feely shit?\" Gray muttered. \"You sound like a damn woman\" (143).Frankly, he'd rather suffer a case of blue balls before getting his dick wet in a chick with more dead space than a black hole (24).When they actually start to negotiate the terms of their relationship, she tells him what she wants (as in, she describes her ideal scenario). Gray gets frustrated and stops. Then he says this:\"You've set the scene just as you imagined. You've scripted the role, my role, and decided how everything plays out. You've got every detail worked out in your mind. You're in complete control. No one else. I'm merely a puppet dangling on a string waiting on you to command me to command you and for you to tell me HOW to command you\" (172).Then he says:\"I don't work that way, Faith....I told you what I wanted. A woman who'd be content to let me call the shots. Nothing about this scenario is me doing anything but allowing you to dictate how it is we get together\" (172).I thought that was the point. The submissive is supposed to call the shots.She dropped her face into her hands. Oh God, what a moron she was. She hadn't wanted a dominant man. Just the opposite. She'd been trolling for a mindless puppet (173).Now that he'd laid it out for her, it seemed so clear.Her idea of a man taking control had been handing him a checklist of activities to perform. She'd have been better off to hire a male prostitute and give him a script (180).\"If we do this, I will be in complete and utter control. There are no safe words, no playacting, no 'lifestyle' books to read. That's all bullshit. I've never lived by anyone else's rules and certainly not a bunch of rabid lifestylers all spewing what people do or don't do according to their list of guidelines....If that's what you're expecting, then you need to walk now. You can forget about anything you've read or experienced, because what I will demand from you bears no resemblance to what a bunch of role players screwing around with sex games would\" (214).The \"guidelines\" I imagine he's talking about are called SSC, or safe, sane, and consensual. Basically: a set of guidelines to prevent mental and physical harm, and ensure that everyone has a good time.This thing that these two are doing is not what BDSM is. This is very close to an emotionally abusive relationship. She tells him her fantasies, he shuts her down, tells her what he wants, mansplains her fantasies to her, makes her feel bad and guilty about herself, and she ends up capitulating. That is not what BDSM is about. Then he essentially tells her he doesn't believe in consent.That is not what any relationship should be about.Also, I couldn't help but find it funny that a book capitalizing on the BDSM community would do its damnedest to put down said community at every opportunity.\"I'm not your parent. Have no desire to be placed in that role. We're both adults, and the petulant master/slave game bores me to tears. The little fake disobedient act so the master will punish the naughty little slave - it's ridiculous. If and when I spank you, it'll be because I like seeing my mark on your ass and because you'll enjoy it. Not because you disobeyed me. You're an adult with a mind of your own\" (248) Other random wtf moments:-: On p. 229, Gray, the Omnipotent Sex Genius, uses soap as lubricant. I suppose he doesn't believe in urinary tract infections any more than he believes in risk-aware sex.-: This line: He sure as hell wasn't going to bed with a hard-on the size of Texas (240). *swallows down the obvious joke* *barely manages to make it* *does* \"Because I'm...so...mature...\"-: This line: \"How many blows do you think I should give you before I stuff my dick so far up your pussy that you taste me?\" (270) Thanks for the horrific mental image.-: This line: \"Sand up the woo woo would be a tragedy indeed. Especially since I plan to spend a lot of time up that woo woo\" (275). What was all that high and mighty talk about being adults, hmm?-: Like Sylvia Day, this author has a verbal tic. Unlike Sylvia Day, it isn't cream/creamy: it's blush. Which sounds harmless enough until you see the g-d word every other page. I almost wish I had the e-book so I could do a search to see how many times it was used. It had to be 50+ times...I'll give this book some begrudging points for having aftercare and not using the word \"cream\" (well, okay, Banks used the word once and then seemed to realize what a poor idea that was and never used it again). I'll have to deduct half a point for the phrase \"warm seed,\" though.As I said, I purchased the entire series so I'm going to review them all. I'm hoping the other books will be better than this one. SWEET SURRENDER, as far as I could tell, seems like it's less about BDSM and more about an idealized version of a highly sexist dynamic that's founded on emotional browbeating and sexual manipulation. I also didn't think it was very nice that both characters seemed to go out of their way to badmouth members of the BDSM community - especially since this book is supposed to portray and reflect (ostensibly) that community. But some women enjoy reading about sexist alphaholes, even if they'd never date one, so if that's your thing, pull up a seat.If that isn't your thing, throw the chair (and the table) and run.

I loved it--it had the perfect balance!The hero, Gray, is a Dallas cop whose partner has been killed in the line of duty. The police are getting nowhere trying to find the perpetrator. Gray gets a lead that the perp may some way be connected to a woman in Houston. Gray takes a leave of absence and finagles a job with the family P.I. company where the woman works. He's stunned by her beauty and innocence when he meets her--she couldn't possibly be connected to his partner's murderer, could she?The heroine, Faith, is very happy in her professional life. She has a job she loves working for her adoptive father's P.I. firm. But her personal life is just...okay. She longs for a strong, take charge kind of man. She'd like to be dominated, and taken care of by her man. But how is she going to find 'the one'? She hasn't had much luck with men...until Gray walks into her life. Could he be what she's looking for? This was a very quick, easy read. The story flowed smoothly and I really liked the characters. The heroine had a brother and a few friends that I could also see as having their own stories told (I hope)! And the hero was hot, hot, hot, yet also sensitive and caring (loved that!) If you've read any Maya Banks books before, I'm sure you know what you'll be getting--but I'd have to say that this one is not quite as kinky (although it has it's moments) as some of her other books.

Sweet Surrender was a little slow for me. I thought that there was a lot of emphasis placed on things that really weren\u2019t necessary. I don\u2019t need to read about Faith\u2019s day-to-day work duties. In contrast, the things that I was looking forward to didn\u2019t meet my expectations. I was a little bit disappointed with the pacing. I hate to admit it, but I was skimming a lot of the pages.Part of the reason was because even though I liked Faith in the beginning, she kind of lost her appeal half way through. I just kept waiting and waiting for something drastic to happen and nothing did.And although Gray seemed like a nice guy, I thought he was almost too nice for a Dom. One moment he\u2019s this charming guy who smiles when he makes Faith blush and then the next moment, he\u2019s shoving his hard cock down her throat telling her to swallow. I just didn\u2019t feel like his character in the first half of the book matched the latter half. Basically, I wasn\u2019t feeling him.

While some of the scenes were definitely hot, I didn't feel there was a great connection between Gray and Faith. I kinda felt that Gray was a bit too selfish (more of a dictator than a dom), especially in his refusal to dole out a safe word. Faith, IMO, was a weak heroine - yes, I guess she was \"assertive\" enough to know and insist she wanted a submissive lifestyle, but she didn't have much of a personality and it seemed like what she really wanted was to be treated like a doormat. The suspense element to 'Sweet Surrender' wasn't all that suspenseful, and felt like filler in an otherwise erotically themed story. I was, however, somewhat intrigued by the aloof and debonair Damon, owner of the kink establishment 'The House', and for that reason I'll likely continue with the next in this series."}, {"userName": "A\u043c\u0443", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10342872-a", "userReview": "Review originally posted at: [ http://prufreads.blogspot.com/2012/12... ]As the sexual tension between Gray and Faith grew stronger, my sexual tension was about to blow a gasket! I don't think I've had an itch to scratch that bad since reading Kristen Ashley's - The Gamble. So I held my expectations pretty high in hopes that my patience would be awarded - Nope. The BDSM theme in this novel was actually pretty tame. (A word I never thought to associate with BDSM!) But it was. The first half of the book was no touching, no sex, not even a few dirty words.. and even Gray's thoughts about Faith were pretty tedious. Then all of a sudden when we see their first sexual encounter at The House (which only took eighteen-freakin' chapters to get to), Gray is abruptly pushing her down on her knees and telling her to \"take it deep.\"? I admit, after seeing humble Gray for so long, I was thrilled when seeing Faith being paddled sent Gray's temperature off the scale and his way of 'retrieving' her was pretty hot. Afterwards? A recipe of public displays, anal, a strange m\u00e9nage (which we will come back to) and a dash of SOFT d/s play. I could stand most of them, sure, but the more sex there was in Gray and Faith\u2019s pivotal week together, one scene just faded into another. I found myself skimming the multiple shower/bath scenes. (This book had enough bathing to have their skin wrinkle and dissolve.) Now back to that m\u00e9nage..Borderline creepy threesome with her friend Micah? He thought of her like a little sister for over 3 years! Then suddenly he gets the golden ticket to gang bang with her and Gray so he jumps at it? Not on my watch!Where did that even come from? Just seemed kinda random considering we didn't see much interaction with Micah until towards the end. Maybe if Faith and Gray had developed their relationship further, it would have made more sense. M\u00e9nages have just never been on my hot-&-heavy list sadly. I mean, hey, I gave it a shot. This book was just not the one to make me a believer in the art of group groping.Enough ranting over sex (which pains me to say) - time for some character/plot critiques. I admired Faith wanting a real dom, not a guy playacting. I guess because that's how I see most books - they're just acting it out. Banks however makes any woman want to submit, especially if it means getting pampered and having naps all day like Faith does. Her demeanor towards her mother was awe-inspiring. I was so ecstatic to read about a female protagonist that did NOT give into the antagonist's demands! Good for you Faith! Thus, I was a bit in denial when she considered an armed madman's word over Gray's.. and who the hell asks questions of an armed madman?! Surely her relationship drama could've waited. Lastly there was Damon. Did anyone else have a weird crush on him?? Just me?? Good! 'Cause he's mine! I was so depressed to see how woefully underdeveloped his character was though - just as the other secondary characters were. Unfortunately, the mystery/action part of the plot left me flat. While I enjoyed seeing Gray and Faith\u2019s relationship grow, the other side of the story was forced and frankly, a lot of times did not make much sense. There were glaring inconsistencies and at times (like at the end), where the plot became rushed.Other than those few little blips, this is an okay book. The writing is very fluent. There\u2019s always a nice flow and rhythm throughout the story. I never found myself tripping or stumbling over a phrase nor dialogue. So if you are looking for a well written relationship and chaste d/s, this is definitely a book for you. If you are looking for a strong plot and blush inducing sex scenes, then you might want to look elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Daisiemae", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/838071-daisiemae", "userReview": "I loved this book so much! I hated to see it end. I loved everything about this book. The characters were likable and I found myself really caring about the outcome of the storyline. Police detective Gray Montgomery is recovering from the murder of his partner and his own injuries. Just when he is about to return from medical leave, his partner's father Mick-who is a retired police officer-approachs him with information about the killer. Finding out that the killer is shacked up with a two-timed loser of a woman who frequently mooches off her daughter and others, Gray decides to some investating of his own. When Mick tells him he has arranged for Gray to work at the business the daughter works at, Gray decides to earn the daughters trust, and hopefully it will lead to justice for the death of his partner.Faith has had to take care of her mother most of her life. Shouldered by the responsibity of taking care of her worthless mother, she has learned to rely on her other family for emotional support. She has been making efforts to separate herself from contact with her mother. Longing for more dominance with her relationship with men, (she's still not a pushover) She is shocked by the immediate attraction and chemistry she has with Gray. Her instincts tell her he is exactly the man she is looking for.Faith and Gray are very likeable people. But have issues of trust and personal growth they have to achieve throughout the book. Faith longs for a more dominant man in her life, but she isn't a pushover by any means. Gray also grows throughout this book. He is dominate, but not in a demeaning way. I liked that they became friends first before jumping into bed together. Both have some issues they had to work on, but watching them build their relationship was a wonderful thing to read. Some of the things Gray does for Faith was truly romantic...he definately knows how to take care of a woman! This book could easily start a series or spin off from the other characters in it. I hope the author continues with the lives of the characters, because I am definately interested in what will become of everyone.There is some mild BDSM and some strong language in this book, so if you are offended by either one, it won't be for you."}, {"userName": "Susanne ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7179798-susanne", "userReview": "4.5 Great Series OpenerI adored all characters!

I have chosen a paragraph from the book that is tasteful (IMHO) and gives you a look into how the author portrays delicious moments between the lovers in Sweet Surrender.It has been a very long time since I\u2019ve read an erotica book. I was a little shocked haha .. I guess I feel old. Regardless, this book was super cool and I really like the story and the characters.The author did a fantastic job bringing the characters to left. The diversity of personalities is a wonderful change.Sweet Surrender is a book about the relationship between Faith and Gray. Faith is a sweet and kind woman who is disappointed and unsatisfied with the relationships in which she has found herself. Although the men in her life have been kind and respectful, they have also been entirely too passive for her tastes. She craves a man who will make the decisions for her. She craves submission and to be taken over by the passion that only a real man can give her.Gray is a cop that is grieving over his dead partner that was murdered. Taking some leave from work, he relocates to Houston where he inserts himself into a security business where Faith works. She is his only lead and he must get close to her in hopes of luring the murderer out into the open. Fighting the attraction (I just love it when they fight it haha), they both constantly turn away from each other. Avoiding lust filled eyes and sexual tension, the relationship becomes firework worthy explosive.Deciding to take control of her sexuality, she searches for a way to dive into a new lifestyle. \u201cThe House\u201d is an establishment that hosts a scrumptious amount of room to fulfil almost any fantasy a person can dream of. Need.Gray refuses to let Faith put herself in that position and walks into The House to bring her home kicking and screaming if he has to. What he finds, sends lightning shooting through his body as well as rage. Trying to prove to Faith what she does and truly does not want, Gray opens up a moment between them that they are unable to ignore.For once, her heart and her mind were in unison with her body. Never had she felt so complete. So satisfied. So content. So convinced that this was where she was supposed to be. Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks as every single muscle in her body tightened unbearably. And finally her release flooded her, relaxing the tension. She floated, weightless, cradled in his arms. She became aware of him kissing her ear and murmuring soothing words.This book has extremely strong sexual content. Mild violence. Forewarning, this is an erotica book that is surrounded by an alternative lifestyle. Read at your own lust filled bravery!I recommend this book to any lonely housewife. I recommend this book to anyone in general that needs a little spike for their fantasies. I recommend this book to anyone that is searching for something they may feel ashamed of.

Just got terribly old, quickly)I try not to let other reviewers' evaluations weigh too heavily on my own but I'm always so surprised when I read something that I consider less than great then see that my GRs friends/people I follow have rated it highly and/or raved about it. It just so happens that this is one of those times and as I'm reading the reviews that say things like 'great development'; 'couldn't put it down'; 'a new take on the Dom/sub relationship' or 'the book was deep', I can't help but giggle. Sure, it's deep in so much as how many times the poor girl gets DP'd (deeply not 'double' penetrated although that nearly happens too), but deep by any other definition? I'd have to disagree.I'm guessing the depth of story that some reviewers remark on happens in the first 127 pages. The romance (I use the term lightly) doesn't happen until well after that so those first 16 chapters are devoted to story building. Here's what I learned. Our hero, Gray, is taking a leave of absence from the Dallas Police Department to go to Houston in search of his partner's murderer; based on a lead his partner's father has found. In Houston, Gray works at Malone and Sons, a security agency. His mark is the boss's daughter Faith, whose derelict mother is assumed to be cavorting with the murderer. Faith is 22, has had a difficult childhood, rarely speaks to her mom these days unless she calls begging money, and is well loved by her adopted dad, Pop, brother Conner, and the other two employees Nathan and Micah (all decent characters who I assume are the focus of subsequent books). Faith has decided that she wants, no needs a dominate man, lover, protector and keeper so she schedules an appointment at a sex club hoping to find what she desires. It just so happens that all his life Gray has been looking for a girl with Faith's wants, but every other girl he's tried it with has turned out to be only half willing. So page 127, we're at the fetish club. Faith gives it a shot but is disappointed with the result until Gray shows up and spanks her. Then BAM! she knows what she wants and who can give it to her but Gray fights her off for many more chapters. A few reviews mentioned that this book offered a new take on the Dom/sub relationship. I'll concede that it tries to offer a new take, or at the very least disparages sex club Dom/subs and reduces their import to playacting, sex games and role players. It also attempts to show Faith's desire to be dominated and taken care of as normal. What women wouldn't like to be taken care of in every possible way? I don't know any. And I didn't think it made her weak or abnormal anyway. The one recurring problem I have with every BDSM book I've read is that the author spends a good deal of time explaining how BDSM is normal behavior, nothing to be ashamed of, and that prevailing culture hasn't accepted it as such. But then, rather than support this view with 'normal' characters they present the reader with characters who have been greatly hurt, are damaged or suffer from something that results in them needing whatever BDSM is supposed to be/offer/provide. Now as humans we are all flawed and damaged and our past dictates our present and future so there is no way around that in literature. Plus it would be pretty boring to read about perfection anyway. But it's hard to make a case for BDSM in books when everyone is so messed up. And in this case, like most others I've read, no matter how you try to pretty it up by telling me on page 293 that it's an emotional connection that drives their sexual acts, you have to call this what it is and that's submission to the same degrading degree it's always been.I was actually a bit sickened by the scene where Faith tells Gray she doesn't know what to expect from the arrangement they've agreed on. He asks \"Did you expect to be kneeling? Have to ask permission to speak? Did you expect me to beat you before fucking your brains out?\" Faith nods yes. Gray says he's \"not an asshole...and won't treat her like garbage...and there are lots of ways for her to show submission and respect which don't include humiliation or ill treatment.\" But after reading this book, I'd say that Gray's ways of showing submission and \"respect\" are little better. Faith has not been demure or naive about her needs in this book and the fact that she thought Gray would do those things, thought she had to endure those types of things, especially if against her will, irritated me.There are moments in real life when some of the more explosive sex scenes from this book could be erotic for some people. I'd actually say it's more for men than women though. In fact I felt like I was reading a book catered to a man's desires most of the time. But in real life, when half of this stuff happens, I can't imagine how the girl walks away feeling loved, cherished, protected and cared for, which is what the book tries to make you believe is happening. It's even sometimes just disgusting to read. During the couple's first night at the beach house (where the sexual relationship begins) Gray tells Faith that the first night is all about her. He takes her to dinner, talks to her a about her past and her current desires, bathes her, brushes her hair, pleasures her with his hand, tells her how much she's desired, holds her while they sleep naked together. Aww, kind of sweet. But the next day he reminds her that it's all about him now and though the first day is mild and sweet with a bit of kink, it never seems to be about anyone else but him after that. The sex happens only over the course of a few days and that really constitutes the entirety of their relationship as they only have one true conversation and it's only about Faith. We don't learn much more about Gray. The sex is nearly endless (it also got very boring to read) and there is a good deal of pain and ramming and shoving and stretching and forcing and spanking, oh my! At one point Gray is telling Faith to simply \"Relax, it's going to hurt...Let go of the hurt\" he's inflicting and just \"Embrace the pleasure.\" Umm, he just \"shoved...deep\" and \"forced\" his you know what into her virgin bum. But Faith describes his words as sensual which, you know, is exactly what I was thinking, in between cringes. *sarcasm* She's happy as a clam after, saying she's \"never been better\" so he takes her naked body, bends it over the arm of the sofa, ties her arms behind her back and warns her to stay just like that until he comes back from showering. Wow, he's a dreamboat. In another scene he acknowledges that after he's collapsed on top of her and is holding her to him too tightly, she probably can't breathe but he didn't care because in that moment he just wanted her close. Again, I can see how Faith sees this man as her protector and provider.So I didn't really like the sex stuff. The rest of the book was ok. I suppose the plot is plausible and the minor characters are likeable, mostly. I should mentioned that there is nothing wrong with Banks' writing per se. She's a proficient writer that I have enjoyed reading in the past. Her McCabe trilogy got 3, 4 and 5 stars from me. It's next to impossible to get a 5 outta me so that's saying something. But sometimes in erotic novels you really do feel like you're reading inferior material for cheap thrills and at times this book was not different. And I resent the word 'woo woo' as a euphemism for vagina. It's was so childish and unnecessary. I have book OCD that demands that I read every book (in order) in a series once I start it. That is if I'm able to get them from my library or cheapish. I will not, however, be making much effort to continue this series."}, {"userName": "Malinda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14108764-malinda", "userReview": "3-3.5 starsSigh! I just had this review all written out and then accidentally erased it all... so here we go again.This was a decent story but had some definite flaws. Faith was a good heroine and Gray was an alright hero but to me, the story was a bit lacking. BTW, the BDSM in this story is seems more along the lines of BDSM-lite.Faith is an office manager for a security firm. Faith grew up with a lazy and selfish mother and Faith supported her mother more than anything. When she was older, Faith was adopted by Pops and now she's very happy with her life. Faith's main issue right now is that she can't seem to find a guy who will satisfy her in bed.Gray is a cop whose partner was killed by a bad guy. Gray takes some leave from his job in order to help his late partner's father, Mick, investigate his murder since the police force isn't getting anywhere. They find out that the suspect is hanging around with a woman and that woman has a daughter (Faith) she mooches money off of when she's in need. Gray and Mick think this is a good lead so Gray goes to watch the daughter to find the mother and their suspect.When the story begins, Faith is just breaking up with her boyfriend because things just aren't working for them. Mostly this is in the bedroom and unfortunately, when Faith tried suggesting adding some kink into their sex, her boyfriend wasn't into it so they split up. Thankfully, Faith wasn't overly broken up about it. Gray gets a job working at the security company and the chemistry between them is intense. Gray tries to ignore it while Faith tries to pursue it. Gray is determined to keep Faith at arm's length since he's having to lie to her about most everything and this would probably have been a good idea if it wasn't for the fact that Gray has a hard time keeping his hands off her. Things aren't helped by the fact that Faith starts investigating BDSM because she suspects she's a submissive and Gray finds out. I was actually a bit pissed off when this happened because Faith got hit with the \"You're too sweet to \"really\" be into this. You must be in over your head.\" talk. All I could think was....can you be just a bit more condescending??? So Faith is interested in Gray and he's sending her mixed signals and the brushoff attempts end up being rather rude at times. Faith is getting some calls from her mother but doesn't realize how bad things are. She thinks her mom just wants money and Faith keeps telling her she won't give her any but Faith doesn't know that her mom is being pushed by a bad guy. Just about the time that Faith is ready to give up on Gray, he decides to step up...unfortunately, Gray doesn't tell her the truth about why he's there though and you can guess how that turns out when the crap hits the fan. Things do turn out well though and the story ends with Faith and Gray working things out and starting on a HEA together.This was a decently enjoyable story. Faith was a good heroine overall...I can't think of any major complaints about her. Gray was alright but I had some issues with how he handled things, especially later in the story when he could have told her the truth yet didn't. The story itself was definitely focused on the romance storyline and most of the time the action storyline seemed more like filler than anything else. Overall, this book was good but had definite flaws. I own the whole series so I'll be reading the next book in the series but I don't think I'd recommend this one.* note - I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator did a very good job."}, {"userName": "Tracy74", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3053064-tracy74", "userReview": "This was such an amazing story...I really fell in love with the characters.

The H shares h with someone else in a non-permanent menage. I'm becoming a lot more evolved in my reading, reading things I couldn't stomach in the past, but obviously this is still a hang up with me. Never, I think, will I understand a m/f relationship where the H says he loves, adores the h, and then wants her to have sex with a strange man. That's NOT romance. I'm sure there's a reason this turns them on, but it sure as hell doesn't turn me on. I just don't get it.About 50 or 60 pages in I was enjoying this book, and my internet was down so I couldn't look up Goodreads, as I had decided I wanted to find out who the H and h were in the next book, so I skimmed the start of the second book just to see who the H and h were, out of curiosity, and just happened to land on a page where the h in book 1, this book I'm reviewing, and her friends were discussing her menage with her H and another co-worker. Turned my stomach.Then skimmed forward in the second book further only to discover the H and h in the second book have sex in front of two other men, strangers, in a business meeting. \"Baby I love you, they're not going to have sex with you, but get naked and have sex with me right in front of them while they're panting away.\" Yeah, that's romance - are you kidding me. That's just sick. Turned my stomach even more and made me feel a bit nauseus. These Sweet books are just not for me. Disappointing as I love Maya Banks, but I just can't hack these books. I didn't leave a star rating as I should have checked these out more before I started reading ... I left this review just in case it helps other readers who may not like the content either.

I just want get my one negative out of the way quickly. I was a little disappointed with the storyline. I had expected more of the Cop aspect, a more detailed case maybe? But we were told who the bad guy is and what he wanted, right at the beginning. Then it went quiet in the middle and was all neatly wrapped up within a few pages at the end. So if you're looking for a really full on, complicated and thrilling storyline, this isn't the book for you.However, what this book DOES have is a pretty fucking fantastic romance.  Grayson is such an incredible hero. Usually the whole Dom thing just really turns me off. But this guy? Holy shit, I would do anything he asked, if he'd take care of me like that. LOL Yes, he's dominant. He likes to have control of everything in his life, including his woman. But not the usually games and crap that you read about these days. Luckily, he is exactly what Faith is looking for. But he was always honest, above everything else. \n\"You'll be mine. Mine. You'll give your everything to me, and in return, I'll give you more than you could ever imagine. I'll take care of you, pleasure you, and provide for you.\"\n What really made me fall in love with him though was the way he cared for her. He is so incredible in the bedroom, pushing Faith as far as she can go and once they're out of it, he's even better. He takes care of her every need, you can feel just how much he loves and cherishes her. He's amazing.\"I love the look of a well satisfied woman,\" he murmured as he pulled her into his arms. \"There's no bigger rush for a man than to know he's responsible for putting that kind of look on a woman's face.\" Marry me? LOL Also, some of the sex scenes in the book were scorching hot. Maya Banks, you know how to write seriously hot sex *bows* Faith is a wonderful heroine. I like that she was so honest with her boyfriend (before Grey), telling him that she just wasn't satisfied with her life right now and what he was giving her, also making sure that he knew it wasn't anything he had done. She knows what she wants, even if she doesn't know how to go about getting it, yet. I felt so sorry for her, having no father and a shitty excuse for a mother. That's why Pop and the gang were so incredible. I loved Pop for adopting her and making her feel like a part of a family for the first time in her life. The atmosphere at Malone and Sons Security was so much fun. Pop made sure that they all felt like a family and the banter was hilarious.  Nathan lost a bet (that Micah totally fixed by the way), and had to shave his head, so he was bald!'...Then as if just noticing, he stared at Nathan and shook his head. \"What the hell happened to you, son? Get into a fight with a lawnmower?\" Bwahahaha. I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to get back to the gang and to learn more about them all.
