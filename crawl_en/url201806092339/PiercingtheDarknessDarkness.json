The second book has touched me much deeply and has even moved me to tears as I \u201cjourneyed\u201d with Sally Beth Roe until she finally found her salvation. I love the hide-and-seek-cat-and-mouse mystery that shrouds Roe\u2019s character, and I feel strongly attached to her in a very emotional way. I can relate to the questions and confusions she laid down in her letters to Tom Harris. I especially loved that the story has a big portion on legal issues on it, (plus some courtroom drama) and more particularly, one major character was a Christian lawyer. This is what really made the story very close to my heart.For the complete review, you may go to It's A Wonderful Bookworld."}, {"userName": "Sarita", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37168935-sarita", "userReview": "Wow. The first book was amazing, but the second book was even greater. This was full of action as well as suspense as you follow Sally visiting all the significant places in her past in search of answers.After Sally escapes barely from a plot to kill her, she escapes in search of answers and trying to stay on step ahead of her killers. Angels are trying to protect her while demons from her past is trying to destroy her.This is one amazing book of spiritual warfare I would recommend to any Christian reader. Frank Peretti did an amazing job in showing the reader a glimpse of the spiritual warfare going on and the importance we as Christians play. The story was gripping and the reading easy to follow, as well as to flow the story where it goes from the human story, to the dialect and story of the Angels and demons.I was reminded once again of the authority we have in Christ and that we need to step up and walk in this authority. Scriptures I was reminded of during reading this book was:\" For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\"\"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\"I don't think this book even begins to describe half of what is actually happening in the heavenly realms.This book made me glad I chose the side of the light!

To be honest, I had been charged with a number of criminal offences, stolen about $1000.00 (in 1990s money) off of my parents, and was hanging around with a guy that was not only a bad influence, but also a bad smell. Before I go into this book I might say a word or two about this guy.\tHe was a funny guy, a refugee from an Eastern bloc country (isn't it funny that refugees from European and Asian Countries were welcomed, but refugees from Middle Eastern Countries aren't) who wanted to live 'the life' but did not want to work for it. I suspect that the main reason he hung around me was because he thought that I could come up with grand some money making scheme that would make him rich, but with the minimal amount of work (probably also because I looked up at him, and he was one of those people that loved having people around that looked up to him \u2013 it gave him some form of identity). It was like if he could buy alcohol and clothes by passing off stale cheques or stolen credit cards (it was a lot easier back in those days to rack up credit card debt on somebody else's card because the shops would not be notified until at least a month after the card was reported stolen), he would do it, but if it involved establishing a publishing house (or even a dodgy stock brokerage firm) he was not interested. Oh, and he was also the type of guy that would pretty much take everything for himself, and when I said he was a bad smell, I meant it: I simply could not get rid of him. I would try to disconnect myself from him, and then suddenly he would rock up at my door one day and want to hang around with me. I really don't know what happened to him, and in a way I am curious because it has been a long time since I have seen him and it would be interesting to see if he has pulled himself out of the rubbish that he had got himself into (as I have done), or if he is dead.\tMind you, that is all by the by, because this book is about spiritual warfare. It is about a woman who is haunted by a demon and has to come to terms with this demon by fighting it. A number of Christians that I know don't like this book because it is very works based: the main character has to fight and overcome the demon herself when in reality it is through God that we are able to overcome our demons. Mind you, when I speak about overcoming our demons, I mean it in both in the literal and the metaphorical sense.\tOne of the funny things that I have found in my life so far is that sometimes our demons (both literal and metaphorical) can be location based, and sometimes they can simply be due to who you hang around with, and I guess that is why I mentioned the story of that guy above. It wasn't until I managed to not only separate myself from him, but from all of the people that were related to him, that my life began to turn around again. Look, I am not blaming my problems on him, by no means, because I always had a choice. There was one time where I (surprise, surprise) ran into him in Victoria Square when I was with another friend, and I was given the choice of going with him or with my other friend (I couldn't have both) and I ended up going with him (bad choice).\tThe same has happened recently, in that I have moved myself seven hundred kilometres away from my source of marijuana and I have begun to clean myself up (though I still probably drink more than I should, and am kicking myself that I did not buy any beer on Christmas Eve to discover that even in Melbourne you can't buy beer on Christmas Day) and even save money. As I write this on Christmas Day in 2012, I must say that I have managed to achieve three goals this year, I have moved interstate, I have saved $5000.00 and put it into my share trading account, and I have beaten the market (by about 8%). The third one, I must admit, was more luck than skill, and I am not expecting to do the same next year, but I guess my next goal is to bring certain holdings up to about $5000.00 each, and also develop a friendship network here in Melbourne, as well as going to Hong Kong and connecting with a church there. One should remember though that the Bible says that it is not that we should not be making plans, but that we should be making plans with God's purposes in mind, and as I look back on my achievements this year, once again I will have to say that it is not through any skill of my own, but through God's grace that I have been able to do that."}, {"userName": "Keiki Hendrix", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790150-keiki-hendrix", "userReview": "A supernatural, page turner.

It was absolutely riveting. Peretti even outdid himself. I decided to go back and read This Present Darkness again before reading this one, for comparison's sake. This story revolves around another small town named Bacon's Corner that is being overtaken by evil. A woman named Sally Beth Roe stars along with a man named Tom Harris, but they follow parallel storylines, tied together but unknown to one another--at least at first. Our heroes, Marshall Hogan and Bernice Krueger, make their way back onto the scene, with Marshall's wife Kate playing a more active role than in Ashton.I love how Peretti starts the story out with tons of action and confusion but then slowly brings some order out of it without telling all. Although we, as readers, are able to see from many different characters' perspectives, including the angels and demons, Peretti ably conceals the tortuous route that the story takes us through. And even though we can guess the end--good prevails over evil--we are driven to find out HOW good will prevail over evil. At so many points in the story, impossible situations occur, things get bleaker by the second, evil's grip become a chokehold . . . and yet, we continue to root for good to triumph SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY. Peretti does not fail his readers.I am a Frank E.

The quasi-religious activities such as using a mantra or acquiring a spirit guide are being practiced in our public schools and are not benign exercises in values clarification. In areas where there are no Christian schools, or other alternatives, people are turning more and more to homeschooling.The small church school in this story is being attacked by an ACLU type organization. The lawyers seize the opportunity to involve themselves in the school because the mother one of children in the school is receiving Federal day-care funds. The organization wants to set a precedent for interfering with religious schools. This could easily be tomorrow's headlines. The plot has several threads and the author weaves them in and out to keep the action moving, but they all dovetail at the end. One of the most interesting ideas is that the angelic host cannot fight unless there is enough \"prayer cover\" and that demonic activity can thwart the angels by spreading gossip and strive within the Christian community."}, {"userName": "C.J.

He creates a situation in which the angels of heaven do actual battle with the demons of hell in a bid to help a group of people in a small town overcome the biggest personal and legal battles of their lives. Peretti is masterful at creating a story in which he has asked the question, \"What if spiritual warfare looked like real warfare?\", and then making that come to life in his words. Piercing the Darkness follows the same heavenly warriors from the book This Present Darkness as they now battle demons for the life of Sally after a failed murder attempt on her life. They also battle for the emotional, spiritual, and personal well being of a small Christian school principal who suddenly finds himself battling a lawsuit against his school, while at the same time trying to regain his children from CPS, who have taken them from him, for seemingly no reason at all. Stranger yet, is that the lives of the woman and the principal intertwine, even though they have never met.A page turner for sure.

Otherwise, this narrative is full of stereotyping from an evangelical conservative perspective, which in retrospect makes many of its claims laughable. For this reason, it has not stood up well under the test of time. Some of the outrageous evangelical stereotypes espoused by the author are: 1). That the ACLU discriminates against Christians, and is directly involved in a satanic plot to undermine Christianity; 2) that those who practice relaxation practices, like meditation and transcendental meditation, are directed by satanic spirit guides; 3) that people who report pastors, and Christian schools, to Child Protection Services for whacking children with paddles and wooden spoons are also involved in a satanic conspiracy against the church. I'm sure there are more ridiculous claims, but for the moment these are the top three that surface to my memory.The first claim, that the ACLU discriminates against Christians, and is in cahoots with Satan, is absurd, because one only has to perform a simple Google search to discover that there have been many legal cases where the ACLU represented the rights of Christians to express their beliefs. In fact, there is a whole website called aclufightsforchristians.com which mentions several of these cases.The second claim, which compares meditation to satanism, is equally ludicrous. When I was a college student, I took some stress management psychology courses, and during those courses we practiced various types of meditation. Not once, were we asked to contact any type of spirit guide, or any demonic entities. Meditation is actually more in line with science than vague spirituality. By practicing meditation, an individual acknowledges that their brain actually is able to more of the involuntary functions of the body than perviously was thought to be possible. By focusing their thoughts, a person can lower their heart beat and blood pressure at will, reduce or increase their body temperature, and naturally enter altered states of consciousness. This is a scientific fact, and has nothing to do with the worship of demons, or lucifer.As for the third claim, if I knew of any church, Christian school, or parent that was smacking children's backsides with wooden paddles, spoons, belts etc.....I would certainly consider reporting them to Child Protection Services. Study after study has shown the harm that can be caused to children through corporal punishment; and the theology that some Christians cling to to support the continuance of such a twisted tradition is so laughably thin that one has to wonder if anyone who holds to such convictions has actually spent the time to think about how unbiblical they really are. For instance, all Christian childrearing authors, like James Dobson, Roy Lessin, Ted Tripp etc......all make the absurd claim that God invented the human buttocks for the purpose of being spanked. Really? I'm sure that the buttocks has nothing to do with our ability to walk upright, instead of on all fours. But, since I am attacking the theology, and practice of spanking, with logic, I must be in league with the devil.I enjoyed this novel when I was in 8th grade and was not knowledgable to recognize how stereotypical, and absurd its claims were. When I re-read it as an adult, I still enjoyed some of the suspense, but realized it was completely illogical and out-of-date."}, {"userName": "Randy Tramp", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21953550-randy-tramp", "userReview": "My Thoughts: I read this book several years ago and wanted to revisit it.

I would however recommend it to people interested in finding a fresh way of trying to understand the spiritual world. It\u2019s not possible to understand the Spiritual Realm fully because our minds are way too small to comprehend something that does not fit into anything logical to grasp the majesty of what lies beyond, but reading the book might bring some solace to our way of thinking. My main concern with promoting this book is that I believe our focus should be directed on the Creator (Who is ultimately the centre of all realms), moving into a deeper and never-ending spiral of relationship with Him. I was about 13 at the time of reading this series, and it completely diverted my focus. Because although this is a work of fiction, there are so many biblical principles included and it\u2019s very hard to distinguish between fact and fiction. Yes, my age then should be considered, and may be the reason that I started believing that the whole spiritual world is on my shoulders and I have this immense responsibility to work harder, pray longer, stay purer, and ultimately work incredibly hard not to fail or become a disappointment to God or His angels etc. In my journey so far, I\u2019ve learnt that my goal should not be to carry this self imposed burden on my own, but that when I understand a little more about God\u2019s grace and mercy, kindness and faithfulness etc. that I become empowered through Him, and He takes care of the rest. In conclusion: This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness are both imaginative, gripping, heart warming and at times funny. Unfortunately the people interested in this type of genre are usually quite fickle as we change our beliefs (or small aspects thereof) constantly \u2013 which is very healthy in my opinion \u2013 but it leaves us to wonder onto planes not destined for our human minds to grasp, but for our spirits to understand. If you can dedicate yourself to experience this series as pure fiction (and if you\u2019re over 13, it might help), then by all means, enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Donovan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7565775-donovan", "userReview": "This is the second book and sequel to This Present Darkness and I found it to be as good if not better than the first. I need to point out it is heavily Christian in its content but don't let that put you off. Although I am not a Christian, I did find this to be quite a good read and was given to me (with This Present Darkness) while I was going through a particularly difficult period in my life. It provides an interesting and contemporary look at Angels & Demons in a setting that is quite believable. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy this one although there are references in there.Plot ***Spoilers***It follows the journey of Sally Beth Roe as she tries to escape her past and slowly overcomes her constant struggle to discern the Truth.Told in this story is the town of Bacon's Corner, and a resident named Tom Harris. His kids are ripped from his home by Child Services. Seeming to have no connection with other events at first, a young police officer, Ben Cole, is convinced what is being brushed off as a suicide is actually a murder, and ends up losing his job over the issue... which brings him to the side of the embattled Christian school. Caught in the crossfire is a little girl who's been forced into a curriculum of \"meditation techniques\" and \"inner spiritual guides\" that control her moods, attitudes, and actions, the little Amber Brandon, and her mother Lucy who realizes this lawsuit and the people who are \"helping\" her may be much, much more than she bargained for.Before the paths that Sally Roe and Tom Harris [and the others] are on collide, the Ashton Clarion editor and his wife, Marshall and Kate Hogan, make a return appearance as veteran fighters in this war against the powers of darkness that threaten freedom of religion everywhere. As the story unfolds, the lawsuit and its participants are soon locked in a struggle of ethics versus non-ethics, absolutes versus relativism, right versus wrong, and those with interest in this battle are shown to be even in the highest places of government."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26869813-martin", "userReview": "Piercing the Darkness was recommended to me by a fellow Christian who suggested that I read Mr. Peretti\u2019s books.Most of the negative reviews I\u2019ve seen seem to revolve around the writer\u2019s Christian outlook and the fantastic stories of demons and Angels doing battle in an unseen realm. It does sound sort of fantastic doesn\u2019t it but then that\u2019s what the Bible says is happening in a dimension or realm which we cannot see. It would be frightening to be aware of all of the struggles on God\u2019s behalf and on the behalf of satan, wouldn\u2019t it? Some folks have trouble thinking in terms of a Heavenly Realm because science says that rubbish, right? Well, scientists say that we generally operate in 4 dimensions but they\u2019re very clear that there are at least 10 dimensions. Perhaps it\u2019d help if we thought of God\u2019s realm as spanning all those dimensions at once. If we were to really see it, be aware of it, I think our little heads would explode.The earthly story was a bit contrived. The author seemed to be attempting to use every \u201cboogeyman\u201d that has the Christian Church has encountered including the police, the federal courts, satanists, witches, demons and the public school system but it is, in my humble opinion, not very well done.The earthly story could have been made far more simple and reasonable while still demonstrating that there is a battle behind the scenes between good and evil, God and satan.Having said this I will give Mr. Peretti\u2019s books another try."}, {"userName": "Alexander Draganov", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3826049-alexander-draganov", "userReview": "More like 4.5 stars, but because I was harsh with the first part, I'd be generous with the rating of the second part.
