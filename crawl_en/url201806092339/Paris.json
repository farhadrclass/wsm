Detailed and concise, excellent graphics and maps, and well thought out suggested walks and sights that will get you into the heart of a place and learn something as well. My only issue is that the book itself is heavy to carry around all day. The maps are great, very handy.

I bought this prior to my latest trip to Paris and found it so much better and more useful that other giudes I have used in the past. There is so much history and detail in it that I found places that I didn't know about despite several previous visits.The book is split into really easy to follow sections - basically the diffrerent quarters (i.e. The Latin Quarter, Le Marais, Monmartre, The Opera Quarter etc). At the beginning of each section there is a small map of Paris at the bottom of the page highlighting where it is in relation to the other areas and then over the page a more detailed map of the sites in that area with snippets of info. The following pages go into more detail about various sites, buildings etc. It's choc full of so many things I wanted to cram into my weekend but alas some will have to be saved for another trip (any excuse!).There is also loads of info on the best places to eat (again by area, and also price), different types of shops, markets etc as well as all the practical info about getting around and underground and overground maps. I read the whole things from start to finish before I left for Paris becuase I found it so interesting as a book as well as just a city guide.I highly recommend this book - perfect for planning and drooling over."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1122708-megan", "userReview": "The first two-thirds of this book actually make for rather enjoyable reading. It introduces first suggestions of how to organize stays of particular days' lengths. Then is an overview of Paris and its history. Next is overviews of 14 main areas of Paris and popular sites in the Greater Paris area. These overviews go into surprising depth, which make them fun to read, even if you won't be heading to Paris any time soon. These sections show why a printed book can offer more than the internet in travel planning - the reader here can get a very good idea of where things are and what is available in each area, instead of scattershot offerings from foreign websites. The latter third of the book has more practical nuts and bolts about traveling - hotels, emergency services, cell phone use, etc, that are useful for planning a trip, but make for drier reading."}, {"userName": "Kim Keech", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47154766-kim-keech", "userReview": "Likes: lots of pictures, both well-known and lesser known sites detailed, good visual organization, very detailed highlights of destinations, good practical information about the basics of traveling in Paris like currency, transportation, and food. DK guidebooks always provide terrific illustrated overhead maps and building layouts that really give you the feel for how the block/building/indoor areas appear.Now the one glaring weird thing. Real-life Paris is arranged by arrondissements, or districts. There are 20 and they spiral out from the center of the city. Everyone in Paris knows this and uses the information for locating places and giving directions. (\u201cIt\u2019s in the 11th.\u201d) ALL other guidebooks use this system, as do maps and pocket guides.This book does NOT use arrondissements. It\u2019s organized by 14 sightseeing areas the publishers/writers have created themselves that do not follow arrondissements though they do overlap sometimes. In fact, the book only refers to arrondissements three times that I could find, and those only briefly. They don\u2019t even use the word, which is bizarre. It\u2019s as though they were trying to redo Paris. You will have to cross-reference to another map by description if you want to use the system that all Parisians and other guidebooks use.The DK method is interesting in a way, but it stands alone. Each destination item is good in that it provides the address, phone number, website, cost, hours, Metro stop, dates open/closed.No arrondissements. Really weird. Otherwise wonderful, but I have to give it a 3 only because of that."}, {"userName": "Anthony Sznakowski", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8031262-anthony-sznakowski", "userReview": "a great book to read prior to visiting Paris for the first time."}, {"userName": "Laura Hodgins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20469723-laura-hodgins", "userReview": "Like the maps and how it is divided into areas.

The format is appealing -- a lavishly illustrated introductory section expounding on the history and key features of the city followed by color-coded sections, each devoted to a different area. In this case, the introduction includes sections on \"Celebrated Visitors and Residents\" and \"Paris' Best\" pages -- guides to the best churches, parks and gardens, and museum and galleries. Just that introductory section alone makes an excellent blueprint for exploration. The rear of the book is devoted to practicalities such as transportation, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment. Since it heavily relies on pictures rather than words, it's easy to pick up a guide, thumb through it, and let a striking photo serve as inspiration for where to go or what to do. The text on even the major sights is succinct, so if it's the full monty you're after, supplement this guide with something more substantial like a Blue Guide. However, if you want to get a quick sense of what a destination has to offer, an hour or so spent with one of these guides is probably one of the most effective ways to do background research.One quibble is that since the Eyewitness Guides are printed on nice, heavy stock, they're not that light. Perhaps in the future another format - digital? - will get around this problem."}, {"userName": "Mark B.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2149241-mark-b", "userReview": "I have at least a hundred books about Paris, including many travel guides. Though I tend to prefer the Cadogan series and Rough Guides, I picked up this Eyewitness Travel guide just to get some updated info and because it was on sale. I haven't been to Paris for 5 years and I just wanted to have one of those nicely illustrated guides to pique my interest (not that I really needed a nudge.) It's actually a decent general travel guide with more details than you realize at first glance. Adequate neighborhood maps, plenty of good photos and illustrations, and all the how-to/where and when info you need to function as a tourist are included. I'll definitely be taking it with me on my upcoming visit to Paris to reference as I plan my days, but I won't be taking it out with me. I prefer to make my own notes based on research I do ahead of time either via the internet or through myriad other sources. All in all, a very proper and recommended guide book to Paris."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Al-Garawi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4650824-mohammed-al-garawi", "userReview": "This one was okay, much better than Napoli's, but not even close to Fodor's Rome. The book was useful in some cases, but not exclusively. It didn't provide us with anything special. Just basic general information. In my opinion, the book didn't do Paris justice. A place with such rich history deserves something better. The book would suffice if you're planning to roam places quickly. Mus\u00e9e du Louvre's part was just basic and didn't give anything interesting. We even had to buy guides from the museum itself.However, the part on Disneyland was the best thing about the book. It listed all the rides and their average waiting time along with other useful info.One of the things I really liked about this book is the timeline that starts at the beginning of the book with Paris's major historical events, until it ends at the end of the book with events from the present."}, {"userName": "Joy Weese Moll", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/293164-joy-weese-moll", "userReview": "Starting with an introduction that includes sample 4-day itineraries and a quick history of the city, roaming through every region of Paris, and ending with all the practical stuff like where to eat and how to get around, the DK Eyewitness Travel Paris guidebook is a complete vacation in the palm of your hand.
