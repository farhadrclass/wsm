The stillness radiates from the main character, Catherine Sloper. I see her as a monumental figure in a hieratic pose, immobile, meek, but solid to the core. Her immobility impressed me greatly, especially as this book is quite like a play. There is a lot of dialogue, a small number of characters, and one principal location where most of the important scenes take place. The characters circle that space, and they circle Catherine. She rarely moves, and since she pauses before answering every question addressed to her, we have time to imagine her face turning slowly towards the speaker as she meditates her careful response. The result of Catherine's overly cautious responses is that the other characters fail to know her, and fail abysmally. Though he allows the reader to see more of her inner life than the other characters ever guess at, Henry James allows Catherine to keep the core of her being a secret even from us. I like to think that as he developed his heroine, his respect for her grew so that he had no choice but to preserve her privacy and to keep the mystery at the heart of her stillness a mystery to the end. That's what I wanted for her and that's what he delivered...............................................................While Catherine doesn't say very much, the other characters more than make up for her lack of verbosity. The exchanges between Catherine's various relatives reminded me of Jane Austin's ability to deliver witty dialogue line after line (of course people don't talk like this in real life, but how we wish they did). There were in fact many moments during reading when I was reminded of Jane Austin, and particularly of Fanny Price from Mansfield Park. Like Fanny, Catherine is undervalued by her entourage, and treated quite badly by certain among them. But Fanny acquires a savior. Henry James prefers Catherine to be her own savior."}, {"userName": "Flora", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873514-flora", "userReview": "I love this book so much I can't bear it. As someone who adores just about every last word that Henry James (over-) wrote, it has never gotten any more deliciously (un-)satisfying than this -- a slim, tart little novel about plain, socially unpromising Catherine Sloper, whose wealthy father refuses to allow her to marry Morris Townsend, whom he believes to be mercenary. No matter how many times I read this book, the question still nags at me: \"Does Morris have any feeling at all for Catherine, or is he really just after her fortune?\" But why is this even a question?It's usually taken for granted that Morris is sketchily-drawn, the standard handsome and callow fortune-hunter of melodrama, and his own remarks to other characters in the novel seem to provide ample evidence. I'm not fully convinced of this, which isn't to say that he's fully-drawn; rather, I wonder if Morris Townsend might be a kind of failed stereotype, a failure *of* the novel to keep him in his appointed place. If he's so successfully sketchy, then wouldn't the novel be redundant, and its central ambiguity unambiguous? If that were so, then \"Washington Square\" would do little more than encourage the reader's contemptuous pity for its heroine, whose tragedy would be utterly generic: her inability to recognize her beloved's venal motives. That would be straight-up melodrama, or mean-spirited satire. That wouldn't be Henry James.The tragedy of the novel depends, though, on Catherine's father, Dr. Sloper, one of James's most stunning and indelible creations. The man despises his daughter, yet wants to protect her; he sees through Morris's dandyish charm, yet is most offended by the idea that his awkward, unlovely daughter would win herself such a handsome, charming husband. His opposition to the match may be, on the one hand, patriarchal duty, but it is no less an act of cold-blooded cruelty, and it is through his refusal to allow that the young man may like the money and yet be a fine husband that the real drama of \"Washington Square\" emerges. In fact, the pressure of this character produces the novel's greatest and least predictable achievement: the transformation of Catherine Sloper from a non-character -- the pathetic, jilted heiress -- into a character, and the reader's tormented resistance to Dr. Sloper not only keeps the door of \"Morris Townsend\" ajar, but keeps the novel on a wonderfully shaky course, morally and aesthetically.In later years, James himself commented that he started \"Washington Square\" with great disdain for Catherine, which metamorphosed into something much more complicated (similar, maybe, to Tolstoy's creation of Anna Karenina). Maybe it's possible, then, to read Morris Townsend (to whose consciousness we only have access in scant, sharp shards of observation) as the most reflexively novelistic in the book, in the sense that his own ambivalent heartlessness may well mirror the novel's own confused motives. James ultimately disavowed \"Washington Square\" -- he even omitted it from his \"Collected Works\" -- but it marks the first appearance of the central conflict that governs his later, greatest novels: the predation of love upon money, and vice versa. The moral puzzle of the passionate mercenary haunts his major work, and \"Washington Square\" may well mark the death of the non-characters (villain and victim) that started it all. A strange, beautiful, perfectly unsatisfying book."}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "Time the late 1840's, in New York City, Catherine Sloper, a twenty-one year old woman, is the daughter of a prominent and wealthy doctor, you'd think all the young men would be trying to marry her, but Catherine is plain of face and very shy.

Morris dances with the tongue -tied girl, Catherine, she falls hard for him.

The suspicious but busy father has reservations about Morris, what does he want with his daughter? It's apparent to everyone else...poor boy wants to marry rich girl, for her money.

Dico questo nonostante in queste pagine l\u2019intreccio \u00e8 a suo modo avvincente e fluido, non privo di colpi di scena, con molti dialoghi brevi e ben ritmati.Quello che conta davvero sono le ossessioni di James: e su tutte, sopra dentro sotto, la personalit\u00e0 dei suoi sfaccettati personaggi, l\u2019incapacit\u00e0 d\u2019amare \u00e8 l\u2019ossessione regina.Anche qui i personaggi incarnano pi\u00f9 un\u2019idea che soggetti realistici. Pi\u00f9 anima che corpo. Nonostante James ripeta pi\u00f9 volte che Catherine \u00e8 goffa e sgraziata, manca di bellezza e si veste male, tentare di descriverla fisicamente risulterebbe difficile a qualsiasi lettore: molto pi\u00f9 semplice sarebbe descriverne i dettagli psicologici.Nel pi\u00f9 recente adattamento diretto da Agnieszka Holland (1997), Jennifer Jason Leigh \u00e8 Catherine e Albert Finney suo padre, Dr Sloper.C\u2019era una volta, prima che \u201cWashington Square\u201d abbia inizio, un uomo, il dottor Sloper, che si spos\u00f2 per amore.

Poi perse tutto: il figlio mor\u00ec a tre anni, e due anni dopo sua moglie mor\u00ec dando alla luce una bambina, Catherine, per la quale il padre, il dottor Sloper predisse che non avrebbe conosciuto l\u2019amore, che non si sarebbe mai sposata con qualcuno davvero innamorato di lei. Il dottor Sloper non si spos\u00f2 una seconda volta, non s\u2019innamor\u00f2 pi\u00f9, neppure di sua figlia, per la quale non nutr\u00ec mai amore paterno, piuttosto disprezzo.Olivia de Havilland con Montgomery Clift che interpreta Morris Townsend, sempre nella versione di Wyler.Data la premessa, ovvio che invece la figlia s\u2019innamor\u00f2 eccome, e per amore commise sbagli su errori, scegliendo l\u2019uomo che puntava solo ai suoi soldi. James ha un bel sminuire e criticare Catherine, per\u00f2 \u00e8 lampante che la sua simpatia \u00e8 tutta per questo personaggio, per questa creatura femminile che sembra non poter accendere passioni, ma di passione vive, e si consuma.Ci\u00f2 nonostante, dopo il primo sbaglio, Catherine riceve le attenzioni, affettuose, se non innamorate, di altri due candidati, un vedovo e un giovane avvocato: ma la giovane donna ripete l\u2019errore paterno, vive come in un santuario, quello del primo amore. E non si innamora pi\u00f9, non ricambia, non accetta. Persevera nella tara di famiglia, l\u2019incapacit\u00e0 d\u2019amare.Quando il primo amore ritorna a bussare, ormai disilluso e sconfitto, Catherine potrebbe accoglierlo, aprirgli la porta.

In secondo piano un altro personaggio fondamentale, la zia Lavinia (interpretata da Maggie Smith), inguaribile romantica che si prodig\u00f2 sempre perch\u00e9 l\u2019unione riuscisse.Il film di William Wyler \u00e8 bello e ben fatto, vinse quattro Oscar, e oltre al talento del regista e produttore, lo si deve molto anche al talento della protagonista che s\u2019innamor\u00f2 del play teatrale e spinse Wyler ad acquistarne i diritti (su sua insistenza lo fece la Paramount per $ 250.000 dell\u2019epoca, e diecimila dollari a settimana ai due autori della commedia, moglie e marito, per adattarla in film). Olivia De Havilland \u00e8 una pi\u00f9 che notevole Catherine Sloper.Il film \u00e8 \u2018suggested\u2019 dal breve romanzo di James. Il play era probabilmente pi\u00f9 fedele: ma poi si volle rendere il personaggio di Morris Townsend meno arrivista e maramaldo perch\u00e9 a interpretarlo fu chiamata un divo romantico come Montgomery Clift. E quindi il film raddrizza le magnifiche curve di James, evita i bivi che lo scrittore amava, non rende giustizia alla complessit\u00e0 della novella di James, va dritto, ma funziona a meraviglia, \u00e8 un buon film pi\u00f9 che godibile, alleluja.Washington Square intorno al 1880, quando veniva pubblicata a puntate la novella di James, ambientata nella prima met\u00e0 di quel secolo.

Henry James is my favorite American realistic period or classic novelist, and Washington Square is an example of why. This man can take a small situation and write 300+ pages all about it. And this is one of his shorter books. In this classic, the tale of the average woman, who is set to inherit a large sum of money, meets dashing man... but of course, he's only after her money. She's considered plain-looking. He's considered ruthless. They couldn't possibly be in love. And as you follow the course of their \"romance,\" you see what couples and relationships go through during the courting period... at least as it was 150 years ago. James is not shy when it comes to providing detailed descriptions of feelings and actions. You read his words as though you are in your head, thinking about choices and decisions for hours, then acting on them. This is a very direct story... commentary on the normal every day live, the differences between classes, the way in which women must act to find a husband, the efforts men go to so they can be free, the attitudes of society towards older women or those who are not considered great beauties. When you step away from this book, hopefully not too frustrated at the story being so basic and calm, you realize it's a reflection on reality... on what actually was happening at the time. Who would accept it today? Who would tolerate being treated in such a manner? And where do you go when you end up a bit hopeless? Stories like this aren't common nowadays, at least in this form. But when you put yourself into the time period, this is a true treasure. \n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Instead of being what I had thought of as the somber \"master\" of cold 19th century fiction, he is a man with sharp and perceptive humor, a clever sense of inequalities between sexes and in society. My enlightenment is partially responsible for my rating, though I also enjoyed the novel!The story is really quite simple...wealthy father knows what is best for future heiress daughter. Rogue suitor comes to town and captures her heart but does not pull the wool over daddy's eyes. Silly Aunt plays go-between and girl falls as deeply in love as a 19th century novel allows us to see. But James does not stop there he provides so much more by giving us asides filled will sarcastic, humorous \"digs\" at various characters, revealing deeper traits.In one exchange with his sister, Mrs. Almond, Dr. Sloper and she are discussing are discussing how the doctor will manage the situation. \"'You are shockingly cold-blooded!' said Mrs. Almond. 'I need to be with all this hot blood about me. Young Townsend, indeed, is cool; I must allow him that merit.'\" p 144And later, James briefly summarizes three of the main actors. \"Mrs. Penniman, of the three persons in Washington  Square, had much the most of the manner that belongs to a great crisis. If Catherine was quiet, she was quietly quiet...If the doctor was stiff and dry, and absolutely  indifferent to the presence of his companions, it was so lightly, neatly, easily done,that you would have had to know him well to discover that...he enjoyed having to be so disagreeable. But Mrs. Penniman was elaborately  reserved and significantly silent; there was a richer  rustle in the very deliberate movements to which she  confined herself, and when she occasionally spoke, in  connection with some very trivial event, she had the air of  meaning something deeper than what she said.\" p 152And, as a final, briefer selection describing Mrs. Penniman once more: \"'You leave him in good hands,' she said, pressing her lips to Catherine's forehead. (She was fond of kissing people's foreheads; it was an involuntary expression of sympathy with the intellectual part.) p 159I have perhaps fallen for the style more than the story here but one adds to the other. Certainly, I will seek out many more of James' novels in the future.

This is a kind of novel of manners, a mid-19th Century soap opera. Our author is Henry James, so be prepared for the long, convoluted, comma- and semicomma-laden sentences akin to those of Jane Austen.Yet a fascinating book. Catherine, more or less our heroine, is plain, stolid, timid, obedient and, quite frankly, a bit on the dull side. She lives in her father's house. With her mother deceased, a widowed aunt is her caretaker and companion. Catherine is in her late 20's when a suitor finally appears (a late age for that era). Her suitor would be quite a catch for a gal like Catherine, so her father, a wealthy physician, immediately recognizes (and so do we) that he's after her inheritance. Her father forbids the marriage and in that process we learn that he is vindictive, petty, tyrannical, bullying - and wait --- there's something even worse: he doesn't really even LIKE his daughter.The novel fast-forwards in the final chapters so we get to see how it all works out decades in the future.

Several years back I started on one and found myself daydreaming that my late grandmother was offering a sudsy soliloquy on a couple of \"nice\" and \"clean\" romances of her time (the 1930s). In all events, I finally opted for Washington Square, primarily because it's his shortest novel.

I can\u2019t even remember exactly when I first tackled it, but I am delighted with my revisit - (the book and the square). And rereads are lately becoming highly enjoyable ventures.My enjoyment with Washington Square may lead to a rerun and a completion task of the major novels by Henry James. I am already familiar with a few but I have read them at different times in my life and in no particular order. It is time I consolidate my impression of his writing.What I did not expect in this revisit is the degree in which I relished lounging in James prose. Even though this is an early work, I felt such pleasure in drinking his writing as if the lines of his book were fresh water drunk avidly after a long walk or run in the heat of a summer day. Reading James had an almost sedative effect.I was somewhat taken aback when I found how familiar some of his syntax seemed to me. The way he strung words together evoked a similar pleasure to that of recognizing a painter\u2019s work just by the texture of the brushstroke. I noticed his attention to prepositions, which for a non-English speaker, is therefore more baffling. He shifts them and this shifting had at times an equivalent effect to that of a purple dub in a shadow. \n-\tI am told he lives upon her.-\tLives upon her?-\tLives with her.....\nThis example also contains another one of James\u2019s idiomatic uses. The repetitions in his dialogues of expressions that seems ambiguous not only to the reader but the characters in the novel as well. Like throwing light to an obscure corner in a poorly lit room. Here is another sample:\n-\tWhy are you so dry, Catherine?-\tSo dry?-\tSo cold\u2014so irresponsive.\nThe main character is an exercise of the maxim \u2018show and not tell\u2019. We are told from the beginning, mostly by hearing her father\u2019s hammering opinion, that Catherine Sloper is a non-interesting character. She is bland, dull and insipid. In the early pages I asked myself, then, how James would deal with the challenge he had clearly set himself: how he would win the reader\u2019s interest in someone that he first presents as offering no interest. So, in spite of the chorus that accompanies every appearance of Catherine, singing or extolling her lack of luster, the reader gradually, very gradually, sees emerging out of her flat mist a very enigmatic, firm, and rightful figure. She is \u2018substantial\u2019 after all. But then she could not be otherwise if she were \u2018going to stick\u2019. This is after all a story of Catherine\u2019s \u2018stickiness\u2019.I imagine that many other readers would not share my reaction to Doctor Sloper, for I found myself liking him. Of course he is the culprit of much that Catherine has to suffer. He is responsible for branding her and thereby determining her life. More so than the right to arbitrate his progeny that any father may feel entitled to. But I also liked his rightfulness, his intuition, and also that his curiosity seemed to take the upper hand over his drive to authoritarianism. In this reading I paid particular attention to the fleeting references to time and place. Which streets or avenues are mentioned, the topography of that rapidly changing city, what are the perceived differences between Europe and the still forming new country, etc. Although this is most of all a study of character, the visual elements for me stood out precisely because there are not many of them.Beautiful work.

On the one hand, the writing and James' observations are exquisitely on point, and he is able to create such a fleshed out story with so little story-line. On the other, I disliked all the characters. I did sympathize with Catherine, and in a way, even with Morris, but I did not connect to them. I've found this to be the case with other books by Henry James as well as Edith Wharton. They are such masters of language, but for me, they are not as acutely talented in drawing out characters with whom I have an affinity. I never perceived great passion or chemistry between any of the characters, so the \"love story\" did not strike me as terribly authentic or believable. That being said, I did strangely enjoy it. After reading far too much news in recent months, and quite a number or creepy thrillers, I felt a need for beautiful language, and eloquence in a world where some days it seems there is decidedly too little of either.

I read this because I trust James to provide something of linguistic beauty, and in that respect, I was quite satisfied.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Henry James should have gone with the more apt and obvious title Two Shitty Men Say Mean Things To Two Silly Women."}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "Washington Square (1880) was originally published in two different magazines as a serial and Henry James himself didn't really think much of it as a small novel, and I would partly agree with that.Structurally simple in it's approach the story basically recounts a conflict between father and daughter over her wishes to wed a gentleman called Morris Townsend, who he greatly disproves of.The father, Dr. Sloper is a cold but intelligent man who after losing his wife seems to struggle with the realization that his Catherine is growing up, while Catherine is child like and has a quivering nervousness that seems like she is going to burst into tears at any given moment, which she regularly does. She is also one of the most dullest characters I have ever come across!, But saying that I found it extremely difficult to like anybody. Things would improve later on, but the whole novel never really gets out of first gear. As a father only wants what's best for their children he believes Morris is only after Catherine's inheritance once married. He would take her to Europe and try to shake the memories of him away, the fact he will never give his blessing to such a marriage only confounds that he really does love her, in spite of his harsh treatment. This was always an easy read, and the fact many compare James's writing with that of Jane Austin, I was expecting something more, but as a psychological study of family during the latter part of the 19th century, it just about delivered."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "Poor Catherine!

Aunt Lavinia - who is definitely not Aunt Lavinia from  Great Granny Webster; though, how many Aunt Lavinias can there be? - is similarly exquisitely drawn, if in less likable hues, and certainly less likable than the previously mentioned Aunt Lavinia.Washington Square - which came and went - is a parcel of land, in another parcel of land, where rich folk stop on their way, historically, to another parcel of land, all isolated from the real events of the day, like the coming fracture.A 'Negro oyster bar' - where plotters meet for nothing more than mercenary marriage - is all we get; yet I do not think James thought to divert from his abstract."}, {"userName": "HRH", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202682-hrh", "userReview": "I had read Daisy Miller and enjoyed it so I thought I would like another Henry James novel, Washington Square. Furthermore, one of the remarks on the cover said something about the man writing as good a family story as Jane Austen. What could be better? A lot of things actually. I even read somewhere that James didn't like the novel so he didn't include it in his anthology. I'm surprised he made it through the first time knowing the ending as he presumably did.Staged in New York City, Washington Square is the story of Catherine Sloper, the twenty-something daughter of a wealthy physician. When the handsome, clever, and prospectless Morris Townsend courts and proposes to Catherine, her father vehemently refuses his consent which basically adds up to an inheritance a third of what was originally promised. The books tediously accounts the little meetings and conversations, the escapade of Catherine's Aunt Pennyman, Catherine's trip to Europe, and Morris's eventual \"jilting\" of Catherine. The reader believes that at any moment the real story will begin.There are no side plots, only a handful of characters, and no other subject addressed that the \"will they -won't they\" question of Catherine's and Morris' wedding.The ending was the worst of all. In a chapter or two, James leads us through Catherine's life after her engagement if broken off. For a moment one guesses that it will have an ending similar to Persuasion, where the slightly older version of the meant-to-be couple finally comes together. But then Catherine just keeps getting older. Thirty, Forty, Fifty. There is a reason why the romantic escapades of old people are not usual. It is not romantic to hear how the hero has become fat and bald. Finally, Morris shows up and one thinks, aah finally! But no, Catherine awkwardly refuses him and that is the book. It was the sort of moment where one looks about oneself, sure that something was dropped. If one could only find the last pages then the book would be good and resolved.Alas, that was the book."}, {"userName": "Captain Sir Roddy, R.N.

Shakespeare's King Lear and Titus Andronicus certainly come to mind, or Hardy's 'Michael Henchard', and 'Laius of Thebes' may be the worst of the lot. Having just finished reading Henry James's Washington Square I am now fully prepared to add Doctor Austin Sloper to my top-ten list of 'Worst Fathers of Fiction'.Washington Square is a short novel (more a novella) by Henry James written in 1880, and is really an excellent introduction to the fiction of James. The novel is set in the New York City of the mid-19th century, and is the story of the courting of Dr. Sloper's only living child, Catherine, by a handsome young man, Morris Townsend. Catherine is, according to her father, \"a dull, plain girl\", but she is very, very rich. The plot largely revolves around Townsend's efforts to win Catherine's hand in marriage; the Doctor's efforts to thwart the attachment; and the meddling interference of Catherine's busy-body aunt, Lavinia Penniman. During the course of the courtship the reader is exposed to the monstrosity of Dr. Sloper, and begins to question the motives of Morris Townsend, and most importantly we witness the maturation of Catherine Sloper.Some authors paint the landscapes of their fictional world and insert their characters and the plot into it, but James takes an entirely different approach. Henry James portrays the psychological landscape of his characters' minds with his words. However, he throws a wrinkle into the mix as his narrator is neither omniscient nor completely reliable. In other words, much of the time the reader knows as little or as much as the characters themselves in the novel. It is almost as though the reader is sitting in the parlor listening to the conversations, but maybe is only able to comprehend half of what is said.Read this book slowly and carefully, and try and place yourself in the the thoughts and emotions of each of the protagonists and you'll find that your perceptions sharpen and you're able to detect the psychological nuances that influence the tale's outcome. I'm of the mind that this is a story to read and reread and continually discover new and important insights. James seems to prefer to exercise his readers and that is perhaps not altogether a bad thing."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie", "userReview": "[It takes her twenty years to take a breath and animate herself.

A sententious physician. A meddling older woman. A maiden aunt, with a sole romantic disappointment in her lonely past. It doesn't occur to you to think about what awful drama that sentence drags behind it, but it's occurred to Henry James. What was that disappointment? Would that maiden aunt have been better off undisappointed? So here's James's wonderful heroine: plain, dull Catherine Sloper. Her father - a wealthy, sententious, widowed physician - took one look at her and thought well, this daughter is plain and dull. Since then he's dealt with her ironically, distantly, with a vague sense of duty to protect her since she's certainly not going to be able to protect herself.The romantic prospect shows up, and pretty much everyone is suspicious. (Except for that meddling older woman, Catherine's odious aunt, in the tradition of Juliet's nurse.) Catherine is plain, dull and rich; Morris Townsend is handsome, broke and unemployed. You can't blame us for cocking an eyebrow.Dr. Sloper cocks more than an eyebrow. He cocks his whole fortune, insisting that he'll never give her a penny if she marries him. He knows this will crush her; she's utterly smitten, and she may never have any other romance. He judges that a life of lonely disappointment is her best option, as compared to a life of betrayal. Here we are at the drama, and it's high drama, right? It's high romance! And whether Dr Sloper gets his way or not, it may be high tragedy. And I've finally found a way to like Henry James; there's something lovely in his careful picture of Catherine's helpless distress. \"You know how little there is in me to be proud of,\" she says. \"I am ugly and stupid.\" He's found the drama in a life anyone else - even the characters themselves - would have relegated to the sidelines.I mean, listen, Henry James isn't any easier to love than Catherine is. With his steadfast refusal to get to a point, and his teetering piles of words, and his eek-a-mouse reaction to exciting moments. His characters conceal so much, they talk so circumspectly, it's like he's telling you a story with a pillow over his face. The drama is there, but you have to strain to hear it. He's writing in 1880, at the same time as Thomas Hardy's cinematic vividness; it's not like we hadn't invented excitement yet.But it's there, isn't it? Here's one reason the modernists looked back to James: his ability to find a story in the places one doesn't ordinarily look. As her father tries to ruin her only love affair, he's asked: \"Hasn't she made a scene?\" \"She is not scenic,\" he replies. But he's wrong. She is."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "My second book by James and I still remain unimpressed when comparing him to Lawrence, Hardy or the Bront\u00eb sisters. Even to Austen.I know he writes about different times, different places and with different aims, but even though I appreciate his correct and composed style, I miss the passionate accounts of other classic authors.In \"Washington Square\" the setting takes place in the late XIXth New York where we are introduced to the Sloper family, consisting basically of the well respected and intelligent Doctor Sloper, her humble daughter Catherine and a couple of her manipulative aunts. Our heroine is a dull girl, who lives under her father's wing, whose will is completely subjected by the Doctor's poor opinion of her. Dr. Sloper is always kind to her but at the same time he treats her as an inferior creature, not relying on her judgements or her opinions. He is domineering and strict. The biggest praise we hear about her is that she is \"a modest and a quiet girl\", meaning that she is gullible, submitted and patient. Not exactly as Hardy's Tess or Charlotte's Jane Eyre or Lawrence's Lady Chatterley. The plot is settled when a new character is introduced, a young suitor, Mr Townsend, who wins the girl affection on the spot, seeing an opportunity to get a large sum of money if he marries her.In the end, this book talks about a family conflict, as all the characters have their own interests and only the girl is earnest and innocent in her desires. She is trifled by everybody, by her own father and aunt and also by her lover. I was sorry to witness her endurance, passive self control when her future and happiness were being decided by everybody but herself.All in all, I would say that I enjoyed this story much more in retrospection than while reading it. The whole composition makes sense in the end, and I find it highly realistic, but my guts can't help but shouting out loud to condemn the way women are mistreated in this novel.I'll have to read more books by James to see if that's a \"general\" in all his works.

Anzich\u00e9 muoversi sui tre lati del triangolo Catherine - Morris - dottor Sloper, James aggiunge il personaggio di Lavinia, la zia di Catherine, ottenendo di fatto un quadrato (in inglese, square). In effetti anche a me, leggendolo \u00e8 apparso come una sorta di gioco dei quattro cantoni; un gioco in cui i quattro personaggi si alternano sulla scena seguendo un meccanismo talmente perfetto da ricordare quello degli orologi a carillon esposti nelle facciate di alcune chiese, come in un balletto in cui, alla fine, ciascuno ruota solo su se stesso.http://www.diunlibro.it/washington-sq..."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Henry James\u2019 in-depth character portrayals are marvelous.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)The CCLaP 100: In which I read a hundred so-called \"classic\" books for the first time, then file reports on whether or not I think they deserve the labelBook #10: Washington Square, by Henry James (1880)The story in a nutshell:Agreed by most to definitely be one of his minor works, Washington Square is in reality not much more than a novella, written between major novels in the late Victorian Age as James often did throughout his career. And there's not much of a plot either, to tell you the truth; it's primarily the story of Catherine Sloper, a pleasant but rather dim-witted and plain-looking young woman living in the ritzy old-money New York neighborhood of Washington Square, along with her father who she shares a large house with, Austin Sloper, a typical middle-aged business-focused white guy who sorta laughingly condescends to all the people around him who aren't middle-aged business-focused white guys. In fact, this is the crux of the problem between the two of them, the conflict that fuels almost the entire storyline; it seems that Catherine has met a good-looking charmer named Morris Townsend who wishes to marry her, but her father deems him a simple-minded dreamer who's most likely after her money, and Catherine herself as just too much of a blockhead to be able to make a realization like this on her own, which is why he forbids the two to wed for her own good.The father and daughter then whisk off to Europe for a year, as upper-class Americans so often did at the time; but instead of Morris heroically coming to the rescue and bringing his true love back, it turns out that her father was right all along, with Morris turning out to be a kinda skeevy loser who actually was kinda after her money, and who sorta slinks off in this weasely way once she gets back into the country and declares that her allowance will be cut off if they wed. Instead of this making her grateful to her father for seeing the light, though, Catherine just ends up pissed at both of them, eventually growing into a matronly middle-aged old maid who becomes the buddy of the younger crowd in the neighborhood, but who never experiences love for herself even once.The argument for it being a classic:The argument for Washington Square being a classic is not a strong one, truthfully, and seems to most concern what the small novel is not -- it's not one of James' ponderous epics, not one of his later experimental works, but rather a simple and entertaining little story in the spirit of Jane Austen, told in about the most straight-ahead fashion possible. This is why people become fans of James in the first place, after all; he's considered by many to be the godfather of the modern realistic novel, the kinds of no-nonsense, clearly-written stories that comprise most Pulitzer winners and other academically-revered books. Certainly there are a lot of other novels in James' ouevre that are better-written, better-known, more historically important and a much better argument for being a classic, even this book's fans would say; it's just that Washington Square is one of his most accessible novels, a great way to ease yourself into his larger and denser pieces, and thus should be included in \"The Canon\" as well.The argument against:As mentioned, the argument against Washington Square being a classic is clearly the stronger one, and consists mostly of what we've been talking about; that it is simply too slim and obscure to be considered a classic, certainly a good beginning for people new to James' work but definitely not something to be held up against early-career trans-Atlantic sagas as The Portrait of a Lady and The Bostonians, nor the proto-Modernist experimental stylings of such late-career novels as The Ambassadors and The Golden Bowl. It may be a good introduction to James, critics argue, but that comes with a price; it is also a frothily light novel, its plot so wispy as to almost not exist, and not something that will give you a good idea of why James fans are so nuts for his work in the first place.My verdict:So I have to confess, this was the very first book of James that I've ever tackled, and I picked it deliberately because I was a little intimidated by his larger and more well-known ones; James has a certain reputation, after all, especially among academic intellectuals who enjoy thick and challenging books, and I've also heard that his larger novels can sometimes get extremely bogged down in their middles. Ah, but like everyone else, I've discovered the problem to starting with a classic author's lighter and less-important work, which is the same thing mentioned in the criticisms above; that you just really can't get a sense from work like that about why people love that author so much to begin with, of why their work got so famous and respected in the first place. Washington Square comes and goes with the reader barely noticing; just when you think the story's about to get ratcheted up and interesting, suddenly it's over, and you realize that the entire point was to provide not much more than a trifling and amusing afternoon of diversion*. It was decent enough for what it was, and I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the 1997 movie adaptation with Jennifer Jason Leigh, but I certainly can't say that I \"know\" James' work in any kind of significant way because of reading it, nor can I in good conscience declare Washington Square a classic.Is it a classic? No*And by the way, some final proof of just how lightweight this novel is -- James himself, when doing a retrospective of his ouevre late in life and putting together the revised 24-volume \"New York Edition\" of his work, actually left Washington Square out on purpose, reportedly because he couldn't even read through it again as an older man, disgusted as he was with the frivolity of the story. When the author himself is disgusted with one of his own books, it's usually not a great sign that it'll be making the canon list anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Siti", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70149062-siti", "userReview": "Romanzo appartenente alla prima fase della narrativa jamesiana, pubblicato per la prima volta in Inghilterra nel 1880, se si sono gi\u00e0 letti i suoi romanzi brevi pi\u00f9 belli \u201cGiro di vite\u201d (1898), \u201cLa bestia nella giungla\u201d (1903) o il romanzo lungo \u201cLe ali della colomba\u201d(1902) o ancora il pi\u00f9 noto \u201cRitratto di signora - coevo a Washington Square - si rimarr\u00e0 inizialmente sorpresi dalla narrazione fluida, dalla trama spicciola, da un romanzo che apparentemente sembra abbastanza sempliciotto. Eppure non nego che mi \u00e8 piaciuto e come al solito sono stata in balia dei capricci jamesiani. Si legge, il lieve romanzo, ancora una volta sulla scia di una lunga prospettiva chiedendosi che cosa accadr\u00e0 mai, quale sar\u00e0 il punto di volta, dove lo si trover\u00e0 inaspettatamente, e ancora quali sviluppi conosceranno i personaggi, quali evoluzioni, perch\u00e9 s\u00ec un punto di volta ci dovr\u00e0 pur essere. Ed eccoci di nuovo caduti nell\u2019inganno! Nessuna evoluzione, nessun importante smottamento, nessuna rivoluzione, nessuna!! Eppure si arriva alla fine piacevolmente intrattenuti da una banalit\u00e0 che ha il fascino di suscitare quei grandi interrogativi che portano ad andare un po\u2019 sopra le righe per chiedersi semplicemente: come viviamo, che significato attribuiamo agli eventi che ci capitano, come reputiamo di essere in grado di essere noi medesimi gli artefici del nostro destino, e ancora come viviamo il nostro temperamento personale, ne abbiamo uno effettivamente marcato e marcante?Il romanzo \u00e8 ambientato in America, New York, in una abitazione borghese sita in Washington Square, il fulcro di tutti gli eventi, la metafora dell\u2019immobilismo pi\u00f9 assoluto della povera protagonista Catherine. \u00c8 la figlia poco apprezzata del Dottor Sloper, noto negli ambienti per rigore, onest\u00e0 e fine intelletto, quello che lamenta mancare alla figlia, l\u2019unica rimastogli dopo la morte prematura di un figlio e della moglie, emblematico il fatto che lui cos\u00ec capace non sia riuscito a strapparli dalla morte. Salvo due brevi digressioni, funzionali all\u2019impianto narrativo e caratteristiche della prosa jamesiana, ambientante in Europa, la scena \u00e8 fissa su Catherine e sulla dimora dove tutto accade, anche quando lei non \u00e8 presente perch\u00e9 momentaneamente in viaggio col padre. La casa \u00e8 luogo di incontro con un suo pretendente il quale si rivela fin da subito per i suoi intenti meschini anelanti al miraggio del soldo facile, quello che il matrimonio con quella giovane bruttina e insignificante potrebbe garantirgli. L\u2019accorto Dottor Sloper fiuta immediatamente il pericolo e intralcia le possibili nozze. La dimora \u00e8 inoltre il luogo dove l\u2019antagonista Morris si trover\u00e0 a casa proprio in assenza del padrone grazie alla benevolenza della sorella, si appropria degli ambienti a lui pi\u00f9 cari, tenta la sostituzione, attende il rientro e cerca di convincere la giovane Catherine del suo amore... Insomma tutta la narrazione \u00e8 un tira e molla fra padre e figlia e pretendente, mai uno scontro aperto, mai una parola di pi\u00f9, tutto \u00e8 giocato sul filo della psicologia pi\u00f9 fine con una ragazza che riuscir\u00e0 a giocare la sua partita senza perdere un colpo seppur perdendola.Consigliato perch\u00e9 piacevole, interessante, suscitatore di interrogativi e insolitamente jamesiano."}], "description": "Washington Square follows the coming-of-age of its plain-faced, kindhearted heroine, Catherine Sloper.
