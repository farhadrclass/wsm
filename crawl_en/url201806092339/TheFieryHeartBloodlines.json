I hurried to it. Did you get it? asked Sydney.Get what?Look under your door.I did and found that a room key had been slid inside. Not even bothering to respond to her, I quickly dressed and headed out into the hall, turning toward the room number on the key. I nearly knocked but then decided I must have an open invitation and unlocked the door.I stepped inside, shutting the door behind me, and found the room was even nicer than mine. Most of the lights were off, and a blazing fire crackled in the wood-burning fireplace. Sydney sat on the bed and rose as I approached.And she was naked.\u201cYou want to get breakfast?\u201d I asked.\u201cWe can\u2019t go out together. It\u2019s going to be bad enough if someone sees you leaving my room.\u201dI glanced at a clock. \u201cNah. They\u2019re all going to bed right around now.\u201d\u201cThen how are we going to get breakfast?\u201d\u201cThere are a couple of twenty-four-hour places since there are always some people coming in and out from human schedules.\u201d I kissed her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll lift your coffee restriction since this is a special occasion.\u201dhe watched him with amusement and then turned back to me, sobering a little. \u201cI also figured you\u2019d want a cigarette. Must have been rough going, what, three hours?\u201d she teased.\u201cThree hours? Hell, Rose. I\u2019m going on about six weeks.\u201dThe complete shock on her face was one of the best things I\u2019d seen all day. To be fair, her surprise wasn\u2019t entirely unwarranted. I\u2019d kind of quit while dating her, though I\u2019d cracked a few times and then completely relapsed afterward. \u201cYou . . . quit?\u201dWhy are you so sad? You aren\u2019t stupid. You\u2019re my brilliant, beautiful boy. You\u2019ll figure a way out of this.I could hear Aunt Tatiana\u2019s voice as clearly as if she stood beside me. I buried my face in my hands. \u201cGo away, Aunt Tatiana. I don\u2019t need to add hallucinations to my growing list of problems.\u201dSince when was I problem?ReviewThis is one of my favourite series of all time and this book surpasses its predecessors, which is really hard to do. It\u2019s got everything that made me fall in love with this series but it takes all that to a much higher level and you can feel how high the stakes are and how much Adrian and Sydney are risking by being together. The romance is definitely the thing that stands out and it\u2019s foremost a love story. Adrian and Sydney have the greatest chemistry ever and reading their scenes is wonderful. Sydrian takes up most of the book and their fans will literally die of feels! They both bring out sides of each other that we\u2019ve never seen before and it\u2019s amazing to discover more of them through their interactions with each other. There are some very HOT sydrian scenes and I LOVED them! I personally love all the characters in this book, but sadly they didn\u2019t appear much. And Zoe appeared too much. (Can I kill her?) I knew from her first appearance in Bloodlines that I would loath her and she didn\u2019t prove me wrong. There are instances in the book where I sort of understood her and thought she may not be so bad, but she really is a total bitch and all she cares about is sucking up to her dad. As for Eddie, Jill, Trey and Angeline, their love square is kinda resolved-ish, but honestly, they needed more page time! Neil was also introduced and we barely get to know him, but he\u2019s likeable and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more of him. The non-sydrian part of the plot is about blood and spirit experiments and stuff. It\u2019s interesting but it takes a back seat to the romance \u2013 not that I minded. BUT, because of these experiments, Adrian and Sydney do visit the moroi court and we meet Rose/Dimitri/Lissa/Christian/Abe....and some other characters from VA . It was really nice to see them again, especially Abe and I really hope he plays a bigger part in the next book. I think it\u2019s possible because he kinda knows what Sydney is up to. Basically, this book is a love story and if you\u2019re in it for Sydrian, it will be heaven. If you want something more like VA, then you might be disappointed with the lack of action. The ending was .................INTENSE. It\u2019s what I have been expecting for a while now and although it\u2019s painful, I was very excited by it and can\u2019t wait to see where it leads. UPDATE: Am I the only one who hates the cover? The Adrian model looked alright in TIS's cover, but his haircut sucks in this and the Sydney model looks weird too. Disappointed....OMG!!!! I love the title!! 'The Fiery Heart' And its gonna switch between Sydney and Adrian's POV!!!! Did I mention how excited I am to get into Adrian's head?GIMME THE BOOK!!!!!!!Still waiting....Release date isn't until 2013!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581159-jennifer", "userReview": "OMG!

Is it just me or does it seem very cheap compared to the others. The same goes for the 5th book, Silver Shadows. What happened here, guys?And second, I have no idea where I'm taking this review for The Fiery Heart. I mean it was amazing, mind-blowing even and yes, simple perfection, which isn't a surprise when it's about a book that has Adrian Ivashkov in it, but oh... the ending killed me. It really did. And the thing is, I had a feeling this would happen but still, I wasn't prepared for it to shock me like it did. It's just the most awful ending I have read about in so long. I really hate cliffhangers.So... Sydney and Adrian? Ah, they're perfect together. Simply perfect. I was a little wary at first when I started this book because I had no idea where Richelle Mead would take their relationship to. So I'm really glad and relieved about the way she did it. Really, nothing has changed, except for the hot make-out sessions they have to do in secret, but let's face it, that makes it just the more sexy. But it's not just about sex, it's more. They love each other so much, you see it in the way both Sydney and Adrian talk to and about each other. It just makes the ending all the more terrible. Aside from their relationship, we can totally see how both Sydney and Adrian have grown. I mean, seriously, you wouldn't recognize them if you'd go back to reading the Vampire Academy books. And that's just one thing I love about both these characters. But of course they haven't changed too much. Sydney is still the same brainy girl who plans ahead and Adrian is still the witty, charming guy who makes every girl drop their panties. And we love him for it. Seriously, I can't press enough how much I love Adrian. If it wasn't obvious before, I came to love him even more because of this book. He was simply put awesome in it. Still my #1 book boyfriend!But anyway... I feel like I'm straying from the review here. So, the overall story? Loved it. And not just all because of Adrian, though of course he plays a big factor in me loving this book and series. No, the story was pretty great too. Especially with Adrian's point of view. Oh yes baby! Being inside his mind was thrilling and exciting and just totally amazing. His chapters show his highs and his lows but I still love him anyway. I also felt like it isn't just Sydney's story anymore. Adrian did pretty impressive things. Again, he's grown so, so much. Damn, I love him.I also love all the other characters. And I mean it when I say this series has a lot of great ones. Of course there's the usual ones like Jill, Eddie, Trey, Angeline. And I must say I'm really liking Jill now. I used to be not a big fan of her but also she has grown up a lot. Pretty impressive. I just want her and Eddie to be together already. Come on! Trey as usually was his awesome self and I'm glad he was in the book quite a lot actually. And Angeline? She's just a riot, isn't she. Then there were the newer characters like Neil, the new British guy. I wasn't too sure about him in the beginning but after what he did for \"the greater good\" I think he's pretty great. Oh and Sydney's sister, Zoe joined them. I wanted to pretty much choke her all the time because she was so annoying and kept making it harder for Sydney and Adrian to be together. And of course she played a role in that awful ending. Boo! She's definitely on my kill list now, together with her and Sydney's father. I should also mention this book was like a Vampire Academt reunion. Pretty much all the major characters appeared in this book not once but several times. And when I say major characters I mean, Rose, Dimitri, Lissa, Christian, Sonya, Abe. So yep, pretty much the whole gang. It made me smile. I miss them all so much. The Fiery Heart by Richelle Mead definitely is one of my favorite Bloodlines books. It had everything I crave in a good book. Kick-ass action, passion and romance, drama and one hell of an ending with a cliffhanger (although I could've lived without that last one). But even with how totally shocked and sad it made me, it's a pretty good ending if you want to give your readers a heart attack and make them crave the next book like they're hooked on drugs. Also this book has been one of my most anticipated books of the year and I read it like two days. Yep, that's what this series does to me. Turn me into a reading zombie. But it was one amazing ride that I wouldn't want to forget even though I'm in need for some hugs to help me get over this book. And now the only think I can do is wait for the next book, Silver Shadows. Can't it be July 2014 already?"}, {"userName": "Mikaela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2714947-mikaela", "userReview": "For this review to take place, I feel as though I have to split myself into two people. One is the completely bias fangirl, who obsesses over characters and a world she loves. This is the same girl who shrieked so loudly when Dimitri made a reappearance that someone came in to check if she was okay. Looking at the book through this persona I was happy. Adrian and Sydney really grew as a couple (even with the drastically cliched \"the centre will hold\" motif) and they had some cute moments with cupcakes and car sex (woohoo Sydney, onya girl!). I loved seeing all the characters that I've come to love, and I had a heart attack when Jill FINALLY kissed Eddie (I mean come on it's been four books)The other part of me is the objective reader, who's sifted through classics, trash and every other book in between. She was unimpressed with the slow pace of the plot, the predictability of the ending, and the lack of any real definitive action. There were things I liked, but nothing that drove me to pick up the book and obsessively read it cover to cover in one night. It just seemed like a load of teenage angst (bear in mind that I love this series and it kills me to say that, so you know it's my honest opinion rather than just plain ol' book bashing). I was... disappointed. I know Mead, and even though it's the characters that drive her books I was thoroughly disappointed in the story itself! And even the characters plateaued. I know we were supposed to recognize that Adrian had \"changed so much\" and \"grown as an individual\" but to me it felt as though we saw that last book, and this was just reiterating something we'd already known? With the exception of Sydney and how her character developed, I'd say most of the characters just stayed in their own little background roles, adding fluff here and there. Like a nice backdrop in a photo which was clearly centred on Sydrian. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE Sydrian. I live for Sydrian. The fangirl part of me was super happy with that. But the other part was NOT. Hence my confusion, and a 3.5 star rating. And now because I've been so kind I'm going to go and crawl up in a corner and cuddle Dimitri for a little bit, while I wait for the next book to come out and amaze me. By the way, we're all taking bet's on what's going to happen next book  over here if you want to pop in and have your say!"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Becky  22 ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7778906-becky-22", "userReview": "This was goooooooood! \"Just finished writing what may be the most powerful scene in the VA/Bloodlines series. And I don't say that lightly after Shadow Kiss.\"- Richelle Mead about the ending of this book.OH MY GOD.Kinda scared. I mean...Shadow Kiss was woah. I have a feeling Fiery Heart will be like Shadow Kiss.A crying festival. Am I right ?Richelle: I don't know if it'll be a crying festival, but I think a lot of books will be thrown across the room. (http://blue-succubus.livejournal.com/...) 06/20/13 Update: The next \"Bloodlines\" book, \"The Fiery Heart,\" comes out November 19th. That's going to be a big one in the series. For those familiar with the first series, it's kind of like what \"Shadow Kissed\" and \"Blood Promise\" were\u2014the point where the plot just really jumps up. It's told through alternating POVs of Sydney and Adrian, and it's just\u2014there's a huge, almost heartbreaking intensity to it. We finally deal with the issues of spirit, like mental health and things like that. So that just really tugs at you, but at the same time, we see Sydney and Adrian's relationship escalate considerably. So fans who liked how hot \"Indigo Spell\" was, I hope they have their smelling salts for this one. It's going to get turned up in there too. It's just another one of those things I like. I like the contrasting things: I want you to be excited and laughing one moment and gasping in the next, and I think there's just a lot of that. It's got a big semi-cliffhanger ending, so I apologize in advance for that.  06/09/13 Update: Richelle Mead talking about this book: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUPvei...(Anyone else scared?)Here are two mini excerpts! One from Sidney's POV:http://www.scribd.com/doc/131689699/T...And one from Adrian's POV:https://www.facebook.com/notes/richel..."}, {"userName": "Chester Carstairs", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705811-chester-carstairs", "userReview": "Love is... a flame in the dark. A breath of warmth on a winter's night. A star that guides you home.\nRichelle Mead did it again! Oh yes, you're probably tired of reading that in my reviews. But really, can you say otherwise? This book has given me all the Sydrian dose I needed and. so. much. more. It's that good kind of overdose you'd never recover from. Certainly worth the agonizing wait!Our favorite couple (or should I say one of our favorites? Since we have tons of ships in this series) is finally together! Yes, I know it started in the last book, but I've been so excited to know of their progress since that time. And this book did not disappoint at all! I feel like I would spontaneously combust every other page. THAT'S how great this book is. Of course, it's not Sydrian without the lows. And we did get a few of that here. Nonetheless, you can definitely say we've come through a long, long way from Vampire Academy. Or even Bloodlines, that is.Sydney is... well, it's like the old Sydney has been abducted by aliens and been replaced with a new one. And I'm not even exaggerating. I mean, have you ever imagine Sydney is capable of this?\n\"I never claimed strength in the face of your charms, Sage. I'm just an ordinary man. Now put the shirt back on.\"I leaned forward, testing the strength of his hold. \"Or what?\" With my free hand, I caught hold of one of my bra straps and started to pull it down...\nI know you've heard and read this a million times but Sydney had come a really long way. There are a lot of things in this book you'd never thought the old Syndey would have done. Things you'd never dream she'd be capable of or even confident enough to do *ahem* that freaking lodge scene.Of course, the same things could be said about our beloved and ridiculously handsome Moroi. Yes, Adrian surprised us a lot in The Indigo Spell, but it's nothing compared to the Adrian we see now that they're together. Not that I'm surprised. Adrian has always been the sweet type to people he liked. And Sydney, well... she's the love of his life. Of course you'd expect nothing less than to swoon every page of his chapter POVs.I wish I could say it'd be nothing but happy times for Adrian now that they're together. He's within grips of spirit's craziness, after all. It's totally different now that we're seeing how spirit can affect someone directly, now that we have his POV. Not a good insight at all. And in addition, he'll now be forced to face his own demons. Nothing our Ivashkov prince couldn't handle. Or so we'd hope.But as what I mentioned earlier, Adrian has come a long way. We do get another chance to meet well-loved characters of the past. Including Lissa and Christian! Yep, most of the old gang will have a cameo. And if Dimitri bothers Adrian before, he could now make jokes (still at our favorite dhampir's expense, of course) without bitterness.\n\"Nah, we've got to be all responsible and stuff to deal with the spirit problem, right? We can celebrate later. Besides, Belikov can't hold his liquor.\"\nBut what I love most is the fact that despite all the magic and otherworldly stuff now filling the lives of the characters of this series, we keep coming back to main focus of this series. The focus on morality and beliefs. And it's not just Sydney's beliefs and morality anymore, but other people's as well. So that being said, let's visit our other ships' lives. *wink*Trey and Angeline! These two dysfunctional people is cute. Especially when they become Dimitri-like people with their Zen wisdom. It's funny how this couple, of all people, would be the one Sydney would admire and even be jealous of. But Angeline would really surprise you in this book. Oh, she's still crazy, but you'll see sides of her you've never seen before.Eddie and Jill! *exasperated but fangirl-crazy sigh* Finally! Well, I was kinda expecting that when Eddie won't shut up but I didn't know Jill had it in her. You go, Jill! I'm so proud of you. *screams \"that's my otp*I even ship Neil and Olive. Gosh, the couples won't sop coming. How are we even expected to survive all these cuuuute ships?! *dreamy sigh*But as much as I would love to stay in that wonderful, wonderul chapters of the book, I have to face the fact that that last 3 chapters happen. So... let's talk about despicable Zoe.**major spoilers below**The most torturous of torture is not even enough as Zoe's punishment. I know, I know, that if we stop and look at it in Zoe's perspective, she thinks that she's trying to save her sister (though if I'm going to be honest, she's probably trying to up herself in her daddy's eyes). But if only she hadn't come interfering. Ugh. I so, so hate Mr. Sage.

I took a deep breath and met the gazes of all those watching me in the room. Who was I to do this?I was Adrian Ivashkov. And I was about to kick some ass.\nActual rating: 3.5Here's my very controversial take on this book: I wish Sydrian never happened. What can I say, I loved the sexual tension and the chemistry of Sydney and Adrian as they battled for and against their feelings for each other more than I love their actual romance.Please don't take my rating and my statement to mean that I did not like this book. I really did. Richelle Mead's writing has always been exceptional (with the exception of one glaring instance that rhymes with Lameboard of the Gods, which we shall never mention again), the characters---all of them, not merely the side characters, are multi-dimensional and well-portrayed. Technically, it was a very, very good book, but I do wish that Sydney and Adrian were still embroiled in the midst of their complex mating dance, rather than together as a couple.I have been anticipating this book for a long time, I have absolutely adored this series, and Sydney and Adrian have grown on me more than I ever would have known. I mean it, I loved both characters. Individually. As a pair, as a lovey-dovey couple constantly sneaking off for groping/make out sessions, planning sweet gifts for one another, having clandestine eye-contact in the middle of important meetings, sending cute texts to each other on their \"love phone?\" Not so much.What I loved about this series overall was the characters of Sydney and Adrian, and watching them evolve into better people, thanks to one another. Sydney and Adrian were so instrumental in each others' growth, and as happy as I am to see them achieve happiness as a couple, I can't help feel that their overwhelming romance took place at the expense of the plot. Frankly, their love got on my nerves.I never expected to like either Sydney or Adrian as much as I did coming into this series. Both characters were initially hard to love; we only saw glimpses of a very standoffish, cold, and deeply distrustful young Sydney in Vampire Academy. She was a stark contrast to the energetic, fiery Rose, and her narration was starkly jarring to me in the beginning of the Bloodlines series. Sydney grew on me as much as a character in a book ever could. I grew to understand her and admire her as she has grown into herself, as she has worked exceedingly hard to change the very core of the rational Alchemist that she is. We saw Sydney overcome her distrust of the Moroi, her fear of magic, her skepticism of Adrian, her obsessiveness with perfection, her insecurities, her body issues. It feels as if Sydney is fully matured in this book, she has changed so much, and I like her as she is, but she seems somewhat less compelling of a character in this book. I liked her with a little more mental insecurity, more issues within her head, not so perfect. Does that make me a bad person?Without a doubt, Adrian is my favorite character in this book, and I loved the way this book was structured, because for the first time, we get to hear Adrian's narration. Adrian's mental and physical change was such a joy to read. I hate bad boys. Fuck rakes. Fuck jerks, assholes, douchebag romance tropes. Fuck all the Jericho Fuckin' Barrons of the world. But there is nothing so attractive as a reformed rake, and Adrian's transformation was as good as they came. In this book, we got to see even further how much he struggles, we see his mental instability as he deals with his overwhelming spirit use, his conflict as he tries to be someone worthy of being loved, of being a good boyfriend to Sydney, and a person who is in control of his own life.And I gave myself a pat on the back because I was able to diagnose Adrian's mental illness before the book did. Thanks, DSM-V. I'm by no means an expert on mental disorders, but I felt Richelle Mead painted bipolar disorder in a realistic, convincing way within this book. The extreme highs. The despairing lows. The constant swings in between. The mental instability. The feeling that you are never good enough. The phases of mania descending into a stupor. It was commendably well done.With that said, this book was too much Sydrian. The plot was just not there. The majority of the book dealt with Sydney and Adrian's clandestine love, their illicit meetings, their struggle to disguise their actual feelings for one another during their meetings with others. There was an underlying plot, several minor ones, in fact, and they were very well done. In fact, I wish for more of it, including more of Adrian's involvement in using Spirit to cure the Strigoi. But no, the plot just got overwhelmed by the gooey pile of mushiness that is Sydney and Adrian.Overall, this is a very good book, but I found it a disappointment compared to the previous books. But then again, this is Richelle Mead, and I have to confess, I expect very great things from my favorite authors. She still remains one of my favorite authors, but I just want more plot and less knocking of boots, however attractive those boots are, Adrian."}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "SpoilersI initially enjoyed the first three Bloodlines books but I think I've gone off them\u2026 On rereading I found them all rather uninspired and cheesy, especially the numerous romances which seem to dominate every story arc. I was hoping The Fiery Heart would reestablish my love for the series but if anything it just made me dislike it even more. Maybe, I'm just tired of vampires, YA, and silly-forbidden-tropey romances. -I didn't really find the plot interesting. Most of the book was spent on Sydney/Adrian's mushy-and-dull-and-of-course-forbidden relationship, the rest was focused on Sydney replicating the Alchemist anti-ink, and finding a solution to the stirgoi problem. It all felt like filler and everything was dragged out, it wasn't until the very end when things really started to kick off. I have to say I wasn't impressed with the cliffhanger - I think it's obvious that Sydney will be rescued from the Alchemists/reeducation centre, she'll be traumatised for a little while but her wuv for Adrian will heal her, they'll get it on, and Sydney will vow to take down the Alchemists. If there's going to be a cliffhanger then I want to be surprised by what's to happen. Why have a cliffhanger when its clear what's to come?-The series was initially about Sydney and co trying to protect Jill but that's been more or less been forgotten about. There was a quick conversation with Lissa telling Adrian that Jill could come out of hiding because she managed to change that silly every-monarach-must-have-a-family-member rule/law. So yea, the arc that was the foundation of the series was tied up in a very rushed and unsatisfying way. I'm not sure what the series is about anymore \u2014 the books have gone off into different tangents and seem to more about Sydney's magic, the Alchemists, Adrian's perfect HEA, and the stirgoi problem. I wish there was just the one overarching storyline throughout, I guess future books will be about taking down the Alchemists. But since I find them irritating and dull, I'm not looking forward to that.-I'm not interested in the Alchemists whatsoever, I don't find them compelling antagonists at all. They're just a bunch of stuck up, hypocritical, boring, righteous, racist humans who hate vampires for no real reason other than them thinking they're impure. The Alchemists don't have the allure, power or danger of the stirgoi\u2026 So yea, they make rubbish bad guys.-In earlier installments, I thought I preferred Sydney over Rose but not so much in this one. I finally realised how uninteresting Sydney is, she's had such a boring life, she mostly always follows rules, she's never had a relationship before Adrian, and she's never had a life before Adrian\u2026 And that makes Sydney boring. I didn't notice her flat personality in the first 3 books because I was kept entertained by Sydney's character development \u2014 she changed her principles, she embraced vampires and love, she rebelled against the Alchemists, and she accepted her magic. And now she's done all that, she has nothing else to offer, except her boring personality and her boring duties and her banging on and on about her wuv for Adrian.-I really didn't like Adrian. He was an annoying, self-pitying, useless, irresponsible, drunk loser. Yea, I know he's a Spirit user which messes with his emotions but it was hard to feel sorry for him when he got drunk whenever he felt down in the dumps. What can he really offer Sydney? She'd just be picking up after him and having to support his many ups and downs all her life. Sydney has enough to worry about (Jill, her sister, her magic, not getting caught out by the Alchemists) and Adrian just makes her life even more difficult. She'd be better off without him.Also, I was really tired of Adrian's whole nobody understands me routine. Get over it.-Sydney/Adrian's relationship/love seemed so forced. I used to like them together but not anymore \u2014 their relationship comes across as fake and contrived. There was too much of Sydney/Adrian banging on about how perfect they were for each other and how they were made for each other. I wasn't convinced, I wanted to 'see' their love for myself instead of being repeatedly hit on the head with it. They just weren't natural together, every action and thought between them was contrived so that they'd seem like a 'meant to be' couple.-I hated how much Sydney's friends/Adrian took advantage of her. She was always the one who was left with sorting things out.-I was disgusted that Sydney losing her virginity meant she'd lose half her magic. WTF?! It really pissed me off, why do so many fantasy/supernatural type books have heroines that can't lose their virginity without losing their power or strength. Because a girl who loses her virginity needs to be punished or is somehow less than before?! Ugh. It's a disgusting and sexist trope.-What was with Adrian calling Rose the love of his life? Really? Sure, he might think it's Sydney now but if he thought it was Rose at one point, and now thinks it's Sydney then what's to stop it from being someone else in the future?-I wish Adrian would get a job. He's 21 and living off his dad. He could still work whilst taking classes, he's got plenty of time.-I'm getting tired of all these virgin heroines who can't fathom having sex with anyone apart from the love of their life. Yet all YA heroes/male love interests are cool with having sex with anyone and everyone regardless of feelings. The double standards and sexism in YA are disgusting.-I rolled my eyes at Adrian saying he was inexperienced because he'd never been with a virgin before. Ugh, I'm sick of that line \u2014 it's in every YA book and it's not romantic, its cringey. Adrian was an experienced manslut, he knew exactly what to do, his whole 'I'm inexperienced' nonsense was tropey bullshit.-It was Adrian's fault that Sydney was caught out by her sister/dad/the Alchemists at the end. Adrian kept pushing her to sneak out and pressuring her to spend time with him even though he knew Zoe was getting suspicious. Sydney was risking it all to be with him, he was risking nothing whatsoever. I didn't like how willing he was to put Sydney at risk just because he was greedy and selfish. I'm not convinced that he loves her all that much, everything was about him and his needs. He never once thought to back off in order to protect her.-Also, I hated how Sydney paid for so many of Adrian's things\u2026 Like the bed and breakfast, Adrian's ruby, and Adrian's car repairs. He was such a loser boyfriend.-I find it funny how Adrian emptied out his bank account for Rose and gave expensive gifts to all his other girlfriends yet he couldn't do the same for Sydney when he claims to love her. It was really off putting how she was bank rolling him, no wonder he's in 'love' with her.-I was disgusted at how easily Adrian gave up on Sydney when she was taken by the Alchemists after they found out about her relationship with him. She'd only been missing a few days, and he stopped trying to find a way to rescue her, and instead decided to get drunk because that would make him feel better. Never mind about Sydney and the fact that she needed help, it was all about him. If it was the other way around, Sydney would stop at nothing to save him. It's a shame Adrian doesn't love her as much as she loves him.-There was way too much recapping of earlier books.-I still don't understand why every moroi king/queen has to have a sibling/family member to rule. It's not like the throne can be passed down to relatives, it's all election based\u2026 It's a ridiculous law that makes no sense.-Why does every character have to paired off with someone? There were too many couples/potential couples\u2026 Adrian/Sydney, Jill/Eddie, Angeline/Trey, Neil/Olivia, not to mention past teen couples. It's unrealistic that every teenage character has managed to find their twu wuv. All in all, it was disappointing. Sydney was boring, Adrian was whiny, the romance was another cliched run of the mill YA romance, and the plot wasn't exciting."}, {"userName": "Kelena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7096828-kelena", "userReview": "5 Centrum Permanebit Heartbreakingly Emotional, Sensual, Fun StarsWill it, Sydney?

I can't believe it took me almost 2 months to read The Fiery Heart. I got stalled out by the midway point and didn't have any motivation to want to pick the book up again. Was my love affair with Richelle Mead coming to an end? Say it isn't so!I really couldn't figure out what was up with the \"whole lot of yawn\" happening in the first half. Even having Adrian's PoV didn't really perk up the non-events going on. Maybe the alchemist side of the story and all of the new characters just don't do it for me.I'm still also trying to reconcile in my head how much magic humans can do now. Back in VA, it almost seemed like the magic that alchemists had was borrowed through the use of vampire blood and infused items. Now, humans are just going around left and right and kicking ass alongside the vamps. Are we heading into a world where the poor guardians can go extinct because yet another race ends up having more value with them?...and Hopper. WTF is this thing? It's alive. Oh wait, it's not. Oh wait, it is. What is the point of Hopper? We didn't have cutesy gimmick creatures before.I'm starting to feel like the further we get into this series, the more the rules change. Adrian's character growth has almost turned him into an unrecognizable character, and I can't decide how much of this is for the better. At least he didn't forget to call Rose \"little dhampir.\" Score a point there. The second half of the book finally brought it all back though. Even a weaker Richelle Mead book still ends up being better than 90% of the stuff I read, so I have to give credit where it's due. When I decided to come back and try again, I ended up loving the rest of the story.What Jill did after the fight scene : I was mentally cheering her on. Sydney and Adrian : Not as exciting as I'd been hoping for. They're sweet, but this spin-off series just doesn't have the heart-pounding and epic romance of the prior series.Dimitri : I laughed at Adrian joking about him not being able to hold his liquor, and him having a WTF? reaction.Eddie : Is it too much to ask for more Eddie time? He's one of the actual characters who came over from VA, yet he is still background fodder. I know that Mead probably doesn't want to write Dimitri part deux, but when she teases me with phrases like Eddie was magnificent. I'd nearly forgotten that the adopted brother I joked and ate lunch with was a lethal warrior. or He was one of the most badass, capable guardians out there, but he couldn't believe that about himself, not when he kept seeing those failures laid at his feet. DOESN'T THAT SCREAM for more character time? We have another brooding person who wants to save the world and he's delegated to being the designated driver. It's wrong, I tell you.Anyway, even though the book slipped off a little, the strong and exciting second half somewhat made up for a weaker first half."}, {"userName": "Komal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11279144-komal", "userReview": "[Why couldn't she simply say what the Alchemists wanted to hear?

I guess I'm still in denial. We all had a suspicion that this would happen to Sydney eventually but it wasn't until Adrian lost his phone - and later when Sydney received messages - that it really hit me. I finished it on the bus so if anyone saw me I was probably pulling very alarming facial expressions, while internally (hopefully it was internally) screaming NO, NO, NO. Like when she gave Hopper to Eddie and make up that thing about the spell, and said the Latin thing to Adrian. This book has just reduced to be fangirl-ish mess. It was bad enough that Sydney did get taken but Adrian's reaction just killed me. We all know that in the next book, he's going to go to hell and back to find her and it's not going to be good. Hate is a strong word but I might just have to apply it to Jared, Zoe and the other Alchemists at the moment. It's bad enough that they wanted to turn Zoe against her mum and that Zoe was generally just really annoying. Jared makes Nathan Ivashkov look like a lovely father in comparison. I just really hope Sydney can hold on and keep fighting. I hope her magic protects her. I don't think I'll be able to handle it if she ends up like Keith.It wasn't just Adrian's reaction that killed me, but the others too, especially Jacqueline and Eddie's. The latter is obviously beating himself up about it and I never realised before just how much Jacqueline cared for Sydney. It was all very emotional. Then in the last chapter, we see how awful re-education is. The next book is going to be painful. Very, very painful.On a more positive note, THEY HAD SEX. SEVERAL TIMES. The trailers did make it seem pretty obvious that it would happen but I was still surprised. They could barely keep their hands off each other. The thought of Sydney reading books about it just cracks me up. I was also SO happy that Jill and Eddie finally kissed too. They're both lovely and I really hope Eddie realises he is good enough for her. I've grown really attached to those two but I'm sure there will be plenty more angst to come. Relationships in Richelle's books are never that straight-forward.The thing about this book is it's all happy and lovely and full of Sydrian feels and then THAT happens at the end. It's like Richelle literally just punched me in the face. Not many endings get this kind of reaction from me so I have to commend her for it. Surely all will be sunshine and rainbows in the end. Right?!The Fiery Heart really is the Shadow Kiss of this series.

Seriously if you haven't read any of her books, get on with that because everything from the writing to the amazing characters is incredible! Her plots and style are fantastic! And this book did not disappoint!  (well, actually it did....but we'll get to that later.)I know I've said this in most, if not all, of my Bloodlines reviews. If I haven't convinced you yet, I don't know what will.Let me tell you something: the minute an author introduces a second perspective in the middle of a series, you know something is going to happen, something to the main character that will render them unable to narrate the complete story.So the main plot of this story is the \"figuring out how to break the alchemist tattoo\" thing because it was established in the last book that they have compulsion properties. In other words, the Alchemists keep their people on track by brainwashing them in small amounts. It was very interesting, and of course Sydney would figure out how to do it with only sodium chloride instead of some fancy rock only found in Mexico!Oh wait...you wanna know what else happened in the last book? Zoe showed up! That's right! Sydney junior.Can we please dispose of Sydney Junior?Zoe is like a b-word begging for treats! HATE her. And then there's the crap excuse that she loves her sister and wants to see her healed blah blah....You know what? I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt (I know, I'm being really generous here). I don't think Zoe would be this against her mother in the divorce issue. I'm willing to bet that their ass of a father used the power of the tattoo to brainwash Zoe. She probably would have picked her dad in this case anyways, but I don't think she would be so opposed to her mother.And don't even get me started on her dad! UUUUGGGH! He's kind of like Adrian's dad....only worse.I hate him from the bottom of my heart, even more than the alchemists because he doesn't care squat about his daughters, I don't care WHAT he says. Everything he does is in his and the alchemists' best interests. I get that loyalty is important, but where is the loyalty to his family!?If anyone has a corrupted soul, it's him and the rest of that deranged bunch.The love phone! Of course that's how Zoe found out! Sydney, you've become too soft! Forgetting things left and right, I mean, COME ON! I think what annoyed me the most between Sydney and Adrian was that after the did it once, it was sex 24/7....well not exactly, but whenever they got the chance. I miss the words and the feelings! And since this is a YA book, the sex scenes are just brushed upon. So instead of a nice meaningful conversation about love and feelings or whatever, it was scene fading out. So it was kind of less Sydrian time. It was more implications than an actual relationship. But I am very very happy that they got to that step in their relationship.So remember how I said this book did disappoint? Well it's time we discussed the ending.Sydney gets taken....by the Alchemists.....screw them. I hate them. From the bottom of my fiery heart! And also Zoe and Sydney's dad. I may have already mentioned that.I HATE THEM ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL!Sydney has to be \"reeducated\", which is just a nice term for \"We're gonna screw you over and turn you into a zombie for disobeying us\".Why is Eddie still depriving himself of Jill?? Dude she kissed you! Of her own free will! Stop being like \"I don't deserve her\" and moping around! Get over yoself!I love Adrian's sudden maturity!

First book where we follow two character perspectives instead of one, yeeeeees! And which two characters you might ask? Sydney and Adrian!!! ALL THE HEARTS <3 I've been wanting this without even knowing i did, it added a little something extra and seriously i've been wanting to get inside Adrians head since the VA series. Another knock out novel by Richelle Mead!Sydney is walking a dangerous path, not only by dating Moroi vampire Adrian Ivashkov but by initiating into a coven of human witches and meddling with magic herself, something that would be unforgivable to the Alchemist group she was raised in, who have strict views on what is unholy and unnatural. Sydney is trying to remake a magical ink that will break Alchemists free from the tattoos they are initiated with, causing the compulsion within the tattoo to break down and leave the wearer with their own free will, and free from the Alchemists reign. If things aren't complicated enough, Sydney's younger sister, Zoe Sage has been recruited to help them with their mission in protecting the Moroi princess in Palm Springs, where she is being hidden away from those who wish to bring down the queen by killing her only living relative- a law that will hopefully soon be changing thanks to said Queen, Lissa Dragomir . As much as Sydney wants to mend the relationship with her sister, her parents upcoming divorce and custody battle, and her need to lie to protect her secrets from her ambitiously childish younger sister, and fellow Alchemists, proves to be difficult. How much can Sydney get away with before someone becomes suspicious of her involvement with a vampire and her magic use? How far will her sister go to find out the truth about why Sydney is hardly ever around? Who will be the one to bring Sydney's world crumbling down? In the fourth book of the Bloodline series, things are about to go from 'taking caution', to 'extreme danger' really fast. Past secrets will be revealed, parents up against one another, changes made for better and for worse, and freedom on in the line. \u201cIf you wanted to remold people, you had to break them down first.\u201dOkay the Adrian/Sydney perspectives blew me away! It was amazing seeing inside Adrians head- seeing him struggle with spirit, his love for Sydney and just him as a whole. This is a character i've loved since the VA series and still do to this day so its nice to see more of him but not through someone else. Sydney's part isn't anything new, but seeing her love for Adrian grow, how they are together (in both perspectives), and how much she cares for him and his well being is so cute. I hated Rose for hurting him, but honestly Sydney and Adrian are meant to be so if Rose helped open that door by not being able to love him(even though she handled the situation kinda shitty), then go Rose. SYDRIAN<3  \u201cAn image of Sydney's face appeared in my mind's eye, calm and lovely.I believe in you.My anxiety faded.I took a deep breath and met the gazes of all those watching me in the room.Who was I to do this?I was Adrian Ivashkov.And I was about to kick some ass.\u201d Can i just say that i hate Zoe Sage and have from the first book when she had a go at Sydney for trying to keep her out of the Alchemist world, and then not talking to her for months. This girl is childishly ambitious, a full blown daddy's girl and such a pain in the ass. I guess she makes a good Alchemist, although we know by now being a true Alchemist and believing all the prejudice and beliefs means they are more like a brain washed robot following orders by those who lie and control them. Even when she starts thinking the vampires aren't so bad, she goes back to being a brain washed idiot. She is pretty much her dad all over, someone who i've also hate for being a dick right from the start. She seems like a spoilt brat, i seriously cannot stand her. She is the total opposite to Sydney, in every single way, like how are these two even related.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you have us pick upsomething?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s not my job!\u201d Zoe lifted her head up high. \u201cWe\u2019re here to keep Jill\u2019s cover and make sure she stays off the radar. It\u2019s not my job to feed you guys.\u201d\u201cIn which sense?\u201d I asked. I knew perfectly well that was a mean thing to say to her but couldn\u2019t resist. It took her a moment to pick up the double meaning. First she paled; then she turned an angry red.\u201cNeither! I\u2019m not your concierge. Neither is Sydney. I don\u2019t know why she always takes care of that stuff for you. She should only be dealing with things that are essential for your survival. Ordering pizza isn\u2019t one of them.\u201dI faked a yawn and leaned back into the couch. \u201cMaybe she figures if we\u2019re well fed, you two won\u2019t look that appetizing.\u201dThere isn't much more i really want to say, but if you have read the VA series, you will love these novels. The characters feel so real, i mean yes we went through 6 VA novels, and now 6 Bloodlines novels, like come on 12 books in this world, with these characters and it doesn't feel like enough!.. even know im still not done with this series, im sad i only have 2 more books to go!\u201cWhether it's simply some fierce animal joining of mates or a sublime merging of souls, she is mine, and I am hers.\u201d Recommended for: Fantasy/YA/Paranormal/Vampires"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820960-jess", "userReview": "Well Richelle Mead has done it again.

Not a single bit. I always manage to get hooked on Richelle's books from the first page, and this book was no different. It felt so awesome to be back with the gang again, even some of the old ones made an appearance, to my absolutely delight. The Fiery Heart was fantastic read from the start to the very end. This book was I thought very much a filler and build up the what I am sure will be a huge excitement filled 5th round in Silver Shadows which publishes next summer. There wasn't a lot of action, but that was ok, because is carried on some of the stories we were left with in Indigo Spell last year, it was most definitely a book made to answer questions raised (kind of), and most definitely setting up for what I can be sure will be an explosions in the next.For a filler book it was beautifully paced, full of witty banter, love, sex (yes sex). It had all the elements you come to expect in a Richelle Mead book, and I simply loved it and I was most definitely irresistibly hooked all the way through. We get a lot of Adrian, we get a lot of Sydney, we get a lot of Adrian and Sydney. Together. Told in alternate points of view from Adrian and Sydney, we are really thrown into their relationship and how they attempt to keep it under wraps so that neither get into trouble. I loved being in Adrians head, from the moment we meet him Vampire Academy:Frostbite, I've wanted his point of view, and we get it in Fiery Heart and it didn't disappoint. Just to touch on the ending of the book (because this has been bit of a gushy review), the ending is, well, I guess expected to say the least, although you could sort of call it a 'semi-cliffhanger' but really, compared to most Richelle Mead cliffys, this one really isn't that bad at all. Sure it's gonna want to make you want Silver Shadows, but it won't make you rip your hair out, cry or throw your book/kindle at the wall, and that's always a plus for me :). So not much of a cliffy, but sort of a semi one, but an expected ending none the less.Overall, fabulous new installment to the Bloodlines series. If you haven't already picked up this series, then you probably should do that. GO!"}], "description": "Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the wolds of humans and vampires. They protect vampire secrets - and human lives. In The Indigo Spell, Sydney was torn between the Alchemist way of life and what her heart and gut were telling her to do. And in one breathtaking moment that Richelle Mead fans will never forget, she made a decision that shocked even her... But the struggle isn't over for Sydney. As she navigates the aftermath of her life-changing decision, she still finds herself pulled in too many directions at once. Her sister Zoe has arrived, and while Sydney longs to grow closer to her, there's still so much she must keep secret. Working with Marcus has changed the way she views the Alchemists, and Sydney must tread a careful path as she harnesses her profound magical ability to undermine the way of life she was raised to defend. Consumed by passion and vengeance, Sydney struggles to keep her secret life under wraps as the threat of exposure \u2014 and re-education \u2014 looms larger than ever. Pulses will race throughout this smoldering fourth installment in the New York Times bestselling Bloodlines series, where no secret is safe.", "title": "The Fiery Heart\n      \n          (Bloodlines #4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833184-the-fiery-heart", "average": 4.38, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383243238l/9833184.jpg", "reviews": 5066, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/137902.Richelle_Mead", "name": "Richelle Mead"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833184-the-fiery-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18860795-the-fiery-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18080377-the-fiery-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2802316-shadow-kiss", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2282133.Frostbite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5996153-blood-promise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6479259-spirit-bound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
