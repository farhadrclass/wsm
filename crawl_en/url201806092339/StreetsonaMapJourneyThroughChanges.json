Dale Harcombe\u2019s novel, Streets on a Map, follows the ever changing lives of the residents of Astley, a small country town in NSW Australia.Small town gossip, unemployment, drought, relationship issues, PTSD and crime, Harcombe explores many of the emotive issues that we encounter in life and relates how our actions have consequences for ourselves and those around us.I loved how the characters evolved and grew, first Laila giving Abby confidence and unquestionable friendship and then Abby later doing the same for Zoe.The characters are so diverse it\u2019s hard not to see a little of our own lives in some of them and at times nod, thinking, yes that\u2019s exactly how I feel.Just as Abby grew to love the town of Astley, so did I."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "Streets on a Map: Journey Through Changes was exactly that, a story told of a small country town, by Australian author and poet Dale Harcombe, where various stories of this community\u2019s residents intersect and interweave, offering glimpses of the best and the worst of human nature. This novel isn\u2019t meant to be a blockbuster. It ambles slowly through a group of people\u2019s lives in this little town. Along the way it reflects the things that I imagine that the author loves \u2013 people, nature, colour, poetry, animals - and the way the people of this town (more often than not newcomers) 'keep on keeping on' through the many turns in the road. I loved some characters (Laila and Zoe were my favourite) and I disliked some. I found Abby to be surprisingly negative, but I have a feeling Laila hadn\u2019t finished weaving her magic here, with Abby.Often I found myself smiling along the way when I came across a lot of the phrases used \u2013 simply because I hadn\u2019t thought of them for a long time. Blasted nuisance, mite, blooming, stubborn as a farmyard bull! I thought the writing suited this type of storytelling, which I found to be particularly salt of the earth. Our matriarch Laila reminded me of someone? I\u2019m wondering if others who've read this have the same train of thought as me?!With sincere thanks to the author for my copy."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne", "userReview": "\u201cYou don\u2019t stop caring for someone just because they make a mistake. We all make mistakes. The difference is whether we learn from them\u201d Streets on a Map: Journey Through Changes is a novel by Australian author and poet, Dale Harcombe. Abby Donovan never dreamed she would find it so hard to fit into her husband, Joel\u2019s hometown. But Astley, in central west NSW, several hours travel from her beloved Sydney, seems to be a close-knit community with no space for her in the weave. Luckily, not everyone is wary of newcomers: Laila Harris holds out a metaphorical hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. All you have to do is accept it. There are things in this world that can\u2019t be bought \u2026\u2026friendship is one of them\u201dOver the following years, Abby finds herself slowly becoming part of the community, and she learns just what living in a small town can mean: \u201c\u2026appreciated concern or\u2026.an intrusion? \u2026.it was both one of the privileges and the pitfalls of a small community. Here, where lives intertwined like streets on a map, such things were more noticeable\u201d. Abby grows and matures, delighting when things go well and learning to cope when they don\u2019t. She realises \u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. It\u2019s easy to use circumstances as an excuse for what happens to us\u201dIn the tradition of Anne Tyler and Maeve Binchy, Harcombe takes a cast of ordinary characters and subjects them to everyday happenings. Along the way, she throws them some challenges and gives them words of wisdom to share: \u201c\u2026in some way, we are changed by the people we associate with. And their perceptions of you are coloured by their own personalities and experiences. You appear to them the way they expect you to behave. Between them they bring out the different aspects of your personality\u201d, Laila tells Abby. Harcombe expertly renders the feel of a typical central west town, the different attitudes of community members, unwavering ostracism side by side with incredible generosity. Her characters are familiar and appealing, none wholly good or bad, all flawed to a greater or lesser degree. Their dialogue is exactly what is heard on the streets and in the shops of every country town. Harcombe gives the reader some humour, some heartache, even some excitement (someone gets stabbed!), but above all, an entertaining and enjoyable read.With thanks to the author for my copy."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "When recently married couple Abby and Joel Donovan moved from Sydney to the small country town of Astley, where Joel had lived and grown up with his family, Abby wasn\u2019t sure how she would cope with the quiet country life. She was used to the hustle and bustle of city life, and as a singer had found herself with much to do, rushing to and from rehearsals and shows which gave her a constant buzz. After eight weeks, which seemed like a lifetime to Abby, she was filled with remorse for leaving her life in Sydney. She loved Joel, but with him out every day at his job and her in his old family home day in and day out with nothing to occupy her mind, she thought she\u2019d go crazy! Making friends with the only person in town who wasn\u2019t suspicious of the newcomer, she found Laila a special person, the mother she missed desperately after losing her own two years previously. When the idea of opening a restaurant in town took hold in Abby\u2019s mind, somewhere she could sing again, it was Laila who encouraged her, and together they made the \u201cLincoln Lodge\u201d a reality.An unplanned pregnancy just when the restaurant was proving to be extremely popular created problems, and secrets in Laila\u2019s past threatened to upend her calm demeanour. With dramas on both Abby and Joel\u2019s sides of the family, new people in town and the gossips having a field day, nothing was boring in Astley for long. I really enjoyed this book; with the small town \u201ctelegraph\u201d meaning everyone knew what the other person was doing almost before they did\u2026and that definitely happens in country towns in Australia! The care of the townsfolk when one of their own suffered, with them all pooling together to help was great, and real; there were triumphs and downfalls, sadness and happiness \u2013 all emotions every-day, down-to-earth people feel. Some great little twists throughout had me engrossed in this book until the last page! I have no hesitation in recommending this novel.With thanks to the author for my copy."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2825213-kathryn", "userReview": "This was definitely a good read - 3.5 stars, if GR allowed. A sweet story about the ups and downs of the journey through life in a community. I liked the exploration of the various themes - of resolving conflicts, of the flow-on effects of our actions on others, of the inter-connectedness and community of country towns, of forgiveness, to name a few. Although I'm certainly no expert regarding crafting a story, at times, I felt the pacing of the story to be slightly wrong - some happenings felt rushed and could have been fleshed out a bit more, others seemed to drag a little. Also, at times, some characters seemed to contradict something they'd already said, or say things that another character had already said. There was a lot happening in this story, which certainly made it interesting, but I was sorry not to find out more about some of the happenings - I'd like to have found out more about the Reubens and the Johnson's who seemed to leave the story abruptly quite early and more of Shannon's background a bit earlier in the story (we find out more about her family about 2/3 of the way through, but she has only felt like a minor character until then). But those aspects are probably me being picky, and overall, it was an interesting story and a thoroughly enjoyable read!I look forward to reading more of Dale's adult novels (no pressure, Dale!) in the future."}, {"userName": "Paula Vince", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10911644-paula-vince", "userReview": "Abby, a successful singer in metropolitan Sydney, marries Joel and moves to Astley, the country town he was raised in. Feeling shunned by the locals and at a loss for things to do, she must get creative. Before long, Abby discovers that life in the small town holds more in store than she ever anticipated.Astley turns out to be a paradigm of the wider world. Normal people lead lives of quiet heroism. Every day is full of noble gestures that may go unnoticed in the grand scheme of events, yet have the power and potential to change the lives of others. A deliberately lit fire, a baby's early delivery, a brand new business, the return of an estranged sister and a cold-blooded attack are just some of the issues dealt with in the story.As the characters are all honest, regular, down-to-earth people, it's no stretch of the imagination for readers to see that we too, may be a source of huge blessings. It is a story of how small ripples may have more far-reaching effects in our sphere of influence than we may imagine. Beautiful reflections about relationships and the Australian lifestyle make \"Streets on a Map\" the sort of book that helps us to realize the value of what we have.

It is one of several great reviews of it. Others are on my website.This review is 5 star as are some others and some are four and four and a half. I'll leave it to those who read it to decide. *****page-turner to the end! By L.Swann, Do you want to read a book that will keep you so enthralled you just have to keep turning the pages? Then Streets on a Map is exactly that book. The story line is alive with excitement, surprises, disasters and emotion. The histories, habits and complexities of the characters are carefully weaved into the story providing a beautiful balance between a plot that will keep you guessing and characters which deepen, becoming old friends the more you get to know them. The story stayed in my mind long after I would put the book down, and often I would find myself wondering about the characters; their habits, their motives, what they would do next. This always made me eager to find the next time I could sit down and continue the story. I thoroughly recommend this book as a refreshing, enjoyable and page-turning read.

Suddenly she\u2019s living in a small country town, her singing career possibly over, and with nothing to occupy her days. However, friendship with an older woman, Laila, brings a new direction. As new changes are encountered she learns the power in forgiveness, the grace of second chances and the joy found in the simple things of life. An enjoyable story about relationships and community, with a gentle background of faith lived out with honesty and vulnerability. WN(2)Every choice, trivial or momentous, has a consequence. Every decision at a fork in the road means one path remains untrod. The other route can become so familiar it seems to form a backdrop to life rather than the pathway through it. As Heraclitus once said: You cannot step twice into the same stream.Abby has moved with her husband to a small country town where he grew up. Restless and isolated, she is inspired to consider opening a restaurant where she can sing and entertain. In surmounting the obstacles between thought and reality, Abby makes new friends. DS(3)This is a satisfying book that I would recommend to others. It has nice peaks and conclusions.I love how the transition from city to country is treated. Country life and community is also portrayed very well. It comes across as very real and very Australian.I would have loved to see Laila\u2019s relationship with God explored more, not a nebulous force but a vibrant reality. More deliberate conclusions would help, for example, \u201cI did this because I love God\u201d. Perhaps this is a personal edge and not what the author intended.Bookseller\u2019s Choice \u2013 reviewer CALEB Prize(4)I really enjoyed the setting and storyline in this book. I love the development of the characters and their growth. The one disappointment was that the main character was still a non-Christian at the end of the book. If she had even had a moment where she wanted to know more about God, this would have worked for me. I know it doesn\u2019t always happen in real life, but as I was expecting it, I was disappointed when it didn\u2019t happen.

In this book we see a city girl who has moved to the country and a small country town at that. Astley is a small country town where everyone know everyone and any new comers are notice. Abby has made friends with Laila and they end up working on a plan together. Add some new other newcomers including Shannon and the Zoe. Laila's sister also comes back to the town and this will affect Laila. The story was interesting getting to know the different characters and and the different storylines. We also learn about forgiveness when something happens which many think is unforgivable. We also see how 2 people can live in the one house but there memories of events are so different. The other issue we see is how we can see ourselves one way and then we meet someone and suddenly we see things in a new way and learn new things about ourselves. This happened at times in this book.This is a christian book and there are Christian values in the book albeit subtle, but I was a little disappointed that the main characters were still not christians at the end of the book or had an encounter where they realise they need God in there lives."}, {"userName": "Susan Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17111557-susan-barnes", "userReview": "Streets on a Map by Dale Harcombe is an interesting story of a young woman, Abby who moves with her husband, Joel to the country town where Joel has grown up. Abby is a city girl who has to adjust to a new life style in an unfamiliar setting. The book raises a number of issues associated with forming relationships, moving on from dysfunctional families, forgiveness and building trust. Some good Judeo-Christian ethics are subtly woven into the story. I liked the way this was handled as it didn\u2019t feel contrived. However, there were a couple of things that didn\u2019t work well for me. I never warmed to Joel, perhaps because the first time we are introduced to him, he is arguing with Abby. He comes across as insensitive, and since they had no history of Christian standards, there were times when I wondered why Abby didn\u2019t pack her bags and return to Sydney. I also wondered what line of work Joel did. Another issue I had was getting a mental picture of Astley. I have lived in small country towns and I couldn\u2019t get a feel for how big it was. The level of gossip and rumours that circulated suggested a very small town yet it seemed to have a number of services like a hospital suggesting it wasn\u2019t that small. However these issues weren\u2019t significant enough to distract from a good story and others may not even notice them. Overall an enjoyable read.

Tighter editing would improve, especially of over zealous punctuation. A story of country town interactions with a host of characters who are mostly likeable. The title is arresting but I'm not sure of its relevance."}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "Abby and Joel Donovan have recently moved to Joel\u2019s home town of Astley, near Bathurst. They are renovating Joel\u2019s childhood home, and Abby is having trouble fitting in to the close-knit community, especially as the move has meant she has had to give up her career as a singer. She feels alone, as the only friend she\u2019s made is Laila, an older woman. Laila is probably the best character in the book\u2014a spunky older woman who has made it through many life trials with her sense of humour and faith intact.This is supposed to be a book review, not a critique. Unfortunately, it\u2019s more like a critique because I found the story difficult to get in to, easy to put down, and marred by distracting writing and punctuation. The story is written in the third person, mostly from Abby\u2019s point of view. The viewpoint is consistent in that there is no head-hopping, but it would have been better to have scenes from the viewpoints of more than one character (we do eventually get some scenes from Laila\u2019s viewpoint, but not until almost halfway through the book. Unfortunately, we then get the viewpoints of several minor characters, including some head-hopping). Joel and Abby have been married less than a year but I only saw the immaturity of their relationship and their struggles, not the reason they fell in love and married in the first place. I also felt that I was being shown what happened\u2014she did this, he said that\u2014rather than getting an insight into the reactions of the characters, the choices they made, and why they made those choices. I found Abby difficult to relate to and never got to know Joel well enough to decide whether or not I liked him (I\u2019m leaning towards not). There were several flashbacks in the story, which had a negative effect on the pacing. It\u2019s one thing to have an occasional flashback to a point in time before the story began in order to show us something about a character that is relevant to their current situation\u2014if it\u2019s actually relevant (which was debatable). What were more annoying were the flashbacks to incidents within the timeline of Streets on a Map, which just made it feel as though the story was being told out of sequence. My other major complaint was that there was very little Christian content, despite the book originally being published by a Christian publishing house and now being offered as part of a blog tour for Christian novels. Laila was a strong Christian, and I kept waiting for something to happen that would draw Abby towards God. I\u2019m still waiting. I can only assume the theme of the novel was the uselessness of life without God, because what came through was a series of experiences with very little in the way of character reaction or personal growth. There was the potential for a good story here, but it didn\u2019t eventuate.

In the beginning of the book, we are told about a young man being suspected of committing a crime which eventually leads to his family leaving town. However, there is no follow-up of whether he was even convicted of the crime or any resolution whatsoever about what caused a fire resulting in a young girl's death.Then later in the book, the sister of the main character, Abby, appears to undergo a complete transformation in her personality and goals after going through a very stressful life event. However, then she abruptly leaves the story and and the reader is left completely hanging about whatever happened to her later. This sister had had an important role in Abby's life!

I enjoyed visiting Australia and liked the idea of getting a feel for small-town life there. But I have to confess - sorry Dale - that it didn't engage me the way I hoped it would. I think that's because it didn't have the kind of strong plot with a central dilemma where I had to keep reading to know what would happen. I guess I prefer detective fiction (like Reginald Hill's Child's Play), or stories which build to a bog climax (such as Sheila O'Flanagan's Things We Never Say), both of which I read at the same time as this, and which had me quickly turning pages. When things happen in Streets on a Map, it felt like waves lapping gently on a shore rather than a surge building through the novel. There is a more dramatic event towards the end, but there was no sense of the novel building up to it. So don't let me put you off if you enjoy a gentle kind of book, as the reviewers who've given it 4 or 5 stars have done. I'm just saying it didn't suit me as a reader."}], "description": "Every choice carries a price as Abby discovers when she marries Joel.
