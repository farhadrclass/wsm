Browsing the bookshelves one day, I found an old copy of one of Rod McKuens books. He writes things so simply yet paints a heartwrenching picture. Some of his writing is laid down like a journal.... describing a trip hes taken, the women hes been with, things hes seen and thought.He writes in a way that i can relate to.If you havent read anything by him yet, I suggest you do. You are missing out on some beautiful writing!"}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5556783-meghan", "userReview": "I was not as impressed with this book as I was with With Love. The poems didn't speak to me as much. Regardless of that, they are still beautifully written and mostly enchanting."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31795306-tristan", "userReview": "I was singularly unimpressed by this book. I thought the poetry was dull and unpoetic and the content was rather pointless. The first section was the best, as it tells of him and six of his friends from young-adulthood and how their lives turned out, but even that I thought fell flat due to the weak poetry of this book. I will not be reading any more of Mr. McKuen's work."}, {"userName": "Cassy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7423941-cassy", "userReview": "All of his books spoke to me, but the one that spoke the most was this. After all, if you do not understand my silence, you will not understand my words."}], "description": "This was Rod McKuen's newest book of poetry in 1974. As in much of his earlier work, the poems are gentle, beautiful, alternatelylonely and happy, but these are poems unlike any the author has written before. They speak directly to man's uniquelyu human condition -- his wants, his solitude, and, most of all, his desire to be understood. But most importantly, these poems represent a new and different kind of McKuen writing -- more mature, more compassionate and more deeply in touch with both public and private feelings.", "title": "Come To Me In Silence", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374943.Come_To_Me_In_Silence", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1295912909l/1374943.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/159826.Rod_McKuen", "name": "Rod McKuen"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374943.Come_To_Me_In_Silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/482214.Listen_to_the_Warm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/482215.Stanyan_Street_Other_Sorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687460.Lonesome_Cities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374958.In_Someone_s_Shadow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/482213.Caught_in_the_Quiet"]}
