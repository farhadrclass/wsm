Monster Island is so fantastic, I've used it as an infection vector (har) to get several of my friends who aren't into zombies to give the genre a try.The sequel, [Book: Monster Nation], wasn't nearly as good, but was still an enjoyable romp that struck the right notes for me.Now, there's Monster Planet, a book that, though it shares title and some characters in common with its predecessors bears little resemblance to them in tone, story, and enjoyment. I couldn't even finish it, giving up about halfway through because it just drove me crazy.David Wellington is a fine author, and I adore his other work, but Monster Planet just isn't at the same level as his other novels. It very much feels like a publisher wanted a trilogy, he agreed to give them a trilogy, and then realized that there really wasn't a third book in the arc. Or maybe he decided to challenge himself and do something completely different from the first two (which would have been a bad idea. Imagine [Book: Return of the King] with spaceships instead of Nazgul.) Whatever the reason, the result is a lot of crazy supernatural stuff that is so convoluted it strains suspension of disbelief (yes, even in a novel that's about the living dead), and was a major disappointment to me, especially considering how much I loved the first two books in the series.Skip this, and if you really want to read more zombie stories, give World War Z a try instead."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7063413-anna", "userReview": "zombie horror?

A trilogy that became more and more supernatural as it went on and in this book we are treated to a story that steps away from the traditional zombie tale far more than the previous efforts. Monster Island and Monster Nation could only hint at the extent that magic would end up playing in this culmination of this saga. The story takes place twelve years after the zombie plague began and most humans have been wiped out. We are reintroduced to some familiar characters and several new ones. Where the the first two stories were devoted to single liches (zombies who remain intelligent and have special powers) plus an ancient druid and mummies, in this story it starts to become clear that Nilla and Gary were not alone in their state of undead power. The Tsarevich is the most powerful lich of all, able to control massive armies of the undead. He not only controls them but has created other liches as well, Generals in his new army. He too, like the Gary and Nilla, has a love/hate relationship with Mael Mag Och, the ancient druidic ghost whose has been called upon by his ancient god to destroy the world. He has his own agenda and much like the other two that have come before he has a strong tendency to frustrate Mael to no end. David Wellington has crafted a very involved and detailed mythology in this trilogy. His characters in this book, particularly Sarah and Ayaan, are rich and vibrant and are brought to life with a story that is complex and full of unique takes on the zombie genre. Certainly, if you are reading this book I will have to presume that you have read his two previous novels and enjoyed them enough to complete the trilogy. If that is the case then you are probably someone who can step away from the traditional Romero works, even if you (like me) love those stories just as much. David has added several new layers on top of the standard stuff here, which allows the story to take off in totally new directions. If I am to find fault in this book, it is the same fault I have found in the other two novels of the trilogy--some of the elements the author is asking me as the reader to suspend disbelief over are a little bit hard to swallow. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say, this realm is rather fantastical. I would dare say that the Monster series, especially this book, weaves a narrow path between horror and fantasy storytelling. Some elements do work and make good sense (such as human cultists who worship the liches and look forward to death so they can better serve them) while others are pretty over the top (some of the varied lich abilities are a pretty big stretch). I guess the key thing to recognize is that despite the tagline on each book being \"A zombie novel\" the title of each includes the word 'monster'. The monsters in these novels are a bit more diverse than just zombies, as characters such as Erasmus, The Least, and Amanita clearly point out. Magic permeats everything and not only the dead have it, but the living as well. Overall, I have to give the series the same amount of stars that I gave this book. I liked each one of the books primarily because David Wellington knows how to create interesting and compelling characters that are vivid and fun to read about but at the same time he takes risks, stretching the stories in ways that sometimes works and other times does not, at least for me. I will have to admit that he does pull it all together nicely in the end though, as fantastically wild as this saga became in this third and final act."}, {"userName": "Brendan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/344179-brendan", "userReview": "In some ways, Monster Planet takes the most ambitious bite of Wellington's three novels. It also veers furthest from the classic zombie archetypes that we saw at the beginning of the series. In this world, some 12 years after the outbreak began, there are a number of zombies who have kept their higher brain functions (usually through mechanical means like a crash cart) after crossing over, and these lichs usually have magical powers, such as the ability to control the other zombies, physical deformities, or even weirder stuff. As such, the process of becoming a zombie becomes a bit like being an X-Man.We follow Sarah, the daughter of DeKalb (from Monster Island), and Ayaan, the soldier from the first novel, as they pursue the evil Tsarovich on his dastardly quest (whatever that is). Bits from the other novels weave together nicely as Wellington lets the threads of his fantastic horrorscape play out to the end. Because of the complicated mythos of this magical world, though, the horror of zombies qua zombies vanishes completely. While the first book might more aptly be called Zombie Island, this book definitely focuses on Monsters.A few additional thoughts: * Once again, Wellington develops a couple solid storylines nicely, with good reveals and cliffhangers that drive the book forward. * More than some other books, I found it harder to remember the little threads of narrative that returned from the earlier books. Wellington provides fewer clues to remind the reader about what happened previously. Reviewing plot synopses of the previous books would be a wise move for readers who've gone months between books. * The cover has little or nothing to do with the book. Sigh. * Ayaan becomes an interesting character in the novel, as her allegiance slides back and forth from one pole to the other. The notion of a benevolent dictator gets some good traction here as a thought experiment. * Never has mold seemed scary in the way this book makes it seem. Mold and crab legs."}, {"userName": "Imogen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33887-imogen", "userReview": "The problem is that the apocalypse doesn't happen. I think they destroy the thing that makes the zombies be zombies, and then humans are left to pickup the goddam pieces, but I'm like... well, obviously. I just would've liked to see everybody die. Also, the logic of the grand large-scale plans these immortanlish folks have been laying for millenia tend to have pretty simple, stupid loopholes. Also I don't care about all the obsessive military weapon fetishism. And I don't remember much of what happened in MONSTAR ISLAND, so that was kind of too bad for understanding what was going on. Still, who cares? It is a novel about zombies and it was full of zombies and there was hella gore and violence and telekinetic bullshit and a lady who walked around killing people by filling their lungs with mold just by being near them.

This book is the finale to David Wellington\u2019s zombie trilogy, and being a fan, and having read his vampire series, he has yet to disappoint. I wondered over to Amazon to get the info for this book, and noticed that the reviews were all over the board. I will admit it \u2013 this isn\u2019t your traditional zombie series. There are some readers that hardcore when it comes to monsters, and don\u2019t care to deviate from the hardened fast rules of what each monster is supposed to be. If you like your zombies slow, stumbling, and mindless, then this story might not be for you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are plenty of your standard zombies in this series, but the author adds so much more to the walking dead that it makes it that much more terrifying for the living and the dead. \u201cWhat can be so terrifying for the dead besides a bullet to the head?\u201d you ask. How about the dead that can think? Zombies that are so smart, that they possess a dark magic that can bring the end of the world as we know it. The writer refers to them as \u2018lich\u2019, and they battle centuries-old ghosts that inhabit zombie bodies, and mummies that have reanimated without the slightest yearning for human flesh. In the first book we found one of these lich following orders of a ghost to destroy mankind. It is set six weeks after the zombie epidemic where ten percent of the population is the undead. The lich, Gary, rebels with his own intentions in mind \u2013 farming humans.The second book takes us back the beginning of the outbreak. Nilla finds herself dead, without any previous memories of herself. She follows her inner direction to head west but ends up finding the source of the infection.Monster Planet, the finale, brings back all the key players to finish the story. A war is being waged between the living and the dead, between those who want to rebuild the world, and those who want to end it all, and don\u2019t assume that you know which side wants what outcome.\tFrom the book:It was the last, the hope, that made her despair. It looked like the others had been treated to the same act she had \u2013 the kindly guide leading them on a tour of what must look like paradise on earth. To many of these people the idea of a safe place where the dead were kept at bay and where there was a little something to eat had long ago faded from possibility. They had been hiding, hiding for years in fallout shelters or hardened public buildings, eating when and what they could, resorting to whatever it took to stay alive \u2013 Ayaan knew that many of them could tell her what human flesh tasted like. They had been cold and hungry and alone for over a decade. When the Tsarevich\u2019s troops dug them out of their holes it must have felt like inevitable doom descending. What little fight or spark of anger left to them had been shaken out on the long, horrible journey in the cages. Now they were brought to this safe, clean place and told lies about apple trees. Their brains no longer knew how to process bullshit. -David Wellington does a wonderful job of writing in third person. I\u2019ve always been biased to first person POV, but his books seem to suck me in, and I forget about how the story is being told. I was pleasantly shocked to find characters from this vampire series hidden within his zombie trilogy. He brings the two series together to give you a feeling that his world, is all one world. I look forward to sinking my teeth into his werewolf series."}, {"userName": "Imani P", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48491314-imani-p", "userReview": "There was just too much going on. Instead of a strong finish to tie all of this together it was just...a mess. It's been a while since I've read the last book and unfortunately I still can't get over how much it disappointed me compared to the other two books. Honestly, I just felt like there was too much action not enough character development, and of course it's a zombie book with a mummy twist I found pretty cool but then it just got stupid. I found myself trudging through the book and giving it a WTF several times. Do yourself a favor and read the first two books and skip this one it'll ruin your whole perception. [Spoilers Ahead unless you're into that stuff ;)]Let's start with characters, oh my gosh maybe it's just me, but I found Sarah so insufferable! She was suppose to be someone I could relate too and it seemed that way at first. A teenage girl trying to survive and get by under the wings of Ayaan and find her place in the apocalypse but my gosh is she so easy to manipulate. And what really pissed me off was when she saw her dad again and was a total (excuse my French) bitch at him! I mean seriously her dad did everything he could for her in the first book all he ever talked about was how he loved her. Hell the ending was revealed that he was writing everything for her and when she sees him she gets angry at him and lashes out at him and I'm like GIRL you should be grateful you got to see him one more time like honestly. Come on! Ayaan was one of my favorite characters. I loved her badassery and assertion but she wasn't so stoic that she didn't appear human. In this book I still liked her and found her battle scenes were nicely put together. To be honest the ship scenes weren't so bad. BUT, the battle scene on the mountain with the helicopter and a giant bug-like Gary stomping on things just seemed confusing. And then there are these other characters that are introduced that are kind of ridiculous and then killed off to the side that you don't even have enough time to care about them like the werewolf man that went crazy and got killed off. And then there was this scene where they went to this cabin basically and there was like a fucking wizard, after that I really stopped caring. It seems like all the rules of this world were thrown out of the window and any ideas for a coherent plot flew right alongside those rules. Also there were like four likeable characters in this one. This book just didn't cut it for me, it may have for someone else and I'm glad you got to enjoy it, but I felt like I just wasted my time."}, {"userName": "goldslippersandpinkheels", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7543592-goldslippersandpinkheels", "userReview": "I was glad to have an ending to this series.

I really liked Monster Island but by the time I got to the end Monster Planet it felt like that the story was just trying to do too much. I was OK with most elements of the story but the psychic connections surrounding some of the undead and living just felt a bit...I don't know...forced?

This book takes place 12 years after the last one and we find that Sarah is the main focus of this one.I loved the plot twists. Gary and Dekalb will be very memorable. Nilla was my favorite character overall but I liked most of the women. Many of the support cast were great too, like Mael, Ptolemy, and Jack.The mystery behind why the undead have risen is solved in this book. There are several cool battles and kill scenes, including a nasty fungal lich. If you are into character driven zombie stories than this is a series not to be missed.

The reintroduction to characters thought long gone from the two previous Monster books, (Monster Island and Monster Nation), was terribly exciting. I can honestly say this book didn't end how I thought it would; it ended so much better exceeding all my expectations. I find myself wondering now if he will write another in this series, or if this is truly THE END. While the entire series can be quite gruesome at times, it has a very unique approach to zombies and the undead in general that I find quite refreshing.

If you like this kind of escapist fiction then I really recommend this trilogy, and I should add that any of the books can be read standalone, though obviously reading them all does add some extra context.Monster Planet ties up the trilogy, set twelve years after the events of Monster Island. The exceptional zombies of the previous novels now have a uniting name - liches. Each has special powers and this is the novel that introduces a wide range of them as dangerous antagonists. It also reintroduces some characters from previous novels and manages to end their stories in ways that are both unexpected and satisfying.

I think it was a little soft...no not soft, but there was no epic showdown that the writing kept hinting at. Gary is always a fun character to read about. The mummies are endearing, but annoying to hear them say anything longer than one word. But it's not a love and that makes me sad.

The characters from that book are more prominent in this book."}, {"userName": "Andy Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19488649-andy-phillips", "userReview": "This is the third and (hopefully) final instalment of the 'Monster' series, following on from 'Monster Island' and 'Monster Nation'. The first book was great - it had all the things that a good zombie story should have and a couple of twists. The second book was hardly related to the first, but also enjoyable in its own right. I assumed that the third book would bring the two together and form some sort of conclusion. In a way it does, but to be honest you could skip 'Monster Nation' and not miss much of the story.This third book contains too many deviations from the typical zombie novel in my opinion. I had trouble figuring out who was doing what and why and there were far too many 'super zombies' for my liking. Towards the end I didn't really care who lived or died, and it didn't seem to make much of a difference to the characters either.I guess if you're a zombie-holic then you could do worse than read this book, but you're definitely better off starting and the beginning of the trilogy (and maybe stopping after the second part)."}, {"userName": "Kissu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51690928-kissu", "userReview": "Me encant\u00f3 c\u00f3mo uni\u00f3 los hilos del primer libro y del segundo, eso fue excelente.

It has been 12 years since the mission to NYC for life sustaining medical supplies and medicine and not much is left of the world. DeKalb's daughter, Sarah, is helping fight zombies in Africa by using special powers she has learned from a ghost. Ayaan, who was on the medical mission to NYC is now the leader of the girl warriors (now close to 30) and she is abducted by a new breed of zombie. Sarah must then gather up volunteers to help her chase the new leader and his army of zombies to America and rescue Ayaan.This one gets 5 stars bc it starts out w/action and doesn't let up. This story is told between Sarah and Ayaan.

Swore I'd never read him again and then this book was foisted upon me by a relative (the 3rd and final book). Still not enthused but I'm glad I read it. Themes of the first book that I dismissed totally (liches, magic, the Source thing) were fleshed out a bit better and I took a tad more seriously. But eh...not going to read the second one or a fourth one if that (unlikely) occurs. Basically, even with suspending my disbelief over the magic, liches, and post apocalptic zombie universe (so its fantasy, not horror), everything felt forced and far-fetched. Also grew to hate all the characters--but it had a good ending well, so I'll throw this book that bone."}, {"userName": "Leif Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961877-leif-anderson", "userReview": "For the first time in this series, I felt a little let down by the ending. There was a really big climactic scene, with some plucking on the heart strings, but overall, the ending here just didn't amaze me like the first two books in the series. It left me feeling unresolved. Also, the story seemed to move in fits and starts, taking too long in some places, then making a jump that seemed too fast.With that said, there were several really good moments, and there was a lot more of that moral ambiguity that I love so much. Are the bad guys really that bad? Do noble goals justify evil actions? Nothing too seriously weighty to consider, but better than the average cheap zombie adventure.Oh, and there were an annoying number of instances where \"lead\" was used where \"led\" should have been."}, {"userName": "Joseph Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862806-joseph-barnes", "userReview": "Love this series. Things are getting a little TOO weird for me though. The Cast of Characters are really freaky. Set twelve years after the shambling zombie masses have overrun Manhattan, America, and the world, Monster Planet is the mind-blowing conclusion to what must be the scariest trilogy ever. Oceans of blood, scattered limbs, wanton violence, and general mayhem abound, along with revivified mummies, a Welsh sorcerer, and Wellington's signature brand of cool high-tech weaponry and sly humor \u2014 zombies, after all, are the ultimate consumers. What do the undead want, aside from fresh meat? Do the steadily diminishing number of humans who have somehow managed to survive over a decade of living hell stand a chance on a planet where they've been reduced to the status of prey? It all ends here, on Monster Planet."}, {"userName": "tages", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569748-tages", "userReview": "Best zombie trilogy!! My review also gives a summation of the entire trilogy. Book #1 was really amazing and had me on the edge of my seat at every turn! I was somewhat bored with book #2 - not so much with Nilla's story, but more so with Clark Bannerman's story. After finishing the last book I think back to book #2 and realize that it really was worth the read. Book #2 clearly shows its purpose in this final installment! Book #3 links books #1 and 2 together and brings the story to a solid conclusion. Definitely worth reading if you are into zombie novels. This is nothing like World War Z, I believe this is much better. The Newsflesh Trilogy by Mira Grant is another great zombie novel series."}], "description": "In 'Monster Island', the dead walked the streets of New York City.
