It was one of the first science fiction novels I read, and definitely my first taste of Douglas Adams and British quirkiness.The thing you have to get about h2g2 is that it's not enough to suspend your disbelief. You need to have it surgically removed, then seal it in an airtight box, ship the box overseas to Germany (use FedEx), and bury the box in an abandoned mine (alternatively, if you live in Germany, ship it to Australia).The book begins with the end of the world, which is naturally an excellent way to begin any story. In fact it's almost becoming cliche now. However, at the time Douglas Adams was doing it, it was just what you did to make money working for the BBC.Arthur Dent is the lovable everyman with whom we can sympathize (and sometimes yell at for being such a dense clod). He is not a knight in shining armour, nor is he the renegade anti-hero we are so used to seeing in action films these days. He's British. He's middle-class. His home and planet have been demolished all in one day. You'd think the universe would cut him some slack, but no....What really appeals to me about h2g2, however, is the fact that it is so readable. I take it with me whenever I travel (which isn't very often), because I always know I will enjoy it. And as I get older, there are new dimensions for me to appreciate. At first glance, the situations in the book seem absurd and infinitely improbable. Yet if you think about it long enough, you will realize that they are in fact what goes on in real life here on mostly harmless Earth. The universe of h2g2 is a microcosmic representation of our own society's bureaucratic fallacies, beginning with the demolition of one man's house and working its way up to the poignant irony that Earth is a computer built to find the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything.The fact that the entire series is about the search for the question, and not the answer, which the book happily reveals to all of us, is a timeless metaphor for human existence. It doesn't matter whether you read this in the '80s, '90s, now, or in the future. We spend so much time searching for an answer, for the \"meaning,\" that we often forget to simply enjoy the search itself. We forget for what we're searching--we're searching for an \"answer\", but to what? What do we expect to find? H2g2 conveys this unoriginal thought in a very original and fun manner--the Earth gets destroyed, naturally, then mice claim that they ordered it custom-made from a planet-building society, and ... well, Arthur doesn't get much of a rest from there on in.So far I've only really explored the first book, and the overarching concepts of the series. What about the other books? Each has its merits, although unquestionably the first book is the best. Restaurant at the End of the Universe has the tastiest quotation of the entire series, right at the beginning, so cool that many just attribute it to the series itself. Life, the Universe, and Everything lives up to its name by positing interesting \"facts\" about the nature of the universe, physics, time travel, and sofas. So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish has the pithy God's Final Message to His Creation, which is really the epitome of bureaucratic rhetoric.I didn't really like Mostly Harmless. I'm sorry, but it was depressing. I think that at that point, Adams had been doing h2g2 so long that it was no longer a burst of creative genius but an arduous struggle to write something new out of something so well done already. The absurdity of the original two books, which adapted material from the original radio series, was replaced by a more rigid, formulaic absurdity, and that just isn't as fun.Still, h2g2 is an amazing and timeless series. With so many incarnations, so much different material and conflicting continuities, it is not a \"book\" or a \"story\" but a phenomenon unto itself. Few series, no matter how popular, can make that claim. And thanks to Douglas Adams, I always know where my towel is."}, {"userName": "foteini_dl", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48824606-foteini-dl", "userReview": "\u039e\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 food for thought;\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03be\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2,\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2,\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bb\u03c0;\u0395,\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Douglas Adams.\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1 Monty Python \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 Mighty Boosh. \u039a\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ce \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9.\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1,\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf montypython-\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc feeling,\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c8\u03ac\u03be\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7.Guess what,\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0398\u0395\u03a9\u039d \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9,\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9-\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03c2-\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u2019 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5.\u201cMuch funnier than everything John Cleese has written.\u201dTerry Jones\u201cReally entertaining and fun\u201d.

When I asked myself which book in the \"hitchhiker\"-series should go on my \"favorites\" shelf, there could be only one. It had to be a collection - the individual books are brilliant, but who in their right mind would think to themselves \"I think I'll re-read 'Life, the Universe and Everything' today\", skipping the first two parts? Right, no one! That was rhetorical... never mind, it had to be a collection! How Adams' himself felt about his books is of course interesting and others opinions also, but not for this decision really. Neither is the fact that there are 5 parts in the series. Or 6, depending on who you ask. The man was a genius taken far too soon from us and I would gladly read his shopping list . Actually, I think I did read his shopping list, in The Salmon of Doubt - or possibly in a biography(?). Anyway, beside the point again. What matters is of course what version of this great work that works the very best for me and this is it. Fascinatingly, Douglas Adams being very very British, the Swedish translation (by Thomas Tidholm) of this, Liftarens Guide till Galaxen is an on par edition and very much recommended."}, {"userName": "Deedee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5814164-deedee", "userReview": "When I picked up the book I thought to be The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, little did I know that I had picked up the entire four part trilogy (yes, a trilogy of four parts, this is par for the course with Adams). It's quite fortunate I did because I think the best way to experience Adam's mad world is to read it as one book.The book is full of the cleverest, funniest nonsense I have ever come across, so sharp it cuts itself into funnier, cleverer, more ridiculous nonsense still.The first time I read it I found almost constantly giggling like a maniac at words on paper. IT has not grown duller with time. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy is a prime example of my favorite kind of book; the kind you read for its contents, not for its resolution.

Forget the Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy, I would gladly compromise with a guide to the mind of Douglas Adams! Taking into account when this book was written and the fact that it is science fiction it would still be an instant hit if it came out today. The universal truths that it holds are a bit unnerving and sometimes make one wonder if things ever change or just go around in circles. All in all I have no more words to describe how wonderful this book is, how I would have loved to have met Douglas Adams and how in awe I am off anyone who has the guts to allow his imagination to run wild and is not afraid to put it in paper!

Did he partake in a little LSD one wonders. ;-)Shame he isn't around to write more books because I certainly for one would read them.What a weird and wonderful mind.I found myself saying \"ohhhhhhh, I get it\" out loud on many an occasion.This book is one of those that I will definitely read again at some point and see if I take something more or even else from it as it oozes detail and hilarity and quirkiness.I was amazed how much at the beginning of the book resounded modern day.Douglas Adams was onto something with that screen reader ;-)Funny thing about this book is how Adams incorporates so many aspects of 'truth' into this sci fi, action packed, humorous 'trilogy' of four.It deserves all five stars given and I recommend everybody to give it a try."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695870-lynn", "userReview": "I tried to read this after seeing the 2005 movie.

It is based on the radio plays and TV series of the same name/s.Arthur Dent is having a bad day - just after his house is demolished to make way for a bypass, the Vogon fleet arrive to demolish the earth, to make way for a hyperspace bypass. He escapes by hitching a ride with his friend, Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien and introduces Arthur to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - a prodigious book with DON'T PANIC printed on its cover. Instantly, we are catapulted into the word of excruciating and deadly Vogon poetry, Babel fish, an Improbability Drive, piles of galactic red-tape and wild adventures. While I haven\u2019t listened to the original radio plays, I have fond memories of watching the T.V. series as Arthur Dent (a quintessential Englishman) travels through time and space with Ford Prefect (a researcher for the guide, from a system near Betelgeuse), Ford\u2019s half-cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox (a super cool guy with two heads and three arms), Trillian (from earth) and Marvin the pathologically depressed robot. Arthur\u2019s hilarious, improbable and rather farcical adventures are interspersed with humerous and often eventually relevant asides from the guide itself. I love Douglas' dry and cynical sense of humour, as he gently pokes fun at life, the universe and everything - even if I have a more hopeful view of what it all means, myself.The first two books covers most of what I remember from the TV series and the movie (though I think the movie does depart a bit from the originals), a lovely nostalgic read. The next two were new material for me - with the Krikkit Wars in book 3 & the mystery of the reappearance of earth and a sweet love story in book 4 which sustained my interest and whimsy. Each book has a vague plot and resolution as it careens through the galaxy in bizarre twists and turns and - mostly -saving the day. What did surprise me (but probably shouldn't) was that almost all the active parts across the four books are filled by males. With the exception of Trillian (brilliant, generally smarter than the men, at times feisty, but in the end loyal to Zaphod) and, in the fourth book, Fenchurch - the females have small and infrequent bit parts as wives, girlfriends (preferably in bulk), prostitutes and maids. Hmm - I guess it shows the era in which it was written in. Still, I was thoroughly amused and entertained by Adam's gentle, statistical wit and fecund imagination.

The first book is the original hitchhikers guide and is fabulous. A work of real originality, humour, wit and acute satirical observation. No question about this being a 5 star book. 'Restaurant' is also very funny but somewhat episodic - there is a slight impression that the author is making it up as he goes along that detracts from the immersion. In the third book this impression is stronger, and there are less good jokes. 3 stars. The fourth and final book in the anthology is really bad. No real humour, very short, the characters are inconsistent and heavily reliant on previous works to give them any depth at all. An unreserved no stars.So overall a mixed bag.

I can't believe you haven't already!\"I'd agree, and I promised that it would go onto my list. The next day, I would have forgotten the idea entirely, in favour of some other novel, or video game. Finally, after one too many recommendations, (funnily enough, four of them are called David), I remembered to look for it while I was in a bookstore. So, what did I think, now that I've fulfilled so many wishes?Why didn't I listen sooner? It was an incredible read.One of the first things that struck me is just how deliciously witty and sarcastic this is, on every level. The unforgettable characters are greatly developed with their own unique oddities, especially robots you'd assume shouldn't have personalities (looking at you, Marvin). They're all so very British, even the characters from other planets who've never even heard of Britain. The dialogue is the highest form of banter you'd probably only expect from comedy clubs centred in Cambridge. The voice of the narrator even manages to exceed the characters with absurdities. The metaphors and similes are consistently hilarious, with images given such as \"The ships hung in the sky much in the same way that bricks don't\".Many of the scenarios the gang finds themselves in, or the devices they use, are so utterly creative and clever. It all, in a weird sort of way, makes sense. There's an infallible theoretical logic to it all. It is, really, a writer's dream to read. There's so much to be gained from this.This is the Seinfeld of novels. The height of comedy. Perhaps it's a good thing I waited a while to read it, because otherwise it would have ruined many of the following books I'd have read in comparison."}, {"userName": "Pugsie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13407816-pugsie", "userReview": "This made no sense. The story takes off and you'd think you know where this is going. TWIST. You realize this is not about the first part of the book but about what you are now reading. TWIST. This is going somewhere you'd never think it would go. It continues that way and you find yourself wondering how you got here from the beginning of this book. The ending is surprising and since there is a second book (and more) there's more to this story than just the first book. Which made no sense.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this! It made me laugh and read short pieces out load to someone, just to share it with another person.---Second book was like a long scene where a lot of things happen but not really anything. A normal day in life. Made me wonder what will come next. Felt like a build up for the third. A lot of catchy lines, but nothing outstanding. Not a good as the first one, but definitely worth reading.---Third book review disappeared which made me sad.---Fourth book was interesting. It changed the pace all together and felt like a side-story to the main mission I have been taken through the previous books. A pause in the chaotic universe. New characters are being introduced and it feels normal, like life, only it is difficult to understand how long time they spend together. I do believe I remember a hint from the beginning of the book about the end, but when the end came I had no idea what it meant or even remembered that it was the point of the whole book.

Arthur Dent was the stereotypical Englishman and a bit of a bumbling idiot, but I found him quite likeable. There were some other great supporting characters - Marvin the Robot earns the award for the most hilariously depressive character I have ever encountered, and Zaphod Beeblebrox was an absolute nutter and a clear favourite.I smirked and laughed out loud more often than one should whilst reading on public transport, and earned a few odd looks from nearby strangers.I would classify this book as fantasy for the non-fantasty reader and I would recommend it for anyone wanting a dose of hilarity and an escape from reality.I only have one negative about this: I lost my way a bit in the third book - a touch of fantasy fatigue, I suspect. In hindsight, I should have put it down and read something of a different genre in between books. Nonetheless, I would definitely pick this up again for a re-read."}, {"userName": "BakerStreetBat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19730076-bakerstreetbat", "userReview": "How have I lived without this book in my life? Starting with the demolition of Arthur Dent's house and planet, this 'trilogy of four' is a rollercoaster ride from start to end. Adams' dry sense of humour keeps you laughing out loud while the sheer invention involved in the many ridiculous elements of the galaxy is breathtaking. It's unashamedly nonsensical but some parts remain poignant and sweet all the same. During the 1st 3 books I felt that the female characters were somewhat sidelined, but in Book 4 that was fixed. The excerpts from 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' were particularly hilarious. My personal favourite of the four was 'The Restaurant at the End of the Universe' but all of them were amazing. Adam's creation is one of those rare books you wish didn't have to end and stands up well to rereading. If you haven't yet read this, be prepared for madness, mayhem and Marvin the Paranoid Android. Make sure you know where your towel is, because unreliable, witty cynic Ford Prefect will lead you from prehistoric caves to the apocalypse in the search for the Ultimate Question. But DON'T PANIC - the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is your trusty guide through this marvellous technicolour romp."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899463-leslie", "userReview": "Don't panic! Hitchhiker's Guide is hilarious and random. Most books aren't laugh-out-loud funny. This one definitely is. If you have a certain sense of humor, you'll love it. If you don't get into the book by chapter 3, you may want to look elsewhere for entertaining reading. I really enjoyed the first three books in the series, but the fourth book got too random and weird for me. The movie isn't nearly as good, so if you've seen the movie and have doubts, be sure to give this book a chance. #classroomlibrary"}, {"userName": "Siria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria", "userReview": "I know that these are considered classics of the genre, and have been massively influential on two decades of genre writing and TV.

For Arthur Dent, who has only just had his house demolished that morning, this seems already to be more than he can cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun, and the Galaxy is a very very very large and startling place.THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.When all questions of space, time, matter and the nature of being have been resolved, only one question remains --- \"Where shall we have dinner?\" The Restaurant at the End of the Universe provides the ultimate gastronomic experience, and for once there is no morning after to worry about.LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING.In consequence of a number of stunning catastrophes, Arthur Dent is surprised to find himself living in a hideously miserable cave on prehistoric Earth. However, just as he thinks that things cannot possibly get any worse, they suddenly do. He discovers that the Galaxy is not only mind-boggling big and bewildering but also that most of the things that happen in it are staggeringly unfair.SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH.Just as Arthur Dent's sense of reality is in its dickiest state he suddenly finds the girl of his dreams. He finds her in the last place in the Universe in which he would expect to find anything at all, but which 3,976,000 people will find oddly familiar. They go in search of God's Final Message to His Creation and, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it.", "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A Trilogy in Four Parts\n      \n          (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy #1-4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841628.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy", "average": 4.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348461082l/841628.jpg", "reviews": 490, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4.Douglas_Adams", "name": "Douglas Adams"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Humor", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841628.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161489.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9581226-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81643.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_To_The_Galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10334881-liftarens-guide-till-galaxen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386162.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13.The_Ultimate_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8695.The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8694.Life_the_Universe_and_Everything", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6091075-so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish"]}
