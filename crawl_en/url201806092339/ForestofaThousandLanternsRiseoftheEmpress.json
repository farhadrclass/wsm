There is a price for everything, as she learned and you, too, will learn. Some magic requires blood. Other magic requires a piece of your own self and eats away at your soul.\u201d\n4 1/2 stars. In short: Forest of a Thousand Lanterns is an East Asia-inspired fantasy in which a young woman chooses ruthless ambition and power over the love of a hot guy. Halle-freaking-lujah.I should probably say this is not for readers who must like the protagonist in order to enjoy a book. I almost DNFed it in the beginning when Xifeng hates and/or is jealous of every other woman she encounters. Girl-on-girl hate is one of my all time biggest pet peeves in YA. However, it soon became apparent that this is kind of the point. We're not really supposed to like Xifeng. She's a complex antiheroine and, honestly, it worked really well for me.The story opens with Xifeng living in a small town with her abusive aunt/Guma and secretly longing to fulfil the destiny the cards have predicted for her, again and again. The cards show a future of ultimate power, with Xifeng as the Empress, but there are sacrifices to be made and many obstacles to be overcome. She finally gathers her courage and runs away with her beloved, Wei, searching for a way to plant herself close to the Emperor and achieve what the cards have promised.It's nasty, twisted, and kinda gory. And I loved it! I experienced a whole array of emotions while reading. It's one of those books that gets under your skin until you're not quite sure how you feel about what is happening. On the one hand, Xifeng's dark jealousies and obsession with her own beauty should make you dislike her, and yet it is easy to feel the suffocating, frustrating cage of being a woman in a man's world. Forest of a Thousand Lanterns goes into a surprising amount of depth, never allowing characters to become one-dimensional stereotypes, and considering the complexities of abuse - how one can love their abuser for their few kind, gentle moments, despite everything. Even the most despicable character in the book offers us glimpses of her humanity:\n\u201cLife is difficult when you\u2019re born a woman in this world,\u201d the concubine murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ve entered a game you can\u2019t win. Men make the rules and we are left to be used by them or claw our way to whatever scraps they\u2019ve left behind. Do you think my father gave me to the Emperor because he loved me? Did he care when he tore me from my mother\u2019s arms? He thrust me into this pit of scorpions to be stung and forgotten.\u201d\nIn a strange way, it's something of a feminist tale. Or, at least, a critique of a patriarchal world that can make a woman terrified of losing that which she considers her greatest weapon - her beauty. It may be difficult to like Xifeng, but I truly felt her claustrophobia and pain here:\n\u201cI was Guma\u2019s, and now you want me to be yours. I have my own soul and my own destiny, and I\u2019m tired of belonging to someone else.\u201d\nIt definitely has a very Macbeth-esque feel to it. The use of prophecy - and how a person can become obsessed with and corrupted by it - reminds me of the Shakespearean tale. I can't say I would want Xifeng for a friend, but I am very interested in where her story is going. I have a feeling things are only going to get darker and nastier from here.

Xifeng is raised by her abusive aunt/Guma who longs to fulfill Xifeng's destiny, the cards have predicted. They show Xifeng's future full of power and as Empress, but with great power comes great sacrifice and difficult obstacles to pass. Sick of her aunt's abuse, Xifeng ceases the opportunity to run away with her lover, Wei, and fulfill this fucking destiny, yo!!!The pacing of this book is extremely slow and takes its time in building up to the good stuff. Slow pacing is a hit and miss for me. I'll either love it or quickly go bored with it. In this case, I did have a hard time enjoying this book, but thankfully that lasted for only about 50ish pages. The book started off well but then I got bored and I was going to dnf. But I decided not to and swear to god, the best decision my pathetic ass ever made. I think the pacing has a lot to do with what's going on in the story as well. As long as you're enjoying what you're reading, you'll enjoy the book. The world building is so freaking GORGEOUS, y'all I was in awe!!!! Everything is described so beautifully. You know that feeling when your mom makes some real good looking food and doesn't let you eat it so all you can do is take in every detail and your mouth is watering?? That was actually me. World building is hands down the best thing about this book!!Xifeng is such an amazingly written character. I read some reviews about how Xifeng is supposed to be an anti-hero. You sympathize with her and like her at some point and sometimes things she does make you hate her. This girl knows she's drop dead gorgeous and she knows that using that beauty the right way is going to get her where she wants. (The whole woman and their beauty message also showed some feminism in the book, which was great!!) She hates on other woman and kills one to have the spotlight on her. She's fucking crazy I know and girl hate is annoying, but it's all part of her ugly side. We aren't supposed to like Xifeng sometimes. Also not to mention she eats the hearts of the dead to get stronger, so that's great!! It's very gory, dark and bloody and you know I'm a sucker for that stuff. Overall, a very refreshing and beautiful book about how far people are willing to go to fulfill their destinies, v v great sacrifices, selfishness and all the ugly things that go through a woman's mind. Definitely recommend.\u274c\u274c\u274c\u274c\u274c\u274cthis cover is ugly af but it's the inside that should be beautiful and if it's not then you'll find me in a hole i personally dug for myself back in 1669.also br with Mat the blue eyed sexy Greek god with a six pack but is broke and only has muscles and his hotness to keep himself happy."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "More like Forest of a Thousand Dull Chapters.I have nothing against slow-paced books. I think it's alright for some stories to take longer to unfold and be detailed, and consequently, descriptive. You don\u2019t, for example, want to read a mystery novel that is not at all mysterious because you barely had time to guess who the killer was that BAAAM! You already finished the book.But if I\u2019m not interested, it doesn\u2019t matter how beautiful your writing is. If I don\u2019t care about the characters, it doesn\u2019t matter that what they\u2019re experiencing is challenging and mentally or physically-exhausting for them. It won\u2019t affect me. And unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened here. Retellings fascinate me.

It\u2019s a premise that you don\u2019t hear every day, and originality is necessary in YA fantasy fiction.NECESSARY.And yet I did yawn reading this. And yet I did struggle to sparkle my own interest in the book, because the latter certainly failed to do that. But it\u2019s not my job to make myself actively interested in a story\u2026 right? That\u2019s the author\u2019s job. Great concept, dull execution.

HOLY BATMAN I cannot express how beautifully dark this book is. This book is a typical-folklore fairy: beautiful and hypnotizing and just brings you in with your words... but it\u2019s super creepy and probably going to kill you. Xifeng is a victim of abuse. Her aunt took her in once her mother was out of the picture and looked into her future. She saw that Xifeng was destined for greatness and that she could even become Empress of Feng Lu, if she played her cards right; those cards being completely dark and doing whatever she needs to do to get to her destined throne.\u201cShe would bloom where she was planted and let her roots close around the throats of her enemies.\u201d The character building for Xifeng is literally out-of-this-world. She is so meek in the beginning and believes the horrible things her aunt tells her. She believes her beauty is the only thing she has going for her and she must protect her face at all cost. But then she realizes she doesn\u2019t have to do things her aunt\u2019s way... she can do things without her. And then she does and things get really complex and abstract from there.She wasn\u2019t confident in herself. But as the story goes on, she becomes more and more confident that she can do anything and that is what makes her the most threatening person in this book. She is an anti-hero; if you don\u2019t know what that is, it is when the main character is not a good person but you find yourself loving and cheering for them anyway. And I had my pom-poms out the whole time in this book.\u201cIf my beauty is my greatest weapon, vanity is the shield that protects me.\u201dThe world building in this is so beautifully woven into the story. There is no world-vomit and there is no confusion. The East Asian setting was just jaw-dropping and vivid to the mind. I wish more authors would take this way instead for settings more often. I don\u2019t really know a lot about this culture, but this has really peaked my interest. I don\u2019t want to give things away, but things like heart-eating and step-mothers and clawing anyone who threatens her being the fairest of them all are a part of this story. She goes about getting the throne in a completely different way than I thought she would, which was really refreshing.If you love creepy, unexpected, anti-heroes and surprisingly well-done retellings: this is for you.

I'd like to start off with a big loud pterodactyl screech that might convey how unique and amazing this book was. I am thoroughly impressed. The entire plot was so well thought out and the characters were beautifully written (even if some of them were brutal as hell... yeah I'm looking at you Xifeng). Basically, I loved it.Essentially this story is an Asian inspired twist on the Evil Queen from Snow White. It also seemed to incorporate lots of Asian mythology as well. I adoredddd this aspect because I'm not exposed to Asian culture very often in YA, so it truly was a breath of fresh air. There's also an antiheroine in the story and you have no idea how much I adore antiheroines like YES PLEASE GIVE THEM TO ME. I can not and will not get over the entire concept of this book. For the first half I would say I thought this book was about a 4 star read. But then something extremely dark and twisted happens and from then I was internally screaming until I finished the book. Now let me emphasize this again... this book gets REAL dark... There are certain violent scenes that are described that were hard to stomach... but they were done SO WELLLLL! I'M STILL INTERNALLY SCREAMING. AHHHHHH THIS CONCEPT.This story also breaks so many stereotypes and typical YA tropes... FABULOUS in that regardNext, the characters. Now, uh, as I mentioned before I adore antiheroines and LET ME TELL YOU... YOU DON'T THINK THIS PERSON WILL BE AN ANTIHERO UNTIL THIS THING HAPPENS AND AFTER THAT OH MY *cackles* sorry... was that too much? I just really love antiheroes don't @ me... Anyway... I enjoyed reading about all of the characters except for Wei... honestly I hated him the entire time oml...I will say the romance was a low point for me and what made me seriously consider whether this was a 5 star or a 4.5 because the romance in this book annoyed me to no end. However, I do understand why it was there and I respect it... That respect is as far as I will go. I feel like I already emphasized this but THE SECOND HALF OF THIS BOOK. The second half totally turns into a pre Snow White story and the ending HOLY SHIT I NEED THE SEQUEL. Now, I will say this is NOT a Snow White retelling... it's more of a PRE Snow White retelling and it seems as if the sequel may be more of a Snow White retelling. Don't go into this expecting Snow White... there were just so many hints and clues that point toward that story and it made me so giddy. And that second half man... it felt like a different book. When this book is released and if you aren't feeling the first part... I BEG YOU TO STICK WITH IT.This story had politics, demons, murder, gods, kingdoms, and a splendid world full of magic and darkness. I enjoyed it immensely. For sure pick this one up come October so I can have someone to freak out with!

She was a monster, a bride of the darkness, and she rose to face her destiny as though it were the blood-red sunrise of a new day.\n\nThis book is so gloriously BRUTAL. One word of warning, this book is certainly not for faint hearted, if you want a glint of hopefullness and happiness then go away because this book is certainly not for you. Forest of thousand lanterns follow the story of 18 year old's Xifeng's rise as an empress, as she embraces her own dark destiny.Xifeng's abusive aunt/Guma had filled her head with promise of great destiny as an Empress of whole Feng lu. The cards shows a powerful future beholds Xifeng but with great powers come great sacrifices, so throughout the book we saw as Xifeng abandon every kind of love to achive her destiny. She left her aunt, who she thought as her mother and abandoned Wei, her childhood sweetheart, to go into the Castle of Emperor Jun and grab her future.The world building was so beautiful and intricate. The blend of various elements of Chinese culture was done really well. I love court settings and court manoeuvrings so much and the author did splendid job building a court and consperacies within it.Xifeng's journey to darkness was done so well!!! Xifeng is gorgeous and knows how to use her beauty to survive in this cruel and dark world run by men. Throughout the book, we saw her inner conflicts. She try hard not to let her selfishness and darkness within her take over her but as story progressed she realize that only way to achieve greatness is through embracing her darkness.Just as it had the first time Guma had made her kill, Xifeng could hear a piece of her old self pleading: Let me go. Don\u2019t make me do this. Her limbs shuddered with her silent prayer for mercy, for her own salvation, but she heard nothing in return except the thundering of her own heart.\u201cSave me,\u201d Xifeng uttered aloud, one last time, before she let the darkness take her. She knew nothing now but her uncontrollable hungerXifeng is not the character to love or root for. She is extremely hateful toward every girl at court but her hatred for other and desire to be greater then everyone is the whole point of story. The court life is cruel, and if Xifeng did not become cruel like others, she would have eventually failed. I know everybody cared more for Xifeng and her conflicts but to be honest, the character I loved most was Empress Lihua. Lihua was the most miserable character in this book despise being Empress and direct descendants of Dragon Lords. Her parents did not deem her fit to rule, her first husband married her to another person before his death, his second husband, Emperor Jun did not gave a shit about her once Xifeng came into view and then in the end everyone forget her. She was not ruthless like Xifeng was, and in the end nobody cared for her. But despuse everything, she was still strong. She was clever and saw everything thay was happening around her. She loved her daughter dearly. She didn't have physical strength but her love for her child made up for it.Everytime I think if Lihua, my heart break even more. She did not do anything wrong. She deserved love and in the end she did got love in the form of her daughter, but almost everyone, even the readers too, forget her. I think this was the whole point of this book; be cruel or be forgotten. I just hope there is loads of Princess Jade in the next book. Pleasee!!!It's twisted, it's cruel and full of blood. I felt anger and love for Xifeng, I sympathized with Lihua, I am feeling so protective of baby Jade and I really want fo kill Emperor Jun. There were tons of twists and turns that I did not see coming and Xifeng's conflicts would not bore you.

The progression of the book moved at a gradual pace, nothing seemed to be rushed. Not only this the writing was so well done. I think what made this book so gripping is that there were many plots going on underneath the surface and you didn't know who you could entirely trust.\"Your beauty is all you are, and all you have. Your only weapon.\"Our main character is Xifeng, when we first meet her character I didn't really know what to think of her, she has something very very dark in her, we see her being abused by her Aunt and wants something better in her life. Her character development what phenomenal, the way in which she thinks and plots and how she overcomes certain aspects was just so well done. We see her flaws and her embrace them, some things were grotesque and at some points I was inwardly screaming.Some are given a rope to the moon, and others claw up to the sky.What I liked?- The storytelling we see throughout, it was so gripping and in them they felt like fairytales.- All of the little references of Snow White- Her friendship with Kang- Even though some bad things happened, I kind of felt sorry for Xifeng...

Forest of a Thousand Lanterns is an East Asian retelling of the Evil Queen's origin story before she became Snow White's stepmother, and it is everything I wanted it to be.First of all, SHE DOESN'T BECOME EVIL BECAUSE OF A DUDE. I love my villains and I am a sucker for a good origin story, but my main pet peeve is when a female villain becomes evil because a guy wronged her. Sure, there's a guy in here, but there are so many factors contributing to Xifeng's embracing the darkness and it was really well done. Her descent was well developed and thought out.Which may make my complaint seem a bit contradictory, but at times, this book felt really long. According to Goodreads, it's not even over 400 pages, but I honestly felt like I was reading a 500-page tome sometimes. There was so much information to suck up, and yes, this does result in quite a rich world-building, but... I think I would've been happier with less. It didn't read as smoothly.I did really love the mythology and the stories everyone told. The characters were nicely fleshed out as well. I did guess some of the things that were coming, but the road was still an enjoyable one.Overall, I'd really recommend this to fans of fantasy, villains, and retellings.

Between the current empress, the concubines, and even the gossiping eunuchs, Xifeng navigates and schemes her way, manipulating nearly everyone in her favor to hook the current emperor into hopefully making her his next empress.I loved this book. I was super into it from the start. It has a quiet beginning, but once Xifeng makes her way to court, I was enthralled. All the relationships were so intricately schemed I was so interested in the dynamics Xifeng had with everyone, both the men and the women in this book.First, I gotta talk about the writing and how immersive it was. Julie Dao can write, holy moly. I'm not the biggest fan of flowery prose but it was so atmospheric and fit with the tone of the story she sat up here that it was really inspiring to listen to. I say listen, because I did get the audiobook for this one and I loved how this story was told me. I can't wait to read more of Julie's books because I'm a lot of percent sure I'm going to enjoy anything she writes. The book primarily takes place in a court setting at the palace and it was exactly what I needed to read at the time because I was eating all this court life up. The political intrigue and alliances aspect did not disappoint me at all. It was great. I loved learning about everything, especially the culture. Now, I have seen a lot of mixed reviews on this book and it seem a lot of them come down with Xifeng's character. I loved her character. This is a villain origin story so... she does some pretty pretty awful things. But like, I was both shocked and proud of her when she did these things. I was rooting for her. I wanted to see her become empress. I enjoyed the way the malicious schemed and manipulated the characters around her to get her goal. It's wildy different than how a hero would get there. Speaking of her manipulations. Oh man, was I on board for how she completely worked all the men in this book. Her childhood love she schemed against and I was thrilled. She manipulated the crown prince by planting seeds of doubt. And the way she worked the emperor was the best. I was living for these scenes, they were my favorite part of the book. *insert Louise Belcher laughing in front of flames gif* Now the only reason I rated this a four instead of a five came down to the evil creature that lived inside of her that Xifeng often references. She relies on this \"creature\" a little too much in my opinion for the reasoning behind she does certain things. I wish there was more of a separation there. I wanted Xifeng to be a little more self-reliant on her villainous tendencies. I would have liked to see her do some of these things without saying the creature made her do it. But really, that was the only thing I didn't like about the book. I'm really excited for the next book in the series and I just... I harbor ill-will toward anyone who will go up against Xifeng since I am #TeamXifeng alllllll the way."}, {"userName": "Joshua Gabriel (\uc870\uc218\uc544)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8832758-joshua-gabriel", "userReview": "I've been watching a K-drama called Empress Ki, so now, I can't help but imagine Xifeng as Ha Ji-won and Emperor Jun as Ji Chang-wook. <3 Hahaha, I'm such as helpless fanboy. xD"}, {"userName": "Cindy \u2729\u263d Savage Queen \u2654", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222333-cindy-savage-queen", "userReview": "Cover Reveal: Good old Asian vibesBut re-reading the synopsis and seeing, \"she must spurn the young man who loves her...\" Me: Wait, does she love him too?

Ive heard nothing but amazing things about it.\u00a0The setting and culture were beautifully vivid and lush. I also thought the writing was fantastic.\u00a0I wasnt sure if I was still into retelling but after reading this wonderful East Asian evil queen retelling I have hope there still some great ones out there.I probably would have finished it in a couple days had it been an egalley. Im so used to reading ebooks that switching back to physical books makes it harder for me to get fully immersed in the story and read for long periods of time. Despite my struggle with physcial books, I read the last 2/3 of the book quickly. The story had its slower moments, but I still didnt want to put it down.The main character Xifengs inner struggle with darkness was compelling to read about. She wasnt always likeable, but I loved her scheming once she got to the palace. I tend to love smart and cunning main characters and this was no exception. Her developpement felt realistic and Im not surprised she turned out the way she did after the way her aunt treated her. The way she treated Wei broke my heart.I also had Ken pull on my heartstrings. I loved the way Shiro was represented as a little person and Xifeng friendship with him. I also\u00a0really liked the eunuch\u00a0Kang. Even though I didnt trust his quick friendship with Xifeng right away his flare and kindness made him instantly likeable. I really appreciated that the Emperor didnt treat Xifeng like property. He could be ruthless when it comes to ruling, but he also had a very charming side.I appreciated how the author gave us good reasons for Lady Suns behavior, as well as Xifengs. I dont like when the antagonist motivations arent clear but I didnt have that problem at all with this book.I enjoyed how the dynamic between Xifeng and the Empress developped.\u00a0I would have liked to have seen more female friendships, but I understand this is an evil queen retelling.\u00a0I still wonder what became of Ning.Im pretty good at predicting were a story will go, but my predictions were totally wrong for this book. I expected the romance to go in a different direction and I expected her to be impatient about becoming Empress.\u00a0I loved the dark magic, the\u00a0mythology and demons. I have a set of tarot cards at home and I liked seeing it incorporated in a book.There's wasnt that much action, but I thought the political and magical plot was intriguing. I dont always find it easy to get invested in villains\u00a0because their flaws can make them hard to like, but despite Xifengs flaws I was rooting for her. Ill definitely be picking up the next book as soon as it comes out and anything else the author publishes. Id recommend this if you love anti-heroine stories.---------Physical copy just arrived in the mail and its soooo pretty. Im hyperventilating.

And I think it's something the YA genre needs more of, because it has so much potential to be different from many other generic - or too similar - books in the genre. Coming into this book, I didn't realize it would be so reminiscent of Snow White from the evil queen's point of view. It's not the same and I'm not even sure if the author meant it to be a sort of retelling of that particular fairy tale, but I really liked how the story had some similar elements, but still was esentially its own. The Asian inspired setting was beautifully described and magical and one of the best points of the story. In terms of lush world building combined with rather slow paced storyline, I'd recommend this books to fans of Renee Ahdieh. Of course I enjoyed the moral greyness of the main character, Xifeng. But at the same time, I have to say I really disliked her. It's kind of understandable - and intentional - since she's the future villain, but.. Normally I either love a good villain, or at least love to hate him/her. And if the story is about the origin of a villlain, I want to understand her, to feel for her somehow. Like I felt, for example, for Adelina Amouteru from The Young Elites. That story ripped my heart right out. But this, I felt either indifferent towards Xifeng, or outright hated her. I mean, she was so so vain. So woman hating, so self absorbed, judgmental, hypocrytical and thoroughly unlikeable to me from the beginning. And it just got worse. So I guess I did like the promise of evil queen origin retelling, and I did like it on the surface, but I didn't always (or most of the time) enjoy reading from her view. \n\u201cThe beauty of this world is fading all too fast through the cruelty and thoughtlessness of men.\u201d \nAs for the side characters, no one really stood out to me. There was some little bit of romance as well, but it didn't take the center stage of the story at all, for which I was grateful. All in all, I didn't care for the love interest as a character, nor for the bits of romance. The pacing of this book was also a bit of a struggle for me. It was very slow and uneventful, for the most part.Overall, I liked the world buidling and the premise of the story. I like morally grey character and fairy tale retellings. Xifeng was an interesting future villain, but a horrible person and reading from her view was unpleasant for me. Recommended for those who, like me, want to read more YA books focused on female villains.\n\u201cShe knew her own worth. She would seize her destiny with all the strength and spirit within her, and bend them all to her will: every man kneeling and every woman overshadowed.\u201d \n *****************************Some great YA books centered on morallly grey main characters that I would also recommend: The Young Elites, Cruel Beauty, Fairest, Heartless, The Diabolic."}, {"userName": "Lily \u2601\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10148904-lily", "userReview": "This was both boring and weirdly addictive?

A book review? It can't be...After taking a 3 or 4 month break from reading I finally decided to pick up a book and it feels good to be back in the reading mood!I'm not normally a fan of retellings, but this is definitely the best one I have read. I tend to stay clear of them, but I'm always drawn to an eaten inspired fantasy setting and then an anti-hero main character as well? I mean how could I resist? Ultimately these were the two features I enjoyed most about this book. The setting was vibrant and filled with culture, but also was riddled with political conflict which really helped build that sense of uncertainty and caution, which every court-like setting should have! And Xifeng, while being somewhat generic as a person, had some really dark elements woven into her character. The whole heart thing is amazing... Also this book has some guts and really took things as far as it could, which I greatly appreciated.Why not 4 stars?Everything just felt too convenient at the beginning stages of the book and I felt like everything just sort fell into place for Xifeng. She seemed to get where she wanted without too much conflict or struggle.I HATED the romance, it was just dumb... Maybe because you're sorta thrown into the middle stages of it, so there's no knowledge of background or anything like that and tbh Wei as a character just seems a bit unnecessary to me, but what can you do. He's just a dumb dumb.I've also kinda had enough of the whole 'mulan-esque' trope now... (Love Mulan, don't get me wrong), but it's just the same scene every time were the woman steps forward and claims that she'll fight and then the men all laugh and then the woman proves them wrong and the men are like \"Oh shit, she can fight...\" Luckily that wasn't heavily used in this book tho but it's just something that's starting to annoy me now.Overall though I really liked this book and will definitely be reading the sequel whenever it comes out!

I did not even read the synopsis! The book was part of my first ever Fairyloot box and I remembered seeing good reviews everywhere. The monthly Fairyloot topic was villainous\u2026Obviously there would be a villain but who would play the role? I looked at the synopsis only after having finished the book and I\u2019m glad I did not read it sooner as it tells lots about the story!Now the plus side is that I\u2019m not too limited in my review for fear of spoiling the fun! Yepee I will be able to give some context!\u00a0First thought: Julie C. Dao is gutsy (I wanted to go for b@llsy but I will keep this PG rated)!It's not every day that you have a main character that is not completely \"white\" even if Xifeng is Asian. I speak about character's trait here not skin color! One of my blogger's friends (yes Shruti that's you) recently published a very interesting post about: female YA character wanted (link HERE).Here are the prerequisite to fit the job:-The heroine should have an obscure name. Well I don\u2019t know if Xifeng is an obscure name in Asia\u2026-The heroine should be an orphan or raised by a single mother. Xifeng lost her mother, never knew her father and is raised by her aunt Guma.-Be white. Well no Xifeng is Asian!-She should never realize how pretty she looks. Well this is so not the case! Xifeng knows she is gorgeous. She is obsessed with her beauty as it is her best tool to fulfill her ambitious destiny. You could even compare Xifeng to the evil Queen in Snow White who scrutinize anxiously her reflection every day.-Among other responsibilities she should save the world. No. Again Xifeng does not want to save the world. She wants to rule the world, big difference!See how this YA Fantasy heroine does not take the conventional path? Hail to Julie C. Dao!\n\u00a0Second thought: this read was a treat and a trick. Sorry Halloween just ended just bear with me as I\u2019ve been conditioned by my kids these days. A treat because the penmanship is gorgeous. The setting in Asia with silk clothes, paper lanterns, quiet ponds and measured words accompanied by inscrutable faces make for a tale instead of a story. But under the polished veneer feelings, hate, hunger are burning bright! Xifeng is my trick. I adore this concept of living Snow White evil Queen\u2019s life BUT walking in her shoes was not easy! Xifeng is conflicted. She has two faces. This is confusing and conflicting for the reader.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have two faces. Two beings live within you, struggling for control. One has a heart of darkness and feeds in the pain of weaker souls. The other longs to stretch a hand to the light, to live and love as others do. Have you never sensed this?\u201d\nShould I love her? The girl with fences around her heart had me weaving a tapestry of barbed wires around my own heart. Sometimes I hated her for how she played with Wei's feelings.\u00a0\n\u201cWei as a man still wanted what Wei as a child had wished for, but Xifeng's heart stayed silent.\u201d\n\u00a0It was not fair how she treated him never loving him fully but not wanting to free him from her spell and have another lover.\u00a0\n\"She would wrap her coils around him in tender confinement and be not his captive, but his captor.\"\nSometimes I pitied Xifeng as she seemed to have her destiny chosen for her. Yes she had the poison and the antidote. Yes she could have made another choice. But honestly was it a real choice when she had to contend with that terrible god? With Wei out of the picture I would dare say few hope was left.\u00a0\n\"She couldn't help the urgent longing to see Wei. He, too, was part of her destiny after all that faithful dependable boy who had always been her moral compass, who had always only seen the good in her. If anyone could keep the creature's dark whisperings at bay, it would be him.'\n\u00a0\u00a0Third thought: poor na\u00efve Xifeng so ambitious. She thought all her wishes would come true once Empress.But what would be the price? The Serpent God would want to take his final payment. Would she fulfil her destiny or choose the path of love?\u00a0All this made for a terrible, unconventional, lush and lavish tale.Recommend it? Without a doubt!\n\u00a0Have you read it?
