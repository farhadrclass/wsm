Maybe it\u2019s not even singular. Self is a plurality, but pluralities can also be integrated, right? Think of a rainbow. It\u2019s one arc of light, but also seven differently colored arcs of light.\u201d\nThis is difficult to rate. Looking back, there were definitely certain aspects that I thought were done well, but I just didn't enjoy either the story or the uber-philosophical writing. Given that I consider three stars to be a mostly positive rating, I'm going with two.Turtles All the Way Down is really only for those looking for deep cell-level evaluation of human consciousness and personhood. To give him some credit, Green captures Aza's needling anxiety and compulsions very well. That little inner voice of doubt that causes you to question things you know until maybe you're not so sure is spot on. It's everything else around Aza's inner turmoil that feels like what it is - filler.It could very easily have been an interesting portrait of OCD and anxiety, but attempts to add a bizarre subplot of a missing billionaire (who is also the father of her childhood friend, Davis) don't disguise the fact that nothing really happens. I am not opposed to an introspective novel, especially in YA contemporary dealing with mental illness, but I cannot figure out why the author decided to add such a disjointed and nonsensical side story to the mix. Unless, of course, it is yet another \"deep metaphor\" for the nonsensical nature of anxiety, but I would have found Aza's story far stronger without it.The ludicrous and boring plot acts as a superficial backdrop for Green to play out the usual \"super precocious teens having philosophical conversations.\" Aza's mental illness and Green's philosophy bleed together into statements that are straddling the line between clever and nauseating:\nI guess I just don\u2019t like having to live inside of a body? If that makes sense. And I think maybe deep down I am just an instrument that exists to turn oxygen into carbon dioxide, just like merely an organism in this\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. vastness.\nI had very little patience with hipster teens being hipster back when I was the age of these characters; I have even less now.I don't know why Green has to create such annoyingly unrealistic carbon copies of himself. Even secondary characters like Daisy quickly become annoying - calling Aza \"Holmesy\" in literally every sentence she speaks is extremely irritating. And these text messages between Aza and Davis:\nMe: You\u2019re not your money.\t\t\t Him: Then what am I? What is anyone?\t\t\t Me: I is the hardest word to define.\t\t\t Him: Maybe you are what you can\u2019t not be.\t\t\t Me: Maybe. How\u2019s the sky?\t\t\t Him: Great. Huge. Amazing.\nIt's not even right to say these characters don't talk like teenagers because that makes it sound like teens can't possibly be this smart (and they definitely can), but these characters just don't talk like any people I've ever encountered anywhere. Of any age. They sound like what I imagine old buddhist monks to sound like.Green takes steps toward exploring the painful reality of living with a mental illness that deeply affects your everyday life and wellbeing, but it's sad that he pulls it back into the land of pretentious philosophical mumbo jumbo. For a while there, it felt real to me, and then it just became John Green talking to himself about the universe and the nature of \"self\". I guess I have to accept that early John Green - the kind who wrote Paper Towns - is a thing of the past.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel", "userReview": "I\u2019ve been having a bad run with YA lately. I\u2019ve loved it for so long that I persevere on, remembering that there are gems, that there are treasures, but increasingly I\u2019ve found myself worried - have I grown out of it? Have I overdone it? Each novel seems to be repeating some unspoken pattern, or at least trying to make something new out of the same ingredients. It was with trepidation, then, that I wandered in to Turtles All The Way Down, thinking \u201cyes, I\u2019ve liked John Green books in the past, but maybe that was before I had grown tired of the same ingredients.\u201d \u2026 NOPE. IT\u2019S GREAT. YA IS ALIVE AND WELL. Like always, I\u2019m thankful for Green\u2019s refusal to dumb anything down. He treats his teenagers like adults because they are adults, or nearly are, and at the very least deserve the same respect as adults. When we are introduced to Aza\u2019s life, and her way of living it, nothing is hidden. Her anxiety and mental health continue to be an unrelenting problem in the narrative because they are an unrelenting problem in her narrative. It doesn\u2019t ease up, it doesn\u2019t get fixed, and at times it is nearly physically painful to read about a sad girl who can\u2019t get better. You do just want to reach into the pages and give her a shake, or a hug, and tell her to please get better. But that\u2019s the point. She can\u2019t. Or not forever. And that\u2019s okay. Because she\u2019s still lovely and wonderful and loved.I have a particular love for the ending. My dad and I agree that watching a good movie is more fun the second time. Now you know that every thing is going to be all right and you can just relax and enjoy it. I went into the ending so nervous that it would be cheesy, or unrealistically hopeful, or really unnecessarily sad. I was so surprised by an ending that moved on from being a teenager, looked at a life beyond teenage hood, that I nearly cried. I nearly cried because not enough teenagers hear that what they\u2019re going through truly matters, but also that they'll be leading a completely different life very soon. It was something I told my brother constantly when he was still in high school and I had gone on to University and suddenly had to try and remember how hard high school had been. A note on technology: I feel very strongly about the use of technology in YA. It frustrates me to no end when a teenager \u201cleaves their phone at home\u201d or \u201cruns out of data\u201d or \u201cdoesn\u2019t think to text someone something time sensitive.\u201d It isn\u2019t the way that teenagers function, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, it ignores a huge part of the way that teenagers understand themselves and each other, and can you tell that I really care about it yet? John Green does the impossible here: he manages to include technology organically, to make it important to the story and to their lives, but without making it gimmicky. For that, I am also thankful.Finally, I am thankful for this representation of mental health. It is ugly, sad, disturbing, frustrating, but not hopeless. It isn\u2019t everything (even though sometimes it is) and it\u2019s honest. I am so happy, so unbelievably happy, that kids and teenagers and also adults will have this. That they will read it and feel understood, or empathize, or both. You know how we always want books to \u201cmake us better people\u201d? To \u201cshow us new perspectives we couldn\u2019t imagine\u201d? Pick up Turtles All The Way Down.Full disclosure: I read an early version of the book and worked with John Green and his editor, and my name is in the acknowledgments!

My mind can't really wrap around that. (Especially given where I was 5 years ago, not even knowing BookTube existed, now I can't imagine my life without BookTube and being Hailey in Bookland). But it was a pleasure to read his writing again. He is extremely talented. I was super nervous going into this admittedly. After the smash success of TFIOS I couldn't imagine a more high pressure situation. Especially as I haven't absolutely loved all of his novels, I just didn't know where this one would fall for me. But I'm so happy that I loved it. It's definitely my favourite YA book on mental illness that I've ever read. What sets JG apart and makes him, IMO, a pioneer in the YA genre, is the fact that he writes knowledgable teenage characters. He doesn't discount teenagers as unintelligent due to their developing brains. He recognizes that teenagers, IRL, are able to comprehend complex concepts. (This may seem obvious, but I read a book on writing books for young readers recently and it emphasizes the fact that you have to use the most simplistic language possible so young teenage minds can understand it. BS. Teenagers are not dumb). Because of this, his characters are so startlingly relatable. I think Aza is an especially relatable character for me with her struggles with anxiety. The way JG describes her experiences with anxiety spoke to me so intensely. Specifically the metaphor of the spiral. Blew my mind in all honesty. JG definitely has a talent for metaphors, I never get sick of it. He's always had a way of finding the perfect words to describe that which seems indescribable. Seeing him use this technique regarding mental illness was fascinating. I think if you do, or ever have, suffered from mental illness, you will vastly appreciate his narrative. I found this story to be very different than JG's other novels. Not in a bad way at all, but the plot was much more subtle. There are two plots happening simultaneously really, one internally and one externally. You think you're following the one and then it turns out the other is the central focus. The way the two were interwoven was genius. I think this has been written in a way that will appeal to both the next generation of YA readers as well as the aging generation of YA readers. Typically JG's novels have the romance as a main focal point, and they really are some of my favourite romances, but here the romance takes a back seat. The front seat is occupied by Aza's own personal mental health journey. It was such a nice change. (That's not to say there is no romance, it's there but it's just not the main topic).Overall, this made me SO happy that John Green is returning to the world of YA. It was the most authentic representation of mental illness I've ever read and I'm so glad I went in with an open mind. You can tell he is writing about something he's extremely familiar with. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next (I hope he has plans to write more!)"}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "Even though I just finished this book, I already know it's one that will stick with me for years to come.

His early work would suggest that he prefers warm places, but over the years he has slowly migrated to the Midwest.We can assume that this time it will be set on the sun, for the conditions are best for cultivating our feels, and destroying our hope.Next, we can examine the characters. They must be the perfect combination of witty, socially awkward, beautiful, and of course, burdened with a great amount of tragedy and overwrought with pain. I'm guessing ex-convict and clown. Good pairingThe plot is tricky, you see, for this varies greatly book to book. The spectrum is quite wide. I'm going to guess it'll be a complex story that weaves together the lives of the ex-convict who becomes the first great poet in years, and the young circus clown who keeps having dreams of the constellation Hercules. Yes, this sounds about right. I think they will need to save the world from llamas. And the romance. One mustn't forget the romance. All you really need to know is it will break your heart. So, if I have guessed correctly, this book will be about a past criminal mastermind and a clown, living on the sun.

Heck, I went into it pretty much expecting to dislike. And yes, I know that\u2019s a horrible thing to say, and a terrible reason to read a book, but come on, you can hardly blame me.I hated The Fault in Our Stars, with all of its extremely pretentious characters (although I did cry at the end, and actually liked the movie). I then left Looking for Alaska, halfway through after a friend spoiled the ending (thanks a lot, Megan!) I also couldn\u2019t get past chapter five of Paper Towns, (mostly because I had already seen the movie and hated Margo).So, Turtles All the Way Down, was me giving John Green one last shot. And you know what? I liked it. I actually, genuinely liked it.This book is classic John Green. You got the two teenagers from well to do families who sit around contemplating the meaning of the universe with all the knowledge and wisdom of college philosophy professors and the vocabulary of a SAT test book.And yet, in spite of all of these things, I actually enjoyed this one. Maybe because Aza and Davis didn\u2019t come across as annoyingly pretentious as Augustus and Hazel had.So, the story is about Aza, a girl dealing with spiraling thoughts that are entirely out of her control. She feels trapped and bullied by her mind as her anxiety takes over. And yet, she tries her best to be a good friend and daughter and to live the life she wishes she had.It\u2019s also about Davis, a billionaire boy with a missing father, who is trying his best to be a good influence for his 13-year-old brother.It\u2019s also about mental illness and family and friendship and falling in love. Really, it\u2019s about a lot of things, but more on that later.I think John Green does an excellent job at portraying Aza\u2019s illness and the way that thoughts can sometimes control a person. I know firsthand how hard it can be to deal with invasive thoughts. I know that sometimes the mind seems like a different entity from the self and John Green wonderfully showed all the thoughts going through her head. More so, he did it in a way that properly displayed mental illness.I liked the romance also, although at points it was a little too philosophical for my taste. I liked that love doesn\u2019t fix mental illness. I liked that the world goes on and good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. I also like the way that mental illness is portrayed as affecting not just the individual but also those around them. I loved seeing how family and friendships are tested and yet remain. Truly, I think that it was all brilliantly done and I must say, kudos to John Green because I could actually relate.So, why not a higher rating? Well, this book felt like it was trying too hard. It was too many things. It took a great story and stretched it out to the point that the plot seemed thin. It felt out of focus and it greatly diminished my liking of it.I think it could have had a greater emotional impact if it had focused on only one thing, either Aza and her troubles, or Davis and his missing father. It could either be a look into mental illness or a mystery. Or, it could be both if it were longer and found a way to combine the two. But, alas, it did not.Overall, I really enjoyed it and totally recommend.

To each their own and all that jazz - truly, I'm happy other people got something out of this book -but, in my opinion, for something to change my life - or at least remotely affect me in any way - it has to have at least some depth to it.And this book had about as much depth as the shallow end of the kiddie pool.

You're a you. You're a she, an it, a they. My kingdom for an I.\"I hate when I have a middle of the road review to write; I like to feel passionately about a book one way or another, and I almost feel it is easier to share my feelings on a book that is a 1-2 star than any of the 3 stars that come along. I feel at a loss for words to describe my experience while reading this book; I've seen multiple reviews state they felt Turtles All the Way Down wasn't even on the same level as The Fault in Our Stars, and I have to agree. While this wasn't a BAD story per se, it didn't feel up to the John Green standard we've come to expect. Multiple times I was stopped by randoms at the gym asking how it was, because it was on their wish list, and I could never muster anything more than \"This book is fine. Fine is what it is. It is not great, but it is fine\" and I felt guilty for that. For such a short book with big font and little chapters and lots of spacing between lines, this book sure was slow in the first half. I believe he was going for atmospheric, but when I think of setting the tone in a slow building way, I think of descriptive writing that can be filled with prose or not, but definitely something that draws me in and makes me feel a part of the story, and that's not what happens here. The narrative is very jerky and disjointed, and it took awhile for my brain to become engaged enough to care what was happening. I think the premise of this book, minus the billionaire side story (but I'll get to that in a minute), was excellent. I love YA books featuring mental health issues and illnesses and this was by far the strongest aspect of the plot. I didn't find Aza likable in the beginning, but I feel that was the point so that we could form a connection with her as she grows and becomes aware of herself in new ways. Honestly, I really could have done without the awkward side story of Davis and Noah's missing father. I didn't feel it added to the story; actually, I felt it took away from some of the more important factors since it stole coverage where those pages could have been used to further the main focus. I couldn't help but wonder what felt off, and I think it came down to a rushed characterization of Davis, Aza, and their relationship. It almost felt as if chunks of the story were missing and we were just supposed to fill it in our own way. I would have liked a little more development, but that's just me. I did feel the ending was another strong point; it was messy, uncomfortable, and slightly disturbing, but added a gleaming spark of hope and a viewpoint of recovery for those struggling with various mental health issues and disorders. Please don't toss this book aside and chose not to read it just because it didn't wow me; I think it has some very valuable insight into a very tough subject that is still taboo in 2017. There are plenty of 5 star reviews that are much better than mine and I hope you enjoy it more fully than I did. Maybe I'm getting too old for this type of YA contemporary or maybe I'm just out of touch with how teenagers behave and converse, so I think I'll just say that it was fine, but the over hyping of this book pre-production may have done more harm than good for the die hard fans."}, {"userName": "Warda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30036082-warda", "userReview": "Edit: Well, I cannot stop thinking about this book, and it's been a few weeks, so that deserves me upping my rating to 5 stars.

Hard to read (trigger warnings for OCD and anxiety), but Jesus, did it feel healing at the same time. John Green wrote the shit out of this book. The way mental health was portrayed through Aza was excruciating, harrowing and educational to read about and it still made me feel that though the stigma might have lessened a bit, the understanding of this subject is narrow. I felt this book to my core. I was there with Aza when she was spiralling out of control, her mind constantly pulling her in different directions, finding no centre, the constant doubt hurling you further into finding no fixed point, so that you may breathe and focus.I've so much admiration for Green for writing so openly in this book. It was so raw and bleak and the ugly side of mental health truly came to live, because that's how it is and what it can manifest into.

I've read his previous works and, even if I didn't completely despise them, the whole JG phenomenon never really felt to me like a complete mind-blowing experience that I absolutely had to be part of.Then why does this book changes the entire game, you might ask? Well, first of all, there was a lot to relate to. And I'm not only talking about all those pop-culture references and the exquisitely colloquial writings. I mean, yes, they're quite necessary if you look at it from a certain angle, and they serve their filling purpose greatly, but it's something else, really. As simple as it sounds, I found myself utterly and painfully represented by the issues this book portraits, and I couldn't help but see my own fight against the same angsty and suffocating thoughts the main character, Aza, has to struggle with on a daily basis, as well.It's really something that doesn't happen everyday. Aza is a complex and damaged character, one of those charries I usually am drawn to, only this time it was because her character sometimes appeared very adult-coded, so it was a case of mutual and shared vision of life. Through the pages, you get to see her journey, in and outside her head, and, I don't know if it's just me being me, but some of the things she does and says are things I thought I was the only one doing. Talk about relatable MC's! I like her, so so so so much. Green's characters once again fall a bit on the clich\u00e9 side, but I got to give it to him. When they start throwing tantrums, I don't blame them, because they're young and immature, just like they should be. And when they learn from their mistakes, is even better. Aza's mum is probably the purest character I've seen in years. She's adorable. I respect the shit out of that woman, I admire her for being so strong and for keeping herself together for her daughter's sake even when things are shitty. She's a good mum and a good role model. Love interests aren't usually a problem for me, except for when they become love-interests-period. This time around, it was Davis' turn and, I've got to say it, I adore the guy. Just like Aza, he's walking a wire, with one foot dangling from the edge of the darker side, constrantly fighting to live up to a family name he didn't choose himself. And he's so... Likeable, you know? At least for me. I mean, he's got this whole Gansey thing going on (cute and nerdy rich boy, wears khakis and polo shirts, has a frigging diary) and he loves poetry. No, let me rephrase that: he loves and writes poetry. *sticks gold star on davis forehead*Back to us...So, reason #3 this book is the best I've read this month: the plot is so blunt and easy to follow, that it flows perfectly with whatever mood you might be in that moment. Sure, it's not the thriller of the year nor the best contemporary that deals with heavy themes, but if you put all the elements together and follow the recipe step by step, you're in for an adventure.The quotes sprinkled all over the book, in a certified Green fashion, the very same quotes I've always found a bit pretentious in the other books, add a sense of poetry (as if there was little of it already! *puts another gold star on davis forehead*), a sense of being known. The romance is light but at the same time very intense. It's not even that much eye-rolling, if you know what I mean. Some Davis/Aza scenes really left me out of breath, not gonna lie, but I really did like Aza and Daisy's interactions just as much. I speak from personal experience when I say it's not easy being friends with people who have social anxiety and/or ocd (especially since they, we, take a little more than others to open up to people and let them in), so I appreciate the author's effort of showing how relationships and dynamics can work out with a little help from both sides. And it's not always sunshine and rainbows, that be clear.

They are totally rich and their father is missing. So this is about finding each other and finding a missing father. A few other things thrown into the mix.

You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something, but you are also your you.\u201dI went into this with a bowl full of low expectations but with a side of high expectations. And it tasted good.It's been a while since John wrote a book. The first John Green book I ever read was TFIOS, which I loved. During the time that passed until the release of Turtles All the Way Down I caught up with most of his other books, apart from An Abundance of Katherines. Will Grayson, Will Grayson was meh but Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska straight up sucked. It made sense that I was torn wether I wanted to read TALWD or not. But I'm glad I did.The plot wasn't all the exciting. I saw lots of people complain about an absence of plot, but some stories are more character-driven than others, as in this case. Apart from this there were lots of subplots that I loved - Daisy's relationship with Mychal for once, or the disappearance of Pickett Senior.The characters were fantastic. First and foremost there is Aza, a teenage girl battling with anxiety. While she did not say much, I enjoyed her narratorial point of view. She was a fleshed out character with lots of depth, which is such an improvement to John's previous main characters that were part boring and part even more boring. Now, I don't struggle with an axienty disorder. I can't possibly judge this novel from that perspective because I never experienced anything similar to what Aza struggles with on a daily basis. But this book managed to make me feel what a person with an anxiety disorder might possibly have to go through - so much that I could only skim the parts where the main character's anxiety surfaces and takes over all her thoughts and actions. With Daisy, Aza's best friend, it was love at first sight. This girl is precious. I loved everything about her.I never warmed up Davis, Aza's love interest, if that is what you want to call him. I don't think that I fully got him and I'm not entirely sure why Aza was drawn to him. On one hand, their relationship lacked romance, on the other hand I'm glad that this was not one big love story. It would not have fit into the story.Overall I simply liked this novel. Money was one of the story's central themes, and while I'm both uncomfortable with and in awe of this unfathomable wealth depicted in it, I also deeply connected with Daisy, when she talked about what being poor can be like. Of course, wealth and poverty are extremely subjective topics and people hate to talk about money, but I think John Green managed to find a good balance.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Nat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-nat", "userReview": "\u201cIf only I were as good at life as I am at the internet.\u201dI was so overly eager for any new John Green book related content\u00a0that I made the mistake of reading the excerpt shared on Buzzfeed last month. I say mistake because when I opened up the book weeks after having read the first two chapters, I only had this vague recollection that certainly wouldn't help to continue from where I'd started. Rereading was key.To give you a bit more background on why I was so eager: Back in 2014, John Green was one of the first authors I'd read that introduced me to the magic of books. I owe a lot to his writing that sucked me in so completely, only to leave me craving for more by the last page, which then led me to look up what next book would satisfy that particular hunger. And here we are today.Despite all the above, I still went into\u00a0Turtles All the Way Down with little to no expectations as to what was to come. I knew that though I had history with TFIOS, when I look back on certain scenes, I can't help but feel shivers of disgust (like when the \"two very privileged caucasian Americans who have never known starvation, genocide, or physical abuse\" kissed in the Anne Frank house, which\u00a0Ariane tells like it is in this article).\u00a0So if anything, I was apprehensive as to what this newest work would contain.It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward.\u00a0Turtles All the Way Down\u00a0is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.I feel like the only way I can accurately describe the heart of the book is by borrowing this phrase:\u00a0Captures the everyday moments of teens' lives and then sets fire to those moments, heightening them until they become metaphor.\u201cTrue terror isn\u2019t being scared; it\u2019s not having a choice in the matter.\u201dI have so much my mind is eager to spit out, so I think a list is in order (mild spoilers ahead):\u2022 Let's start with Aza, who surprised me so much with her strong will and great depth of character. Her thought process and spirals gave me a keen insight into the works of the mind and expanding my view on things. What I wasn't expecting, however, was having my own thoughts staring back at me from the page. From\u00a0staring down the rabbit hole that is social media stalking your crush (#exposed), to vocalizing my exact fears on the reality of dating:\u201cI\u2019m really not looking to date anyone.\u201d I know people often say that when secretly looking for a romantic partner, but I meant it. I definitely felt attracted to some people, and I liked the idea of being with someone, but the actual mechanics of it didn\u2019t much suit my talents. Like, parts of typical romantic relationships that made me anxious included 1. Kissing; 2. Having to say the right things to avoid hurt feelings; 3. Saying more wrong things while trying to apologize; 4. Being at a movie theater together and feeling obligated to hold hands even after your hands become sweaty and the sweat starts mixing together; and 5. The part where they say, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d And they want you to be, like, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you, darling,\u201d but you\u2019re actually thinking about how cows literally could not survive if it weren\u2019t for the bacteria in their guts, and how that sort of means that cows do not exist as independent life-forms, but that\u2019s not really something you can say out loud, so you\u2019re ultimately forced to choose between lying and seeming weird.\u201d\u2022 Green\u2019s style has grown and matured a lot for me with his newest work.\u00a0It\u2019s equal parts dark, hilarious, and achingly real. Plus, the dialogue is amazing. Speaking of the latter, the main reason why is thanks to the effervescent Daisy, who's a force to be reckoned with,\u00a0from writing her own\u00a0Rey/ Chewbacca fanfiction to her inspiring directness.\u201cHave you ever gotten a dick pic?\u201d she asked in lieu of saying hello.I feel like she and Ilana Wexler would get along perfectly. Actually, I've never been surer of something.\u201cI mean, how am I supposed to react to a semi-erect penis as fan mail? Am I supposed to feel intrigued?\u201d\u201cHe probably thinks it\u2019ll end in marriage. You\u2019ll meet IRL and fall in love and someday tell your kids that it all started with a picture of a disembodied penis.\u201d\nJohn Green isn\u2019t afraid to let loose with his newest work. And I\u2019m digging it.\u2022 Speaking of which, the direction the author took with Aza's mental illness\u00a0felt like the most honest portrayal I'd read in ages.\u201cI wanted to tell her that I was getting better, because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over, or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past tense.\u201d...\u201cI would always be like this, always have this within me. There was no beating it. I would never slay the dragon, because the dragon was also me. My self and the disease were knotted together for life.\u201d\u2022 I got educated on such a\u00a0vast array of topics, without ever feeling like I was lectured. The random history and science lessons really give away who the author of this novel is. From the history of Indianapolis (the setting of the book), to the genetically distinct creature called tuatara, to\u00a0this weird parasite called Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. I can't deny how utterly fascinating John Green made all of his swift lessons.\u201cWhat I love about science is that as you learn, you don\u2019t really get answers. You just get better questions.\u201d\u2022 The bits of romance\u00a0seemed slightly off-kilter with the flow of the story at first, but it\u00a0just so happened that I was in the rare mood for a budding romance to indulge in. Actually, it turned out to be quite nice, since it first and foremost focused on two teens taking comfort in talking with someone that gets them\u00a0to a whole new level.\u201cIn the best conversations, you don\u2019t even remember what you talked about, only how it felt.\u201d\u2022 The fact that we get to read inserts from Davis's blog post & poetry\u00a0entries, and Daisy's successful fanfiction.\u00a0The particular Davis piece below rang in my ear for a very long time.\u201cThe next one stopped me cold:\n\u201cThe greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.\u201d\n\n\u2014WILLIAM JAMES\n\nI don\u2019t know what superpower William James enjoyed, but I can no more choose my thoughts than choose my name.\nThe way he talked about thoughts was the way I experienced them\u2014not as a choice but as a destiny. Not a catalog of my consciousness, but a refutation of it.When I was little, I used to tell Mom about my invasives, and she would always say, \u201cJust don\u2019t think about that stuff, Aza.\u201d But Davis got it. You can\u2019t choose. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u2022 On a totally separate note, I couldn't help but think of\u00a0Richard Campbell Gansey III from The Raven Boys when Davis was first introduced, thanks to his obscene amount of family money.\u201cYou mean, when a movie comes out in theaters, it\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. also comes out at your house?\u201dI never thought we\u2019d have someone upstage Gansey... And yet here we are.\u2022 But what came quite unexpectedly was how connected I felt to Noah, who's the 13-year-old brother. We see him truly struggle with the fact that his dad up-and-left with no clue of his whereabouts. But what hit most was the fact that Noah had no one to cry out to. Davis is barely getting by on his own, so his younger brother has to figure things out mainly by himself. And reading that just took a piece right off me.\u201cIt\u2019s all right to be scared, Noah.\u201d And then he turned his face away from me and started sobbing. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I told him, lying. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. He\u2019ll come home.\u201d\nThough the premise is set to be about making\u00a0\u201cconnections that crack open the long-dormant case of Russell Pickett\u2019s disappearance,\u201d\u00a0Turtles All the Way Down is at its core a character-driven novel, favoring the development of the characters' relationships with one another, which is how I like 'em. All this to say:\u00a0I'm beyond eager to see what Green has next in store for us.\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.\n3.5 stars. I haven't been the biggest fan of John Green's stories in the past because I found the characters to be too unrelatable. Like they were just trying too hard at times? But Aza's character felt super realistic and I am so impressed right now. This was honestly one of the best depictions of anxiety or any mental health battle I've ever read. It didn't sound like someone trying to write the concept... John Green has clearly lived this. It was incredibly raw, honest, and beautiful at times.I think everyone will relate to this on some level because the story grapples with the types of realizations we all face while growing up (so it's kind of reassuring that we're not alone in those thoughts). Aza spends a lot of time examining to what extent we author our lives and what our definition of \"self\" involves. But then she gets stuck in obsessive, infinitely tightening thought spirals that are SO well depicted.\n\"It's getting sucked into a whirlpool that shrinks and shrinks and shrinks your world until you're just spinning without moving, stuck inside a prison cell that is exactly the size of you, until eventually you realize that you're not actually in a prison cell. You are the prison cell.\"\n\n\"True terror isn't being scared; it's not having a choice in the matter.\"\nJohn Green articulated so many situations and struggles incredibly well. And even though he had his characters muse over how there aren't really ways in English to describe the pain or struggle, he somehow managed to convey it quite vividly. The book did feel like more of a character study at times, though. The story itself wasn't particularly gripping and I wasn't really that interested in whatever was happening outside of Aza's thoughts. I think it just tried to cover too many different potential plots in less than 300 pages. But the mental health aspect more than made this worth the read! Everything Ava pondered worked together really well to have a larger impact (especially the bits on different parasitic thoughts/beings). I was grateful that the book didn't talk down to the audience OR get too pretentious while covering some of the fascinating strings of thought. The philosophical conversations were one of my favorite parts because they felt so natural. And the way that the typical \"turtles all the way down\" imagery fit into this particular story was really neat. I also liked how the book's tone could've easily gotten bleak or tried to put some hollow positive spin on everything, but instead did a great job tackling everything head on in a way that felt really authentic. I am SO glad that this wasn't some cure narrative where Aza gets into a relationship and starts going about life after she's \"better.\" She's just living realistically.\n\"...nothing in this world is deserved except for love, that love is both how you become a person, and why.\"\nSo this wasn't the typical John Green romance with quirky teens, but that ended up being a refreshing change for me. And even though I wasn't terribly into the overall story as a whole, I still really appreciated the depiction of Aza's mental health. Obviously everyone's personal experience is different (so it's not necessarily \"wrong\" if it doesn't speak for you), but I do think this will resonate with a lot of readers!!"}, {"userName": "Sara\u27bd (Ink Is My Sword)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28146945-sara-ink-is-my-sword", "userReview": "1.5 \u201cJohn Green is definitely a miss for me\u201d Stars\n\u201cReading someone\u2019s poetry is like seeing them naked\u201d\n UHU.

My problem was feeling. I thought I would feel, I couldn't. JG fans please don't throw tomatoes at me. Although if you throw them with parmesan cheese or mozzarella cheese, I may, just may be okay with it. Do I think everyone will hate this book? Hell, no.I for sure know many people will be able to relate and enjoy this book. So don\u2019t feel discouraged to pick this up if you want to. There was nothing wrong, yet everything was wrong for me as a reader.Do I recommend it? Yes, if you are a usual JG fan and if you are interested in reading more OCD representation. OCD representation, yes hell yes, I am glad his book exists. Many people could relate, many had this book piercing their heart, so yes I currently think what the hell is wrong with me. I have the theory that I am a robot. So if you have a solution for me please send it my way.Mr. Green can definitely write and he obviously is very well received by the audiences, if not how will he be a bestseller author, two movies produced based on his books already, heck they are probably even producing this one while I am writing this review. I don\u2019t think there is anything atrocious, I just can\u2019t connect and I feel very much bored while reading his stories. My only exception has been The Fault In Our Stars and his history youtube channel, he has seriously saved me some grades. But anyways let\u2019s not make this personal.Plot?Not consistent. It felt like a random stuff put together, finally distracting you from the actual point. I mean this would have been best if we were totally focused on the mental health aspect of the story, but suddenly this bounty hunter stuff was thrown at us, and it didn\u2019t even have a worthy climax or anything. It felt dull.Characters? Couldn\u2019t connect with anybody. As a teenager, I always end up with the sensation that I am reading adults (like not only in this book, but pretty much everything John Green has written), and it bothers me.Aza: I think people who have OCD could relate a lot to her and this whole book, I just couldn\u2019t. But for that, I give 1,000 kudos, the representation a mental illness, but this just doesn't mean I loved this book. I really wanted more than just Aza\u2019s perspective because I felt I couldn\u2019t get anything from the book. Maybe this was the intention, but I basically hated it, because it felt like there was nothing going on or important to remember. She also made me realize I am really getting tired of the whole \u201cpsychologist suck they are just pricks who fake listening to us\u201d because fuck I am freaking tired of all YA books not having good mental health help. Davis: Why did he even exist? I mean I felt he was the manic pixie dream character we always found in John Green\u2019s characters. I liked he liked poetry, that\u2019s about it. I honestly couldn\u2019t even feel sorry for him and his dad plot. Yes, I have an ice heart. Daisy: Mmmmm\u2026. How can I say this? Oh yeah, I didn\u2019t like her. Again, she just was a terrible friend? As bad as Aza was to her, the fanfic part was too low my dear. Also, I haven\u2019t watch star wars I don\u2019t plan to watch it ever, and I was not the even minimum interested in her freaking Chubaka stories. Relationship? Why did it exist? H-O-N-E-S-T-L-Y. Please, someone, explain to me. There wasn\u2019t even palpable attraction to start with, I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even have words because there is basically nothing to talk about. Writing? Yeah some cool quotes, but I don\u2019t emotionally connect, I felt bored.I really struggled, 258 pages felt like 1576868 pages. To not make this review completely negative here are some quotes I will keep.  Just know I still regret physically highlighting this book, I want my money back, sigh. If the books were just this quotes it would have probably been 5 stars. \u201cBut I was beginning to learn that your life is a story told.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a weird phrase in English, in love, like it\u2019s a sea you drown in or a town you live in. You don\u2019t get to be anything else-in friendship or in anger or in hope. All you can be is in love.\u201d\u201cI wanted to tell her that I was getting better because that was supposed to be the narrative of the illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past.\u201d\u201cAnd we\u2019re such language-based creatures that to some extent we cannot know what we cannot name. And so we assume it isn\u2019t real. We refer to it with catch-all terms, like crazy or chronic pain, terms that both ostracize and minimize. The term chronic pain captures nothing of the grinding, constant, ceaseless, inescapable hurt. And the term crazy arrives at us with none of the terror or worry you live with. Nor do either of those terms connote the courage people in such pains exemplify, which is why I\u2019d ask you to frame your mental health around a word other than crazy.\u201dThis book may have worked if my mental health was horrible, which I don't even know it means something good."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "From the outside looking in, Aza seems to have it all. She's smart and sensitive, and she tries hard to be a good daughter, a good student, and a good friend. But life for Aza isn't what it appears: she struggles every day with invasive thoughts, thoughts which at times leave her unable to focus on nothing but the fear and anxiety they cause.\"It's so weird, to know you're crazy and not be able to do anything about it, you know? It's not like you believe yourself to be normal. You know there is a problem. But you can't figure a way through to fixing it. Because you can't be sure, you know?\"When Aza and her best friend Daisy learn about the disappearance of the town's notorious billionaire, Russell Pickett, the father of one of Aza's childhood friends, they are intrigued by the mystery. And when Daisy learns that there is a $100,000 reward for information leading to Pickett's capture, she convinces Aza to help her investigate. While Aza honestly doesn't care about the money, she's doesn't mind that she gets to be reunited with Davis Pickett, on whom she had a crush when she was younger.As Davis and Aza grow closer, both struggle with questions about the meaning of life and the true nature of existence. Aza tries to help Davis deal with his feelings of abandonment, whether he even wants his father to return, and what it will mean for him and his younger brother, Noah, since their mother died several years earlier. Davis tries to help Aza by understanding the intensity of her thought spirals, and helping her have the type of relationship she can handle, but as her problems deepen, no one can provide her any comfort.\nTurtles All the Way Down\n is an unblinking look at living with mental illness. There's no candy-coating Aza's feelings, and how helpless and frustrating her illness is for her family and friends. It's also a poignant look at just how much we need love, friendship, acceptance, and understanding, and how debilitating it can be to try and understand the challenges that life throws at us.There's a point in the book when Daisy tells Aza that someone once said she was like mustard, \"great in small quantities, but then a lot of you is...a lot.\" To be honest, while I believe this is an important book, I found it was a little like mustard, and almost relentless. In his quest to give readers a you-are-there feeling where mental illness is concerned, I felt as if John Green sacrificed the book's humor and much of its heart. While Aza and Davis are fascinating characters, I found Daisy tremendously unlikable, while many of the other characters aren't well drawn.As always, Green's teenage characters are wiser and more erudite than most adults. But that aside, he really shows his storytelling skills when describing Aza's anxiety. Here this paragraph, for example:\"I don't know, like, I'll be at the cafeteria and I'll start thinking about how, like, there are all these things living inside of me that eat my food for me, and how I sort of am them, in a way\u2014like, I'm not a human person as much as this disgusting, teeming blob of bacteria, and there's not really any getting myself clean, you know, because the dirtiness goes all the way through me. Like, I can't find the deep down part of me that's pure or unsullied or whatever, the part of me where my soul is supposed to be.

I devoured it in under a day! I couldn't leave it down even though I had studying to do. I was there, with Aza, feeling what she was feeling, understanding even though I don't suffer from it, wanting to \"heal\" her even though I know I couldn't. This book was so deep (too deep for teenagers but that's John Green for ya) and it entailed so many excellent quotes that cut deep into me. The other characters were brilliant, too (even though Daisy just pissed me off at times), the Star Wars references were cute, being a SW nerd myself, I relate (even though the Rey x Chewbacca parts were sort of weird) and I think he did his research a lot for this book. 6 years is a lot of time and he really produced amazing work out of them.I'm so looking forward to the movie I heard that is coming out, (a John Green book not becoming a movie would be a first) I hope they do it justice. It was the first of his books I read before the movie comes out not because of the movie so I'm really curious to see what their angle will be about it.ANYWAY, I'LL PROBABLY BE THINKING ABOUT THIS BOOK FOR A WHILE SO K BYE!"}, {"userName": "\u2728    jamieson   \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706640-jamieson", "userReview": "\u201cIt's turtles all the way fucking down, Holmesy. You're trying to find the turtle at the bottom of the pile, but that's not how it works.\"\"Because it's turtles all the way down,\" I said again, feeling something akin to a spiritual revelation.\u201d \nmy relationship with john green is hit and miss and whether our relationship would end or continue all hinged on this book. folks, I'm pleased to say he's not cancelled yet. Honestly, this book almost didn't feel like John Green. It does have staple John Green aspects, but at the same time it's very thoughtful, very cohesive, and overall feels more mature. I don't know what's changed between this book and TFIOS, but I really enjoyed the John Green we get in this book. Don't get me wrong: there's still a ridiculous amount of metaphor, simple, hyperbole, analogies, symbolism ect. I just think I happen to like those things. And metaphor is actually one of the only ways to describe what having a mental illness FEELS like. Turtles All the Way Down follows Aza Holmes, a 16 year old girl who's thrown into the investigation to find a missing billionaire, and is also trying to deal with her OCD. The billionaire plot kind of takes a backseat to the character work - this mostly focusses on Aza's mental health and her struggle with it. the representation was both the hardest and best thing about this book strong content warnings for this book because some things were kinda triggering, but at the same time the OCD rep is done .. really well. This is ownvoices representation and I think it's pretty clear how much John Green has put into putting forth an authentic and honest book about mental illness. John Green explores stigmatisation of MI, how it can become hard to balance your MI with your relationships, and the feeling of hopelessness when you're dealing with a mental illness that is spiralling out and out of control. I think it was great to see therapy, a positive discussion about medication and also the debunking of the \"mentally ill people make better artists\" trope thing (which sucks)\n\u201cThoughts are only thoughts. They are not you, you belong to yourself even when your thoughts don't.\u201d \nI also liked the subplots: the romance was nice, and I liked the discussions about privilege/wealth that came up. My favourite subplot was the disappearance of Davies Pickett Senior and how it was affecting his family. Even though this was character driven i liked how these plots played into the story, and I also liked that it was happening and didn't leave Aza as the \"character who IS their MI\" character. I also just liked how teenage-ery this was. I mean, Aza's best friend Daisy writes shippy Rey/Chewbaccaa star wars fanfiction on AO3 ? And also there's a line that literally says \"he's probably some loser kylo ren stan\" that's fucking hilarious and authentically teen. I really just enjoyed that there was so much fanfiction in this book.\n\u201cThe thing about a spiral is, if you follow it inward, it never actually ends. It just keeps tightening, infinitely.\u201d \nI just .. really thought this was nice. I thought it was well done. The representation is so so important. Like, guys we don't get good authentic MI rep like this that often. I really enjoyed the characters, I liked the writing and there was some lines and bits I really related to (after a good conversation you don't remember what you talked about, only how it made you feel being one of my favourites)There was also just ... none of the JG nonsense I didn't want. There was no dramatic romance with a nerd boy desperately trying to attain the girl. It was just .. good. I really enjoyed it so much more than I was expecting and I am going to gladly pick up more of this books in the future. YAY. \n\u201cYou're both the fire and the water that extinguishes it. You're the narrator, the protagonist, and the sidekick. You're the storyteller and the story told.

I also liked Aza\u2019s mom and the Davis story-line, even though it wasn\u2019t the focus. Aza\u2019s story was one that made me think, made me feel, and spoke to me. And it\u2019s one of the first John Green books that didn\u2019t make me cry LOL! I listened to the audio version and enjoyed the narration. Once again, Green writes an unforgettable story with a fantastically flawed leading character.
