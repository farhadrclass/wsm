If you've read anything at all about Ford, you know that his grandfather was Chinese. I love that he honors his heritage with his stories. But his stories are more than sweet love stories and tributes to his background; they are stories of substance. They reflect the history and society of the times of which he writes. Prejudice, the importance of identity, fitting in, what family means, no matter how unconventional it may be at times. I wanted to read his latest book because I was so taken with his storytelling in his first two novels. I also remember reading or hearing an interview with Ford who talked about the seed for this story - the image of an orphan up for raffle at the 1909 world's fair in Seattle , the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition . If you check it out, you'll find that an infant named Ernest was indeed on raffle and Ford has imagined what the life of this child would be like after he, the prize is redeemed. Ernest in the novel is not an infant, but a young boy. The novel begins in 1962 as Ernest is dealing with his wife's memory loss. The story moves seamlessly back and forth from the present to his past telling the story of how he and Gracie met. Ford has a way of taking you directly to where his characters are both in the time and place as well as easily connecting the reader with where there are emotionally. I felt as if I stepped inside the bowels of that ship with Yung in 1902 before he became Ernest, tasted the candy apple at the fair, and walked with him inside the parlor of The Temderloin brothel, feeling his grief as his mother gives him away not out of selfishness but out of love, and understanding his dilemma over the two girls he loves. After arriving in the US , Ernest goes from being an orphan, sponsored in a private school to a house boy at a brothel, taken in by the Madame who won him in the raffle. You might not think a brothel is the best place for a young boy to be raised in, but for Ernest it's the best thing that could have happened to him after his harrowing young life when he was Yung and starving in China, before he became Ernest. It's here that he gets the safety and comfort that he hadn't known and here where he meets people who will change your definition of family and where his life changes . A benevolent Madam, the \"Gibson Girls\" of the house , a scullery maid who was the Japanese girl that Ernest met on the ship , Maisie , the secret daughter of Madame Flora and a cast of likable characters are part of Ernest's early story. Definitely recommended for fans of Jamie Ford's previous novels and to anyone who wants a glimpse of past times depicted by some wonderful characters I came to care about.I received an advanced copy of this book from Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "\"'My theory,' Maisie said, 'is that the best, worst, happiest, saddest, scariest, and most memorable moments are all connected. Those are the important times, good and bad. The rest is just filler.'\"For Ernest Young, born Yung Kun-ai in China just before the start of the 20th century, some of the worst and saddest moments in his life came at a very young age. At five years old, the illegitimate son of a white missionary and a Chinese woman, he and his mother know abject poverty, which causes his mother to make two heartbreaking decisions, one of which is sending him away to America, ostensibly so he can find a better life.While he is lucky to survive the overseas journey, his life when he arrives in America isn't much better, as he is bounced from place to place, with no true companionship and no one to give him affection, and he is ridiculed by his appearance because of his mixed cultural background. At 12 years old, Ernest Young (as he is now called) is a charity student at a boarding school in Seattle, treated with general disregard by a wealthy patron who pays for his education. He longs for more opportunities, to get more out of life.His patron brings him to the 1909 World's Fair, and tells him the next step in his life: he will be the prize in a raffle at the fair, and the winner will take him \"to a good home.\" To the surprise of everyone, including Ernest's moral-crusading patron, the winner of the raffle is Madam Flora, the savvy, flamboyant madam of a high-class brothel. Madam Flora is known for making sure her \"girls\" are not only beautiful but well-educated and sophisticated; she calls them her \"Gibson girls.\" Flora has had her heart set on a houseboy, and she knows Ernest will fit the bill.Ernest becomes friends with Fahn, an outspoken housemaid with whom he has a previous connection, and Maisie, Flora's headstrong daughter, and little by little, finds himself smitten with both young women. As strange as it may seem given the setting, for the first time, Ernest feels at home, feels part of a family. But when Madam Flora's job-related illness becomes too much to bear, it threatens to ruin the lives of all who live in the brothel, and sets Ernest, Fahn, and Maisie on different courses which might separate them.Fifty years later, as the World's Fair returns to Seattle, Ernest is caught up in the memories of his childhood when his daughter hears the story of him being offered as a raffle prize. For Ernest, these memories are bittersweet, particularly as he tries to help his ailing wife deal with her own memories, and ensure his children are protected from the ultimate truths of their parents' lives.It's funny, but when I'm trying to think of an author to read, I always forget Jamie Ford, yet every time I read one of his books, like the exceptional \nHotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\n, I wonder why he slips my mind. Perhaps it's because his writing seems so effortless, and he so easily is able to pull me into his stories and fascinate me with his characters.While I wasn't as emotionally wrecked by \nLove and Other Consolation Prizes\n, I still enjoyed it a great deal. Even though you as a reader know more about the plot than the characters do, there were still a few surprises Ford threw in. I did wish the plot was a little more linear, because I found the shift between past and present a little jarring occasionally, and I felt things moved at a slower pace than I would have liked. But these characters and their story is a beautiful, heartfelt one (made all the more emotional when you learn it is based on a true story), and there are some emotional moments worth savoring.This is a book about overcoming struggles, the difficulties in following your heart, and what it feels like to finally belong somewhere, with people you care about who care about you, after never believing that could be true. If you enjoy historical fiction that doesn't feel historical, or you just like well-written stories, pick up \nLove and Other Consolation Prizes\n. It's a story you'll keep thinking about.

For the longest time we don't know the identity of his Gracie, which if either of the young girls would become his wife.I love how this author puts his stories together, mixing historical happenings with some great characters, and yes even a love story, though far from a typical one. He shows us the good and bad, the ugly and beautiful in human nature. Treats his characters, regardless of their stature in life, with the utmost tenderness. His stories are heartfelt, wonderful, and yes, a little sentimental, but he shows us that as long as there is hope, true feelings can prevail.

NOW AVAILABLE !!In 1909, Seattle was the time and place for the Alaskan-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. It brought more welcomed exposure of the area, a relatively unpopulated area still, following the 1905 Alaskan gold rush, and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland. For Seattle, 1909 was a chance to have the attention of the world on their city. \n\u201cLove and Other Consolation Prizes\n was inspired by the true story of an infant boy who was raffled off at the 1909 Seattle World\u2019s Fair, as a prize, by the \u201cWashington Children\u2019s Home Society.\u201d Surrounded by miracles of modern science such as a wireless telephone; a machine for butchering salmon; incubators holding premature babies \u2013 a human child, Ernest, was auctioned off. In Jamie Ford\u2019s story, the boy that is raffled off is a half-Chinese, half-American twelve year-old boy, Ernest is the name given to him on his arrival, but in China he was Yung Kun-ai. He\u2019s been living at the Home for a while, a charity student, and believes that this chance to attend the World\u2019s Fair is a dream come true, until he realizes that he is the child to be given to the one with the winning raffle ticket. Before he has a chance to process this betrayal, he is working at a brothel, one with a madam who believes in educating her girls. He is to be their houseboy. Maisie, the daughter of Madam Flora, befriends him, as does Fahn, a scullery maid. Both vie for his affection, but his heart belongs to both \u2013 he can\u2019t choose, will not choose. Or, as someone in my family used to say, he \u201cwilln\u2019t\u201d choose.In 1962 Seattle, Ernest\u2019s daughter is trying to capture the eye of her editor with a story about the opening of Seattle\u2019s new World\u2019s Fair, merging the \u201cthen\u201d of the 1909 expo and some of the life experiences of those who attended the opening of the expo, against the opening of the new fair. Knowing her father had been there, the questions begin.Judgements, innocence, devotion, love, losing those we love, as well as the loss of memories are at the heart of this novel. I loved the historic details, from the seedy tenderloin district to the hallowed halls of the Library; this was a world I disappeared into, even if it wasn\u2019t all glitter and glam. I loved these characters, from the uppity judgemental Mothers of Virtue to the sassy Fahn, these characters felt so real, it was easy to get swept away into this story, to care about these people, and to read their stories about the cost of real love, and the cost of love bought and sold on the streets. Those roads not taken, not chosen. One small moment in time that completely change the trajectory of one small life, but what a life!

I've always been drawn to stories involving orphans and their unique perspectives on life. One of the settings is the World's Fair in Seattle and I can't resist anything involving ferris wheels and space needles! Ernest Young clings to his mother's hairpin, the only remnant he has to remind him of his mother who has given him away. He endures a horrific boat ride to America where he finds himself bounced from the poor house to a boarding school and eventually \"the prize\" in a raffle at the World's Fair. It sounds so sad and it is, but Ernest is someone who makes lemonade out of lemons (and he has plenty of lemons). He only twelve years old, when he realizes that once again his life is in jeopardy as the winning raffle ticket number is called out at the fair. He had lost hope in being adopted long ago and felt he wasn't Chinese or White enough to be wanted by either group. He is told \"the raffle winner is taking you home with them.\"This is a wonderful story involving loss, morality, self-identity and survival.

In 1962, the World's Fair is in Seattle. Earnest, in his mid 60s, is looking back on his life. His wife is suffering from a rare form of dementia. Like Ford\u2019s other books, this one focuses on Americans of Chinese descent and employs a back and forth narrative between two different times. Ford draws you into his story immediately. It's always a bit of a shock what was considered acceptable in the old days. Raffling off a child at the 1909 World\u2019s Fair with the President pulling the winning ticket? No problem. And in case you doubt it could really happen, this episode is based on a true story. Ford definitely has a gift. He manages to combine a winning story with amazing characters. This story describes how a family can be formed anywhere and love does triumph. Ford describes how limited the choices are for those in the Tenderloin and how necessity makes it easy to trump virtue. As Earnest says \u201che was caught up in the blatant, unrepentant honesty of the Tenderloin- as naked and bare as the girls upstairs\u201d. Ford tugs at your heartstrings. Earnest is determined to keep his wife\u2019s background hidden, even from their prying reporter daughter. This, despite the fact his wife barely knows who he is most days. It's been awhile since I've seen the movie, but a large part of the book put me in mind of Pretty Baby. And I could see this book being turned into a movie as well.

I read \u201cSongs of Willow Frost\u201d and \u201cHotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\u201d and really enjoyed both of them, I was hoping this book was another winner. It is!!One of the first really good historical fiction reads of 2017, the characters that Mr. Ford creates are so well developed, they are unique and yet relatable and believable. The novel is written between dual timelines. The first introduction into the book starts with Ernest\u2019s life in China and how his mother sold him because she couldn\u2019t take care of him. He is boarded on a large ship destined for Seattle with many other boys and girls. Many of them ended up as servants or other unpaid help. The time is 1909 and Ernest ends up being raffled off at the Seattle World\u2019s Fair, hard to believe but the author states this is true. The winning ticket holder is a Madame from the most well known house of ill repute and Ernest is treated very well. He gets to know the downstairs women, those that do the cleaning, cooking, etc. as well as the upstairs girls, those who are selling their sexual favors. He is very young and is very much influenced by this early life. Without giving away the plot I\u2019ll just say that you should pay close attention to all of the characters because they may appear much later in the book.The other viewpoint is once again in Seattle during the 1962 World\u2019s Fair. Ernest is with \u201cGracie\u201d and they have two daughters. Lately Gracie has been forgetful and somewhat remorseful and suffering bouts of melancholy. Ernest and the girls are trying to find out what they can do to help her through this. Again there is a lot going on here, one of their daughters is writing an article for a paper comparing the two World Fairs and she knows her parents met around that time. What she discovers as she researches and talks with her father is a revelation that neither of the girls saw coming. The story unfolds at a steady pace and I enjoyed all of the details that were included about the World\u2019s Fair which at that time was actually called \u201cThe Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909\u201d. There was so much new at the fair, incubators for premature babies, wireless phones and electricity used for so many new devices and an entire village with people from the Philippines.

As Ernest stands outside the gates of Seattle\u2019s newest world\u2019s fair, the Century 21 Expo, his memories flow back to the city\u2019s very first world\u2019s fair, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition (AYP), back in 1909 \u2013 a day that changed his life forever. That was the day that, at 12 years old, he was \u201cauctioned off\u201d at the fair, given away as the grand prize in a raffle, technically for the second time. Prior to that, at 5 years old, when he was still a little boy named Yung Kun-ai living in poverty with his mother in China, he was sent away with an \u201cuncle\u201d who would supposedly take him to America so he could live a better life free from starvation. Little Yung does make it to America and eventually becomes a ward of the state of Washington, but not before suffering various hardships and discrimination due to his status as a \u2018half-breed\u2019 \u2013 the \u201cbastard son of a white missionary and a Chinese girl, he was an outcast in both of their worlds.\u201d Later, he is taken in by Madam Flora, the \u201cwinner\u201d of the raffle at the 1909 world\u2019s fair, who also happens to be the owner of a notorious brothel named the Tenderloin, located in the red-light district in the seediest part of town. Ernest becomes a houseboy helping out with various chores at the brothel and it is there that he meets Maisie, the secret daughter of Madam Flora, and Fahn, a young Japanese maid who works in the kitchen -- together with the other women who live and work at the Tenderloin, they become the first real \u201cfamily\u201d \u2013 albeit an unconventional one \u2013 that Ernest ever had.By now, I believe most already know that this story was inspired by a real event \u2013 the raffle that truly did take place in real-life, at the 1909 AYP World\u2019s Fair where an infant boy, also named Ernest, was put up as the \u201cgrand prize\u201d. That raffle did not result in a winner and it is not known what eventually happened to the infant boy, but with the seed of that event, Ford turns it into a story that imagines what might have happened to that boy, with the difference being that the Ernest in Ford\u2019s story is a 12-year-old boy rather than an infant. Ford also incorporates some of his own heritage into his stories, as anyone who is familiar with Ford\u2019s background will probably know that he is also of mixed-race, with a Chinese father and an \u201cadopted\u201d American last name (Ford) that came about when his 100% Chinese great-grandfather decided to adopt the name William Ford when he immigrated to America back in the late 1800s. I love the personal touch that Ford incorporates into his stories and the fact that he pays tribute to his heritage, all done in a way that is seamless yet meaningful.There was so much to love about this book, as it truly combined the best of everything I normally look for in historical fiction: a well-written, captivating story that pulled me in from the start; a good dose of historical content that was obviously thoroughly researched yet did not take away from the flow of the fictional part of the story; a non-typical love story that tugged at the heartstrings without diving into \u201coverly saccharine\u201d territory; endearing characters who, despite being deeply flawed, you can\u2019t help but care about personally and eventually grow to love; wonderful writing that transported me to the time and place that the characters lived in and made the experience feel like a personal one. Ford is known for crafting tender, moving stories that incorporate aspects of hope and redemption and this was definitely the case here with Ernest\u2019s story and the love he had for both Maisie and Fahn. The ending to their story moved me to tears yet it was not sad or depressing but rather a scene filled with hope that made me feel good inside \u2013 I love the way the story came full circle, bookended by the two world\u2019s fairs that also played such important roles in Ernest\u2019s story.I also liked the fact that this wasn\u2019t a typical love story, but rather a story with substance that also dealt with important societal issues \u2013 questions of right and wrong, moral versus immoral and who has the right to judge. Also topics such as equality, social justice, class issues, women\u2019s rights, slavery, etc. \u2013 all heavy subjects that were dealt with in a way that didn\u2019t make light of their existence but at the same time did not weigh down the story with gloom or despair and also did not try to \u201cpreach\u201d or attempt to provide any answers, instead letting the reader go with the story and see where it leads.This is my first time reading Jamie Ford and it certainly won\u2019t be my last! While I wait patiently to get my hands on whatever Ford decides to write next, for sure I will be moving up the two previous novels he wrote (Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet and Songs of Willow Frost) from my TBR so I can get to both of them before the end of the year. If you haven\u2019t read Love and Other Consolation Prizes yet, all I can say is \u2013 READ IT!

Good grief! And believe it or not, that actually happened at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle, WA in 1909. In real life, the child was a one-month-old baby boy named Ernest. The winning ticket was drawn but no one ever claimed the prize and it is not known what happened to the infant. Jamie Ford uses this amazing true occurrence as the idea for his new book. His protagonist is Yung Kun-ai, a 5-year-old boy, part Chinese boy/part Caucasian, who is given away by his starving mother to a man who promises to bring him to America in the hopes of finding a better life. He is just one of several abandoned or orphaned children aboard ship. After arriving at a holding center in Seattle, he is made a ward of the state and goes on to live in a series of boarding schools and reformatories. Now the boy is about to turn twelve and is known as Ernest Young. His sponsor, Mrs Ida Irvine, a wealthy do-gooder social reformer, is disappointed to learn that he wishes to leave his current school, the Holy Word Academy, and she is the one who comes up with the brilliant idea to make him the prize in a raffle at the upcoming world's fair, to aid a civic organization to which she belongs. And so the big day arrives and Ernest doesn't know what to expect. When the winning number is drawn, it seems at first that no one will claim their prize, but then a beautiful woman comes forward. She is the infamous Madame Florence who runs the Tenderloin, a high-end Seattle brothel, and she is pleased to meet her new houseboy. Mrs Irvine, of course, is appalled--the rules say that he is to go 'to a good home' after all--but Florence Nettleton wins the argument and takes her 'raffle prize' home with her. There Ernest will meet the two young girls who will be the loves of his life: Maisie and Fahn.But the story is bookended by another World's Fair in Seattle, The Century 21 Exposition that takes place in 1962. Ernest has made a life for himself with one of those two girls who stole his heart as a young boy and they have two grown daughters. But the woman he calls Gracie is now losing her memory, a consequence of the life they led as children in the Tenderloin. And now the past must be revealed to their daughters as Ernest tries to help Gracie remember their life together. Jamie Ford has such an engaging writing style! It's so delightful to return to Seattle to see it in another era and experience a little known lifestyle. If you've enjoyed Jamie Ford's other books, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one just as much.

What I like about Ford\u2019s writing is that historical details come to life.Ernest is sent to the United States from China for a better life. He is adopted to a well-off family, but he never really fits in. He attends the 1909 World\u2019s Fair in Seattle. It seems impossible that a young boy could be raffled off as a prize at a fair, but that\u2019s what happened to Ernest. The winner of the raffle is the owner of a brothel that boasts of high class girls. She wants Ernest to be her house boy. Over time, he settles in his surroundings and has formed a new family at the brothel.The story is told from early 1900\u2019s and 1962. It\u2019s hard to say which I liked more, the young Ernest or the elder. The young because it\u2019s a coming of age under dire circumstances and the elder because of his reflections on his youth, his daughters as they press him for details of his past, and the love he has for his wife who is suffering from dementia.

I read \u201cSongs of Willow Frost\u201d and \u201cHotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\u201d and really enjoyed both of them, I was hoping this book was another winner. It is!!One of the first really good historical fiction reads of 2017, the characters that Mr. Ford creates are so well developed, they are unique and yet relatable and believable. The novel is written between dual timelines. The first introduction into the book starts with Ernest\u2019s life in China and how his mother sold him because she couldn\u2019t take care of him. He is boarded on a large ship destined for Seattle with many other boys and girls. Many of them ended up as servants or other unpaid help. The time is 1909 and Ernest ends up being raffled off at the Seattle World\u2019s Fair, hard to believe but the author states this is true. The winning ticket holder is a Madame from the most well known house of ill repute and Ernest is treated very well. He gets to know the downstairs women, those that do the cleaning, cooking, etc. as well as the upstairs girls, those who are selling their sexual favors. He is very young and is very much influenced by this early life. Without giving away the plot I\u2019ll just say that you should pay close attention to all of the characters because they may appear much later in the book.The other viewpoint is once again in Seattle during the 1962 World\u2019s Fair. Ernest is with \u201cGracie\u201d and they have two daughters. Lately Gracie has been forgetful and somewhat remorseful and suffering bouts of melancholy. Ernest and the girls are trying to find out what they can do to help her through this. Again there is a lot going on here, one of their daughters is writing an article for a paper comparing the two World Fairs and she knows her parents met around that time. What she discovers as she researches and talks with her father is a revelation that neither of the girls saw coming. The story unfolds at a steady pace and I enjoyed all of the details that were included about the World\u2019s Fair which at that time was actually called \u201cThe Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909\u201d. There was so much new at the fair, incubators for premature babies, wireless phones and electricity used for so many new devices and an entire village with people from the Philippines.

But this is one of those times when I felt that the concept of a story was lost in the execution of it. The pace was uneven, slow to start, better in the middle, and an ending that seemed to drag out over several chapters.Ernest as a boy falls in love with two girls, and is as an adult recounting their adventures growing up in a brothel, while anticipating the 1962 Seattle World's Fair with his wife, Gracie. Early on we know that one of those young girls is Gracie, although that's not either of their names. So you keep reading to figure out this odd puzzle.I really had high hopes for this one. Ford's first book is one of my favorites, but the next and this one were lacking that certain something that puts you on edge and makes you excited to pick it back up again where you left off. Ernest was such a sweet character but I think he deserved a better story with more interesting players on his team. I saw many similarities with Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, but this one didn't match up. I still liked it and I do appreciate receiving an advanced copy from NetGalley and the publisher.*(I just had to go to Wikipedia to learn more about the auction, and maybe the finished book includes this in the author's note, I don't know:\"A month-old orphaned boy named Ernest was raffled away as a prize.

In Jamie Ford's new novel Love and Other Consolation Prizes, this is so evident. In it we follow the life of a young Chinese boy Ernest Young, who is transported to America, on board a ship destined to land in Seattle. Aboard the ship are other children being brought here to work as indentured servants or for other various occupations many of which are nefarious. There Ernest meets Fahn, the lovely Japanese girl who eventually becomes a major part of his life.Life takes a definite turn when Ernest is raffled off at the Seattle's World's Fair and the winning ticket is held by a madam. Ernest winds up in a house of ill repute where he meets Maisie, the lovely young daughter of the madam. Ironically Fahn winds up there as well and the three young people embark on a journey of learning, loving, and binding themselves together. Ernest falls in love with both of the girls as he finds within that brothel the family he never had.Fifty years later, there is a new World's Fair and we find Ernest grappling with his life experiences and a wife who is ill and losing her mind. He endeavors to keep secrets from his grown daughters but as is often the case the truth wells out.This was a wonderful story told through the backdrop of two World's Fairs during the time of the post Victorian era, a time of budding sexuality and suffrage. This was definitely a story of love and compassion, one that showed that life in the many avenues it often travels gives us all that opportunity to find goodness and devotion and most importantly love.

I don't think I've ever hit a request button so quickly as I did for it. In fact I stalked Netgalley until it was available because I just couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I knew it was going to be something special, something emotional and something so worth my time and all the feels I would go through while experiencing it. Ford knows how to weave a tale riddled with history and heartbreak, hope, and love unlike any other author out there. He truly is a master at what he does. It isn't often that one can make you crave history, romance, and a happily ever after, along with struggling and feeling right along with the characters. To be both sad and happy at once, along with heartbroken and angry for everything we put one another through as a people and as a country and as a nation. His words are powerful in every way imaginable and it is so incredibly easy to get wrapped up in the story and the characters themselves until you are completely consumed by them and want nothing more than to see how it will all come together and wishing like crazy that there will be a happily ever after when all is said and done.

He may just be twelve years old but already has suffered after being sent from China to America in the cargo zone of a ship as an infant (along with other children), then becoming a ward of the state in Washington and not have any place to call home. But in a cruel twist of fate, Ernest's life is about to take a hard hit as he learns that he is the \"prize\" for the raffle to take place in the 1909 Alaska Yukon Pacific Expo. Ernest is \"won\" by a madam of a high end brothel and becomes the houseboy of \"The Tenderloin\". Though an unsual place to find himself in, this is his first real home and his first real shot at having a family.Having read 'Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet', I was instantly drawn to Ford's most recent release. Ernest was given away (or maybe sold) by his mother when he was a small boy. Traveling in the cargo zone of a ship for a month from China to the States, his life was far from easy upon arrival. Ernest is happy to be able to go to the AYP fair unaware that he is the \"prize\" of the day. By day's end, he is the houseboy of the Tenderloin, one of Seattle's high end brothels. Surprisingly, Ernest finds that he is quite at ease at his new home and even makes meaningful connections with some of its residents. Jamie Ford has a great talent for integrating historical details into his work. At the same time, he knows how to deliver a heartfelt and memorable story. Dealing with family, belonging, devotion and ultimately love this book was not exactly what I expected but I did greatly enjoy it. The setting was as intriguing as the character progression and plenty times Ford had me questioning who was right and who wrong. Would definitely recommend.I just find the background of this narrative so fascinating. The prompt, that of a baby boy named Ernest being raffled off at the 1909 AYP Seattle Fair is true. While the fair showcased some of the most recent technology available at the time it was also quite controversial. Along with the raffle of a child, there also were babies on display in incubators and displays of people from specific regions/countries designed in a way that made vistors rudely gawk at them. The social norms were also significantly different. The most notorious one being that age of consent was 10 years old. In part to this, the Red District of Seattle was a booming market. The madam from the narrative is based on madam Lou Graham. She ran one of the most lucrative brothels and was known for exposing her girls to culture, education and treating them in a most kind manner. Juxtaposed with this was the morality crusades and the suffragete movement. As for baby Ernest, no one claimed him and his whereabouts remain unknown."}, {"userName": "Tina Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859754-tina-woodbury", "userReview": "For all of my reviews: www.readingbetweenthepagesblog.wordpr...This book is sad at times, but also very heartfelt and inspirational.

He describes many specific attractions at the fair - hot air balloon rides, babies in incubators, and the controversial queen of the fair who was (gasp!) of Inuit descent. He draws a picture of 1909 Seattle making it seem you can walk down every street, see every building. He even uses language of the time like \"bumbershoot\" and \"octoroon.\" Characters in the story were often reading the newspaper or discussing the latest news.

I preferred the story from 1909 and wished that the book hadn't alternated between the two periods. Life in the Tenderloin seemed a little sanitized, but maybe brothels were all sweetness and light and all prostitutes had hearts of gold.

There was a bland sweetness to the love story but no conflict or tension to make me want to keep reading so I wound up skimming a lot.

The book is rich with the history of the 1900's, the racism, the suffrage campaigns, and the moral of the political system. I would highly recommend it anyone who enjoys historical fiction, Asian fiction, romance, Ford fans, and book club members. It is not a book to gobble up, rather, it is to be savored and pondered, discussed and enjoyed."}], "description": "From the bestselling author of Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet comes a powerful novel, inspired by a true story, about a boy whose life is transformed at Seattle's epic 1909 World's Fair.\"An evocative, heartfelt, beautifully crafted story that shines a light on a fascinating, tragic bit of forgotten history.\"--Kristin Hannah, author of The NightingaleFor twelve-year-old Ernest Young, a charity student at a boarding school, the chance to go to the World's Fair feels like a gift. But only once he's there, amid the exotic exhibits, fireworks, and Ferris wheels, does he discover that he is the one who is actually the prize. The half-Chinese orphan is astounded to learn he will be raffled off--a healthy boy \"to a good home.\"The winning ticket belongs to the flamboyant madam of a high-class brothel, famous for educating her girls. There, Ernest becomes the new houseboy and befriends Maisie, the madam's precocious daughter, and a bold scullery maid named Fahn. Their friendship and affection form the first real family Ernest has ever known--and against all odds, this new sporting life gives him the sense of home he's always desired.But as the grande dame succumbs to an occupational hazard and their world of finery begins to crumble, all three must grapple with hope, ambition, and first love.Fifty years later, in the shadow of Seattle's second World's Fair, Ernest struggles to help his ailing wife reconcile who she once was with who she wanted to be, while trying to keep family secrets hidden from their grown-up daughters.Against a rich backdrop of post-Victorian vice, suffrage, and celebration, Love and Other Consolations is an enchanting tale about innocence and devotion--in a world where everything, and everyone, is for sale.Praise for Love and Other Consolation Prizes\"Exciting . . .

A laudable effort that shines light on little known histories.\"--\nLibrary Journal\n\n \n \"Poignant . . . Vibrantly rendered.\"--Booklist\"Combining rich narrative and literary qualities, the book achieves a multi-faceted emotional resonance. It is by turns heart-rending, tragic, disturbing, sanguine, warm, and life-affirming. Perceptive themes that run throughout culminate at the end. A true story from the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition inspired this very absorbing and moving novel. Highly recommended.\"--Historical Novel Society (Editors' choice)\"Ford is a master at shining light into dark, forgotten corners of history and revealing the most unexpected and relatable human threads. . . .
