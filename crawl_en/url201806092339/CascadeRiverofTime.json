This is such an AMAZING series and I really, really don't want it to ever end!!Cascade was another addicting addition to River of Time series. I can ramble on and on but if you have read Waterfall, you are in for another AWESOME reading experience that will linger in your thoughts for quite some time. I read this a while ago now, and I still feel giddy when I think about it! It is a MUST read! Absolutely hands down one of my ALL-Time FAVS!!!I love that there is never a dull moment, the action keeps anyone with a hint of A.D.D flipping those pages and totally submerged within them! You get action, romance, deception, a heroin with more will-power and determination that makes your heart pump at an excessive rate (those who have cardiac conditions..may want to read in intervals) (just joking). You have a major swoon-worthy male counterpart that will have you squeezing your book/e-reader in the palms of your hands and hopeing to the high heavens that he reveals those luscious abs that we all come to love! Not only that, but let me tell you, Marcello is not only all of the above but he has a heart of gold and a deep devotion of love for Gabby that anyone with a fairy-tale dream generated guy in their mind will fit him in that place.You want secondary characters that blow your mind and add just as much flavor to the story...this one has that and more.Cascade picks up right where Waterfall left off. The She-Wolves of Siena are back with more tough decisions, bubonic plague etc.This isn't my typical review and I have a tendancy to ramble on about books I am totally in love with, but I just can't say enough how much I love it!"}, {"userName": "Elaina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45468451-elaina", "userReview": "4.5 stars This book took me a little while to get into at first...it started out kind of slow for me. However, this may have been because, at the time, I was reading several other books at once, and I just couldn't seem to get into it. But I am so glad that I decided to pick it up again :) It started to get better for me around the half-way mark. I love Gabi and Lia's sister/friend relationship. The \"She-Wolves of Siena\" were very funny and likeable characters for me, but I definitely think that I like Lia's character the most. I sometimes found Gabi to be a little bit irritating, but that could just be me lol Another thing I loved in this book was Lia and Luca's budding romance :) They were so sweet and Luca had me laughing so much at some of the things he said. Lord Greco's character had me very intrigued and he kept me wanting to read on until I knew more about him and whether or not he could be trusted. All in all, I am very glad that I decided to get back into this series and hope that I can start the third book, Torrent, very soon! :)"}, {"userName": "Kathy * Bookworm Nation", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075341-kathy-bookworm-nation", "userReview": "I liked how this one picks up right where the first one leaves off. It\u2019s probably a good idea to have all the books on hand when you start, you won\u2019t want to stop reading! This is one series where all the books are great, maybe even getting better as they go. Gabi continues to be a great heroine. I thought she was easy to relate to and easy to like. She is tough, but believable. She is courageous and fiercely loyal. When everything seems overwhelming and futile, she is still brave and speaks her mind. She uses her wits and I just loved being along for the ride. I liked that Lia plays a bigger role in this one. Same with Luca and Marcella, the book is at its best when they are all together. Gabi and Marcello\u2019s relationship continues to grow, but they face a lot of challenges in this one. I love how committed Marcello is to Gabi, he would literally do anything for her and puts her first. Even with all his other responsibilities he will drop whatever it is to come to her aid. He\u2019s pretty dreamy too! Luca continues to add a fun comedic element, but he can be all business when he needs to be. I like the relationship that is building between him and Lia. We\u2019re also introduced to a new character, Lord Greco. While he doesn\u2019t get a lot of page time, he definitely will capture your imagination. There is more to him than we get to see and it leaves you wanting to know more of his story. Luckily, we do get more of him in the next book and boy does he add some good conflict to the story. It doesn\u2019t hurt that he is a hottie too!The plot is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lots of adventure and character growth for Gabi. A great addition to the series!Content: Clean, PG-13. Clean romance, no language, moderate violence."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Oh heavenly day, what a ride, what a read. What an EXTRAORDINARILY EPIC, young adult action adventure! The sixteen-year-old girl within me was charmed once again. Cascade - second in the River of Time series - features Gabi and Lia, two modern day, resourceful and strong willed, courageous and valiant sisters. Once again they travel back in time to medieval Italy where volatile unrest blankets the castled countryside, pitting kingdoms against kingdoms, Lords against Lords, testing family loyalties and allegiances, battling to the death. High octane energy, fantastical heroics, sword-brandishing battles, and thundering young love drive this action-packed young-adult romantic suspense/thriller. A rare jewel, in that it's morally astute and cleanly written, showcasing young women in a positive light as heroines with verve and grace. All the way around, an exceptionally great read. Not quite as appealing to me as Waterfall - the first in series. Waterfall was more story/character driven, as opposed to action. But even so, both were most enjoyable. And I would imagine teen girls and young women will be thrilled with the fast pace, and totally gaga over the swimmingly dreamy romance within the pages of Cascade. Four **** High Octane, Dreamily Fantastical, Young Woman of Courage and Strength Fiction **** STARS"}, {"userName": "Chantel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5822088-chantel", "userReview": "(IN EPIC MOVIE VOICE) In a world... one book reader... is on a vast quest to find....WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THIS SERIES!!! :-) Oh. My. Gosh! This book took me through so many twists and emotions. I think l literally had to keep reminding myself to breathe during some parts! My mani was totally shot from all of the nail biting moments, lol! If you have not read book one, please buy or borrow a copy asap, and read it!. Lol, demand your book store or library to have this book on their shelves :-) I loved Gabriella's character arc from book one to this one. She goes a regular teen to a warrior girl. I love how she progressively takes an authoritative position in the story. You see her more comfortable in the medieval era in this second installment. She's definitely stronger in this one especially considering all the things she has been through in a short amount of time. I really appreciate that the author didn't try to make her like Xena all the way. Gabi still has her vulnerable moments, but she was definitely courageous!And I thought it was awesome how we got to see more of Lia and Gabriella and the sisterly bond they share . These ladies definitely attract trouble like a magnet. Lol it seems like everyone wants to take these girls down! Some of the situations they get into are just down right scary! But they always have each others back. And those girls can work a sword and a bow! Lol, girl power! I think I will forever adore the growing love between Marcello and Gabriella. You can totally see that they are in love. And not just bubble gum YA love, but real, love. I can totally see why the girl has a struggle between staying in the 1300s versus the present. Mr. Marcello Forelli will definitely make a lady want change her mind. Plus, I'm looking forward to see where things go between Luca and Lia! \u2665Cascade was such an exciting Series bravo to Lisa Bergren for creating such a fun blast to the past adventure! I'm so ready for book 3!"}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813423-nic", "userReview": "Favourite Quote: We stood there for a moment, people swirling around us, laughing, greeting one another, kissing on both cheeks in Italian fashion. And our deep stare into each other's eyes was as intense as a kiss of our own. It was like he was speaking to me, singing to me, all through that long, silent, sexy-as-all-get-out look.Cascade is awesome. It is another brilliant and addictive addition to what is quickly becoming one of my favourite series. It has the perfect mix of adventure and romance making for a fully satisfying read.I am still surprised at how captivated I am by this series especially since it is definitely kind of historical which is just not my thing at all. But that just goes to show how much of a incredible writer Lisa Tawn Bergren is. Her writing just keeps you completely captivated in this stunning tale.The plot is fast paced that has a level of tension that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even more than the first instalment. It was like I could not read this fast enough. I love spending time with these character as they bring humour and heart to this tale. Gabi is still the same strong heroine who's strenght and loyalty is inspiring. Marcello would have to be one of the kindest characters out there. And just when you think you couldn't possible swoon any harder for him you do. Then you have Lia and Luca and their banter provides lots of entertainment. \"Lia aimed shifted and waited watching one man peek out time and time again. She let her arrow fly anticipating his next peek at us and it pierced his eye. \u201cOkay that\u2019s just going to make \u2019em mad \u201d I said. \u201cThree hundred and ninety-two \u201d she said to Luca tossing her braid over her shoulder and taking aim again. \u201cSaints in heaven \u201d he said to me rolling his eyes \u201chow much deeper in love can I yet fall?\"The romance was beautiful. It made the romantic fool in me very very happy. Gabi and Marcello's relationship is sweet and tender. They definitely have that out of ordinary dreamy type of love.Overall, Cascade was a perfect reading escape. It is passionate, meaningful and magical. The only problems is I need Torrent like right NOW!"}, {"userName": "Small Review", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4579690-small-review", "userReview": "I wanna marry this book. This whole series. It's like Lisa took everything I want out of a book and put it all together to make the best series EVER! Even if you don't like historical fiction or time travel, this series is so much more than that. The River of Time defies simple categorization and gives readers something they so rarely get.But this is a second book in a series, so you probably have some questions. Second books always sort of scare me, especially when I loved the first book like I did with this series. Will the sequel measure up? Will it spoil the happy feelings the first book left me with? Reading shouldn't be so dangerous, but when you're as emotionally invested in a series as I am with The River of Time, then the idea of opening up the sequel can be scary!I'm going to try to answer the questions I had when I started reading. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers for both Cascade and Waterfall, but some things can't be avoided (like if I mention a character appearing in Cascade, then you kinda know they didn't die in Waterfall...) So if you haven't read Waterfall yet (WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!), then you might not want to read this review.Do the characters I love show up?Oh yeah! Of course Gabi, Marcello, and Luca have plenty of page time, but Lia is also elevated to MC status (and she is totally awesome!). Romana and Fortino make a small appearance, but they're not really present much. I know, I was bummed about the lack of Fortino, too. You know who does show up and totally surprised me? Paratore. I thought we had seen the last of him, but that jerk is back for more...and I love it!We're also introduced to two more characters who were totally awesome additions: Momma She-Wolf and Lord Greco. Momma She-Wolf is Gabi and Lia's mother who travels back in time with them. She is kick butt! I love that Lisa included their mother. Parents are so often ignored in YA, but when you're torn between living in the 14th century or going back home without the love of your life, well, that's kind of a decision you'd want to talk over with your mom, right? Lord Greco is such a great character. I love hating him and I can't help admiring him (and finding him attractive. Yeah, there's another hot guy). Is he bad? I'm not sure. I can't tell if he's good or if I'm just trying really hard to make him good because I like him so much. I'm not even sure if I want him to be good or bad. He's such a great villain, but he is totally swoon-worthy so, you know, having him be a villain might complicate things. Will I be happy with the romance?Ugh, middle books usually suck when it comes to romance. You have all the happy \"Yay the couple got together!!\" coming off the end of the first book, but usually authors try to complicate things in the sequel. Love triangles, misunderstandings, anything to make the honeymoon end.BUT NOT LISA! I just want to give her a huge hug for not putting me through that agony. Gabi and Marcello are just as awesome together in Cascade as they were in Waterfall. Not only that, but Lisa also totally avoids the annoying \"Gazing into each others eyes for pages\" thing that also usually happens when couples have been together for too long in books. You know how it can get boring seeing a couple just be together? Not here. Their relationship is growing and it's tender and sweet, but also realistic and still totally clean. Marcello is a 14th century guy, and while that provides a lot of perks, he also has a very different approach to relationships than we have today (like marriage age, divorce, etc). I loved the scenes where Gabi and Marcello hashed out these differences. The fact that Gabi is actually considering these differences and how profoundly her life will change is so refreshing. YA girls are so quick to throw away everything in their life for their paranormal insta-love guy. This gets old and I can't help but lose a little respect for those girls. Gabi acknowledges how much she loves Marcello, but she also carefully considers all of the ramifications to both herself and her family if she chooses to stay with him in the 14th century. And Lia and Luca? *Squeeee* SO adorable! How's the action? Is it as good as it was in Waterfall?It's better! Waterfall was a battle. Cascade begins a WAR. The stakes are super high and, honestly, I never knew what was going to happen next. There's secret passageways, espionage, heart-pounding escapes, double crossing, and plague! The political intrigue is so intense I had my eyes glued to the pages and was left gasping in surprise. I couldn't believe some of the things the characters did! Let me tell you, the 14th century is filled with JERKS. Conniving, horrible, ruthless jerks. My poor, wonderful characters go through so much in this book. I was so worried about all of them, and with good reason! We're lulled into a false sense of security with some cute but benign scenes in the beginning, but before long bad things start happening and we don't have a moment's rest. The action kicks into high gear and stays that way throughout the rest of the book. Once you hit that spot you won't be able to put the book down. I'm talking taking a sick day at work because you don't want to stop reading kind of feeling.\u00a0How are the Christian fiction aspects?If you like Christian fiction, then I think you'll be happy with the progression of Gabi's dawning faith. If Christian fiction isn't your thing, then I don't think you'll be bothered at all. The presence of Christian elements is very subtle in both Waterfall and Cascade. While Gabi slowly comes around to embracing the idea of God and God's plan, the story stands just fine on its own without these elements. What I mean is, you know how sometimes in Christian fiction the entire premise is based on religion. It's a major plot point and the book doesn't work if it were removed. That's not the case here. Gabi is a strong character and able to do what she does because she's a strong, capable girl. Will I be able to survive until September?This is where I'm at right now:\nBut with longer arms. And like times infinity. The idea of waiting--waiting at the edge of WAR where everything hangs in the balance and I don't know if **** and how **** and whether or not **** and how **** will pan out...well, this is also where I'm at:\nSo, if in your travels you happen upon a mad woman raving about a castello and Italian hotties and the She-Wolves of Siena, please don't worry. That's just me trying to carry on the best I can until September.And if you want to get a piece of this beautiful agony, make sure you enter the giveaway for a copy of Cascade!

What can I say? The River of Time series has become a favourite of mine. I absolutely loved Waterfall and I can say that the sequel does NOT disappoint. In fact, I may even be willing to say it's.... even better than the first book! Which, if you've read the glowing reviews for Waterfall thus far, you know that's saying a lot.The She-Wolves of Siena have returned. Gabriella and Lia Beterrani make the journey back to the 14th century with another Beterrani in tow this time - their mother. They've only been back in the present time for about half an hour, but due to some weirdness in the space-time continum, to Marcello and everyone else back in the past, it's been almost three months since Gabi and Lia last left. Despite what they achieved at the end of Waterfall, things are more dangerous than ever. They are on the brink of a war and while the Beterrani sisters are revered as heroines amongst the Sienese, their enemies want them with just as much passion.The stakes are raised even higher in Cascade and Lisa Bergren does not step down from the challange. Not only is there a rising threat of a direct attack from the Florentines, but a new danger is beginning to rear it's head among them all, one that can't be thwarted by swords and arrows - the Black Plague. Throughout the whole novel I was on the edge of my seat! The danger increases - the girls get themselves stuck in such sticky situations and you honestly have no idea what's going to happen next. Whether they'll be captured, tortured or even make it out alive and while I know deep down the girls can't die (it's their saga, afterall!), that doesn't stop my heart from racing with apprehension. Lisa knows how to build the suspense and uncertainty!And that's not all she excels at. Yeah, I'm talking romance now, folks. Oh my... Marcello and Luca - I ADORE!!! I loved them both in Waterfall, but they somehow managed to burrow their way even deeper into my heart this time. I don't know who I love more.... can I just have both gift-wrapped for Christmas, please? Marcello and Gabi's relationship is further intensified throughout Cascade and due to the fact that near-death battles seem like an almost daily experience in his era, they recognise how easy they could lose one another. And how strong their love is. They have such a great relationship, it's genuine attraction and a deep, respectful bond.I just have to throw a little quote out there that is SO true: \"Marcello. Luca. They're men, Lia. Not boys. It takes guys at home another ten years to have the maturity that these guys have.\"There's always a growing attraction between Luca and Lia. Well, Luca has plainly declared his swooning for Lia, but she's a little more stubborn to give into the way we're all sure she's feeling! Because how could a girl NOT fall for Luca? This guy still manages to lay on the charm with a grin on his face even while he's incapacitated or in the middle of deadly battle. Lia is the most reluctant to give up life in her own time. Gabi wants to stay - she's found love, true love in this era with Marcello and she doesn't want to leave. But she won't sacrifice losing her family to stay. She's so torn between the people she loves - can she convince her mother and sister that staying in an era where she's both worshipped as a hero and hated with cold fury, is a good thing for them all?Cascade has everything a great book should have. Romance, intrigue, danger, treachery and action. Action the way it SHOULD be written, full of peril and suspense and uncertainty. This series will take your breath away, with characters who'll fast become your friends and an adventure through time that will have your heart pounding alongside our heroines. I cannot recommend these books enough, if you haven't already read Waterfall - what are you waiting for!? Go, go, go!"}, {"userName": "Kiri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1243457-kiri", "userReview": "Oh lord where to begin. I had some serious hopes because she at least began with a historical note on this book. Hmm.. how about.. Book One set in 1332. Book Two 1342. However the author insists it's only 3 months since the girls departed at the end of book One. Then there's the plague thing. I could go on for paragraphs about the errors on that*, not to mention her character not wanting to \"infect\" people then barging into people homes and surrounding themselves with others willy-nilly. She throws nearly everything BUT the kitchen sink at the girls about 2/3rd of the way through the book and manages to pull them out (nice Mary-sueing!). I think your getting the point. The worst gaffe is their mother - who gets conveniently left behind for most of the book - having to get a doctorate of anthropology along with her doctorate of archeology REALLY? I mean REALLY? Does this Author not realize that Archeology IS a branch of Anthropology? That is so basic I about called the publishing house and read them the riot act over their lack of editing (which I might add is incredibly bad). Now I realize this is a romance and rules are decidedly lax. However this is also a young-adult novel and therefore I expect some standards to be met. Why? Because young adults do imbibe knowledge through their leisure reading. Being fed obvious misleading information like this really rubs me the wrong way. If an author cannot take the time to even get a few basic facts correct they shouldn't bother putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard). I'm not asking for a historical treatise, just make sure that when you are writing about something you get it correct. Seriously it takes moments to fact check something this simple, do it for your readers! I picked this series up originally because I enjoy history, have a penchant for time-travel novels, and well.. I didn't realize it was a twenty-first century formulaic romance novel in disguise. *ugh* (I sincerely wish these things came with a warning.. I won't bore you with my usual rant on that)Negative 12 stars. *I don't expect her to hit her readers with details about the plague ad nauseam. but plague was around and about all through that period. Her years and descriptions are off. As are the peripheral characters reactions to quite some degree. There had been several years where it had already ravaged the populace -- 1292 and 1306 come to mind. While I realize 1348 is a year most laymen are familiar with the plague came in several strains and forms and in waves across many many years. Not something to be addressed in detail in such a book, but it should have been acknowledged and addressed if it was going to be brought up at all as a plot point."}, {"userName": "steph", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271398-steph", "userReview": "Despite my excitement to dive back into this world with these wonderful characters, I was a little worried that Cascade wouldn't live up to my expectations or be as great as the first book. I was wrong on both counts! This series only continues to get better.In this book, Gabi and Lia briefly return to present day to fix that sticky situation they were left with at the end of Waterfall. They don't linger too long, though, and quickly head back to the 14th century with their mother in tow, throwing us right into the action immediately. I really loved seeing more of Lia and Gabi's dynamic as they both went to many lengths to protect each other. It is almost insane just how high the stakes were raised in this book. The girls really go through some hard stuff and yet they push through, as fierce as ever. Gabi? Wow, hats off to her for putting up with that cage situation. Gabi's mental and physical strengths aren't the only thing to admire: her selflessness really shines through in all of her actions. Much like in the first book, Gabi doesn't lose sight of the importance of her sister and mother and they remain at the forefront of her decision making. It would be so easy to simply agree to stay in the past --- hello, Marcello alone is more than tempting enough! -- but instead she's willing to wait until she can reach a mutual decision with her family. It's heartwarming to see such a wonderful bond with the Betarrini ladies, especially since these relationships continue to be so rare in YA.I have to admit that I did miss Fortino's presence in this one, but Luca and Marcello more than met my swooning requirement. Marcello will be Marcello (perfect if you're unaware), but Luca definitely had moments where he stole the show. Heck, I even made a goodreads update that simply read \"Oh, Luca <3.\" YEP, HE'S THAT GOOD.The final chapter in Cascade was absolutely touching and ahhh! The emotion! I won't say much more, but I definitely teared up while reading and I'm looking forward to seeing this expanded in the next book.This series has it all: action, adventure, romance, humor, amazing friendships and family bonds...it's a perfect blend of everything that I could want in my reads -- and then some!

Gone is the ass-kicking heroine I fell for in Waterfall; this one is all about being in love, leaving everything behind and waiting for help. So very Bella Swan!!! Fortunately, unlike Ms. Swan, the girl here is still an able and knowledgeable individual, and that definitely counts some bits in her favor. And why does everything have to do with God??? I mean I know The Big Guy is powerful and all, but for freak's sake I demand an acceptable explanation as to why the ruin allows time-travels to take place!!! It's book #2 in a trilogy (?) already and all I've got is \"God must be the answer\"??? Seriously??? Aren't these characters all scientists??? Besides, I can't connect with the hero at all, and I'm still mad at myself for it. What not to love, really? He's a medieval young lord. He's nice. He's brave. He's handsome. He's caring. He's definitely husband material. (Well... if you want to spend your life looking over your shoulders and worrying about plagues and enemies all the time.) But why can't I care for him??? Oh right... He's also exceedingly boring and has no character development. He lacks the charm that his younger brother, who, by the way, doesn't show up all that much, emits so effortlessly. Dear lord.

Loved it. Wish it focused more on that than the romance. Luca. He's my favorite character, I want a book from his perspective. Please? What I Didn't:It was confusing! Half the time I had no idea what was going on. Maybe I was just reading it too fast...idk. Like, I thought they couldn't come in contact with other people for 10 days at the beginning, but suddenly were all better and could? What? And Lord Greco. What? I didn't understand at all. And I still wish it focused less on the romance. And the descriptive violence. My stomach doesn't like it. Overall Opinion:I enjoyed it, though it was very confusing. I believe I'll be picking up the next one. Maybe then I'll understand more. And sorry this review is kind of short, I'm really supposed to be up right now, but I wanted to finish the book. ;DRecommendation:Girls 13 and up."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1049422-kristen", "userReview": "03/28/16 - Can I say how much I loved Luca this time around, Marcello is amazing, but Luca is equally studmuffin material. 8/28/14 - Super-d-duper good. Loved every second of it!!!9/8/13 - Just as brilliant the second time around. (Does anyone feel sorry for Rodolfo?)8/24/12 - Soooo good. I was so glad that I had book three in hand since the second I finished this one I grabbed book 3...Full review to come. Too busy reading Torrent.Ok, major cliffhanger at the end of book 2. I am super glad I had book three to keep going. It was so good. Kept me engaged from the first till the last page. I loved the adventure, the romance was superb, the writing brilliant. I loved how Gabi talked modern day slang with her medieval language. Gabi is an awesome heroine, she is true to herself, and strong and brave, and crazy in love with the right guy.Marcello...sigh...wish all men were perfect like him. What girl doesn't want a strong, super handsome, protector? Love him. Just like Bella was born to be a vampire the Bettarini family was born to live in the 1300's.

That was an exciting ride! I liked this one better even than the first! Funny thing, after finishing this book, I read in an interview with the author what soundtracks she listened to while writing this series and had to laugh, because those were mostly the same soundtracks I listened to when reading this book! No wonder they fit so well! This series really would make awesome movies or even a TV show. It's got action and romance and a lot of humor as well! Even in the midst of battles I would find myself laughing out loud! Tbh, I don't relate much to any of the characters and the insta love from the first book and continued in the second seems a bit far-fetched (hard to believe they are so deep in love after the 2 weeks they knew each other in the first book), but even so, I really loved this story and am picking up book 3 right away!Another good thing is that the story wasn't very predictable. I was surprised by quite a few things that I didn't see coming and that is always appreciated! Another plus, the writing is done in a way to be closer to the language of the time period.Really great series so far.

Ever since I first read Waterfall, I have been enthralled with Lisa T. Bergren's River of Time series. I am so glad that I won Waterfall in a contest because believe it or not, it probably would have been awhile before I picked it up on my own.But I know that I would have sooner or later.As I was telling a friend the other day, Waterfall , as well as the rest of The River of Time series, has everything that I love in a good book. One, it's part of a series. Which means that, yay, I don't have to say goodbye to these characters anytime soon! The fun continues!Two, it has an amazing looking cover. I mean, really, who doesn't want to have that beautiful picture beckoning from their nightstand.Third, Waterfall, Cascade, and Torrent each combine all of my favorite genres. Historical. Romance. Fantasy. Now since this review is technically of Cascade and I've so far raved about The River of Time series as a whole, let me tell you about why I liked Cascade.What I LovedThe first reason is that I loved Waterfall sooooo much. I had no sooner read The End in that fabulous beginning to the Bettarrini's story when I went on Amazon.com and pre-ordered Cascade and Torrent. I can honestly say I've never been that eager to know that a book was on its way before.The second reason I loved Cascade is that it could stand on its own. Have you ever read a trilogy and been so disappointed with the second book, like it only seemed like a bridge, the author's way of getting you from Book A to Book C?Cascade is NOT like that.Full of roaring adventure, sweet romance, keep-you-turning-the-pages-late-into-the-night conflict, Cascade is the PERFECT sequal to Waterfall.And I don't call a book Perfect with a capital P lightly, ya'll.So in a nutshell, this is what happens in Cascade:Gabi knows she\u2019s left her heart in the fourteenth century and she persuades Lia to help her to return, even though they know doing so will risk their very lives. When they arrive, weeks have passed and all of Siena longs to celebrate the heroines who turned the tide in the battle against Florence\u2014while the Florentines will go to great lengths to see them dead. But Marcello patiently awaits, and Gabi must decide if she\u2019s willing to leave her family behind for good in order to give her heart to him forever.Now, go out and buy it. Seriously. You'll thank me later.What I Didn't Love as MuchThe only thing that I can possibly say that I didn't like about Cascade was that it ended with a fabulous, thrilling, heart-stopping, leave-me-gasping cliff-hanger. Entirely appropriate, but, oh, how tortuous! Thankfully, I knew that a copy of Torrent was already making its way to my eager hands. Unfortunately, I had to wait a couple more months for its release (but Amazon.com was generous to send it earler than I expected. I saw the box when I came home work and squealed. Yes, squealed.)Why I Recommend This BookCascade is unlike other YA fiction I've read (though I confess, I haven't read much contemporary YA fiction. Like I said above, I'm more of a historical kind of gal.) There is a faith element threaded through this book that I would have liked to seen explored more, but I think that the author did a beautiful job of allowing us to see Gabi's inner struggle with believing, while not beating us over the head with the fact. Honestly, I'd rather a book err on the side of caution than be out-and-out preachy. Faith comes through strongest in the rocking story as you're transported from modern-day to 14th century Italia. Bonus: you see medieval Italia through the eyes of a 21st century teenage girl. How cool does that sound?One word of advice: don't start reading until you have all three and a long weekend. :)"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2790490-katie", "userReview": "Much like the first book in this series, Cascade was awesome! Even after I finished reading the last page\u2014another cliffhanger, ugh!\u2014I instantly went back and started re-reading the highlights\u2026which was nearly the whole book! The River of Time series just keeps getting better and better! (is it September yet??) I am really looking forward to how this series will be concluded. Tuscany continually grows on me, as it does on Gabi and Lia, and I can only hope that they decide to remain back in time with the men they have each grown to love.The adventures in Waterfall are intense and perilous\u2014and the events that Gabi and Lia go through in Cascade are even more intense! Just when one of the girls get out of a situation, they seem to fall right back into another perilous predicament. Their men, Marcello and Luca, are beside them the whole time, rescuing them from dire situations and, on occasion, being rescued themselves! If I thought I was attached to these four characters in the first book, Waterfall, the bond only grew stronger in Cascade. These four young adults are the best hero\u2019s and heroine\u2019s I\u2019ve read in an action/adventure book in a long time.Gabi came back in Cascade even stronger than before. Ever protective of the people she loves\u2014Lia, Marcello, Luca, and now her mother\u2014she fights to protect everything she holds dear. But she finds it more difficult than before as she realizes that Marcello isn\u2019t the object the enemy most desires now\u2026it\u2019s her and her sister that they want now\u2014the mighty She-Wolves of Siena. There was only one questionable thing that I thought to point out for younger readers. When Gabi is captured a man tears her shirt down the front. Nothing much is seen as her chest and stomach are bound with a clothe, as Gabi was suffering from broken ribs. The man glances down at the rope holding her pants up, but somebody steps in just then and nothing else happens. Lisa Bergren handled this situation so well, though, that I would think its fine for young teen readers.As the girls continue their fight to stay ahead of their powerful enemy, Gabi struggles with the biggest decision she will ever make. She loves Marcello, and Marcello loves her. But if she marries him, she will be tying down her sister and mother to remain in the past forever. My admiration for Gabi grew as she struggled with this issue. Showing a vast amount of selflessness, she considers her mother and sisters happiness over her own. Even though all she could ever want was to remain in the past, marry Marcello, and spend the remainder of her days fighting at his side, she thought of her family first. A wonderful character quality that I really appreciated.I mentioned above that the book ends in another cliffhanger, and now I am looking forward to the release of Torrent just as much as I looked forward to the release of this book. I am SO curious how this series will end. Gabi and Lia want to go back, but if they do, it will be right around the time of the dreaded Black Plague. Are they willing to risk their own death to return to the men who have captured their heart? That is the question that will be answered in Torrent and I cannot wait! At least I can re-read Gabi and Lia\u2019s grand adventures over and over while I wait. Cascade makes me wish I could jump inside the book and go back in time with Gabi. :-)"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "I recently finished 'Waterfall' (which was the first book I've read by Lisa T Bergren) and I loved it so much that I was eagerly anticipating the next addition in 'The River of Times' series.'Cascade' picks up where 'Waterfall' left off. Gabi and Lia return from their trip through time, but Gabi wants to return because the man she loves is there - Marcello.Gabi and Lia return pretty much right away - with their mother this time - and learn that months have passed in Marcello's world. This time they must battle the Plague as well as wars and imprisonment.I love how the story continued. The relationship between Gabi and Marcello is so sweet and I am rooting that everything works out for them.In 'Cascade' we see a lot more of Gabi's mother than we did in 'Waterfall', which I liked. They didn't really connect with her much in their time because she was mostly too busy, but in the 14th Century they spent more time together, and became closer.'Cascade' also showed hints of romance between Lia and Luca, which makes me more eager to read 'Torrent'. I did not like a couple of slang phrases that were used. That aside, I really, really, really loved 'Cascade'. I am therefore giving it 5 stars!!!!!I highly recommend 'Cascade' if you enjoy YA or romance/suspense books, but I would suggest you read 'Waterfall' first.*Many thanks to David C.

My heart was stuck in my throat and I probably left nail marks on my Kindle where I gripped it. I am going to go ahead and call this one of the best historical novels I have read all year. Seriously, why didn't they have inspirational YA books like this when I was a teen?! Maybe I wouldn't have skipped the whole genre, even though I am relishing it now. All the elements I loved from Waterfall was there and more! Each scene was more pulse pounding and adrenaline charged than the last with betrayal, romance, and vicious battles awaiting each page turn. Gabi and Lia's mom joins in on the adventure and she is the female equivalent of Indiana Jones. The faith elements were flawlessly interwoven within the Gabi's traumatizing ordeal (no spoilers here!) and contemplation about the future. The one thing I didn't like? The blasted cliffhanger! I. Could. Have. Screamed. (...maybe I did a little...but on the inside where my neighbours couldn't here me). But thankfully there are only 18 more days until Torrent is released!

It is such a let-down. I'm disappointed. :(I'll explain later. :) Longer review coming up!Like I said earlier in my temporary review, I was expecting a LOT from this sequel. It turns out that the book didn't not meet them. So here I am sitting outside our house having my pity party. Why's that? Here are a few things why:1st: The events are repetitive. I've gone tired reading over and over again how they fought with the enemies and having Gabi injured and, again, saved by Marcello. When I predict something that might come to that event, I said \"Here we go again!\".2nd: So many touchy-feely scenes! Goodness gracious! Can't they wait 'till they win the war then have their own moments?! Please! I really thought that this book was not one of those with cheesy love scenes! 3rd: The events were not what I had in mind! It left me hanging! And the decisions the characters made were swift and careless.So yeah! Good thing I'm generous enough not to give this book 1 or 2 stars.
