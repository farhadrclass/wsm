I got it solely due to Dave Ramsey's high recommendation and would never have picked it off a store shelf myself. The cover tagline does a bad job differentiating itself from a morass of prosperity-riddled Christian self-help (particularly to more sceptical, non American eyes) but that is more due to our prejudice laden attitude towards finance than the author's intent. I realise after reading the book that my interpretation of the cover's 'financial results' had completely changed to meaning spiritual gain not material return. It unpacks in amazing scriptural detail all that the verse 'Where your treasure is there your heart will be also' demands of us as Christian stewards of money and how to subjugate it to God's purposes in our lives in the same way we should our bodies, relationships, talents etc. If the cover attracts you, you should read this; if it repels you, you should read it too and prepare to be challenged!"}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15404371-erik", "userReview": "Edited my original review of 4 to 1 star. I did some more research and did a detailed comparison with the scriptures and found errors such as a lack of proper distinction between law and Gospel and also several verses ripped out of context. Quite honestly I now feel like I was manipulated. While the intent of the book seems to be good, the manipulation of scripture (proof texting) is unfortunately common in the book. Sadly I needed to revise my review and I cannot recommend this book. Read and study the bible to know the truth about giving and why we as believers generously give in the first place: because He (Jesus Christ) gave Himself unto us and died for our sins."}, {"userName": "Todd Stockslager", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager", "userReview": "\"Guaranteed Financial Results\" was not a good way to start right from the subtitle. Morris makes a valid scriptural point--we need to handle our money like stewards, not owners. Sure enough, and when God leads us to go beyond tithing to \"give til it hurts\" we need to listen. No problem there. I felt convicted that we should go beyond tithing.But God doesn't guarantee \"financial results\" He promises blessings. Big difference. Several times Morris says he doesn't use himself as an example because he is proud of being such a daring giver, but it sure seems that way to me.Another problem with the book is his repeated reference to the Lord speaking directly to him and telling him, \"give away this car to that person\" (and why the car fixation?). He does use scripture in this book to make his points, but he makes as many references to personal revelation to himself, which he seems to raise to the level of scripture. Not so good."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6125467-marina", "userReview": "I was very skeptical when our pastor brought this book to our church to read. I didn't \"get it\" first of all; the topic wasn't clear to me (probably b/c I wasn't listening carefully enough!), but after 2 trusted friends shared that this book was changing their lives, I read it. WOW. God's done an amazing work of transformation in my heart in tandem with reading this book. It talks a lot about the financial principles in the Bible and how to apply them to daily life; it also teaches and encourages on the joy of giving. I didn't want to read a \"prosperity preaching\" book or a book about how to budget. This is neither. It's a genuine book about the heart of God and His desire to bless us. The core of my desire to bless, to be like Him, is where God's changing me.

This was recommended to me by Clark Mitchell, pastor of Journey Church in Norman, OK. He was right. I've read many books on giving, this is the best one written that I've seen in recent times. I highly recommend it. Presents the issue of giving from the perspective of keeping a loose hold on the things the Lord allows us to be stewards over so that he can use them for His purposes and continue to funnel more resources through us to invest into people and into the Kingdom. I recommend it highly. This book takes the debate away from the issue of \"is tithing biblical\" and into the realm of \"why wouldn't I want to invest in what the Lord is doing and make a difference in the world and in my own life?\""}, {"userName": "Shorel Kleinert", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4082847-shorel-kleinert", "userReview": "The most well versed book I have read on giving. In short, giving the tithe shows our attitude of heart towards God. Do we trust Him? Do we believe that we are only stewards? That we are blessed to be a blessing? The only thing not emphasized enough in the book was our responsibility in scriptures to take care of family first before doing any extra giving (beyond tithe). In several examples, the stories should have emphasized that the extraordinary giving was in response to the author hearing, knowing and obeying the voice of God. The casual Christian may assume that this extraordinary giving is normative without the prompting of God. Tithe first. Period. Take care of family needs. Then see how much you can give out of the abundance God has given you to steward."}, {"userName": "Christopher Lewis Kozoriz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7841536-christopher-lewis-kozoriz", "userReview": "\"The Bible says that we must be faithful with little before we will be entrusted with much.\" ~ Robert Morris, \"The Blessed Life\", p. 95-96The gift of giving is emphasized in this book, as well as many other aspects of giving according to the Bible. Robert Morris shares his journey of giving and gives other examples of giving from the lives of people he has come across in his journey.Giving is the key to a blessed life.Again, the only criticism I have of this book is \"work\" is not emphasized enough.

How come have I missed these details? I believe that \"The Blessed Life\" goes far beyond our knowledge of God's faithfulness in terms of finance.God has blessed us so much economically and it is certainly because He is God, but also because He loves us and wants us to be blessed so that we can bless others.And if there's something that Pastor Morris has as an advantage is to \"live\" this blessed life.It has happened to him and the book is full of testemonies of people who decided to be faithful to God in the tithes and offerings.In addition, Morris has an eye for detail, analytically investigating aspects of the commitment people from the Bible had with God. For instance, I've always wondered why God liked Abel's offering but not Cain and his offering? It's when then he opens our eyes to check the Abel offered the \"firstborn\" of his flock. As for Cain,\"in the process of time\" has offered his. It may not be clear, yet I'd like to emphasize that the \"first\" part is taken with due respect by God.Notwithstanding this, the author compares God and our relationship with tithes in terms of a wife. Imagine that God gave you money to take care of His wife. He just wants you to give her 10% of your money. So, suppose that God decides to give you and two other people 100 pounds each and tells you three to take care of His wife by simply giving the 10% of it. If you give 10%, the second person 20% and the third nothing, who do you think He'll bless? Well, God will continue give you 100 pounds, give more for the second and nothing for the third, because he is not taking care of His wife.It is certain that God doesn't need your money. However, the author says that we are usually tested in the area that we are weak. Judas Iscariotes was in charge of the offerings. Of course Jesus knew he would betray Him, but the money was under Judas' care though.Furthermore, Pr. Morris gives emphasis to the fact that all tithes AND offerings (BOTH are supposed to be given) must be brought to the \"house of God\". Some may think that giving the tithes to poor people, or helping others somehow is the correct way to tith. I'm afraid it is not. It is supposed to go to the HOUSE OF GOD. Last but not least, it is the fact that according to the book \"giving is important because it does a supernatural work in our hearts, and that's what God is after - our hearts\" (page 196). He even cites the verse that says: \"The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him (2 Chronicles 16:9 NLT). Therefore, God is looking for people who are generous so that He can bless to bless others. \"God has all the resources of the universe at His disposal... His eyes are roaming Earth, looking for faithful-hearted stewards through whom He can channel millions of dollars into His Kingdom\"(page 197).I do try to write my reviews giving my point of view, yet I think this one would be enriched if I directly cited texts of the book. The next one is: \"God owns everything... So, what size gift would impress God? An extravagant gift? YOU\" (page 184). I felt tremendously happy when I read this. Firstly, due to the fact that God wants US. Secondly, because we may think that God wants us our money, but He doesn't. He wants US all. Totally in love with Him. Totally devoted to Him. And I never thought I could be an \"extravagant\" gift. I feel so special.To draw this review to a close, I'd love to say that on page 183, Pr. Morris attracts our attention to the fact that the \"TRUE RICHES\" are people - 'the privilege of seeing those you love saved, made whole and growing in God. True riches are the words of knowledge, gifts of healing, faith and miracles that minister to people. True riches are being able to help others who have spent their entire lives in bondage to depression or oppression experience freedom for the first time. The true riches are souls.'To sum up, the book presents a very detailed understanding of tithes and offerings as well as going beyond the financial terms. I do have a great testimony in my life in terms of tithing and God's great miracles, which is one of the reasons that pushes me to encourage people to be loyal in this area.Let our hearts bow down to God and... our pockets too, because God is FAITHFUL.

On one hand, I totally understand the purpose of writing this book. Yes, it's important that as Christians we tithe to God. But on the other hand, the author tends to be off-putting. Call me a skeptic, but I have a hard time believing that in the span of 18 months, God gave this guy's family a plethora of cars. And I also find it hard to believe that God wanted this guy to sell his house and give away all of his money. I don't know. I've never known anyone to come away from tithing and giving with such extravagant blessings, but would a church pastor lie? I also didn't like what this guy had to say about WHEN we tithe. What I do is, I know the exact amount I give to church each month, so the first Sunday of every month, that's what I give. Now, in the meantime, I take whatever is left from that and pay bills, buy food, etc. In some instances, I pay bills and buy food before I turn in my tithe check to church just b/c...that's the way my schedule works. I'm not skimping on my tithe when I do it this way b/c I've already set aside money for the tithe. Well, apparently, I'm not doing it right. No matter what, I'm supposed to give my tithe FIRST and THEN worry about paying the bills. Uhm, I like to have my bills paid on time so that it doesn't wreck my credit, but whatevs. I just don't see how it makes much difference doing it my way or this guy's way. I do believe that the more you sow the more you reap and maybe I didn't really like this book b/c I haven't fully trusted my money (God's money) to God, but if God told me to sell my house (I can't b/c I don't own it) and give away all my money (not much to begin with), I dunno that I'd be so quick to comply."}, {"userName": "Scott Cordell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49278679-scott-cordell", "userReview": "Nothing wrong with the teaching in this book, but it seems to teach the concept...\"if you do this, then God will bless you.\" I don't really have a problem with that and won't criticize because I know that God is so wonderful that He has a very unique and individual relationship with each person that is unlike any other relationship in the universe. That is very special.I know that God has gifted some people to be incredible givers and that is special too. I also know that at this point in my life and in my relationship with my Abba Father I am not giving away my house or car and expect God to return it ten fold or whatever. Some in the theological world would say that it's because I don't have enough faith.Well? According to the good news which Paul called the Gospel of Grace? The only thing I have to have faith in is that the ressurrected Living Christ is alive and well and living inside me and I believe He is making me like He is. I have His spiritual DNA flowing in me. If He gifts me to be a giver like Robert Morris I would be thankful for it. For any Christian, you should not read this book and think if I do this, I will be abundantly rich. That is too much like law mixed with grace and that isn't good news.

To illustrate how important it is for us to trust him with every aspect of our lives. I am grateful for guidance on how to learn to give without having ill motives. I am left with a Godly mindset of what it means to give to God first and am motivated to give for selfless reasons.I was especially enlightened with the description of having a poor mans spirit and a giving spirit. As well as warnings of \"Mammon's\" schemes to preserve in us a selfish attitude toward giving. Too many of us are not trusting God to provide for our every need because we're afraid and are under the illusion that we have control of our finances and future.

Tithing, that is giving ten percent to God first before all others, or even the tax man, simply means that you are returning to God what is already His. This means that you understand that everything you have, everything you possess, every talent and personal gift, has come to you through God.I was more surprised when I actually started to do what Blessed Life entails.
