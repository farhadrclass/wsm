Sadly it hasn\u2019t.The story just doesn\u2019t seem to be moving much. The biggest problem this series has is its lack of consistency. Some issues are great and some are just plain dull. At times it just needs a little energy. The drama is here though I would like to see more internal conflict and tension building up within the group to push it forward.My biggest problem is Rick and his annoying attempts at leadership. All he seems to do is give out long drawn out speeches that sound like a verbatim repeating of the one before. It\u2019s become tiresome and boring.

This one advanced things quite a bit, and there were some interesting developments, but for the most part not too much happened. Some plans, some searching, some putting down a brewing rebellion, some recovery, and a whole lot of Rick whining.That sounds pretty cold and shitty, but it's getting a lot redundant to have him going on and on about The Things He's Done. It's like he's making the rounds to tell everyone individually. They have three doctors in the community... wonder if any of them is a shrink? Don't get me wrong, I love this series, but I want some progression, not just bogging down the story with the same woe is me stuff every volume. I did find his conflicted feelings about Carl pretty fascinating though. Tomorrow will be on to #16, and then I will have run out of Walking Dead for the time being. But fear not...

It's only a flesh wound, after all.I know it's so early 2000's to quote Monty Python, but COME ON! There is no more appropriate use than for this comic.2) If Rick says it's right, it's right. Anyone with different opinions than Rick is bad.3) No other character other than Rick matters.4) The best way to reveal how a character thinks and feels is to have them talk about it. In huge chunks of text. Doesn't matter when or where, if it actually makes sense in the situation. The bigger the text, the better.5) Oh, yeah, there are still zombies out there too.This book irritated me like no volume has since I read The Massive Compendium. Oddly enough, that was focused on the Prison. Seems like a pattern to me: Kirkman doesn't know what to do to create drama, so he tries whatever he can to make sure that his characters ruin the safety they supposedly desire.Oh, and do the women even exist anymore, outside of being sex-objects for the guys?"}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Hello? Hello, story? Where did you go?!You were there during the whole Governor thing, and even for a little bit after but these last couple volumes, you\u2019ve been totally absent. And what\u2019s worse is that this volume doesn\u2019t even have a zombie herd attacking \u2013 the characters are stuck doing nothing!The zombie herd has been eliminated and Rick decides to create defences for their colony, so a group begins digging a trench around the fence while others move cars in the way to provide another obstacle, and a different group goes out food scavenging.That\u2019s the whole book.There\u2019s a half-hearted \u201crebellion\u201d led by a lone nut with a gun which fizzles out so quickly it may as well not have happened. For so little to be stretched out into an entire book is really disappointing. In earlier volumes, this kinda material would be going on in the background while a plot would be playing out.Carl isn\u2019t dead which also annoyed me \u2013 the kid had a chunk of his head blown away and yet a non-surgeon doctor with limited supplies in a house could somehow save his life?!Robert Kirkman thinks that focusing on the characters is more interesting which it would be if the characters were interesting, but without facing any dangers, they\u2019re not! I don\u2019t care about Rick talking about his feelings or the non-romance between Andrea and some guy, or Rosita finding out Abraham\u2019s been sleeping with Holly \u2013 I don\u2019t watch soap operas, I sure as hell don\u2019t want to read one, especially in a book about the zombie apocalypse!Kirkman\u2019s strength is plotting and story, not character work which is more than evident here. I\u2019ve made it 15 volumes into this series because the story is compelling not because I want to see Kirkman\u2019s ham-fisted attempt at a character portrait in Rick \u2013 he isn\u2019t talented enough to do that.

Absolutely inconsequential volume. Yes, you could say that Kirkman is attempting some character building here, but what the hell did he accomplish? We all already knew that Rick is a very tortured soul, and that Carl is an emotionally screwed up child (who should be fucking dead, by the way), and that all of the characters in this comic did go through a lot of shit that only made them stronger and yada yada yada. The story, meanwhile, is completely absent. They go out into the city and find nothing. That's all. There is some sorta rebellion starting in the community, but that got shut down as quickly as it started, again, with no consequences. And this is really the main problem with this series \u2014 it definitely can and does occasionally get good and even sometimes really good, but most of the time, it just stalls. Kirkman is not very good with characters, and yet he creates a ton of them, and then tries to justify that with volumes like this one. I wish he would focus more on the story.Oh well.

So basically two years of walking dead collections have been sitting on my bookshelf but not read. I am also one of those people who doesn't watch the tv show I have to confess. It's not that I don't know that's a popular series and pop culture phenomenon but I rather want to keep the worlds of print and live action separate in my head. So people in the real world always ask me about if I watch the show and I say no I read only the comics which usually elicits stares from people as I am some sort of elitist where 'screen adaptions are never good enough as the printed version' (which isn't true but I digress). As Far as the collections i burned through this weekend #11 through to 17 the two year break between my last serving of walking dead comics made me really get back into world of Rick and survivors nicely. As always it isn't the zombies you gotta worry about but other humans and that is certainly the case in this block where after the events with the Governor (who is a hard act to follow as he was a wicked antagonist) the crew encounters a greater menace in the form of a group of survivors led by Nagan. Who is indeed a bad mofo ruthless and cunning to core. Whereas the Governor had this air of almost Machiavellian villainy Nagan is more of that sociopath that ruled the schoolyard through cunning and pure imposing brutality. He is for sure that man you wouldn't want to know in real life or regular society as human life is no different than undead mindless zombies. He literally isn't afraid to crack a few eggs to make his point ;( Great art by Charlie adlard who I always enjoyed since his run with the X files comic series back in the 90s and well written by Robert Kirkman. If you want to read a story about how humans would react in the event of a world wide disaster like this give the comic collections a try."}, {"userName": "Gabby", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby", "userReview": "\"Do you have any fucking idea who you're talking to?\"3.5 StarsI didn't like this one as much as the other volumes because it was very slow paced, but it was still good. The thing I did like though is that it had one of the iconic moments from the show in season 6 where someone in Alexandria tries to take over and kill Rick and Rick says the iconic lines: \"You really think you're going to take this community from us? From Michonne? From Glenn? FROM ME? Do you have any fucking idea who you're talking to?\" It as so epic and iconic just like the show. SPOILERS BELOWCarl is finally awake and he seems to have lost some of his memory. He doesn't remember that Lori is dead which is really sad and Rick has to tell him. Rick is concerned that Carl is losing his humanity and ability to feel emotions. Rick and Andrea have a few heart to heart talks in this volume which I liked but I don't get Andrea throwing herself at Rick at the end of this volume. But I'm liking Rick more and more with each volume. He's thinking about the future more and he's becoming more vulnerable and allowing himself to be emotional about things.

And Rick? He's convinced that the reason all their past tempts at survival failed so badly is because he was only concerned with the safety of his family, and not with the community. He says now he realizes they can accomplish so much with a larger group of people, and he hopes to still be in the Safe-Zone when Carl is thirty.I was all pumped after the last one because I thought it signaled a change (finally) in the pattern of this story. Unfortunately, I don't think it really did. This issue just felt like more of the same: Rick having a \"revelation,\" thinking they've finally found the answer, and then what comes next is always devastation.

Of course, Rick will need to come to terms with Carl's health after he received such a terrible wound and he'll have to worry about a possible insurrection.This volume isn't nearly as intense as the previous one. That's not to say that it isn't, but it's not at the same level of insanity. Rick and company aren't out of the woods yet. If it isn't one thing, it's another. While reading this volume, I started to realize how much I'm beginning to dislike Abraham. Glenn remains one of my favorite characters, in the comics as well as the tv adaptation. However, I'm getting more and more annoyed with Maggie in the comics - I definitely prefer what they've done with her character on screen.

Does your life really work like that? I'm sure I don't work like that, no matter how much regret spills up - I'm still going to stomp off mad sometimes, and going to stay pissed at least until the testosterone wears off. These people act like their anger is akin to Star Trek \"synthehol\" that affects them until the moment they will it away - and then it's gone.Long-assed soliloquies, nothing more than an examination of the mundane and how it affects a few people.

That said, I was never caught up in a mad frenzy to burn through the pages of this one, like I have been with previous volumes, so that makes it fairly easy to score this one as middle of the road for a Walking Dead volume - even if said volume is better than most other graphic novels doing the rounds at this time.3 Burgeoning Romances for The Walking Dead: We Find Ourselves."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa", "userReview": "I guess there was quite a bit to miss between books 14 and 16, including a coma & a poorly thought-out rebellion that got sort of squished.

At this point in the series after huge events there is always a needed period of transition, a period to pick up the pieces, count the dead, and think of what happens next. There were some good character developments here, nothing major, but more of the same theme explorations and characters analyzing a certain point or view in new ways. I enjoyed the moment between Andrea and Rick, and then Rick and Carl having a moment to let go and just be a father and son for a moment. The idea that strength is more than just being tough, that it is all right -and needed- to be vulnerable at times and admit things do affect you, was a point that I felt needed to be made. I was a little annoyed by the tension and confrontation with Nicholas trying to rile up the older residents against Rick, but I understand it, I just eye rolled through it because people being people can never let things just be. I also wish that except for Andrea and Michonne, we had a deeper look and gave more meaningful roles to the women in this series. At this point, it is walking a very fine line into misogyny with women either being the only ones to break down and show emotions, or else be a sex object to a male character.
