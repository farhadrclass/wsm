Chris Brady and Orrin Woodward have made leadership education an eye opening experience for someone like me. I never concerned myself with what shape our country was in. But this one book alone has cemented my belief that we all need to become educated citizens so we are able to influence our one great country to return to those ideals. Thank you Chris and Orrin for sharing your vast amounts of knowledge on these subjects!"}, {"userName": "Chuck", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24140586-chuck", "userReview": "This is my second time through this collection of short essays and blog posts. Both Woodward and Brady are strong voices for smaller government, personal responsibility, and entrepreneurship.As they point out, everyone will be called upon to lead at some point and this book gives the reader much to consider in the leadership journey.I truly enjoyed, and strongly recommend, this book."}, {"userName": "James Wirshing", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5036799-james-wirshing", "userReview": "A GREAT collection of short anecdotes.
