This is one of those books that stays with you well after the final page is turned; I\u2019ve been thinking about this book for days now and am finally composed enough to review it. I\u2019m still not sure why this book hit me the way that it did, as I\u2019m not in any sense relatable to Hattie\u2019s stage of life, but this one burrowed deep inside me and refuses to let go. If you are picking this up solely for a cheap, shocking twist on who murdered Hattie-don\u2019t. We know from early on that there are few options so your deducing skills will be wasted if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. This book was so much more than a psychological thriller and there was no mention of a Girl in the title or comparison to a book mentioning said Girl! I\u2019ll try to reign in my thought process as this is one I could ramble on about for days.This story is told from 3 point of views; Hattie, Peter, and Del (the sheriff investigating Hattie\u2019s murder). All have information we need in separate pieces; Mejia does a fine job of spreading these little nuggets around where we discover them at precisely the perfect moment. I could have easily read this book in one sitting; the pacing is compulsive and the chapters are spaced perfectly apart so that they aren\u2019t choppy, but are also not too long. The characters were fleshed out nicely with flaws and issues that were struggled with until the end. The cover was perfect and really drew my eye to it. It\u2019s a great length overall for those looking for baby bear perfection of \u201cnot too long but not too short\u201d. Overall, the construction, writing, pacing, and design were what I would humbly consider exquisite.I found this book extremely disturbing (YAY!), but not for the reasons you\u2019re assuming. This book was actually very tame when it came to graphic violence and trigger worthy content; the disturbing aspect was how deeply moved I was by Hattie\u2019s final year and digging deeper into how it all happened. Maybe part of her story was relatable to me, as my husband and I have the same age gap as Hattie and Peter, which made things more realistic for my reading experience. No, he was not in a position of authority over me, and no we didn\u2019t start dating while I was in high school or underage, but it still made me think about how a gap of 8 years can seem like a life time between two humans regarding maturity levels, rather than if they had both been, say, in their 30\u2019s. You can feel the urgent tension building with each chapter, right up until we learn the killer\u2019s identity and find out just what caused everything to fall apart. My heart broke for this young girl who spread herself so thin to be \u201ceverything everybody wanted her to be\u201d. Most disturbing of all, this book reminded me of the impending death we are all headed for, and how none of us know when it will come. Youth and potential are no defense against mortality and this is the shining theme throughout Everything You Want Me to Be. Overall, this was a haunting story with suffocating tension that will crawl deep beneath your skin without you realizing until it\u2019s over. Highly recommended to the fans of a well done psychological thriller; I\u2019m not sure if I should consider this one of my top reads of 2016 or 2017-maybe both!*Many thanks to Atria Books (go mystery bus go!) for providing my copy for review.

When she\u2019s found brutally stabbed to death on the opening night of her high school play, the tragedy rips through the fabric of her small town community. Local sheriff Del Goodman, a family friend of the Hoffmans, vows to find her killer, but trying to solve her murder yields more questions than answers. It seems that Hattie\u2019s acting talents ran far beyond the stage. Told from three points of view\u2014Del, Hattie, and the new English teacher whose marriage is crumbling\u2014Everything You Want Me to Be weaves the story of Hattie\u2019s last school year and the events that drew her ever closer to her death.Evocative and razor-sharp, Everything You Want Me to Be challenges you to test the lines between innocence and culpability, identity and deception. Does love lead to self-discovery\u2014or destruction?there are people who will read that synopsis of this book and understand where the story is going just by the list of voiced characters. and then there are people who will only register what's written there without clocking the subtext. there's no right-or-wrong, better-or-worse distinction between the two groups; it's just a quirk of perception. i am in the former group, because my brain automatically registers likely scenarios, just like it effortlessly solves word jumbles or dominates at boggle <--- which is definitely a better-or-worse distinction - do not come at me with boggle; you will be defeated. long, rambly, bogglebraggy* preamble just to say that what i consider spoilers and what other people consider spoilers will differ, but since most of the reviews up here so far seem to be dodging a plot point that isn't explicitly stated in the synopsis, but which i'd considered a given before reading it, i will err on the side of caution, since i hate people yelling at me over the spoiler issue. review starts\u2026NOW!this is damn good. it's a murder mystery, but even more than that, it's a fantastic character study of hattie hoffman - a girl from a small midwestern town who learned the art of manipulation at a very early age, and by the time she turns eighteen, it has become as natural as breathing to her. \"manipulation\" may be too loaded of a word - she's not a sociopath; in fact, her manipulations are frequently grounded in empathetic concerns - she has an impressive knack for perceiving what will be most pleasing or attractive to each person in her life, and she chameleons into that personality for their benefit, while suppressing her more natural impulses. her friends, her parents, her teachers, her co-workers all see an idealized version of her; tailor-made for them. but that kind of constant self-regulation is exhausting, and when hattie finds something she wants more than anything else, she uses her considerable talents to construct her most intricate persona yet, and she is doing exactly what she wants for the first time in her life. and then she is brutally murdered.the three voices driving the story are hattie's (before her death - there's no ghostie narrative here), sheriff del goodman, who is heading the murder investigation, and hattie's english teacher mr. lund; both men who knew a different version of hattie.i mean, obviously this sounds a little twin peaksy; a small town setting where everyone knows everything about everybody and yet discover they knew not one thing about the popular girl revealed to be full of secrets after her murder. however, hattie's secrets, while not inconsequential, do not come anywhere near the seedy double life of laura palmer, and she's a much more sympathetic character for it. she's just a girl who dreams of getting out of a town she's long outgrown, of making her way to new york and becoming a broadway star. and unlike so many, she might have actually achieved this goal, with her formidable powers of adapting to characters not her own, and the single-minded energy and optimism of youth.There was something about her: a brightness, a presence\u2026 This was a girl who hadn't made any mistakes yet, one who recognized the world as only a giant cupcake for her careless sampling.she's charismatic - people are drawn to her (or the \"her\" with whom they are presented), but there's also a danger to her self-construction, once her mysteries begin to unravel:\u2026 this girl who kept shedding masks like a matryoshka doll, each one more audacious than the last, a psychological striptease that racked me with the need to tear her apart until I found out who or what was inside.mr. lund is an equally fascinating character - a young teacher, new to the profession, he has all the energy and enthusiasm of the best kinds of teachers: close enough in age to know how to relate to his students, refreshingly honest and unafraid to poke a little at the almighty canon, especially since i agree with his pokes:\"Every book changes you in some way, whether it's your perspective on the world or how you define yourself in relation to the world. Literature gives us identity, even terrible literature. Moby-Dick, for example, defined how I feel about rope. I don't know how anyone can write pages and pages of thinly veiled rope metaphors. If there are any Melville fans in the room, I might have trouble passing you.\"also, he's not too hard on the eyes, as one of his students gushes:\"Kind of skinny, but hot, like library hot. Sweaty in the stacks, you know what I mean?\"\"library hot\" is such a perfect description that i will be using from now on. but mr. lund is dealing with his own life's problems - recently transplanted from minneapolis to his wife's tiny hometown so she can care for her ailing mother, he's feeling the loss of the cultural opportunities city life affords, and is becoming increasingly isolated from his wife, who is so capable at tending to the farm's duties and so devoted to her mother, he feels extraneous, and is frequently a hindrance to her. vegetarians vs. the realities of farm life = always funny.the third narrator - sheriff goodman, is less psychologically developed than these two, and his purpose in the story is to supply the details and discoveries of the investigation. he's more than just a tool for that job; as an old friend of hattie's family, he has some personal stake in the case, but he's less defined as a character, so less interesting to me. but the investigation itself is quite good - there are excellent twists and red herrings and false assumptions distracting the reader from the killer's identity, and while the \"solving the murder\" parts were not what excited me the most about this book, they were well-written and suspenseful.for me, it's all about character here. i love unreliable narrators and how big a role perspective plays in our perception of an individual, and how this perception can be controlled by someone who doesn't want to be seen. this theme permeates the entire book - not just the way hattie is seen by the other two narrators, but in the smaller moments of her story, in the ways she interacts with her peers, her parents, her boyfriend. the gulf between what they see and what she is thinking - it makes for a lonely, but powerful girl.this book also has some marvelous phrasings: She probably thought there were only a few years between us, but it was a lifetime - dark, undiscovered caverns of disappointment and compromises. She was the adult idealized. I was the adult that really happened.so this is definitely one to check out if you're into character-driven mystery stories or if you are in the mood for a psychologically-rich story with lots of seeeecrets.and although their characters are completely dissimilar, the structure here reminds me of The Life and Death of Sophie Stark, with its examination of the life of an enigmatic woman through the eyes of people who only knew pieces of her, and i think it would be a fine readalike to that book. *my spellcheck says NO to braggy, but accepts bogglebraggy without a fuss. go figure."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...High school senior Hattie Hoffman is good at being good. The good student, good child, good friend, good actress, etc. So when she's found brutally stabbed to death after her opening performance at her high school play, no one can believe it. The question on everyone's mind is...Who killed Hattie Hoffman?The story is told from three points of view\u2014Sheriff Del Goodman, Hattie Hoffman, and the new English teacher, Peter Lund. Just like any other small town, Pine Valley has its share of secrets. The story is told from the three perspectives back and forth over the last year. Showing us everything that happened leading up to Hattie's death and the aftermath. Local Sheriff Del Goodman is a friend of the Hoffman's so he is even more invested in finding out what happened. He finds it hard to look his good friend Bud, Hattie's father, in the face as he tries to find who is responsible for this horrific act.Hattie felt like she spent her life playing parts, molding herself into being what everyone wanted her to be. She was tired of being what everyone else wanted her to be. Playing all those different roles can be exhausting. Whether it was pretending to be fearless to ward off an older brothers teasing when she was little to pretending to be interesting in football or the other things her friends were interested in.Deep down she just wanted someone to like her for who she really was. She kept putting on the show waiting for her real life to begin one day.I am going to stop there. Not because I don't have a lot of thoughts about the book, but I just feel like saying much more than I have, would lead to spoiler territory. In this case, with this book, it almost does feel like the less you know the better. I was glad I didn't know much more than this before I started reading.I thought this was a great read...an easy and entertaining read with some great twists and turns that made it hard to put the book down. I liked having no idea what was going to happen. Then all of a sudden I was positive I knew what happened! Oh I thought I was such a smarty pants.... but I was so wrong.

She dreams of becoming an actress, of moving to New York City just after graduation. She already has a plan, even if she doesn't know anyone or have much money. She has the talent and she has the drive, but no one around her, not her friends or her family, really understand why she wants to leave, nor do they want her to go.As her high school career comes to an end, her crowning achievement is starring as Lady Macbeth in her school's production of the Shakespearean tragedy. Her opening night performance was fantastic, and for the first time, people actually started to believe she could make it in New York. But what happened after she left the school after the play? How did she end up murdered?Hattie's small town is rocked by her murder. Things like this just don't happen in this town, which throws Del Goodman, the local sheriff, for a complete loop. Hattie, the daughter of his fishing buddy, is a girl he has known and adored since she was born. As he investigates Hattie's murder, he uncovers as many unanswered questions as he does facts. Was this, as her best friend has suggested, caused by the famous Macbeth \"curse,\" or was someone (or more than person) responsible for snuffing out this promising life?What Del discovers as he digs deeper into the case is that Hattie was not only a talented actress\u2014she was talented at being exactly who everyone needed her to be. The slightly rebellious yet loyal daughter, the perfect girlfriend, the exceptional student, the patient listener and friend, the talented actress. But who was Hattie really, and was this mercurial nature responsible, at least in some way, for instigating her death?\nEverything You Want Me to Be\n is a fascinating, suspenseful portrait of a girl torn between what she wanted and what she thought everyone else wanted her to be. The book is narrated by Hattie, Del, and Peter Lund, Hattie's English teacher, who is reasonably new to town, and it shifts between the months and days leading up to Hattie's murder and the investigation.Mindy Mejia throws in lots of twists and turns, and while the cynical, frequent-mystery-reading me suspected absolutely everyone, I really liked how she let the story unfold. This is a tragedy on many levels, and Mejia's storytelling hooks you from the start and doesn't let you turn away until you see how the book ends. I really enjoyed this and would have devoured it a lot quicker was I not cooking Thanksgiving dinner for 30 people this week!This is definitely a book to pick up, because even though we've seen elements of this plot before, Mejia makes it seem fresh and makes you care about her characters.NetGalley and Atria/Emily Bestler Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

Murder in a small town---splits the community apart ---no matter what the outcome is..... a young girl still died. I found this entire story more sad than I did chilling.For me - it represented the pressures of life - a teenagers life - a couple's life - family life - school community life - suppressed people going through the motions of daily life more numb than thriving. The author, Mindy Mejjia definitely has talent to get into the heads of her characters--and keep us hooked from beginning to end.

This book was much more than I expected. Everything You Want Me to Be is an exceptional debut novel by Mindy Mejia. It\u2019s hard for me to categorize it into a single genre. It has bits of suspense, psychological thriller, police procedural, YA, and family drama, all wrapped up in a big ball of rapid page-turning unputdownability. This is a story told from 3 points of view and in two rather close time frames. We have Hattie, a very unique and quite brilliant high school senior; her AP English teacher, Peter Lund; and sheriff Del Goodman. In chapter 2, someone is found dead. The rest of the story centers on who committed the murder and why it happened. This is NOT, as mentioned above, a simple police procedural; this is an intricately woven tale of love, deceit, loss of control, remorse, sorrow and issues with self-identity (note the title). I was really wrung out at the end of this, in a good way.The characters are wonderfully drawn, especially Hattie and Peter, but the more minor members of the cast are also well characterized. There also are not that many people to keep track of, which is always a plus. The setting was especially meaningful to me--southeast Minnesota, where I have lived for the last 36 years. On many occasions I could clearly visualize where the action was occurring\u2014even that \u201cdirt road off the highway just south of Zumbrota.\u201d The plot mesmerized me. I couldn\u2019t stop turning the pages, not because of unbearable suspense, but because of sheer intrigue. How was this all going to shake out? And even more importantly, what would be the consequences to all involved? Plenty of little bombshells were dropped along the way to blow up my ever-changing theories. And so much to think about as this all played out, including what would I do if I were in the positions some of these people found themselves in.The only thing I can think of to criticize is that at times I got confused as to when in the timeline a specific event occurred. This is a minor complaint. Bottom line is I enjoyed the heck out of this book. It left me with a lump in my throat and much to consider. I highly recommend it to all readers who are looking for a good story.

Hattie is excellent at playing the role of whomever she is \u201cexpected\u201d to be, switching from one persona to the next as a chameleon changes colors. To say Hattie is misunderstood would be an understatement\u2014she\u2019s sort of a contradiction. There isn't a single person Hattie won\u2019t alter herself to please, yet she\u2019s very self-aware and knows exactly where her choices will lead her.(Well, almost.) She is young and erratic, talented and relentless, and she\u2019s harboring one killer of a secret. This story is told in first person and alternates between three narrators, Hattie included. The transitions are smooth and the characters distinct. The plot takes a slow and steady path that leads up to Hattie's death, offering some well-played out twists along the way. I appreciated its focus of self-discovery and self-destruction, and I'd definitely give the ending a mental fist pump. All-in-all, a GOOD read\u2014I liked it, I did.

I\u2019d usually be all judgmental and negative about the situation the characters find themselves in (before the murder), but oh no, the writer, with her knack for creating sympathetic characters, tricked me into accepting\u2014hell, into liking\u2014what\u2019s going on here. When a book challenges my morality, I know it\u2019s a good one. But it\u2019s the superb mystery that is the star here, not morality, so get over it I tell myself.I\u2019m sort of brutal when it comes to reviewing mysteries. I scream I don\u2019t buy that, or man, that\u2019s too predictable, or why do the characters have to be so shallow? But with this book, I don\u2019t need to scream. This is a tight, believable story with good writing and characters you care about.I can\u2019t go so far as to say this is a wow, but it is a first-class murder mystery. I\u2019m always a sucker for people living double lives, and that was part of the intrigue here for sure. I don\u2019t like to talk plot because I prefer to go into a book cold and I figure it\u2019s the same for others. Let me just say there are three narrators: a teenage girl, a teacher, and a cop, all of them well-drawn. There are a couple of minor characters who are really well-drawn too. And lo and behold, the story takes place in a small town, yet I still liked it. (Small towns often bore me or make me claustrophobic.) My ability to accept the small-town locale could be based on the fact that the main character, Hattie, wanted to get out of Dodge. And she had set her sights on New York, which for some reason is a city I idealize myself. The story is told in flashbacks, and the style is effective in painting the story of what was happening before the crime. I\u2019m usually not crazy about cop talk, and here, the cop was my least favorite character. He just seemed blah, and every time I got to him, I was annoyed I had to leave the other two narrators. I can see why the author threw in a cop, though, because it was handy to have someone trying to figure it all out.But boy was I bummed that Hattie died. I grew more and more attached to her. Hattie is brilliant and angsty and passionate and has so much hope for the future. Did the author really have to make her so damn likeable and mesmerizing? Luckily, we learn right away that she dies, so I knew that rooting for her wouldn\u2019t work. Plus, by having her death over with, the author didn\u2019t make me endure the shock and dismay of a cool person dying right after I got to know her.I loved trying to figure out who the murderer was, and I loved it that I was wrong. The book is twisty at the end, sending me down several wrong roads. A good mystery, fast-paced plot, and well-drawn characters, combined with smooth, no-nonsense no-fluff writing, really made the book delicious. I couldn\u2019t put this one down. I\u2019ll be on the lookout for the next book by this new writer, I promise you.Thanks to NetGalley for the advance copy. A totally silly aside (a global complaint board entry):Sorry to be obnoxious, but I have to complain about the trend in titles these days. Just look at how many books have \"you\u201d or \u201cme\u201d in their title\u2014this book has both! And then there\u2019s the ever-popular \u201ceverything,\u201d and yep, that\u2019s here too! Add four teensy (2-letter) words, 6 words altogether, and you have a title that doesn\u2019t come rolling off your tongue or that is memorable in any way. I guess I should be happy that the title doesn\u2019t have \u201cgirl\u201d in it. Now authors, can you please send us back to the good old days and start giving us shorter, simple noun or noun-and-a-verb titles?

The plot of this one sounded like more of the same, high school girl from a small farming town found dead, but..... so many of my trusted friends were giving this four or more stars so I decided to give it a shot. Started reading and the name of the town, Pine Valley jumped out at me, All my Children, soap opera of many years, thought to myself, Please to not let this be soap operish. It. wasn't. The character of Hattie, thespian, so good at so many things, pretending to be whoever the person she was with wanted her to be, beloved of her parents, her dad in particular, how could someone have killed her? Narrated in turns by Hattie herself and two others, we learn of the events leading up to her murder.This was so much more than I expected, better than most I read last year. Hattie herself, such a brilliant characterization, full of teenage angst, but in many ways older than her years. I wanted to dislike her, but couldn't, I understood her, the things she wanted out of life, so much more than that found in her small town. She made for fascinating reading. The other characters, the family friend, police officer, the high school English teacher who wants to be elsewhere, compelling.So I surprised myself by also giving this a high rating, this author can write but more importantly she can put together a story.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "Everything You Want Me to Be\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 Stars!\n\"You say you're just acting, but you're fracturing yourself into a thousand pieces, and every time I see another piece, you're gone again. You turn into someone else, a crowd of someone elses, and it makes me wonder if there's any such thing as Hattie Hoffman\".\nFrom Everything you Want Me To BeI received a free advance e-copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, thank you!********************************************The narrative of this novel revolves around a crucial question: Can we truly get to know someone, or at least a person that is really close to us?At 17, Henrietta (Hattie) Hoffman is one of those precocious teenagers who, in the cusp of adulthood believes she has everything figured out. On the surface Hattie appears to be a well-adjusted girl about to graduate high school. She is talented, popular and looking forward to starting life after school pursuing her dreams of becoming a professional actress.But Hattie possesses two very distinctive qualities: she is a masterful manipulator and is capable of transforming herself into anyone and anything people want her to be. It is not surprising then that Hattie chooses to become an actress: the theater provides the ideal platform to make use of her talents.By the time the curtain of the second chapter opens though, we learn that Hattie's promising life has been tragically cut short. Her body is found in an abandoned barn a few hours after her last performance as Lady Macbeth at her high school auditorium. Everything You Want Me To Be is set in a small town in Minnesota. The story is told in the form of flashbacks narrated by three protagonists: Dell Goodman is the sheriff in charge of investigating the murder, he is also a close friend of the Hoffmans, Peter Lund is Hattie's literature and drama teacher and someone with whom she becomes involves via an internet chat room, lastly Hattie herself is the third narrator. I thought Mejia skillfully made use of this three-part narrative, which not only complement each other but also give the novel a balanced and riveting pace. All three of these characters have distinctive and unique voices, but is no doubt Hattie, who from the very beginning has our undivided attention. The relationship we develop with her is, to put it mildly, complicated. No sooner are we are amused by one of her pranks or charmed by her wit and shrewd sense of humor, than we find ourselves appalled by the great lengths she is willing to go in order to get what she wants.The challenge for an author writing a whodunit is keeping readers engaged once they know what the outcome of the story is (in this case we've learned very early that Hattie is dead). But as suspects emerge, new motives are considered and secrets get revealed, Mejia challenge us with a few morally ambiguous questions. Was Hattie's own arrogance and penchant for conceit the culprit of her own demise? Is she the victim or the villain of this story? At what age is someone completely responsible for her actions?I thoroughly enjoyed the author's sardonic sense of humor as well as the literary references she uses, giving the novel a quirky and charming quality. (As a side note, I think fans will be delighted by the author's obvious reverence for the oldest Bront\u00eb sister and her shout out to Jane Eyre.)There are lots of mysteries thrillers to choose from these days, a plethora of which seem to include the word \"girl\" on the title. And of course by now it has become a clich\u00e9 to name every new thriller the next Gone Girl, but this is one instance in which I think the comparisons to Flynn's \u00fcber popular novel might be actually warranted.Everything You Want Me To Be is one of those deliciously twisted stories that allow us to indulge our morbid tendencies without feeling too guilty about them. So kudos to the author for writing a highly addictive crime mystery that manages to entertain without insulting our intelligence.********************************************One final note for my fellow audiophiles, the audiobook introduced me to three new voices. I especially liked the performances of the two male narrators. The novel's easy-to-follow format and fast pace made for a breezy and enjoyable listening."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12851291-karen", "userReview": "Wow, I would give a 4.5 rating to this book.

In a way she is alive through the investigation that is conducted after she died. I kind of expected the multiple POV that gives us glimpses in the fictional world of Hattie. It has become - for the better or the worse - a staple treatment.I decided in the end that Hattie 'worked' as a goody-two-shoes. We constantly hear about how nice she is, and how much is she sought for her company. It's a new thing for me to read about murder the way it is depicted in the book. It makes for a nice change of lieu from books ranging from thrillers to chick lits.In the end the ambition of the book exceeds its value.

She had her whole life ahead of her, but she chose to live dangerously.....in a world of manipulation.....a world she thought she could control.....until the frightening end.EVERYTHING YOU WANT ME TO BE is the story of Hattie's tumultuous last year of high school told from three different perspectives: County Sheriff Del Goodman, (wanted more of him) aspiring English Processor Peter Lund, and the devilish Hattie herself.

My thanks to Atria Books and to Mindy Mejia for the opportunity.She waited a long time to respond before she wrote, \"You're no worse than me. That's all that matters.\"We long for others to validate, in some way, the very thing that we believe about ourselves. True or untrue. Fact or fiction. We paint upon the walls of our soul, ironically, the only hue that can be recognized solely by our own eyes.Hattie Hoffman is full center stage in what transpires here in tiny Pine Valley, Minnesota. The set has been crafted and aligned by tragic scenes that play to a horrendous final moment. Hattie takes her last breath in the culimnation of this closing act. When her brutalized body is found in an abandoned barn, the community is stunned. Silence.Detective Del Goodman heads the investigation into Hattie's murder. This is the murder of a high school girl who has touched the fringes of eighteen. Hattie's only wish was to take her fine arts acting classes and present them on stage in New York. Professionally, Del knows the procedures. Personally, he has known Hattie since she was a child. Her father, Bud, is a long-time fishing buddie. The paths crisscross throughout the storyline with its heaviness. And like most small towns, the clues are sifted the old-fashioned way.Mindy Mejia presents this story, chapter and verse, through the voices of Hattie, Del, and Peter. Peter and his wife, Mary, have returned to her hometown of Pine Valley when her mother becomes ill. Instead of just finding the body of Hattie in the onset, we are given a more indepth backdrop of the main characters. The story is not merely about Hattie, but Hattie is layered within her own telling. Voice shifts back and forth. That clever technique draws the reader in chapter by chapter.While there were many twists and turns within this storyline, the intensity level was limited. How many avenues of questionable access can you have in such a small town? There could have been a bit more sizzle and heightened anxiety with more unknown than known. Perhaps it may be enough.Everything You Want Me to Be is still a well written story in the hands of Mejia. She's got a handle on the subject matter and has walked around gingerly inside the mind of the young.

Hours after her well-received performance as Lady Macbeth in a high school play, she goes missing. The next day her body is found in an abandoned barn. It turns out that her acting was not just reserved for the stage; the investigation reveals how much of a performance Hattie had been putting on for everyone around her. I\u2019ve always gravitated to the tragedies, where even witches and ghosts couldn\u2019t distract the audience from this central psychological truth: our own natures, we are all inherently doomed. Shakespeare didn\u2019t write anything new. He didn\u2019t invent jealousy, infidelity, or the greed of kings. He recognized evil as timeless and shone a spotlight directly, unflinchingly on it and said, This is what we are and always will be. [Peter] Pine Valley is a farm town where everyone knows each other and nothing ever happens, so the close-knit community is shocked when one of their own is brutally murdered. The plot will be familiar to many, but it\u2019s still an enjoyable and addictive read. The small town investigation isn\u2019t heart-pounding or twisty, but I really liked the steady pace it maintained throughout. The most interesting part was not the investigation, but how the characters confront the situations they end up in. Two of the narrators are well-read and all the literary references (Macbeth, Jane Eyre, V., etc.) add richness to the narrative. It\u2019s interesting how they were able to be so analytical about the lives of fictional characters, yet they still make similar mistakes. \nEvery book changes you in some way, whether it\u2019s your perspective on the world or how you define yourself in relation to the world. Literature gives us identity, even terrible literature.\n The story alternates between three perspectives: \u2022 Hattie, the victim - Her chapters take place over the 2007-2008 school year, her senior year of high school. Her brother Greg was deployed to Afghanistan and the Hoffman's thought Hattie was the child they didn\u2019t have to worry about. They had no idea how many secrets Hattie was keeping. She spent most of her life playing a different character for everyone she encountered, even her family members. Sometimes I got the feeling that I was supposed to see her as a budding sociopath, but most the time she comes across as your average high-achieving, impulsive teenager. She\u2019s more mature than most of her classmates, but her life inexperience is conspicuous. She's manipulative and unrelenting when she wants something. She feels completely in control of her life and those around her, but is she prepared for when people go \"off-script\"? I liked Hattie, but I enjoyed reading about her more through the other character's eyes. One of my favorite lines describing her: \"girl who kept shedding masks like a matryoshka doll, each one more audacious than the last, a psychological striptease that racked me with the need to tear her apart until I found out who or what was inside.\"\u2022 Del, the local sheriff - His chapters take place after Hattie\u2019s death. Del is best friends with Hattie\u2019s dad and has known Hattie since she was born. He faces the challenge of leading an investigation while intimately knowing most of the parties involved. He wrestles with his legal obligations and his duty to his friend. The fact that he's even considering putting his friend first is a huge blow to his self-image as a lawman. \u2022 Peter, new high school English teacher - His chapters take place over the 2007-2008 school year. Peter and his wife moved to Pine Valley from Minneapolis to take care of his ill mother-in-law. He always thought of his wife as a sophisticated urbanite, but she immediately settles back into farm life. His mother-in-law is dismissive of him and he feels like an outsider. He assumed the move was temporary, but there's no end in sight. His repeated attempts to reconnect with his wife are consistently rebuffed and he starts looking for an emotional connection in inappropriate places. Peter had a higher opinion of himself than I did, but I thought he was the most interesting character because he seemed to have the furthest to fall. I successfully predicted how his story would play out, but it was still fascinating to watch him circle an ethical line.  A child with a woman\u2019s body. [Hattie] didn\u2019t even know how young she was. She probably thought she was grown up and ready for the world, with her acting career and her endless quips and comebacks and that brain that soaked up everything around her. She probably thought there were only a few years between us, but it was a lifetime\u2014dark, undiscovered caverns of disappointment and compromises. She was the adult idealized. I was the adult that really happened. In Everything You Want Me To Be, desire and hubris become the characters' undoing. They make choices they know are wrong and succumb to temptation despite being cognizant of the potential consequences. Identity also plays a huge part. Hattie wears many masks, often to elicit specific behaviors from others. Can you spend your life pretending to be someone else without losing yourself? Other characters either become someone they don't recognize or watch someone they thought they knew morph into a completely different person. Can you ever truly know anyone\u2014even yourself? Do we all have a dark side? I\u2019m always going to be drawn to stories about the dark side that most people keep hidden and the secrets in a small town! I\u2019d rate it a little lower if I was only thinking about plot, but all the other elements elevated it for me. I'll be anxiously awaiting Mindy Mejia's next book! Books I thought about while reading:\u2022 Everything I Never Told You: the title, a teenager who was pretending to be someone she wasn't, a broken marriage between two people who want different things, and the addictive quality of the writing. Admittedly, EINTY is on a completely different level (mystery isn\u2019t the first word that comes to mind when I think of it), but the part of me that loved reading EINTY liked Everything You Want to Be. \u2022 Theme-wise it reminded me of Tana French\u2019s The Trespasser, the disastrous consequences of trying to exert extreme control over your life and treating other people like puppets. \u2022 Cruel Beautiful World: Some of the character dynamics. ______________I received this book for free from Netgalley and Atria/Emily Bestler Books.

Like so many teenagers living in small towns, 18-year-old Hattie Hoffman wanted out of Pine Valley. Specifically, she wanted to go to New York City, where she envisioned acting on Broadway. Instead, she ended up stabbed to death in a barn weeks before graduation after a rave performance as Lady Macbeth in the play. From the points of view of the town sheriff and the obvious suspect, Hattie\u2019s English teacher, as he stumbles through his predictably crumbling marriage. Hattie is a master manipulator, so much so that it\u2019s often difficult to believe she\u2019s only 18; when the flirtation with teacher Peter Lund, which begins online, blossoms into a full-blown affair, it\u2019s frustrating that the adult appears to be the one for whom the author is trying to elicit more sympathy rather than the high school student with whom he's having sex. Sheriff Del Goodman functions less as a character and more as a vehicle to move the story along: someone has to solve Hattie\u2019s murder, so it may as well be him. In the year leading up to her death, as Hattie prepares her grand exit, her death seems inevitable not owing to the way she lived.I feel that the title explains Hattie's character. She is a people pleaser and for each individual she was everything they wanted her to be.Quotes from the book:Every book changes you in some way, whether it\u2019s your perspective on the world or how you define yourself in relation to the world.\u201d \u201cMOST PEOPLE think acting is make-believe. Like it\u2019s a big game where people put on costumes and feign kisses or stab wounds and then pretend to gasp and die. They think it\u2019s a show. They don\u2019t understand that acting is becoming someone else, changing your thoughts and needs until you don\u2019t remember your own anymore. You let the other person invade everything you are and then you turn yourself inside out, spilling their identity onto the stage like a kind of bloodletting.\u201dI thought this was very well written. I really dont know how I really feel about this book. It was good but I really don't like dramatic love triangles. I was intrigued and couldn't put it down.

She has played a variety of roles in her life, and can easily transform herself into the person people want her to be. She\u2019s a good daughter to her parents, a good friend, a sweet girlfriend, a good student\u2026 But, when she is found brutally stabbed to death, the shocking facts about her secret life come bubbling to the surface and will shock the town and devastate lives for a long time to come.  Peter, who is Hattie\u2019s high school English teacher, gives us his perspective, as he explains how he came to live in Pine Valley with his wife, Mary. Mary\u2019s mother is gravely ill, but she refuses to sell the farm, leaving Mary no choice but to stay and take care of her and the farm. Peter, however, feels like an outsider as Mary\u2019s focus on her mother\u2019s health becomes morosely obsessive, leaving little room for Peter. Del is the head of Pine Valley law enforcement and walks us through the investigation into Hattie\u2019s murder. His story is raw, and conflicting as he must maintain professionalism while delivering bad news to one of his best friends and grieve the loss of a girl he watched grow up. But, the most haunting voice is Hattie\u2019s, who tells us her story posthumously. She\u2019s a chameleon in many ways, a teenager with a bright future, a little too advanced for her small-town classmates and friends, who needs more a challenge. She has big dreams and hopes and nothing is going to get in her way of what she wants...For me, this story was deeply absorbing and hard to put down. The focus is firmly on the characterizations, but that doesn\u2019t compromise the mystery and suspense elements. There is an understated quality to the story, as it moves toward what appears to be an inevitable outcome. I was so consumed by the characters\u2019 emotions and actions, I never saw the twists coming. But, once they start, they just keep coming, with one shock wave after another.

High school senior Henrietta \"Hattie\" Hoffman loves literature and the theatre and is desperate to leave her rural Minnesotan hometown behind to start an acting career in her dream place, New York City. At school, at home, in her community, Hattie doesn't feel she fits in and has been acting her entire life. She's very successful at playing the parts and being everything everybody else wants her to be, but she \"would never become the role\". Hattie is murdered on the first night she plays Lady Macbeth in her school production. Mirroring Shakespeare's tragedy, was Hattie's desire her undoing in the end? In addition to Hattie's first-person perspective, we hear from Del Goodman, the town's sheriff, who is also a good friend of Hattie's Dad and has known Hattie all her life, and from Peter Lund, the high school English teacher, who recently left Minneapolis at his wife's request to move in with his mother-in-law whose health was rapidly deteriorating. The 3 different first-person perspectives and the time switches between spring 2008 and summer/fall 2007 worked very well here and didn't create any confusion. I enjoyed following each of these tormented characters' perspectives and found them pretty balanced, in the way that each character had positive as well as negative traits, which helped to make them realistic and I could relate to some aspects of all their lives. The writing sucked me in right from the start and the way the plot unfolded was exceptional. The last 40% were unputdownable and I chose to ignore life around me until I got to the end. It was extremely easy to engage with these characters and to become emotionally involved in everything that was happening in this small town. A few unexpected twists, the fantastic character-driven plot, accomplished writing, and the questions it raised in my mind about relationships and life, in general, made this into a story that will stay with me for a while.

It's rare for me to read this genre (I'm a romance reader) but I'd highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great murder mystery novel!!!\u279c http://amzn.to/2iON7tW"}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\"Most people think acting is make-believe...They don't understand that acting is becoming someone else, changing your thoughts and needs until you don't remember your own anymore. You let the other person invade everything you are and then you turn yourself inside out, spilling their identity onto the stage like a kind of bloodletting. Sometimes I think acting is a disease, but I can't say for sure because I don't know what it's like to be healthy.\"\u2013HattieThis book was a steady, subtle joy to read. I can't begin to count how many literary mysteries and thrillers I've read, so it's always nice to not guess the ending correctly. Its structure is also unique\u2013told from differing perspectives, and beginning in the presents then working from the past back\u2013made it easy to breeze through. Equally fabulous were all the literary allusions, characters that were book nerds, and the setting admidst a couple of theater plays like Jane Eyre and Macbeth. The main character, Hattie, has always felt like a big fish in a little pond in her rural Minnesotan farming community. She has big ambitions, and staying in Pine Valley is not one of them. Two months shy of graduating from high school, Hattie is inexplicably found murdered. Split into different narratives, including that of the local Sheriff who is uncovering unsavory truths in order to reveal a local killer, and that of Hattie herself months before her death, it's only a matter of entries before the truth is revealed. Hard to put down. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/EverythingGIRL You Want Me To Be (name change courtesy of Ron 2.0 because really this is one of those times where it actually might be \u201cthe next Gone Girl\u201d or Girl on the Train or some such GIRL story) already has people talking. And for good reason. Have you ever read a Megan Abbott or some similar author/story about an awful teenage girl and think to yourself \u201cman, I wish someone would just kill that little be-atch?\u201d If so, this is the book for you because the MC gets offed in the second chapter! That made Mitchell and me look a lil\u2019 like this . . . . \nThe story here is about Hattie (soon to be dead Hattie YIPPEEEEEE!) and how she met the love of her life on the magical intertubes . . . . \nIn this case maybe more of an accidental Humbert Humbert. You see, Hattie\u2019s virtual flame becomes a red hot inferno of reality once Hattie puts two-and-two together and realizes she\u2019s been making the sext with her English teacher. Good ol\u2019 teach attempts to put the kibosh on things (mainly so his wife doesn\u2019t catch wind of what he\u2019s really been \u201cworking\u201d on in his home office every night), but Hattie isn\u2019t on board with that plan . . . \n (^^^But with less rabbit boiling.)I know what you\u2019re thinking. You already know who did it and what\u2019s the point in reading this and it\u2019s another stupid ass thriller that won\u2019t thrill you at all and wordswordswordswords. Normally I\u2019d agree with you because I bat about .300 when it comes to finding thrillers that meet my standards. And this one isn\u2019t perfect. Without spoiling things I\u2019ll tell you the book had a very clear ending point for me and I was all . . . . . \nIt was the ending that made the most sense/the one you would declare you saw coming, but it was done in an absolutely delicious manner. But then there were more pages. Shelby (who gets credit for strong-arming me into all of my recent NetGalley requests \u2013 especially this one because Atria is well aware of the fact that I read everything wrong and never approves me so I wasn\u2019t even going to waste the effort of clicking the button), Jan and Michelle all flipped their wigs over this one and gave it the full monty of Stars. Y\u2019all know I\u2019m horrible so I\u2019m sticking at 4 rather than 5 due to the (in my opinion unnecessary) additional twists and turns. But we\u2019re talking a solid 4 Stars. Mindy Mejia did an excellent job of writing three very distinct narrators. And Hattie??????\n\u201cI\u2019m good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You\u2019ll see.\u201d\nShe was indeed everything girl I wanted her to be.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

To her friends, Hattie is the perfect listener who is always there for them. To her boyfriend, she's the sweet and loving girl, too pure and hesitant to \"go all the way.\" To Peter Lund, her high school English teacher, she is a predator, an over-sexed sociopath who will stop at nothing to have him. And goodness help him; he wants to let her.To Sheriff Del Goodman, Hattie Hoffman is a murder victim. Someone stabbed this eighteen-year-old budding actress and threw her into a lake one chilly, Minnesotan night. But who? The key to finding her killer is in discovering the true Hattie Hoffman-- someone not even she knew until it was too late.This is one of the best thrillers I've read in a long time. Hattie is such a complex, fantastic character. I rooted for her. I wanted to strangle her. Del is the perfect hard boiled detective, in that rural mid-west kind of way.One of the reasons I've soured on psychological thrillers is that the plots have become increasingly sadistic and improbable in order to earn the distinction of the twist you'll never see coming! This book manages to be completely surprising and suspenseful in a manner that's also realistic. The writing quality surpasses most others in the genre.

Told from three viewpoints, the girl\u2019s and Peter, her English teacher pre- death and Del, the sheriff investigating the the murder. Hattie was anxious to get away from her small town and had actually tried to run away right before she was murdered. Peter and Hattie are both fish out of water, not fitting into life in their small town. The author does a great job of rounding out both characters, making them believable. Hattie is an actress, but thinks she needs to act in all parts of her life, not just on the stage. I just read a wonderful quote in another book to the effect that it's not what is said that dooms a marriage but what is left unsaid. This is certainly true of Peter and Mary. More than just your typical mystery, there is a lot of character development in this book. It still manages to be very suspenseful. A well written novel and one that I recommend. My thanks to netgalley and Atria/Emily Bestler books for an advance copy of this book."}], "description": "No one knows who she really is\u2026Hattie Hoffman has spent her whole life playing many parts: the good student, the good daughter, the good girlfriend.
