I couldn't tell you where exactly this sudden interest came from, but I have lately found myself following the news about Iran, and asking my grandparents about the old country, and, of course, reading a lot of novels by Iranian-American authors. What I'm trying to say, in short, is that I was primed to like this book. I'd heard about it months ago, when the author was awarded a six-figure advance by Dial, and when my girlfriend managed to get her hands on a galley*, I dove into it almost right away. But the book, unfortunately, is bad. And not, mind you, bad in a failed-to-meet-expectations way (it's bad in that way too, but more to the point), but bad in a \"show-don't-tell,\" Creative Writing 101 way. DARIUS THE GREAT IS NOT OKAY by Adib Khorram follows the story of Darius, a teenager living in Washington state, born to an Iranian mother and a white father. Darius is a self-identified Treckie, and in stereotypically Treckie fashion, falls prey to the usual social pitfalls: he's picked on by his classmates in school, he has a difficult time making friends, and he is frustrated over and over by his own inability to read (as he refers to them with annoying frequency) \"Social Cues\"**. The first third of the book is spent establishing Darius' social ineptitude, and of course, his Persianness. And here enters one of the author's greatest failings in this novel: it's as though instead of building a convincing, three-dimensional character by perfecting a voice and ascribing to that character compelling idiosyncrasies, and establishing the character's nuanced worldview, Khorram has seen fit to simply make the character Persian.Indeed, the most interesting thing about Darius is that he's Persian. His obsession with tea, his longing to learn Farsi, his takes on Nowruz and Persian cuisine... such are the dubious foundations on which Darius is constructed. Take away the Persianness, and who is Darius? Well, for an idea, let's take a look at a typical conversation had by Darius and another character:\"Did you have a nice time, maman?\" [My grandmother asked me]\"Yeah. Um. Babou showed me Darius the first.\"\"Where your name came from.\"I nodded.\"I wish you had seen it sooner. I wish you lived here.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes, of course. I miss you. And I wish you could know your family history better. You know, for Yazdis, family history is very important.\"\"Um.\"*** Without his Persianness, in other words, Darius is a socially isolated, monosyllabic, and not-very-well-defined character. Which is not only a writerly failing on Khorram's part, but somewhat sociopolitically problematic. I am, on the one hand, cheered by the proliferation of Iranian-American literature since the advent of the Trump era, and on the other hand, a little concerned by the commoditization and solidification of the Iranian-American identity, of which Khorram seems guilty here****.With his Persian identity and his extreme social awkwardness established, then, it is quickly learned that Darius' grandfather (still living in Iran) has a terminal brain tumor and is quickly approaching the end of his life. In the span of 20 or so pages, Darius' mother decides to take the family to her hometown of Yazd for a week, so that the children can meet their grandfather before he passes.This potentially rich and moving plotline, however, turns out to be a McGuffin for the real story at the heart of DARIUS THE GREAT, in which Darius finally finds a friend in Sohrab, his grandfather's neighbor's child. Sohrab is a charming, athletic boy around Darius' age, with a winning smile (repeatedly referred to as a \"squint\"). Sohrab is nonetheless socially outcast due to local prejudice against Bah\u00e1'\u00eds as well as the fact that his father was taken political prisoner during the Green Revolution protests that took place several years before the novel is set. After a meet-cute involving a post-soccer-game shower*****, Sohrab and Darius find themselves \"joined at the shoulder,\" and (without any spoilers), the most probable narrative arc unfolds from there: there are confidences, moments of adorable whimsy, fights and reconciliations. In other words, not exactly the kind of stakes that are going to blow anyone away.The novel is, in short, a fluff piece, easy to read and easy to forget. Which might be fine if the prose wasn't so clumsy and poorly composed. See, for instance, Khorram's habit of using unnecessary line breaks to make overly simple thoughts sound profound******. Or the annoying repetition of certain phrases, which are again presumably supposed to make up for the lack of work done to characterize Darius (see especially, \"That's normal./Right?\" and \"Soulless Minions of Orthdoxy,\" which is how Darius refers to bullies and is amusing the first time but less so the two-dozenth time).Again, it's not that the book is bad relative to other published novels. It's that the book is so bad, it's difficult to understand how exactly it got published in the first place. It's repetitive and clumsily written and, despite the large font size and generous spacing of the physical text, somehow a chore to read--it took me weeks to get through this. And moreover, there's a hollowness and empty sentimentality at the novel's core that not only fails to make any meaning of the Persian-American experience, but makes the reader feel kind of sad and betrayed at the hands of Khorram.So, if you're looking for a good Persian-American novel in this age of American hostility towards Middle Easterners, might I direct you to Porochista Khakpour's brilliant  Sons and Other Flammable Objects?*A request is made at the beginning of the galley to note somewhere in any reviews of the book that my copy was an uncorrected proof, so consider that noted.**Darius spends so much time thinking about whether certain utterances or actions of those around him are \"Social Cues\" (capitalization sic), that the reader occasionally wonders whether or not Darius is on the Spectrum, but there's no definitive evidence one way or the other. (Likely, it's simply a failure of Khorram's to develop Darius' voice: in general, one of the things that irked me about the book is the way Khoram totally failed to nail the voice of the contemporary American teenager. Darius is supposed to be about 14 or 15, but he often comes off sounding about three or four years younger).***Not to harp on the possible-autism thing, but Darius is more or less this non-verbal throughout the novel, again making one wonder... ****Not to mention the slightly offensive and patronizing attitude of the publishing industry through all of it; I very much doubt this novel would have earned its six-figure advance had the 2016 US Presidential election turned out differently.*****Another thing that's left frustratingly opaque is the homoerotic tension between Darius and Sohrab. It's never said explicitly that Darius is queer, but there are a few heavily suggestive moments. There is, for instance, the aforementioned shower scene, in which Sohrab and a few other boys make fun of Darius' uncircumcised penis. This is in addition to the curious frequency with which S and D get touchy-feely with each other (Sohrab is perpetually putting his arm around Darius' shoulder) and the endless physical descriptions of Sohrab related to the reader by Darius (e.g., \"He was kicking his soccer ball around... barefoot and shirtless. Sweat plastered his short hair to his temples, and the nape of his neck.\") And finally, there's a \"resources\" page at the end of the novel, directing readers to organizations like The Trevor Project and The Trans Lifeline... Khoram might have been able to pull off this ambiguity (again, not un-problematic, considering the perils of being queer in Iran's Islamic Republic) had the rest of the novel contained any kind of nuance. DARIUS, though, is otherwise as subtle as a seizure.*****Thumbing through the book at random here, e.g.: \"He felt safe with me/Maybe that's the thing I liked about Sohrab best of all,\" \"Mom was calling me by my Iranian name/I wished she would make up her mind,\"That night, Dad didn't tell me he loved me/I didn't tell him either.\""}, {"userName": "Rachel Strolle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43164358-rachel-strolle", "userReview": "It's been longer than normal since I've read a book in one sitting.

In case you can't tell, this debut has a lot going for it, including the way it just dips its toe into the main character questioning his sexuality. (I think it was the press materials that came with the ARC that call it a pre-coming out story, and that's pretty spot on, though to call it a queer book feels like pushing Darius out of the closet, or something.)There are a few books lately that've just done such a beautiful job chipping away at toxic masculinity, and I'm so glad to see this one among them."}, {"userName": "Vicky Who Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57349823-vicky-who-reads", "userReview": "Vicky is not okay.

Through fiction we can gain insight and understanding of other cultures, essential in working towards a peaceful world. When his Persian mother gets word that her father is dying, high school sophomore Darius, his sister, Laleh, and their parents make the long journey from Portland, Oregon to Yzad in central Iran. Darius\u2019s vision of Iran expands from his grandparent\u2019s faces on the computer screen to a world where the houses and the trees aren\u2019t so different from the ones in Portland. But he quickly realizes that while the kids at his high school perceive Darius as Iranian, to Persians he\u2019s an American. And it turns out he\u2019s not so great with social cues in either country. He speaks a bit of Farsi, but not enough to have a conversation, and he sometimes forgets to taarof, the custom of repeated saying no thank you, even when you might mean yes, please. His relationship with his grandfather mirrors the one Darius has with his American father. Darius is convinced they both see him as nothing but an awkward disappointment. Added to his problems is a struggle with depression that makes Darius question if his dad even loves him. While working through issues of family connections and identity, Darius unexpectedly makes friends with his grandparent's neighbor, a boy whose genuine kindness leaves Darius rethinking everything from his shaky relationship with his father to his views about playing soccer. DARIUS THE GREAT IS NOT OKAY is a much-needed novel about identity, depression, and finding connections not just among your peers but also within your own family. Teens will love the detailed observations Darius makes about the world around him and his humorous descriptions of the people he meets, proving that even through the lens of depression the world can still be an amusing place. Be prepared to learn a lot about Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings, savory Persian food, and how to put hell in a cup of tea and damn it. While the author does a fantastic job of developing all his characters, my favorite is a dancing electric fan (no spoilers here - read the book to find out why!)"}, {"userName": "Alex Morra", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58648787-alex-morra", "userReview": "What to Expect: A story about a boy and not just any boy. This is a boy who is an undesirable and, simultaneously, unapologetically himself. When he goes to Iran, a place people in his social circle consider his home but a country he has never been in, he meets his grandparents and a boy named Sohrab, who teaches him more about love than he has ever known. Chock full of reflections about being depressed, overweight, bi-racial, gay, and unfriended. I cried at least three times. I smiled more often than that. Darius the Great Is Not Okay is the lead contender for my fave YA book released in 2018.Review: Darius or Darioush: Two names from two locations, historical names for a contemporary boy. Neither is one he can live up to. Many years ago, I went to a retreat. In California. Where I am from and, perhaps, should have seen the following coming. The facilitator put us in pairs for an exercise involving staring into each other\u2019s eyes until we were overcome by each other\u2019s beauty. All around me, people sighed in wonder, transcendent. Me, though? Well, there was nothing wrong with my partner. They were fine. Eyes, like most, were interesting. Even pretty. However, there wasn\u2019t anything particularly self-revealing about the green-brown pair of irises, or the deep chasm of each pupil. I couldn\u2019t, however, fake some matching ecstasy to what I perceived was happening around me. My partner was understandably upset. The facilitator both frustrated and disappointed in me. I was supposed to notice something and this was supposed to make my partner feel beautiful. This experience has haunted me ever since.However.Adib Khorram has been able to give me a way into that experience in a way that facilitator hadn\u2019t. In this book, there was no question that Darius/Darioush isn\u2019t someone who can be perceived as beautiful at a glance. In fact, he was so very other, the opposite is true. From his frizzy hair to his plump body, his incessant self-defeat, the fact of his depression, he is always outside of that which is valued. Even his father is against him, always picking at him, trying to make him more than he is. Nevertheless, he remains unapologetically himself. Even when those around him ascribe different traits or histories or possibilities to him on his own behalf.Then he goes to Iran.His grandfather, whom he\u2019d never met in person, his ill. This side of his family had only been accessible to him via video calls, as two-dimensional as the screen they shared once a week. The other side of his family\u2014his father\u2019s side\u2014so coldly Teutonic, he couldn\u2019t really imagine much different. However, when he lands in Iran, it is like Dorothy landing in Oz with emotion in technicolor. Needless to say, nothing is as he expected. When he leaves, he is changed. Not because anything, in particular, is different other than the fact he is loved and he the way he knows it is like nothing he has experienced before. This book touched me in a way I have no words for. Khorram took advantage so many paper cuts to find his way into my psyche: from how Darius was watched with judgment, for how he was betrayed and embarrassed, to how the most unexpected moments brought him to an unwelcome pleasure of being seen. Those first moments of love felt like splinters: real and painful. What you may not like: \u00a0I mean\u2026there were certain instances in which the ruthlessness and horribleness that is impossible to avoid if you happen to be human rears its ugly head. Almost everyone had a hand in doing things to each other that were Not Nice (TM). These events were hard to read. But they were authentic, touching, and written so beautifully. What you will love: \u00a0The description of Iran as seen with a Western eye from the lush gardens to the fan displaying some level of consciousness to the love of football to heaving tables of luscious, glorious food. This was described as a place where unlikely miracles happen. It wasn\u2019t just Darius going on a journey, it was Khorram bringing the reader along for a diesel-burping, fig tree laden, alabaster tower, teenage-angst ridden ride. Also, just because Darius is openly gay doesn\u2019t mean this book will include a romance. Darius\u2019 identity as a gay man threads in the background but never quite makes it to the forefront of discussion, aside from moments of his coming out and moments when he wonders about those around him. I loved that. Personally, I can\u2019t think of any other contemporary book in which romantic love and/or coming-of-age sex doesn\u2019t play a pivotal role in the plot; this fills a necessary gap. It\u2019s a beautiful example of coming into one\u2019s complete identity and of how one can be complete without having to be in or out of a romantic/sexual relationship.Have I mentioned this is very likely my favorite book of 2018?"}, {"userName": "London Shah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67523306-london-shah", "userReview": "I finished Khorram's DARIUS THE GREAT IS NOT OKAY last night and goodness <3 This is such a profoundly affirming book, most especially for anyone who's ever not felt quite at home, and/or comfortable enough in their own skin.

Khorram\u2019s Darius is a wonderfully flawed and honest character, and his perspective on his family and Sohrab are beautiful in their openness.
