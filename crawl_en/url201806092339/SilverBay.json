It was beautiful, heartbreaking, and completely unputdownable. This one had a very different feel and I had a difficult time getting into the story.\"Silver Bay\" is a slow-paced women's fiction book that focuses on life in a sleepy seaside town. Much of the book's plot revolves around the local marine life in Silver Bay, and there were some beautiful, atmospheric descriptions of the setting. There is also an undercurrent of unrequited love, secrecy, and loss that gives the book an extra punch of emotion. No one could call this book uncomplicated. There are love triangles and people pining after each other over years and decades. There is family drama galore. However, despite all of these seemingly interesting details, this book is still painfully and endlessly slow. I mean, it clocks in at over 400 pages and it dragged on and on for me. I had a few main issues with this book, other then the pace, that I'll bring up. First of all, there were about 1,000 points of view (I think in reality there were six) and I thought that that was about four POVs too many. I don't like head-hopping. It takes me out of the emotion of the scene and it makes it difficult for me to follow at times. I thought it weighed down the story and interrupted the flow. The story was also very predictable. The plot twists were nowhere near twisty enough! I could guess what was about to happen, or thereabouts, 90% of the time. It was a little \"done\" for my taste.Finally, I didn't see why everyone was so enamored with Liza. She seemed like an emotionally distant user to me, and I had a difficult time seeing how she managed to rope in so much attention. I had trouble relating to her and, though she had a horrible past, empathizing with her. The romance in particular was very underdeveloped for me. I didn't see or feel the connection and I was unsure how the \"love\" had come about.Overall, this book was not what I was expecting following Me Before You. I think I wanted something more and what I got was dull and predictable. **Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "As in many aspects of my life, I need to modernise! This one was a CD audio, but missed a chapter or too as it was bumpy. I\u2019m used to this happening with the kids DVD\u2019s all the time, BUT NOT MY BOOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH!Another enjoyable contemporary read, I have read a few like this lately. This is nowhere in the league of The Ship of Brides but it was good for what it was. A nice enjoyable story covering various issues of the day \u2013 conservation, domestic violence, ethics and property development and greed. This little fictional town is based near where my parents moved in their retirement after Sydney suburban living, which was nice to recognise, and another real coastal town where we have holidayed numerous times was also mentioned \u2018Salamander Bay\u2019. This is a great part of the Australian coast line.My interest waned at times, and I also thought the epilogue was a tad long. I do however recommended this as a nice light read, a holiday one would be perfect if this is the way you like to read when you have a short break from the real world. It also would be enjoyed by those who like reading about Australia and its down to earth people characters. It doesn\u2019t push any boundaries and leaves you satisfied, which is a good thing."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "This is a book about a family of women and the man who inadvertently falls in love with all of them. No, it's not as creepy as it sounds. Mike is a big shot developer for a London based company. He's sent to Silver Bay to scope out this quaint little seaside town as a potential spot for a major resort.The tiny inn that he stays in is also the home of Kathleen, Liza, and Hanna...Aunt, Mother, and daughter. Kathleen is a seventy six year old \"shark girl\"...her claim to fame...Liza runs a whale/dolphin watching boat and raises her eleven year old daughter Hannah. These women have secrets, but none so big as Liza. She puts on a strong woman front but is somehow fragile and secretive. \"There is nothing redemptive about the loss of a child, no lessons of value it can teach you. It is too big, too overwhelming, too black to articulate. It is a bleak, overwhelming physical pain, shocking in its intensity, and every time you think you might have moved forward an inch it swells back, like a tidal wave, to drown you again.\"It was interesting watching Mike's protective man instincts come out while around Liza. For me, that's what this book centered around...how this man was changed by living a slow paced lifestyle where cell phones and internet are scoffed at, where life is lived without rushing for monetary gain. These women just live. Their needs are simple, their pasts are not, and Mike falls in love with it all. Problem is, Mike has a fiancee and an extremely lucrative job back home, not to mention the fact that the wheels are set in motion for this project to go through. \"People in Silver Bay weren't the agitating kind. The sea does that to you: living so close to something over which you have no control can make you fatalistic.\"I really connected with this story, and usually women's fiction just doesn't do it for me. But the way Moyes alludes to motherhood...those subtle nuances that made Liza too human to be the perfect mother...spoke to me. Her secrets are real doozies, and they have shaped her entire life and the life of her daughter. And as things start to unravel, I fell in love with them all just as Mike does. My only complaint is that I felt like there were some loose ends that needed wrapped up better. Namely, the other men in Liza's life...romantic and not. Their stories were left hanging. I also thought that there were too many points of view. Six, to be exact, and two of them got a single chapter and that was it. If you're important enough to get a chapter, you're important enough to be included in the ending.The ending is a bit predictable but still very good. This was my first book by Jojo Moyes but I'll make sure to read her others now. It made me laugh, definitely had me in tears more than once, and left me with a sense of satisfaction of a wonderful, thought provoking story.

There were a lot of twists and turns I didn\u2019t see coming, and the story made me tear up several times.Mike comes to Silver Bay in Australia intent on building a huge 5-star hotel that emphasizes water sports like water skiing and jet skiing in the bay.

This one is about a small community in Australia whose welfare is based on whale watching. A large developer decides to built an enormous facility that will change the whole community and the locals lives forever. Unfortunately the man sent by the developer falls in love with the place as it is and then helps the locals fight it.As usual Moyes' strength is in creating characters that feel real and quirky and with whom the reader is engaged. In this particular book there are several threads running alongside eachother and at times different stories come to the fore. The side characters of an elderly aunt and her love life were the most amusing and endearing to me rather than the rather predictable main love interest. However the location of Australia, the details of whales, dolphins and their environment were deftly handled.Good beach read."}, {"userName": "Carina Carvalho", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37217244-carina-carvalho", "userReview": "Ao ler um livro de Jojo Moyes irei sempre procurar a emo\u00e7\u00e3o que vivi ao ler o \"viver depois de ti\".

When he checks into the Silver Bay hotel, he meets Liza McCullen, her daughter Hanna, and her aunt Miss Kathleen that run the hotel. Mike is careful not to reveal his true intentions for staying at Silver Bay and this ultimately allows him to get to know the inhabitants of this town and the rich history that adds to its charm.When the plans are revealed to the townies, Mike Dormer is met with their feelings of betrayal. He ultimately attempts to find a way to right his wrongs without revealing some of the past that might hurt those he\u2019s come to care for.Silver Bay is character driven with so many unique voices. The plot and steady narrative kept me engaged and once again it was a true pleasure to ride along this journey as Moyes weaved her tale about a bay side Australian town that was rich with history and populated with a cast of unforgettable townies.This story also included a meaningful element of how the sea life would be affected by a vacation resort. To learn about the whales and dolphins that inhabited Silver Bay added even more depth to this novel, and I appreciated how Moyes weaved that into her story.Overall, I enjoyed Silver Bay quite a bit and I can\u2019t wait to jump into another novel by Jojo Moyes."}, {"userName": "Filipa", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6261737-filipa", "userReview": "\"Silver Bay\" \u00e9 uma localidade com um carinho muito especial pela vida mar\u00edtima que por ali passa e que assim faz o sustento de pessoas que fazem disso o seu trabalho.

Recunosc c\u0103 nu am vrut s-o mai citesc dup\u0103 \u00cenainte s\u0103 te cunosc, pentru c\u0103 devenise mult prea comercial\u0103. \u00cens\u0103 acum, cu Silver Bay, parc\u0103 am redescoperit-o.Jojo Moyes poveste\u0219te frumos, te prinde imediat, te lini\u0219te\u0219te \u0219i te umple de frumos. Silver Bay e un roman simplu, despre rela\u021biile dintre oameni, despre conexiunea lor cu natura \u0219i cu tot ce a l\u0103sat Dumnezeu. E plin de tandre\u021be \u0219i sensibilitate, cu ni\u0219te personaje frumos construite, cu multe slabiciuni \u0219i defecte, \u00eens\u0103 umane \u0219i pline de dragoste. Cel mai mult mi-a pl\u0103cut atmosfera. Romanul a fost ca o gur\u0103 de aer \u00eentr-o perioad\u0103 aglomerat\u0103. De mult\u0103 vreme nu m-a mai relaxat \u0219i lini\u0219tit at\u00e2t de tare un roman. Ac\u021biunea e previzibil\u0103, da, \u00eens\u0103 tocmai asta \u00eel umple de farmec. Nu trebuie s\u0103 \u00ee\u021bi faci scenarii, nu e genul de roman care s\u0103 te fac\u0103 s\u0103 dai pagin\u0103 dup\u0103 pagin\u0103, s\u0103 te g\u00e2ndesti tot timpul la el sau s\u0103 \u00ee\u021bi dea de g\u00e2ndit. E un roman pe care trebuie s\u0103 \u00eel sim\u021bi. S\u0103 sim\u021bi atmosfera din Silver Bay, lini\u0219tea, valurile m\u0103rii, sunetele balenelor, veselia delfinilor, plajele \u00eentinse cu nisip auriu, ging\u0103\u0219ia Hannei \u0219i durerea Lizei, \u00een\u021belepciunea lui Kate \u0219i glumele lui Greg, totul formeaz\u0103 un tablou perfect. Mi-a pl\u0103cut alegerea titlului, pentru c\u0103 sugereaz\u0103 exact ideea romanului. Romanul nu prezint\u0103 drama Lizei \u0219i nici povestea ei de dragoste cu Mike, ci Silver Bay, comunitatea de pe malul oceanului, plin\u0103 de oameni simpli, care iubesc \u0219i protejeaz\u0103 ce le-a d\u0103ruit Dumnezeu.

Truth be told, this garners a rating of 4.75 stars, if we're trying to be accurate. But Moyes has a way with words that just draws a reader in. In Silver Bay, she brings to life a story that is quiet, haunting and very emotional. Beautifully written, and I'm glad I stayed up to finish it in the wee hours of the morning.REVIEW:(Originally posted on Alexa Loves Books)While it does start out slow, don\u2019t let Silver Bay fool you. There\u2019s a story both engaging and emotional in the pages of this novel, and really, it\u2019s the kind of tale that won\u2019t let you look away till the very end. Moyes\u2019 writing is, as it was in Me Before You, just so good. The steady flow of words forms the reader\u2019s impression of the setting and the characters genuinely well; these same words reel readers into a story fraught with complications and emotions both good and bad. It was so easy to care about these characters, particularly the four main ones: curious, clever Hannah; complicated, cautious Liza; strategic, serious Mike; warm, welcoming Kathleen. Moyes works her magic, inviting readers to fall in love with everything about this story. And fall I did, as Silver Bay, once I\u2019d passed a certain number of pages, kept me up until 3AM in the hopes of discovering everyone\u2019s fate. It might only be my second Moyes novel, but it\u2019s definitely a sound recommendation to continue immersing myself in her body of work."}, {"userName": "Kristy Dr\u00e1\u017eovsk\u00e1", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28043712-kristy-dr-ovsk", "userReview": "Vlastne ani neviem \u010do poveda\u0165...

It was slow to start off and many nights, I read only a few pages before I fell asleep so it didn't captivate me until about the middle. it started to get some flesh on it's bones and then I really began to enjoy it. It had a slow start as I said but it's redeeming qualities were the likeable and the antagonistic characters and the fact that it picked up and was a page turner and I book I didn't want to put down.We are introduced to all of the characters, sort of one chapter a a time as the story is told through the views of each of the main characters, each one getting a full chapter, bouncing back and forth to show the different opposing views of what is going on in Silver Bay. I liked that style. There were some twists and turns as well and most of all it was a love story, with so many layers of love; love for money, love between a mother and her children; love for nature and all things living; old love and young love.A woman named Liza has landed herself in Australia to live with her aunt, and take care of her young daughter while helping at her aunt's quaint hotel and being the skipper of a whale watching eco tour. Her life was once upside down and she has many secrets then this dapper man from England comes to stay at the hotel and her life is turned upside down again as he finds out who he really is, a path to discovery that twists and turns.

And I can't even express the depth of my feelings in that final scene at the airport as I stood in Liza's shoes. The pacing is slow but was never boring. This one is worth the journey because the destination is spectacular."}, {"userName": "Corina\u261eBookTwinsReviews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8905971-corina-booktwinsreviews", "userReview": "LOVED ITI really enjoy her older books much more than expected. This has been my second book after Me Before You (which made me cry, and I don't usually read tear jerkers ;(.In Silver Bay the characters are what pulled me into the story. They were beautifully fascinating, unique, and entertaining. It didn't bother me that there were so many different POVs. I rather enjoyed the different voices. Additionally the location and whale topic was extremely fascinating to me since I've neither been to Australia nor on a whale watching tour. It turned this book into an absolutely captivating read. And most of all, it had a HEA, which is not necessarily guaranteed with this author.;-)"}, {"userName": "Dagmar Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45425395-dagmar-valerie", "userReview": "Verliefd op de boeken van Moyes! Ook deze roman heeft mijn hart gestolen \u00e9n flink laten huilen. Mooi, heftig, intens en meeslepend. Waanzinnig goed!"}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4957606-hayley", "userReview": "Ideally I'd give this book 2.5 out of 5 - 2 seems too stingy, 3 seems slightly more than it's really worth. Jojo Moyes' Silver Bay adds a heart-wrenching twist to the conventional chick-lit love triangle story. Set in Australia and London, Moyes has created characters who draw you in and make you want to learn about their lives. I soon found myself caught up in the intricate details of Mike, Liza, Hannah, Kathleen, Greg and co, eager to know how their stories would unfold. Written from the viewpoints of Moyes' characters, the novel moves seamlessly between them (something that is, in my opinion, hard to do well without confusing your reader or resorting to stereotypes when defining characters). As a result of this technique each chapter gave the reader more insight, revealing the personal perspective of the different characters and leaving the reader uncertain as to what they really thought about the characters (or indeed, what they should really think about them!).While I enjoyed the novel and was desperate to discover the final outcome, I found the plot flitted between predictable chick-lit romance novel trajectory and clever twists (which sadly become more and more predictable, and in some cases less believable, as the novel went on). My reading experience was marred slightly by the glaring plothole in one of the more dramatic scenes in the novel (other people would probably get over this!). If you're interested here's the basic outline (skip to avoid spoilers ;) ): A storm happens and the 'phonelines are down but then a telephone call is received at a vital moment and as this mobilises the characters into action, two are left behind to wait for the 'phonelines to come back and alert more people of the situation. Yea, I scratched my head about that too.Overall, I liked the novel but it is far from Moyes' best works. It's not as well written as The Girl You Left Behind, the first Moyes' novel I read and I was a little disappointed to be honest. But still, a nice book to read on your morning commutes. (And it left me dreaming of trips to Australia, which is hardly a bad thing.)"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47873649-julie", "userReview": "L'\u00e9t\u00e9, j'appr\u00e9cie retrouver des lectures un chouilla plus \"futiles\" qu'habituellement. M\u00eame si ce roman est clairement m\u00e2tin\u00e9 d'une dimension \u00e9cologique avec un plaidoyer assez fort pour la sauvegarde des baleines et autres c\u00e9tac\u00e9s, je ne peux nier son c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"romance\" qui prend selon moi une grande place dans l'histoire. Bien que ce ne soit pas vraiment mon genre litt\u00e9raire de pr\u00e9dilection, j'aime beaucoup en retrouver les codes dans mes lectures estivales. C'est l\u00e9ger, doux, et quoiqu'un peu mi\u00e8vre, c'est ce dont j'ai besoin et envie en \u00e9t\u00e9.Et ce joli roman m'a apport\u00e9 sur un plateau tout ce que j'\u00e9tais venue chercher. Les personnages sont tr\u00e8s attachants et ce sentiment est particuli\u00e8rement renforc\u00e9 par le rythme du roman puisque chaque chapitre adopte successivement le point de vue des personnages principaux. Le fait de voir ainsi l'histoire sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, successivement, donne la sensation tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able d'\u00eatre le confident de chacun. Cette pluralit\u00e9 de narrateurs aurait pu rendre le tout quelque peu chaotique. Mais c'\u00e9tait sans compter sur la plume de Jojo Moyes, l\u00e9g\u00e8re et agr\u00e9able, qui fait que tout s'imbrique et s'encha\u00eene avec une grande fluidit\u00e9.J'ai ador\u00e9 chacun des personnages de Silver Bay et refermer le livre apr\u00e8s sa lecture a sonn\u00e9 comme un adieu un peu douloureux. J'aurais ador\u00e9 partir \u00e0 leur rencontre et partager un moment avec eux dans leur petit coin de paradis, aller naviguer quelques heures sur le Moby I avec Lance et Yoshi avant de rejoindre l'h\u00f4tel de Kathleen o\u00f9 celle-ci nous aurait concoct\u00e9 un d\u00e9licieux repas. J'ai aussi vers\u00e9 quelques larmes dans des situations difficiles...Qu'on se le r\u00e9p\u00e8te : malgr\u00e9 un plaidoyer \u00e9cologique pour la protection de la faune marine en toile de fond, ce roman reprend la plupart des codes de la romance avec sa happy end in\u00e9vitable. Mais ce flot de bons sentiments est parfois si bon! Voir qu'apr\u00e8s l'obscurit\u00e9, la lumi\u00e8re peut jaillir loin et fort fait vraiment du bien au moral =)"}, {"userName": "Tita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120755-tita", "userReview": "Comprei este livro na Feira do Livro, em 2011, durante a Hora H, pois como a Canochinha tinha gostado bastante, achei que me iria proporcionar uma leitura agrad\u00e1vel.

This was a sweet story where everything is tied up in a pretty little bow at the end. I liked this even though it was a little predictable. There was also a \"Save the Whales\" and a \"Save the Dolphins\" message because a big resort wanted to move into little ole Silver Bay. This book glossed over the real fight that would have taken place if this book was aiming for the realistic vibe, but it wasn't. And for me that was okay. It had enough going on in the plot to keep it interesting. I think that is what Jojo Moyes does so well in her stories. There always is a certain depth to her stories with some creative twists. Some of the elements seemed to come out of left field, but I'd rather have that then just one dimension. So 3 stars."}], "description": "When Mike Dormer heads out from London to a small seaside town in Australia to kick-start a hotel development, he expects just another deal. But Silver Bay is not just any seaside town, and the inhabitants of the eccentric ramshackle Silver Bay Hotel - the enigmatic skipper Liza McCullen, her ten-year-old daughter, and her legendary shark-catching aunt Kathleen, as well as the crews of the local whale-watching boats - swiftly begin to temper his own shark-like tendencies. He is left wondering who really has the greater right to the bay's waters. As the development begins to take on a momentum of its own, and the effect on the whales that migrate past the bay begins to reveal itself, Mike's and Liza's worlds collide, with dramatic results. New, unforeseen hazards emerge to confront both the creatures and the McCullen women.
