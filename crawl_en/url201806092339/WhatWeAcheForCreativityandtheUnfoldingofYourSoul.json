When we cultivate and refuse to separate those essential expressions of a human soul \u2013 our spirituality, sexuality, and creativity \u2013 we feed the fire of our being. p.6 \u2013 Our sexuality includes all the ways we physically experience and are intimate with another, the world, and ourselves. p.7 \u2013 Our creativity is the soul-deep impulse in all human beings to go beyond the perceptions of the senses to the conception of something new. We begin with what is and make something more of it. p.13 \u2013 Viktor Frankl, survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, urged us in his book Man\u2019s Search for Meaning not to ask what the events of our lives mean but to take responsibility for creating meaning from the events of our lives. There is no inherent explicit connection between the two people whose stories have come to me this week beyond my knowing them both. p.14 \u2013 The Danish writer Isak Dinesen wrote, \u201cAll suffering is bearable if it is seen as part of a story.\u201d Stories, songs, images help us be with what is. We create as a way to be with what is hard and beautiful and unexpected without closing our hearts or pretending something else is true, as a way of easing the suffering that comes when we fight with or try to hang on to what is. And as we create we make it all 0 the sorrow and the joy, the failed efforts and the places of ease \u2013 count. Our stories and images and sounds create, explicate, or point to a deeper meaning that helps us receive, celebrate, and be fed by beauty and bear what is hard. This is the root of the creative work we do: the desire to intimately touch and share the truth of our lives and our world, to find and follow the sometimes-hidden thread stitching ourselves and our reality into wholeness. Creative work can both reveal and co-create this wholeness from the colors and shapers, textures and tastes of the life that swirls within and around us. p.15 \u2013 Susan Vreeland in her novel The Forest Lover writers about the life of Canadian painter Emily Carr. She writes of the artist\u2019s desire to go \u201cbeyond objectivity\u201d to penetrate the heart and spirit of our lives and our world, to see and share what only the soul can see. We create \u2013 we write or paint or compose or choreograph, we produce scents and sounds and tastes, images and stories and poems \u2013 in order to see who we are, what we value, and why we go on.It\u2019s what makes us human, this capacity to co-create the truth that sustains us from the stuff of our dreams and our lives. Bruises and battered by the inevitable misfortunes of life, aware of our shortcomings and discouraged by our delusions, distracted by and dissatisfied with the quest to satisfy immediate and temporary needs, we seek redemption in the truth creative work offers us. p.18 \u2013 Writing Exercises: Complete each of the following phrases repeatedly for a set period of time. Replace the word write with one appropriate to your medium of creative expression (paint, compose, dance, play music, etc.) \u2022\tWhen I write, I feel\u2026\u2022\tI ache for\u2026Answer the question: Why do you write? Write a story that begins with: The smartest/hardest/etc. thing I ever\u2026 2 \u2013 Beginningsp.30 \u2013 Just as there are times to acknowledge resistance and keep on walking through it, there are other times when it is more effective to sneak around the resistance, to go at the process sideways. The critical thing is that you begin to do the creative work. 3 \u2013 The Seduction of the Artistp.42 \u2013 No matter how far we roam, we always need to return to the places, people, and practices from which we draw inspiration and vitality so we can go out into the world again. p.55 \u2013 For Contemplation: What if no creative work is ever wasted, even when we cannot see where it will lead, even if it is never publicly shared or acknowledged? p.56 \u2013 Notice and begin to list your places of inspiration \u2013 the people, settings, and activities that stimulate your imagination and leave you feeling in the mood and energized to do creative work. 4 \u2013 Learning to Seep.71 \u2013 Being aware is being willing to stay with what is and follow it without expectation, holding an attitude of genuine curiosity and open inquiry. 5 \u2013 Doing the Workp.91 \u2013 There is no writer, only writing, no painter, only painting; no composer, only composing. This idea frees us from the sometimes oppressive notion that we make the creative work happen. 7 \u2013 Creating Togetherp.123 \u2013 Creative work is often solitary, but there can be a great sense of camaraderie and support when working in the company of others who share your commitment to the process. Shared silence is a gift too rarely found in our extroverted culture. 10 \u2013 The Artist\u2019s Lifep.166 \u2013 There are two critical aspects to cultivating a life that supports and encourages the creative work you want to do: an honest assessment of your own human frailties \u2013 the ways you are most likely to be derailed in the creative process \u2013 and a plan for how to ease your way around them; and the creation of a community of support, relationships that continually midwife you in the creative process. Creativity flourishes when we combine open, empty fertile times with regular periods of focused intent and disciplined work. p.168 \u2013 A human life is made up essentially of meaningful work and intimate relationships. Whether you receive an income from your creative work or are financially supported to do it by another means, it is at least a part of the meaningful work you are here to do in this lifetime. Cultivating an artist\u2019s life, a life that supports this meaningful work, is largely about creating relationships with yourself, others, and the world that support that work. p.169 \u2013 All creative work requires some degree of solitude. We have to know ourselves and have access to our inner world if we are to have anything to bring to the work. p.176 \u2013 Our creativity is not separable from that which feeds body and soul, from the needs and pleasures of living a physical life in a human form that requires relationship with others. p.178 \u2013 The truth is that the more you engage in your creative work, the more you will find yourself surrounded by others who are similarly engaged. p.181 \u2013 The artist\u2019s life is simply an ordinary human life that is consciously choreographed to support ongoing creativity in both you and those around you. The more your choices are coloured and shaped by this commitment, the more you will find yourself in the places where you will meet others who share this commitment. And you will recognize each other, and see yourself in another, and create for yourself a community of the heart."}, {"userName": "R.K.
