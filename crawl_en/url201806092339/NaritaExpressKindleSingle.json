Despite the joy of a free book, I'm candid below.The snapshot on this one is that it's the story of a pair of star-crossed lovers as they meet for a long weekend together. The action only covers a few days and is about a 20-minute read if you're leisurely about it.To the positive side, the author paints a good picture of how these two characters are feeling and the situation that brought them to these straits. The man meets the woman with great anticipation and frankly, lust, and the story unfolds as they both realize the price they'll have to pay for this time together. I wouldn't call it emotional but it is a very emotionally deep piece.The only real negative, and it's a negative which depends to great extent what it is you're looking for in a 20-minute read, is that anything which can be called is action is entirely internal. There's no excitement or dramatic event, it's just a rather slow dawning of realization. In summary, this is a solid bit of writing but you have to be in the right mindset for it. It's the sort of tidbit you might suggest to your mate as a \"let's read and then discuss\" piece on a quiet night staying in when the kids are away at grandmas."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7013183-david", "userReview": "I find short stories often to be lacking. Either thin on details and depth or relying on cheap tricks and unearned emotional weight to sell something that was never there to begin with. This is certainly not one of those stories. It's a richly introspective and smart exploration of two people and their fading relationship. Within just a few pages, we experience the length of theirs lives together as it seemingly crawls to pained, slow end, one that neither can bare to admit. It's a relationship as watercolor. Lush and romantic, but faint and fading. It's made even more hazy through a sort of pointed nostalgia, something that doesn't even need to be outright explained to us. Such is how powerfully Mimi Wong is able to commit our attention and feelings towards these characters. Tokyo comes alive not as some exotic playland, but a real city that is given a unique charm that doesn't fall back on well worn tropes. Really remarkable stuff, and I can't wait to see what comes from Mimi in the future! If this is what we get as a short story, I can only imagine what her longer fiction could be!"}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544437-joe", "userReview": "So proud to know this author. Narita Express is beautiful and sad, and one of those great small-scale stories of people spending a few days together that subtly fills in all this history of each character, their families, etc. It evokes such a clear atmosphere and feeling even when those feelings are hard for the characters themselves to understand."}], "description": "This story was originally published in Day One, a weekly literary journal dedicated to short fiction and poetry from emerging writers.Charlie is an expatriate adrift. Since graduation, he\u2019s been living in Shanghai, exploring his parents\u2019 homeland and trying to understand his own complicated identity as a Chinese American.One summer day, Charlie takes a trip to Japan to visit his ex-girlfriend, Kiyomi, who is attending graduate school there.

Despite love and good intentions, Charlie unwittingly reopens old wounds and sparks a romance that, because of distance, is bound to ultimately die out.
