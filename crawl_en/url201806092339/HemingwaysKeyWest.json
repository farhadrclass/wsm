Even though I'd been to Key West before and seen many of the Hemingway haunts, this book took me back and shared new insights. I enjoyed the back stories about the author and his crew. I enjoyed the suggested walking tour. In short, because of the perspective presented in the book by Mr. McIver, I'll be returning to Key West sooner than later, even though I've been there more than a few times before.Rudolf J WaldnerThe Corporate Jungle: Animal Personalities Colliding with Job TitlesMarketing from the Trenches: Your Guide to Retail Success"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17436756-michael", "userReview": "I like reading about Hemingway more than I like reading Hemingway. And the more I read about him, the less I like him as a person. He was a bully, a womanizer, a poor sport. But he could write,and he wrote in Key West. And I really like Key West. My wife and I honeymooned there.Reading this book was fun because I got to revisit old stomping grounds.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a thumb-nail sketch of Papa in Key West. And it gives a decent walking tour of the city. Whether you like Hemingway or not, the truth is thatPapa could live without Key West, but Key West could not live without Papa. His spirit permeates the island."}, {"userName": "E.C.

Hemingway's words are legendary as is his reputation, but this book offers a glimpse into what made the man tick. His suicide is often attributed to his bouts of depression and his \"writerly\" life. Knowing what we know now about head trauma, his numerous and severe concussions are highlighted in this book and showed me another side to the story."}, {"userName": "Patty Gilson l", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10811532-patty-gilson-l", "userReview": "If you enjoy Hemingway and his connection to Key West, you will enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Mike Prochot", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4813812-mike-prochot", "userReview": "Assorted facts, fables and yarns about E.

It was just supposed to be vacation stop before traveling to north to Pauline's ancestral home in Arkansas to give birth to their first child. But a delay in the arrival of the yellow Model A Ford roadster (a wedding gift from Pauline's wealthy uncle Gus) gave the author the time to fall in love with the small town that he dubbed the \"St. Tropez of the Poor.\" For the next decade Ernest Hemingway would write, fish, drink, and end his second marriage in this island town. And Key West would remain his most productive work environment on American soil. Among the palm fronds, bougainvillea, hibiscus, oleander and other tropical foliage outside his studio on the second floor carriage house Hemingway completed such works as A Farewell To Arms, Death in The Afternoon, Winner Take Nothing, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, The Short Life of Francis Macomber, and his Key West novel To Have And Have Not.Florida historian and author Stuart McIver title promises the reader an adventure, but delivers a hodge-podge non cohesive book about Hemingway or of Key West during the time the great author lived there. Why was this decade Ernest Hemingway's most productive? What was the \"it\" Key West possessed that Ernest found his words flowing at around a 7 pencil day rate? Why Papa got on well and kept his Key West friends (the Mob) as life-long friends but lost many of the \"out of town talent\" mob members? How his marriage and later his divorce to Pauline changed the townspeople from supporting him to support Pauline, thusly diminishing slightly some important lifelong relationships to his \"Key West Mob\"? McIver fails to answer these questions adequately or he fails to answer these questions and repeats facts and events from other chapters. Also McIver glosses over two cataclysmic events that had profane effects on the great author: the Great Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and the meeting and subsequent affair with Martha Gellhorn whom eventually became Ernest's third wife.I found the chapters on Hemingway's beloved boat Pilar (named for the daughter he desperately wanted but could never have) and his deep sea fishing very enlightening as well as the Walking tour of Papa's Key West, but the chapters on Cuba and the Key West of today didn't really enhance or fulfill the promise the author gives the reader: full answers as to why Hemingway loved Key West and was the most productive in that island city and his relationships he developed there. As a Florida resident many of anecdotal stories told in this short volume are widely known and probably to the Hemingway aficionado."}, {"userName": "Anilou", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27180332-anilou", "userReview": "Papa's DigsOf all the books I could have chosen to shed light on one of the greatest American novelists, this was everything I hoped it would be. I'm deep into a collection of Hemingway's short stories, and this book shed light on its complicated author, his genius and insanity, his courage, his many loves, and his way of tackling life head on. Hemingway was hard living and a heavy drinker and shed one wife only to remarry in short order. On my list of vacation destinations, his Key West home is at the top. This book will surely enhance my experience. I look forward to meeting the latest generation of his six-toed cats as well. I am so happy to have read this beautifully written story, told without judgment but with a good deal of admiration for his contributions to the world of writing."}, {"userName": "Brian Findley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14417973-brian-findley", "userReview": "I received this book as a gift because of my interest in both Hemingway and Key West. It reads more as a series of short, poorly-written pamphlets that are redundant and thrown together. Sure, there were one or two things I picked up that I didn\u2019t know before, but there are much better books on both subjects available.

Most everything noted in the book was your typical description of Hemingway, if you're a Hemingway fan that is.
