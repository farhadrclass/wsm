It's unusual because it shows how limited the Queen is by her very proper job which might not look like one, christening ships, knighting people, opening hospitals, hosting dinner parties and being nice to foreign politicians, but it certainly would feel like one. She escapes not from reality with a book, but into it, into our reality, how we all live. To say more about the story would spoil this absolute gem of a book. Each facet is a carefully-polished, succinct paragraph of the best of slightly-comic writing on the surface, but there are always glints of Bennett's attitudes, tastes and where he would like to influence the reader with his obviously socialist stance. (Note to Americans, this is quite acceptable, and might even be praiseworthy, in Europe).Bennett says that the reader creates the character as much as the author, which is, of course, self-evident. It is the reason why films often disappoint - the director's vision has clashed with that of the readers. That said, I would still love to see a play, a small film of this book. No one has ever written about the Queen in quite this way before: someone who would deeply like to be human and explore herself rather than being some sort of demi-god in a gilded cage of utmost comfort and deepest isolation.In real life the Queen is supposed to have plastic containers of cereals on her breakfast table (placed there by the butler or the footman) and for holidays in a cottage in Scotland actually cooks for and washes up after the family and wears exactly what she pleases. A holiday? Not for us, oh no, she's not like us at all."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is a wonderfully humorous, subversive and comic homage to literature penned by non other than the great and incomparable treasure that is Alan Bennett. I listened to the audio, charmed by the narration by the author himself. This is a short book, worth its weight in gold, which has Her Majesty, the Queen of England inadvertently discover the mobile library, so beginning her early faltering steps to becoming an avid reader and bookworm. A whole world opens up, in which she is guided by Norman, who works in the kitchens and comes to be the Queens confidant and book guide. However, not everyone is best pleased, her household staff and private secretary, New Zealander Sir Kevin are alarmed and go out of their way to dissuade the Queen from finding pleasure in reading. There is behind the scenes meddling and political machinations as they get rid of Norman. However, nothing will sway Her Majesty as by this stage the unwelcome thought enters her mind that she no longer needs Norman and sets forth her own path in the world of books. Her developments begin to terrify the political establishment as the Queen with a twinkle in her eye, has mischief on her mind. I strongly urge anyone who loves books to read this as Alan Bennett has the Queen reading an extraordinarily diverse range of authors that is bound to catch the interest of any reader. Bennett is an author of gentle wit and a subversive turn of mind. You are missing a treat if you do not read this. Simply Fantastic!"}, {"userName": "Joey Woolfardis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4639825-joey-woolfardis", "userReview": "Alan Bennett brings to life what a world would be like if Queen Elizabeth II started reading voraciously after stumbling upon a travelling library...\n\u201cYou don't put your life into your books, you find it there.\u201d\nQuaint and quiet I think can best describe this. Bennett's usual work is often quite in your face with it's definite humour, but the funny side of this book seems to boil away quietly underneath, rearing it's lovely little head every now and then like a little postage stamp on the edge of a letter.We follow the Queen of England (and other countries beside) as she becomes a reader, a dedicated reader and finally a rather obtuse reader. I've never read a book about reading before, so can't comment on how this differs or remains similar, but it offers a great insight in to what readers go through as they begin-and continue-their reading journey.\n\u201cI think of literature,' she wrote, 'as a vast country to the far borders of which I am journeying but will never reach. And I have started to late.

It's a nice little look in to the world of the Monarchy, as well, without being overly trite and condescending (only the correct amount). It treats them with equal amounts of endearment and contempt, which is a nice way of looking at them. Not always upwards.I didn't quite get the Bennettesque Wonder and Awe that I usually get with his works, though I can't figure out why. I feel like I need to not be English to like this book a bit more. It's funny and charming and a bit cheeky. It makes you think: about the monarchy, the world in general and yourself as a reader, but it never really went beyond that. It's lovely in it's own way but I feel (countless gay references aside) that if you go from this to any other Bennett work you might be in for a bit of a culture shock."}, {"userName": "The Book Maven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47212-the-book-maven", "userReview": "Oh wow. If I could give this book six stars, or heck, even ten, I would. It is so great--there's a lot of subtlety in here that Readers' Advisory librarians will definitely clue into, especially in how society views readers, reading, and books.A lot of us read, sure. A lot of us really enjoy books. But because we are average joes, commoners, small potatoes, this is nothing groundbreaking. It likely will not become upsetting if we take up reading as a hobby. But what if someone important takes up reading, at a late stage in life? What if that somebody is more than important--what if that person is a figurehead, an influential presence of tradition, or otherwise very powerful, in oblique ways? What if that person happened to be the Queen of England?That's the premise of this romping little read that has a surprising amount of substance. Queen Elizabeth stumbles across a bookmobile by the palace, feels compelled by good manners to check out a book, struggles through it, returns it, and again feels compelled to take out another. This one she finds delightful, and so the die is cast. This is so completely out of character for the Queen--she allows herself few hobbies and interests that would indicate a preference for anything, and now here she is, preferring books, developing a love for them, and as she reads more and more, developing some pretty heavy ideas that influence the person she is and how she reigns and interacts with her subjects.But not everyone likes this new habit, hobby, tendency, addiction, whatever. RA librarians will recognize some of the arguments that the Queen's politicians and such make: Reading is selfish. Reading isolates you. Reading will alienate others from you. It's one thing to read this in an RA textbook; it hits home a lot harder when you read it being discussed in a fiction book.The book is mainly dialogue-driven, with a fair amount of character development being devoted to the Queen. It all gets resolved in a tidy, unexpected, funny, and completely ludicrous manner at the end, and the ending is suitably off-beat, just like the rest of the book.READ IT!"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4.125* of fiveWitty, irreverent, and completely charming, Bennett's novella is one I would sincerely hope that Her Majesty read and laughed at when it was published.There are many reviews of this effervescent entertainment, so I will confine myself to noting that the book carries with it a none-too-subtle punch line which I can't imagine would have made Mr. Bennett more likely to be in line for a life peerage, but which I can imagine made him a popular figure around Highgrove.A delightful bagatelle of a book.

The analogy relates to Queen Elizabeth wandering into a bookmobile, getting hooked on reading books, and the various consequences that ensue.I have 14 or 16 GR friends now who rate this 4 or better. Must be the word \"reader\" in the title that inspires a grab. You can\u2019t go wrong, as it\u2019s a short pleasant read. Very subtle and understated, with humor that builds quietly until you have to burst out laughing. Nothing over-the-top. It\u2019s very realistic for how reading changes your outlook and how one book leads to another. I would like to convey enough from the book to hook you, but would not like to spoil any of your fun. I choose to share a sample of her reaction to one book, an example of resistance by others to her reading, and one distillation of the appeal of reading to her. Near the beginning the story, it was the second book the Queen read that got her hooked, a romance by Nancy Mitford:The Pursuit of Love turned out to be a fortunate choice and in its way a momentous one. Had Her Majesty gone for another duff read, an early George Eliot, say, or a late Henry James, novice reader that she was, she might have been put off reading for good and there would be no story to tell. Books, she would have thought, were work.As it was, with this one she soon became engrossed, and passing her bedroom that night clutching his hot-water bottle, the duke heard her laugh out loud. He put his head around the door. 'All right, old girl?''Of course, I'm reading.'The Queen encounters diverse reactions to her reading and a bit of conspiracy led by her PR manager, Sir Kevin, to thwart her new passion:\u2018To read is to withdraw. To make oneself unavailable. One would feel easier about it,\u2019 said Sir Kevin, \u2018if the pursuit itself were less \u2026selfish.\u2019\u2018Selfish?\u2019\u2018Perhaps I should say solipsistic.\u2019\u2018Perhaps you should.\u2019Here is one of the Queen\u2019s insights about the power of reading for her:The appeal of reading, she thought, lay in its indifference: there was something undeferring about literature. Books didn\u2019t care who was reading them or not. All readers were equal, herself included.So as you can see, we have a bit of a fable on the subversive power of reading. There are no specific cases of the content of a specific book inciting high passions or inspiring intellectual conclusions that alter critical political choices. The restraint on the part of Bennett in this way somehow makes it more compelling and moving to experience the impact of reading on the Queen\u2019s daily life and empathy for people of different walks of life."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "My first thought was, \"I wonder what the Queen thought of this\". She probably didn't read it, and if she did, I hope she thought it was funny because it was. In this story she becomes an avid reader after accidentally stumbling upon a mobile library outside the palace. I didn't count them, but Bennett mentions more book titles and authors names than any book I've read. The Queen, much to everyones dismay, spends all her time reading and begins to neglect her queenly duties. She takes on everything from Austen to Proust and her reactions to all this diversity is priceless. Just an all-around fun read."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "Several people had recommended The Uncommon Reader to me over the last year, but somehow I only got around to it this morning. Don't be as slow as I was! The idea is very simple - the Queen gets hooked on reading - but Bennett handles it perfectly. It's a delight, and takes about an hour to read.Maybe a short extract will do the job:'Exploded?' said the Queen. 'But it was Anita Brookner.'The young man, who seemed remarkably undeferential, said security may have thought it was a device.The Queen said: 'Yes. That is exactly what it is. A book is a device to ignite the imagination.'The footman said: 'Yes, ma'am.'It was as if he was talking to his grandmother, and not for the first time the Queen was made unpleasantly aware of the hostility her reading seemed to arouse. 'Very well,' she said. 'Then you should inform security that I shall expect to find another copy of the same book, vetted and explosive-free, waiting on my desk tomorrow morning. And another thing. The carriage cushions are filthy. Look at my gloves.'

I find immense unexplainable pleasure when I read about other people reading, and discover the beauty and freedom of literature. The story shows the tremendous impact that reading routine has on the person\u2019s life, even if that person is the Queen. I loved how the reading ignited the Queen's passion for life and shifted her whole perspective. Before, she concentrated on duties, and she was conditioned to completely disregard herself and lose her interest in small pleasures in day to day endless obligations. This quote perfectly summarizes her life before books. \u2018She\u2019d never taken much interest in reading. She read, of course, as one did, but liking books was something she left to other people. It was a hobby and it was in the nature of her job that she didn\u2019t have hobbies. Jogging, growing roses, chess or rock climbing, cake decoration, model aeroplanes. No. Hobbies involved preferences and preferences had to be avoided; preferences excluded people. One had no preferences. Her job was to take an interest, not to be interested herself. And besides, reading wasn\u2019t doing. She was a doer.\u2018Even to rationalize reading in the beginning, she has to look at it as a duty, because the system didn\u2019t ever allow her to do something just for the sake of doing it or just to enjoy herself. I can\u2019t even imagine that level of restraint. For someone who is a queen of the country, you would think that she has freedom of being in charge of her own life and time, which happen not to be the case. 'I read, I think,\u2019 she said to Norman, \u2018because one has a duty to find out what people are like,\u2019 a trite enough remark of which Norman took not much notice, feeling himself under no such obligation and reading purely for pleasure not enlightenment, though part of the pleasure was the enlightenment, he could see that. But duty did not come into it. To someone with the background of the Queen, though, pleasure had always taken second place to duty. If she could feel she had a duty to read then she could set about it with a clear conscience, with the pleasure, if pleasure there was, incidental.People can often look up to rulers, politicians, celebrities and think they have an ideal life, which I believe seldom is the case. Common people have much more freedom and a chance for happiness in my opinion. Books were portal to a queen to a normal life, to place where she isn\u2019t the queen, but the real person, with her wishes, emotions and inner riches. I think it\u2019s beautiful the way books connect all people, in whatever circumstances, social class, age, sex or color of the skin. This quote is gold.\u2018The appeal of reading, she thought, lay in its indifference: there was something undeferring about literature. Books did not care who was reading them or whether one read them or not. All readers were equal, herself included. Literature, she thought, is a commonwealth; letters a republic. Actually she had heard this phrase, the republic of letters, used before, at graduation ceremonies, honorary degrees and the like, though without knowing quite what it meant. At that time talk of a republic of any sort she had thought mildly insulting and in her actual presence tactless to say the least. It was only now she understood what it meant. Books did not defer. All readers were equal and this took her back to the beginning of her life. As a girl, one of her greatest thrills had been on VE night when she and her sister had slipped out of the gates and mingled unrecognised with the crowds. There was something of that, she felt, to reading. It was anonymous; it was shared; it was common. And she who had led a life apart now found that she craved it. Here in these pages and between these covers she could go unrecognised.\u2019I think this is a book that all readers would enjoy, but never the less, if non-reader comes across this book, I believe it has the power to show the glance of indescribable beauty of life as a reader. The book emphasizes growth, empathy, and freedom and in the end the own personhood and power we find within pages.'But then books, as I\u2019m sure you know, seldom prompt a course of action. Books generally just confirm you in what you have, perhaps unwittingly, decided to do already. You go to a book to have your convictions confirmed. A book, as it were, closes the book.\u2019"}, {"userName": "Rowizyx", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15499043-rowizyx", "userReview": "Libro sottile e che si legge molto rapidamente, ma non per questo una velina: mi \u00e8 piaciuta molto l'idea di Bennett di rendere la regina un'assidua lettrice e mandare cos\u00ec in crisi tutto l'establishment intorno alla sua persona, perch\u00e9 non sta bene che una sovrana abbia un hobby cos\u00ec solitario e le tante sciocchezze che le ripete il primo ministro (LOL, \u00e8 davvero Tony Blair). \u00c8 bellissimo come viene descritto il potere della lettura e il percorso di crescita della regina come lettrice, che mette su dei gusti personali, impara a comprendere sfumature e sottigliezze che a causa della sua educazione le sfuggivano, a riflettere su molte cose a cui prima di cominciare a leggere non notava nemmeno.

It\u2019s like when Xzbit in Pimp My Ride puts a car inside of your car because he knows you love cars.And Alan Bennett puts books in your book. He also puts the Queen there, so you know you are in for a treat. Imagine that the Queen, old as she is, suddenly discovers the joy of reading. She engages a certain Nelson to help her acquire books and guide her through the world of literature. That does sound like a dream job, doesn\u2019t it? To become someone\u2019s personal literary adviser. The Queen is a perfect student, too. Her thirst for books in unquenchable. She doesn\u2019t want to talk about anything else but books and tortures her subjects constantly asking their opinions on this author or another. Don\u2019t I know what it\u2019s like!

That, of course, will never happen if you just read paranormal romance for the rest of your days.Bennett also proposes a thesis that reading must eventually lead to writing. He believes in supremacy of writing over reading, believes it to be somewhat nobler than reading. I am not sure I agree with this. It takes a whole lot of self-control, modesty (and obviously being a better person than I am) to be satisfied with reading only and not have that grandiose need to write.It was also quite brave of Bennett to take on the Queen as his heroine. And to make her into a human being as well! I applaud you, sir. To be honest with you, if there was a good thing about growing up in a communist country it was that absolute certainty that people are equal. And then I came to UK.

Queen Elizabeth, in her eightieth year, discovers the joys of reading literature quite accidentally when she happens upon a book mobile in the process of trying to round up her barking Corgis. Norman, a cook from her Royal kitchen, is a borrower and a friendship ensues, with him becoming the purveyor of the world of pleasurable books. As the Queen's interest becomes more avid in the plethora of fiction that she has missed in her life, the duties which she has graciously and energetically fulfilled suddenly lose their attraction. Her reading sends ripples of discomfort through the staff and all levels of government, which is treated with a delightful comedic touch and gentle satire. \"You don't put your life into your books. You find it there.\", the Queen notes to herself eventually, having travelled a considerable distance in self-discovery near the book's conclusion. The Uncommon Reader ends with tart wit, and had me smiling as I closed its cover. A charming, British treat.

This author is supposed to be a great wit and I just didn't \"get\" his humor in writing style or otherwise. This book seems to be an endless author and book review which I didn't like. The book moved along so slowly that I was surprised to find that I was halfway through the book still waiting for the plot to begin. There were also a few swear words and a disgusting comment that surprised me because they didn't need to be there. All in all, this book was dry and dull and not at all what I expected.

To expound this thesis, the author's creative imagination and liberty had sought the help of the Queen. Yes, Her majesty, the Queen is the main protagonist of this novella and the story is about how in her older days she gets enchanted by the pleasures of reading.All through the book there are some interesting observations on reading. And they are certainly a delight for the regular reader. Here are few examples:\"Briefing closes down a subject, reading opens it up.\"\"Books are not about passing time. They're about other lives. Other worlds.. Far from wanting time to pass, one just wishes one had more of it.\"\"A book is a device to ignite the imagination.\"But other than such delights, the novella seemed very simple. It is a straight forward story and a quick read. It engages you as you read and after reading it except for few phrases the novel does not much affect you. As a concluding remark let me also add this: I chose this book in the bookshop, seeing that it was about the act of reading itself. As I bought it, I was thinking of another book that I had read earlier on the same theme (the act of Reading) -- Italo Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveller -- and so my expectation was my undoing.

The Queen needs a hobby. However, instead of pursuing a queenly hobby (ahem, don\u2019t ask me what that is), she stumbles upon a mobile library just outside her gates and pursues reading; what ensues thereafter is a barrel full of fun, at least until the very end.Alan Bennett\u2019s, The Uncommon Reader, has been on my TBR since a very long time. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember when or why I added it to my TBR as I don\u2019t even remember reading the blurb, which incidentally is true of most of my TBR additions. *ahem* don\u2019t kill me for this. Anyway, I needed a book with a crown on the cover for a challenge and was struggling with the book that I had picked, when a friend of mine, Margaret, suggested that I read this book. Her recommendation was based on the fact that this was small and hence a very quick read. Short it is and a quick read it was, full of funny events that take place once the Queen takes up reading as a hobby and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.Bennett makes The Queen the protagonist of this book and through her explains the delight that most booklovers experience and feel when they are reading. The book is peppered with quotes that are truly a reader\u2019s delight. Being a reader, ever since I could hold a book in my hands, I enjoyed these quotes and references a lot. Let me give you a few examples;\n\n\u201cWhat she was finding also was how one book led to another, doors kept opening wherever she turned and the days weren\u2019t long enough for the reading she wanted to do.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t we all experience that when we read? I, for one, have gotten many of my book recommendations through references made in other books that I am reading or have read. My constantly increasing TBR is proof to the fact that no matter how much you read, the options are endless, which is both exciting and intimidating. The Queen goes onto describe her passion and addiction with these words;\n\n\u201cTo begin with, it\u2019s true, she read with trepidation and some unease. The sheer endlessness of books outfaced her and she had no idea how to go on; there was no system to her reading, with one book leading to another, and often she had two or three on the go at the same time. The next stage had been when she started to make notes, after which she always read with a pencil in hand, not summarising what she read but simply transcribing passages that struck her\u201d\n\nAll of us do this as well. When I read physical books, I use the same method of transcribing quotes that have a special place in my heart. With the Kindle it is so easy to simply highlight it and come back to it whenever I want. I thrive on highlighting and often wonder why I can\u2019t do the same with physical books. Lol. Jokes aside, wanting to immortalize in our minds, what we have read, especially those special parts, is something that is dear to all readers and Bennett has exquisitely put forth this truth in his book.The Queen\u2019s addiction creates havoc among the palace staff and also the ministry. Where they used to find a complacent Queen quietly listening to their reports, they now had a well read Queen ready to debate on various topics and worse asking them whether they had read a particular book or not. Ministers, dignitaries from other countries and even the palace staff are not spared from these musings, which results in a merry tale that has the reader in splits. The Queen spares none and through her Bennett doesn\u2019t spare them either, be it those who show disdain towards readers or those who read to simply pass the time. Through the Queen, here is his fitting reply;\n\n\u201cPass the time?\u201d said the Queen. \u201cBooks are not about passing the time. They\u2019re about other lives. Other worlds. Far from wanting time to pass, Sir Kevin, one just wishes one had more of it. If one wanted to pass the time one could go to New Zealand.\u201d\n\nThis is definitely a praise worthy book but somehow it lost its pace towards the end. What started off as a humorous account of the Queen taking up reading turned into something that felt contrived and out of place towards the end. It was as if the author was trying to say something but his message did not get across as easily as it did in the previous pages. It became serious all of a sudden and took away all the fun and frolic that was there in the initial pages, which irked me a lot. Nevertheless, this is a good book to read, especially as we are all bibliophiles and enjoy reading books about books and reading."}], "description": "From one of England's most celebrated writers, a funny and superbly observed novella about the Queen of England and the subversive power of readingWhen her corgis stray into a mobile library parked near Buckingham Palace, the Queen feels duty-bound to borrow a book. Discovering the joy of reading widely (from J. R. Ackerley, Jean Genet, and Ivy Compton-Burnett to the classics) and intelligently, she finds that her view of the world changes dramatically. Abetted in her newfound obsession by Norman, a young man from the royal kitchens, the Queen comes to question the prescribed order of the world and loses patience with the routines of her role as monarch. Her new passion for reading initially alarms the palace staff and soon leads to surprising and very funny consequences for the country at large.With the poignant and mischievous wit of The History Boys, England's best loved author revels in the power of literature to change even the most uncommon reader's life.", "title": "The Uncommon Reader", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2940062-the-uncommon-reader", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497968557l/2940062.jpg", "reviews": 4627, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11781.Alan_Bennett", "name": "Alan Bennett"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Writing", "Humor", "European Literature", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2940062-the-uncommon-reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1096390.The_Uncommon_Reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1793429.The_Uncommon_Reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4556791-die-souver-ne-leserin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8455369-la-sovrana-lettrice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2715772-the-uncommon-reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7110523-the-uncommon-reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11099010-the-uncommon-reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35617052-la-sovrana-lettrice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6060372-the-uncommon-reader", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/312260.The_History_Boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1389703.The_Lady_In_The_Van", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10589860-smut", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272434.The_Clothes_They_Stood_Up_In", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1725399.Talking_Heads", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
