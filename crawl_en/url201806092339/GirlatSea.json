The ending was kind of a surprise but I liked it!!!! I thought it was a well- written book and was a good mix of mystery and romance. Building suspense in every word, this book can bring tears to your eyes or laughter to your mouth. This would have to be Maureen Johnson's best book for me. I would recommend it, of course :) Please read this book, you won't regret it."}, {"userName": "Janelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695206-janelle", "userReview": "Ok. I have to comment on the cover. WTF? That girl on the cover could never, ever be Clio. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern with Maureen Johnson\u2019s books: Find a picture of a pretty, slim girl (with no face). Put her in tight pants and a tank top. Add in a few pieces of plot-related decorative flourishes. And Voila! A cover girl that has nothing at all to do with the strong heroines Johnson writes. (At least Suite Scarlet seems to have broken this pattern)I\u2019m probably overreacting, but this really bothers me. This cover is so generic that it short-changes what\u2019s inside. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t judge this book (or 13 Little Blue Envelopes) by its cover. If I had, I likely would have assumed the novel would have been another formulaic teen romance drama. Which it definitely is NOT. If I wasn\u2019t lazy, I\u2019d start a petition to stop this cover design travesty. :)Ok, onto more serious matters... Girl at Sea has a great pace and likable characters. There\u2019s a bit of everything here: mystery, romance, drama. It was a great book to read while stuck in winter misery. I\u2019m quickly growing into a huge Maureen Johnson fan, almost entirely because of her heroines. Johnson does not write stereotypical teen girls- they are all fully fleshed out young women with diverse talents, desires, and motivations (which is why the covers bother me so much). Clio is highly relatable, even though many girls probably can\u2019t even imagine living the life Clio has cruising around the Mediterranean. But Clio\u2019s feelings, her relationships, her fears, and her weaknesses are all very real. The exotic locale is just that: a setting. It adds interest to the story, but does not serve to alienate readers. While most readers might not be able to imagine how it would feel to jump off the deck of a yacht into the dark sea, most can probably relate to being hurt by a friend or fighting with a parent. Another thing I like about Johnson\u2019s heroines is that they have romantic interests but do not need to be rescued. Clio does not need a boyfriend or a kiss to complete her. Clio needs to find something inside her- even though crushes and first kisses seem to take priority in her life, it\u2019s not really what she\u2019s looking for. While Clio gets what she wants in the love department, the other things she gets, the things she didn't know she was looking for, are so much more meaningful, satisfying, and life changing. The inclusion of old letters keeps the mystery going and clues readers in on details related to the secret search that Clio is not yet aware of. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Antonia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10873966-antonia", "userReview": "It so pissed me off. First of all, the description was weird. I mean a lot of unecessary infos, and things that made you confused. I loved the cover, the Romanian one :D Let's start with the characters. Clio, just so you know it, I can't remeber how she looked, bbecause it's not specified. Whatever. She is confused and never really acts how she should. I mean she should get mad and scream and all that. Well, no. She gets a little upset, than she's not upset anymore. Clio's father-an idiot. Julia, the girlfriend of Clio's father, well, not so much to say about her. Aidan, Julia's employee, a weird asshole. Elsa, another weird character, but at least I know how she looks like. That's about it. Clio should've had the summer she always dreamed. But her father messes up her plans when he takes her to Italy to a strange trip, without saying her a word about what is going to happen on that trip. I liked the mystery from the beggining, and the scene when Clio meets the jellyfishes, and the final scene. That's all.

After reading several of her novels, I have to say that I quite agree with her nomination and election (can queens be elected?). She is very skilled at writing from the perspective of a teenager, obviously not being a teen herself. For some authors who write YA, this struggle is quite obvious with their dialogue, main character's inner thoughts/actions, etc. Many succeed though and despite the large age difference between themselves and their characters, the tone and dialogue is amazingly accurate. One great example of an author who struggled but did NOT overcome would be Alyson Noel who wrote Evermore (I have not read any of her other books however, so I can only base my opinion solely on this first Immortals book).While I would not say that Maureen Johnson is my favorite author, I have consistently enjoyed every book written by her, which is quite the accomplishment. 13 Little Blue Envelopes is tied with this as my favorite of hers to date.First off, Maureen creates a character that I would love to be friends with. For me this is important. Not all good books need relatable and likeable characters, but it does make it easier to get into the story. In Girl at Sea, the main character is Clio. Aside from I myself being in love with the name (Clio being named after the Greek muse of history), right off that bat I find that I like her attitude. I appreciate wit and sarcasm in both daily life and with my heroines. When we are first introduced to Clio, she is fawning over a local boy who works at the art store: \"She was standing straight, so she slumped a little and arranged her face into a mask of minor melancholy. She approached slowly.\" Ya... so, that would definitely be the way I would react in a similar situation, especially as a teen. I overanalyzed everything (alright, so I still over analyze everything. Nothing has changed except for my age). These analyzations and introspective thoughts make for a very realistic teen character and really show off the author's skill at character development. Then we find out Clio's backstory. I won't go into much detail here because that provides a lot of the plot in Girl at Sea, but let's just say she has daddy issues. Not in a \"my daddy doesn't love me\" or \"my daddy hits me\" type of way (nothing wrong with those characteristics, it just wouldn't be right for this particular story). Instead, Clio's daddy issues have arisen from a number of questionable decisions that he has made (#1 Having is daughter get a tattoo at a very VERY young age. #2 Oh, and being pretty reckless with their money that results in her parents' divorce before the book even begins).The newest questionable decision that her father makes is to take Clio away from her home for the summer and force her to come with him on a wild adventure with people she has never met, and on a yacht that he can definitely not afford.Another reason why I think Maureen reigns as the Teen of Queen is that she doesn't just feed her readers the information. I absolutely despise an author who gives you all of the details upfront with a long backstory and an exhausting introduction to absolutely everything that is going to go down. Even in a non-thriller novel, we need a little suspense. Plus, it is a chronic problem that authors underestimate their readers. Give us a little credit.Girl at Sea includes some historical fiction aspects which make for quite the compliment to the modern day story and setting. Instead of force feeding us all of the facts we need to know right at the beginning of the group's grand adventure, we learn along with Clio. That is the way a good young adult story should read. There also needs to be some compelling characters aside from the main character of course. Here enters the cast: Clio's dad (the scuba diver and trip-funder), Clio's dad's girlfriend Julia (the archaeologist), Martin (Clio's dad's friend and the only sane adult on this trip), Elsa (Julia's daughter who translates and mostly sunbathes), and Aidan (the assistant who provides a potential love interest for the girls).Each of these characters have their flaws. They also have endearing qualities and storylines that make them well-rounded. None are static and all gain something from the trip. I would argue that Clio gains the most. She learns about love, adventure and family. What else could you ask for from a book?My only caveat with Maureen is her sometimes too quick climax and resolution. Let us enjoy the epicness of your endings once in a while Maureen! They are over too soon. Still, as I said before, there is a reason that she is the Queen of Teen. This book is quite the adventure in both mental and physical capacities. It's not a long or particularly heart-wrenching read, but it's a great story nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Amanda Pearl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4341394-amanda-pearl", "userReview": "Girl at Sea is an adorable tale of a young girl searching for herself, love, and buried treasure on the Mediterranean Sea. This book does a really great job explaining the different dynamics of Clio's relationship with her friends, her father, and her budding romance with Adian. The characters are totally believable. The strongest part of Girl at Sea is the character development. I had a clear sense of every character's opinions and goals even though the story was told from the perspective of Clio. The romance with Adian was developed realistically. There was not love at first sight, nor did some huge catastrophe bring them together. Girl at Sea book is not just a love story though. There is an interesting mystery where Clio tries to discover the purpose of her father's mission and then the mysterious objective of the mission itself. The historical experts add a fun bit of insight into their mission. I also LOVED the setting of Girl at Sea. I've been to Italy a couple of times and I've traveled to every location mentioned in the book. Maureen Johnson did a wonderful job describing the Italian scenery and atmosphere. Overall Girl as Sea is a fun book about a girl growing up oh the high seas. She encounters many adventures, some exciting and some dangerous, and through it all learns to forgive and love."}, {"userName": "Kaitie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1726671-kaitie", "userReview": "I picked this up after having read (and loved!) 13 Little Blue Envelopes and The Last Little Blue Envelope. Overall it was an enjoyable book, but didn't come close to being as good as the other two. Basically, we have Clio who it all set to have the best summer of her life when she finds out that instead she is being shipped off to spend the summer on a boat in Italy with her dad. Who wouldn't love that, right? Clio, that's who. We find out that Clio's dad is a bit eccentric and always has something going on in his life. This time is no different as Clio discovers that her dad, along with three other people, are on some secret mission that they won't tell Clio about. The story was interesting and the main character was likable, as with the Little Blue Envelope books, but I found parts of the story to be a little too predictable. I like most of the other characters and the interactions between them, but it was pretty obvious how certain things were going to go. All in all though, it was a fun read with family, romance, and adventure.

I thought she was unnecessarily rude to everyone: her dad, Aiden, Elsa, literally everyone. She had major attitude and an \"oh poor me\" attitude which didn't make sense for a girl who gets to spend her summer on a huge yacht in the gorgeous Mediterranean. The secondary characters were forgettable and not well developed. I also found that the flashbacks to the 1800s didn't really jive with the rest of the story.It was cool to be able to picture some of what she was looking at because I'm familiar with the Mediterranean, but it's pretty sad when your favorite thing about a book is the setting."}, {"userName": "Marjolein", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein", "userReview": "Full review to come!"}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2268493-sally", "userReview": "Okay, I know this doesn't really fit with \"voyages across the sea\", but I don't have any other ship/boat tag.I love the way Maureen Johnson writes. The narration is always so fast-paced and witty and FUN. So I really enjoyed this and it was a nice, quick read. I liked Clio and Elsa (loved Elsa!) and the story itself was really interesting. Clio's JUST gotten a summer job at the art store where cute Ollie works, when her mother tells her she's going to be spending summer with her father - since her mother is going to backwater Kansas for her work and Clio'd be dead bored there in ten seconds.Her father's in Italy at the present. And he's bought a yacht. Sounds like a fancy summer trip for a spoiled rich kid? Actually he's on a MISSION, though he doesn't immediately tell Clio what it is. Actually not sure if he does tell her or if she sneakily finds it all out herself? But she does do some snooping to find out why he's whisked the boat off into the water where there's no phone/internet so she can't contact Ollie! (They're searching for a kind of Rosetta-stone-ish thing that possibly went down with a ship about a hundred years ago.)Of course there's a Cute Guy on board as well, Julia's assistant. (Julia is Clio's dad's new gf, who is also his research partner. Elsa is her daughter. The 6th crew member is her dad's best friend and dive partner Martin.) I just had to check the blurb for the assistant's name: Aidan. Aidan and Clio seem to hate each other from the start. Which is fun. What was less fun for me was the way it was sooooo obvious that they were going to end up together. That of course he LIKES her and of course she LIKES him even though he aggravates her. *yawn* so that's why I can't give this five stars, because it was such a fun, unique, clever book, with a cool heroine, and it just ended up being another summer romance novel. Although at least there was a bit of PERIL! what with the jellyfish swarm that Clio swum through, and then the yacht being hijacked. Nice and exciting stuff!Also, what is with the girl on the cover? Clio's scar-turned-into-a-tattoo was mentioned a LOT in the book. You can see the model's arms in full. She's obviously not Clio. Elsa is also described vividly. The model is really not Elsa either.

While this story did not have as quirky of characters as her Suite Scarlett series, the amazing creativity of Maureen Johnson is still there.Clio had her summer all planned out. She had a new job and a possible future boyfriend. Instead she gets shipped off to her dad. Since her parent\u2019s divorce, she hasn\u2019t really liked her dad, and she is sick of his impulsivity. So to be stuck on a boat with him and four other random people for weeks does not sound like her dream summer.This story about a modern day treasure hunt, even though Clio doesn\u2019t know it yet. Clio\u2019s dad is trying to find a precious stone that was sunk in a shipwreck years ago. Clio has to figure out what her dad is trying to do, and finally whether or not she wants to help him. After being let down so often by him, she is hesitant to agree with anything he plans. Slowly, through learning to give him another chance, she realizes that sometimes people make mistakes and they need second chances.I really appreciated Clio\u2019s growth as a character. In the beginning, she was so bitter, upset, and negative. She thought she knew best about everything, and she did not want anything to do with anyone on the boat. But slowly, she let herself relax and really invest in other people\u2019s lives. By the end of the book, she\u2019s almost a completely different person. She isn\u2019t so obsessed with finding perfection, which will always escape her, and she sees more joy in simple life. She takes advantage of the opportunities presented to her instead of waiting for everything to be perfect.Literally, Maureen Johnson is amazing and sometimes I can\u2019t handle it.

I don\u2019t know if this only happens to me, or if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed it, but you can spend all the time in the world with someone in or around your city/town, and it will still be different when you go somewhere like on a crazy surprise cruise all to yourselves and you spend all your time together.

It\u2019s the same as if you suddenly moved in with them \u2014 you\u2019re bound to have disagreements, or even full-out explosive fights.Out of all her books that I\u2019ve read so far, I think Girl at Sea explores the theme of family the best. (Although The Key to the Golden Firebird is right up there with it.) Moreover, I personally can relate to the way this theme is written about in Girl at Sea completely. That definitely boosted its awesome factor even higher. You may read the first page and be confused. \u201cWhat is this girl talking about? Why is this not modern day?\u201d But you will soon learn that it\u2019s Maureen slyly building an underlying, historical backdrop, piece by piece until the end, where it\u2019s like zooming out of a detailed picture, and you see everything.

Unfortunately, I found the story line to be a bit boring.  Clio is upset when her potentially perfect summer is ruined when she is sent to live with her father. Her father, along with a research crew, are planning dives off the coast of Italy in a hunt for a missing artifact. Her and her father have had a strained relationship since his irresponsible ways caused her family to lose all their money and for Clio to get hurt in a potentially devastating accident. Needless to say, sailing around without any connection to the outer world, or without any idea as to what her father and crew are up to, Clio begins to resent her father even more. I felt that this story could have had potential but that it just never got there. Although as a reader you knew that Aidan and Clio would get together, that plot was dragged out way too long. Also, the technical terms and \"history\" in the story were just not interesting. I would find myself skimming those parts. Also, the shenanigans towards the end of the story just seemed unnecessary and ridiculous. I found myself starting to roll my eyes quite a bit. Although Clio was a solid lead character, this book definitely did not have the charisma of some of Johnson's other stories. I was definitely disappointed by this one.

A great light read for when you are in need of entertainment that is not mentally challenging."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446707-kimberly", "userReview": "I have read and enjoyed many of Maureen Johnson's books, but I enjoyed this one the most. While there have always been small things about the author's plots that bothered me, I found the plot of this story to be very cohesive and enjoyable. While the plot could of been very predictable, it took unexpected twists and turns which left me wondering what would happen next.Great book!"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118095-jill", "userReview": "While not quite as good as Bermudez Triangle in my opinion, the story is a more light-hearted and fun one nonetheless.
