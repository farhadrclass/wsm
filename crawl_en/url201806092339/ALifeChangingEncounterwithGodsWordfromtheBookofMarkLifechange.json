But to the end that it promotes further thought and questions about the book of Mark itself, it does a good job."}, {"userName": "Wade", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/306753-wade", "userReview": "All of the books in this series are solid theologically and ask good questions. Its the best single series I've personally used for introducing a book along with its purpose and who it was written to (if its an epistle) and why it was written. Very good stuff."}], "description": "Mark vigorously defends the claim that Jesus was the true Messiah and that His own people, the Jews, rejected Him because He came not as the glorious warrior-king they expected but as a suffering servant.
