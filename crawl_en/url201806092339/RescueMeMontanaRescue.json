(And that's saying a lot...) The action is way ramped up throughout the entire book, and I was literally biting my fingernails at times. (It was like watching a movie in my head!) I love the author's method of including two romances in the story- the main one between Sam and Willow, and also one between team members Jess and Pete, Sam's younger brother. The characters are strong, yet flawed, and all their journeys- physical and emotional- are compelling and human. I think that's why I connected with this story- each character has some major hang-ups, but it made them easier to relate to as they struggled and tried their best to do what they felt was right. The romances were both very \"will they/won't they\" and kept me turning pages and invested in the outcome. I'm loving this series and just can't wait for the third book!!! Highly recommend!(I received a complimentary copy of this book; all opinions in this review are my own)"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "Rescue Me is the second book in the Montana Rescue series and it was another great story! I had a hard time putting the book down and became so engrossed in the characters and everything that was going on. There were a lot of scenes that had me on the edge of my seat in suspense, wondering what was going to happen next for the characters.I had mixed feelings about the romance, because while I did really want them to end up together, I also wasn't 100% sure because of Sierra...but because of something that was revealed towards the end, I actually did like the romance. :)All in all, a fantastic story.

Love how this author skillfully uses the situations to illustrate spiritual truths, like parallels between a search and rescue operation, and the need for a Savior. The beautiful setting of the Rocky Mountains in Glacier National Park is a great place for many such perilous scenarios too. Felt like the characters had a lot going on, with discussions about relationships and spiritual struggles, but it was balanced well with a lot of action, so didn't bog down at all; it made the people seem real, with all of their ups and downs. Willow was my favorite person in the story, with her sincere faith, desire to help teens, and underlying insecurities. She's someone I'd like to have as a friend in real life!  This is the second book in this exciting series, but it was fine to read as a stand alone. It helped to have read the prequel for some background however; there is also a bit of a spoiler from the quick summary of book one. I hope to go back and read that one to fill in the details.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys Christian romances with action! 4.5 stars  (Book provided by NetGalley and the publisher.

This book has an incredible message on forgiveness and taking chances in order to live fully!However, the thing that touched me the most was how Sam had to let go an option in his life that seemed so right but didn't bring him joy. Sometimes, we fall into the trap of doing our \"duty\" without any delight, and it becomes a burden! Of course, we're not supposed to do what we feel all the time, but it doesn't mean our feelings are not important or that we shouldn't pay attention to them. That was a great lesson!This crew feels like family already, and I really can't wait to read Ian and Sierra's story!

Fighting for their survival after an accident, can both Willow & Sam find out just how strong they can be working together? Having read the first book of a new series \u201cWild Montana Skies\u201d, it was with gleeful anticipation that I longed for this second installment of the Montana Rescue novels.

Once the action started, each heart-pounding chapter ended on a cliff-hanger and I just couldn\u2019t turn the pages fast enough, making me read much later in the night than I usually do! There was so much packed into this story and so many layers it had me completely engulfed, devouring the novel in just two mere days! It also had me savoring it long after I closed the final page. The romance had me smiling, anticipating how it would play out between all the characters. You can see both Willow and Sam fighting their feelings for one another for valid reasons, but really, how can you fight true love when it happens? Most importantly, I love the authors strong faith-theme that shine in these characters messy and all too real lives. She doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the bad to tell a good story, she shows us how God fits into our all too messy lives and how He can pierce the darkness to shine His light.

Quite the thriller, with a car crash and a grizzly on the loose. I liked the layered stories with different people in the team, and I was relieved that Ian (from the novella) mostly stayed out of the drama...other than action, because I'm quite fed up with his selfish behavior.Deputy Sam Brooks is an interesting character, who has to learn what his own motivations and desires are. His brother Pete is the family wild child, trying to build a reputation, but Sam's got walls up, and neither can bridge the chasm between them.On the ladies' side you have Willow, trying to learn what her place in the world is, plagued by insecurities; Sierra, trying to move on after Ian broke her heart; and Jess, who is drawn to Pete's passion for life and yet terrified to tell him of her past.But behind all these colorful characters and all their adventures is a good deal of content I found too much. One girl wears yoga pants and a sweatshirt...ew. Yoga pants should be paired with a tunic top for modesty. When Pete (who admittedly has a colorful past with women) kisses a girl for the first time, there's tongue involved right off the bat...no. Just no.

I gobble up these books as soon as they are out and as fast as I can. This book in particular lends itself to be gobbled. It's full on, non stop and fast paced from the very beginning. Seriously- it was like a action/drama on steroids! It was hard to put down.Sam and Willow are both such great characters. Opposite in a lot of ways, but so good for each other. Sam doesn't get on board with this plan for quite awhile so we have to sit by and watch with frustration as he bumbles up pretty much everything when it comes to Willow. But, even when bumbling, Sam is a hero, a protector, a larger than life character that steals your heart. Watching him fight his demons and ultimately win was very satisfying.Willow is one of my favorites. She has such enthusiasm and joy, it's hard not to like her. She wears her heart on her sleeve and I love that. She genuinely cares about others and wants to help wherever she can. I want Willow to be my friend.And, like I said above, this book is full of action packed drama. I was all sorts of worked up! I can't wait for the next book!!

I like how it is loosely connected to the author\u2019s Montana Fire series, as well. Both of these series are packed with wonderful casts of characters, and this book is no exception to that.In Rescue Me, I enjoyed that there were two potential romances brewing. The main romance between Willow and Sam was fraught with confusion, danger, and the complication of Sam dating Willow\u2019s sister, Sierra. I loved the way these two came together.The other great, romantic tension and side story in the novel related to Sam\u2019s brother, Pete, and his teammate, Jess. There was a lot of chemistry between these two. Their growing attraction kept the story moving along nicely.There was plenty of danger, quite a few close calls, and a touching back story about Sam and Pete, which explained the hostility between these two brothers.

They sucked me in and convinced me to read this story. I'm so glad they didn't steer me wrong! ;) I loved Willow from the start, and wanted to hug her so many times over the course of the book. Sam definitely gives her some mixed signals in the beginning and I wanted to shake him a few times, but as he begins to realize how wonderful Willow is, I forgave him. These two have amazing chemistry together and as they both need a bit of rescuing from themselves, watching them learn to truly trust each other with their most vulnerable sides...ah my heart! It melted again and again. Of course, we get to the action of the story fairly quick and that kept me on my toes as well, wondering when they would be rescued and how it would happen.

This story was addictive, leaving me wanting more - more of the sizzling romance, more of the touching soul searching and faith affirmation, more of the tense action that just kept building and building and building. Rescue Me has so much going for it, so much packed into one novel. I can't wait to read book three in this awesome series.Deputy Sam Brooks knows what it takes to be the reliable one. He has to, especially because his brother continually shirks responsibility for fun and danger. And dating Sierra fits Sam's ideals of organisation and commitment. Willow, Sierra's younger sister, knows she is nothing like responsible Sierra. Willow aches for the day she might capture the attention of someone like Sam Brooks, but she feels that no one could ever want some one as irresponsible and impulsive as Willow. It's why the church is going to overlook her for the role of youth pastor, why she isn't trusted. But a series of high-risk accidents, starting with a grizzly bear attack, leave Sam and Willow relying on each other to save themselves and the teenagers in their care. While this is Sam and Willow's story, there are so many other stories beautifully intertwined. Rescue Me is the continuation of Sierra's story. It's the story of Sam's relationship with his brother Pete. And it's Willow's story of finding a place that feels safe and in which she feels needed, where she can face the disappointments of her past. It's the story of Pete's chance at redemption, to prove to his brother that he isn't always the crazy, reckless one. It's the story of Pete's relationship with fellow SAR teammate, Jess. And it's the start of Jess's story, of her past that she hopes will stay buried and the future she dreams about sharing with Pete but can't quite convince herself will ever happen. It's the story of a group of remarkable and hurting young teens who face many challenges, both in their everyday lives and in their struggle for survival in the harsh mountains of Montana. And finally, Rescue Me is the story of faith, learning to trust God, see His hand in everything, and rely on Him alone for rescue. Apart from all those wonderful, mixed-up, crazy-addictive stories, Rescue Me combines romance, friendship, and faith finding against a beautiful backdrop of gorgeous and deadly scenery. And there is so much action. So many twists and it-really-couldn't-get-any-worse-and-then-it-does scenarios. However, there were a few things I didn't like, particularly the name calling and judging of women who are out with guys. I think it is incredibly hypocritical to label and judge the women but not the men... But that's the best thing about Susan May Warren's writing - she takes flawed, realistic characters and gives them stories that test their values, and challenge them to take a better look and their life and their need for God.I really can't wait to continue this series and see what adventures are in store for us readers next. While this series is best read chronologically due to continuing story lines and characters, each book features it's own action-packed plot and could be read as a standalone.The publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes.

I never miss a one. She has written book two in her current series and she doesn't miss a beat. The book starts out with a draw in for the reader and the excitement only mounts with each page!Sam Brooks is dating Sierra, but her sister Willow has held a torch for him, but knows she will never have Sam. He loves Sierra. Willow has always felt out of place in life, but she is always cheerful, always hopes for the best in everyone, always sees the bright side. On an outing with the church youth group, Willow and Sam leading, they are in an accident and are lost in the icy wilderness, and no one knows where they are. Will they be rescued in time? There is also a rogue grizzly hanging around, too. Danger abounds here and Warren builds suspense regularly. I gasped more than once, I'll tell you that. I loved every moment of this book.Susan May Warren has a way of building the emotional depth in a character that they seem to almost leap off the page. And during that building, she creates deep spiritual truths as well. I always come away from reading her books with a blessing and a life lesson. This book was no different. Lesson here: we all need rescuing at some time or another. We can't do it all by ourselves and it's foolish to try, especially with God standing by ready and willing to help us with everything we go through.

And now that I have, I am in a bit of a reader funk...but not for long because Book Three, A Matter of Trust, comes out in just one month! Anticipation is mounting! I love the members of the PEAK Rescue Team and I won't be satisfied until I have the scoop on each and every one of them.Free-spirited Willow with her unorthodox upbringing and unrequited love drew me in right from the start. Her past is an emotional minefield that has her feeling 'less than'. She has yet to figure out that it's okay to be a work in progress...especially in God's Kingdom.Deputy Sam Brooks is definitely hero material -- in a flawed kind of way. He's the guy you can always count on.The take action, fix-it kind of guy...but he's also the one who needs to be in control and there's a boulder size chip on his shoulder which complicates all his relationships -- especially with his kid brother, Pete. (Insert happy swoon here because the author gives us a delectable peek into Pete's love life...well, the potential for one which is sure to be fleshed out in a future book...pretty please Ms. Warren.)I so appreciate the solid inspirational thread that winds its way throughout these characters lives...and consequently into mine. Both Willow and Sam are Christians but, like all of us, they are in need of divine rescuing. Harsh circumstances refine them as individuals and as a couple and there are so many wonderful faith discussions that ministered to me in a powerful way. Exactly what I love to find in a Christian Fiction novel.A stupendous addition to the Montana Rescue series (which reads really well as a standalone, by the way. All the books do.)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5721050-amy", "userReview": "Rescue Me by Susan May Warren is in my humble opinion her best book yet. To be fair, I have not read all of her books, but I have read many and this book just really captured me to the point that I am still thinking about it and it will not be a story I will soon forget. This story is the second in the Montana Rescue series and picks up where the first one left off. One of the things I really like about this series is that for the most part the stories wrap up, but just at the very end the author throws out a trail of crumbs and I anxiously await the next in the series.This story focuses on Sam and Pete Brooks who are two brothers still reeling from a family tragedy that happened years ago, and this tragedy has altered their relationship. Not only with each other, but also with the women they love. Sam is the responsible one and Pete is reckless. Enter the ladies and these two must rescue their happily ever after\u2019s.We really get to know more about Willow and see how she works, her very positive outlook on life and agonize with her as she tries to keep her feelings for Sam hidden since her sister Sierra and him appear to be perfect for each other. Jess also comes into the limelight in this story and we get a little more background information on her and there is much more to her then first appears.This story had me on the edge of my seat from the first page with grizzly attacks, snowstorms, and watching this team fight nature tooth and nail to save those they love. I really enjoyed the first in this series but this book really ramped up the danger and action. Sam and Willow\u2019s romance was just so beautiful to watch unfold and the rocky road they had to travel to get there was worth the late nights I stayed up reading. What I think touched me the most was the symbolism of the title, Rescue Me, and after reading the author\u2019s heartfelt notes, I can really see how much her heart and soul was in this story. I received a copy of this book for free. I was not required to give a positive review and the views and opinions expressed are my own.

I'm so glad I read the 'starter' novella too. The story of Ian and Sierra is a golden thread that runs through each of the books. The characters are so vivid in this series and in this book. Sam is the 'ultimate' hero type. As we start to get to know the man Sierra is dating, we see he has some very human characteristics, because, hey ladies, men are not perfect! This is a man who needs to discover that about himself, actually learn that he can't do it all. Willow is the delightful character who has been fluttering around in the background and now she steps into the light. I find her to be adorable and stronger than she every dreamed possible. She has an amazing heart that gets her into trouble because it rules her senses. She belongs wholly to God and wants to prove herself. Needs to prove herself and to be taken seriously. Get these two hovering around one another and be ready for a wild ride of quality reading time. The book focuses on human nature. Setting human nature out into the wild of nature makes for a book that I had a very hard time putting down. Susan makes me care about each character, even the secondary members of the story's cast. She has really developed and drawn out each one to highlight the value of her main characters which, to me also include Sam's brother Pete, and another member of the rescue team, Jess. She also naturally brings the leadership of God to the forefront. She is a story teller with the ability to bring the past, pain, humor, fear, anger and so much more together to create a believable story that pertains to today. It's a story that I think will be appreciated by teens through senior adult readers.I can't wait for the third and final book in this series.

I really enjoyed the first novel\u2014although not as much as the Christiansen Family series, but I have to say, this second installment was way, way better than the first one!!! Not that Wild Montana Skies wasn\u2019t good, it\u2019s just that this one blew it out of the water! I absolutely fell in love with Sam in the previous novel, and I fell even harder for his brother, Pete, who was introduced in this one. I was super sad about the way it ended for Pete, but since this story wasn\u2019t in fact all about him but rather about his brother, I understand why his had to be the happy ending.Sam Brooks is super sweet, and always the hero, but I knew immediately that there was something deeper brewing under the surface. As soon as I learned what was really going on with him, I was floored, and I felt for him even while I hated the way he treated Pete. I had to understand that it was complicated, and that there were years of resentment hidden behind the scenes, but his attitude towards it all really made it harder for me to truly like him! Especially after the way he goes back and forth with Willow! She deserves better than that for sure, but I will say he most certainly made up for that in the end!Willow Rose is so completely impulsive, heart-on-her-sleeve, wonderful, that I couldn\u2019t help but love her immediately, and since I want to be a youth pastor myself, her heart for the teens definitely drew me in right away. I understood how she felt inadequate but still wanted to give them her all, and that made me feel like she was a kindred spirit I wish I could truly get to know (if she were actually real of course). Although her fun-loving impulsiveness did get her into a heap of trouble more than once, anyone could see she really did want to help her teens grasp the real truths behind their faith, and her own rough growing-up years helped her to truly understand what some of them were going through.All in all, this story completely blew me away, and I would definitely say that it is one of Susan\u2019s best. She truly killed it with this novel, and I am absolutely dying to see how she\u2019s going to continue Jess and Pete\u2019s story. As far as I know, she hasn\u2019t said she\u2019s going to write a novel for them yet, so hopefully if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019ll intertwine it in one of the next two: A Matter of Trust which is Gage\u2019s novel, or the fourth novel that, if the rumors I have heard are true, will be Ian and Sierra\u2019s. Anyway, I\u2019ve obviously given this book all five bookshelves, and it most definitely is on my all-time favorites list! Check it out; I promise you won\u2019t regret it!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8807580-becky", "userReview": "I've come to expect a fast-paced, engaging, romantic read when I pick up a Susan May Warren novel, and that's exactly what I got with Rescue Me. The second full novel in Warren's Montana Rescue series, Rescue Me focuses on PEAK Rescue member Sam Brooks. Newly dating Sierra Rose, he believes her to be the perfect woman for him. Sierra's sister Willow desperately wants Sierra to have a successful relationship, so she keeps her feelings for Sam hidden. But when Sam and Willow are thrown together again and again, even facing death as they are stranded with a group of teens in Glacier National Park, Willow's feelings can't help but come to the surface...and Sam is surprised to find that he reciprocates those feelings.Besides fighting for his life and trying to sort out his feelings for the Rose sisters, Sam also has to deal with his complicated relationship with his brother Pete. Pete is also a member of PEAK, but Sam can barely stand to be near him, as he blames Pete for their father's death. Watching Sam and Pete's relationship change throughout the novel was one of my favorite aspects. (For those who read Warren's Christiansen Family series, Sam and Pete's relationship reminds me a lot of Casper and Owen Christiansen's relationship, though it's perhaps not quite as volatile.)In Rescue Me, Pete gets his own romance\u2014with PEAK Rescue member Jess. Their relationship begins as friends, but it slowly morphs to something more before Jess's secrets and Pete's womanizing ways get in the way of their happily ever after. At novel's end, their relationship is far from stable, and I look forward to watching it develop in future novels.While not much progress is made in the series' overarching plot, the search for PEAK Rescue founder Ian's niece, Ian and Sierra do begin interacting again, and I'm a huge fan of their romance (begun in the prequel novella If Ever I Would Leave You). So I was quite happy to see Sam move on from Sierra :-)I started reading Rescue Me one afternoon, and I didn't stop until I'd finished it. It is wholly engaging, full of realistic relationships, and features a healthy dose of action and adventure. I can't wait to read the next in the series.Disclosure of material connection: I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher.

What touched me most about the title and book was the author\u2019s note about her life during the writing of the novel, which I am sure will touch the heart of many people as we tend to forget that authors are people too.In the story, we get to meet Willow who is a very caring, loving young woman who also wears her heart on her sleeve. Deputy Sam Brooks though is the polar opposite of Willow in that he doesn\u2019t allow himself to try new experiences. In fact, he has built a wall around his heart, thinking it will keep him from experiencing pain again. However, he is also missing out on experiencing love, mercy, compassion and a deeper walk with God.Willow volunteers to work with the youth group at her church and sometimes her spur of the moment decisions get her into deep trouble or hard places. Her sister, Sierra Rose, is the only family Willow feels who loves her for who she is and will not leave Willow no matter what happens. On what was to be a day hike with the youth group where Sam also goes along to keep them safe and help with the youth suddenly turns into trying to stay alive in a remote part of the forest. Now PEAK is involved to help locate the group, but the weather isn\u2019t cooperating and Sam might not make it out alive!Susan May Warren is a gifted author who tells compelling tales in a setting fraught with danger, adventure, family and faith. I enjoy books that pull me in and make the people real as they make bad choices or wrestle out issues they may have with God due to a life experience. Each book set in Montana is so well described it makes me want to go and see the mountains and forests, but not the bears in this book!If you have never read any of Susan\u2019s novels you are in for a real treat! I do find it helpful to read her series in order as each story builds upon the previous book. So, before book three comes out, catch up and like me look forward to the next novel with expectation for more adventures in Montana!"}, {"userName": "Haley S", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268420-haley-s", "userReview": "This is my first novel by Susan May Warren, and I am happy to say that I enjoyed it very much! I do have to say, though, that I have read a novella/short story/prequel by Susan. I read If I Would Ever Leave You. I don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers, but I do have to say that the way that story ended made me want to read the rest of the series.I know that I am reading the Montana Rescue series out of order. I mean, this is the second book in the series. The first book is called Wild Montana Skies. And, by the way, it is sitting on my bookshelf right now waiting to be read!Back to the book at hand! I really enjoyed this book. I couldn\u2019t put it down and wanted to keep reading to find out what happened. I liked Sam and Willow, as well as Pete and Jess. I can\u2019t wait to read a full story about Pete and Jess\u2026due to the ending of this book\u2026.okay, now I am just going to stop talking about them in case I give away any spoilers. But, Sam and Willow\u2019s story was really intriguing! They are a perfect couple!Also, I cannot wait to read more about Ian and Sierra. Their story has been going on throughout the whole series (or as much as I have read) and I cannot wait for an \u2018ending\u2019 to their story\u2026enough said.The cover is okay. It isn\u2019t my favorite, but it is still good. And, it looks like the rest of Susan\u2019s book will have the main guy\u2019s \u2018face\u2019 on the cover. Due to the fact that Sam\u2019s \u2018face\u2019 is all over the cover, I kinda automatically thought that that is what Sam looked like. So, I will give it 3 stars.As for the story inside the cover, it definitely deserves 4 stars. I can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the books in the series!Title: Rescue MeAuthor: Susan May WarrenAuthor\u2019s Website: http://www.susanmaywarren.com/This review is written in my own opinions and words.Giveaway Alert:April 25th was also It Starts with a Book\u2019s first birthday!

It's been a long time coming, and for 12 years since he lost his father in a skiing accident - he has not been able to forgive his brother & fellow PEAK team member, Pete. Despite playing the carefree, womanizing, everyone's hero, Pete is lost in the same place. Animosity between the brothers has been festering for years. Willow, has lived a fairly rule less carefree life, growing up in a commune, where her mother lived a hippy lifestyle. Not gaining her GED, she feels like there isn't a lot of career options for her, other than a slew of part time jobs. What she lacks in formal education she more than makes up for in her deep devotion to God. She has volunteered as a local youth group leader, and has her sights set on the Youth Pastor position. Except, one disaster too many for Willow, and the youth of the town, seems to consign her to her lot. She'll never be trusted by those who make the decisions to keep the kids safe. Willow has secretly had a crush on Sam, but he only has eyes for her sister Sierra, and after a kiss in the darkness of a hospital cafe - complications arise. Jess, fellow PEAK team member has been hiding a secret, only Chet & Ty seem aware of. She struggles constantly with her growing feelings for Pete - her mind telling her to keep him in the friend zone, her heart however has other ideas.This story, takes us further into the beautiful world of Glacier NP. Most of the locations in this story are places I've had the blessing of visiting. I love getting the opportunity to go back there in my thoughts, along with the PEAK SAR team. There is nothing quite like this place, and it truly makes a perfect backdrop to these stories that take you into danger & survival over and over. This story is far from predictable. It will constantly leave you in shock, and suspense, twisting everything you thought the direction was going. I literally could not put this book down. I love this series. The author skillfully writes a large group of characters, major team members & plenty minor townsfolk that play a part - without you feeling lost or confused. Mercy Falls is fast becoming familiar and I just cannot wait for book 3. Thank you to Netgalley & Revell for the ARC. This is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kella", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14884940-kella", "userReview": "Is it possible to love a sequel more than the first book?Is it?!!! Before I read Rescue Me I would have given you an emphatic \u201cNo!\u201d, resolutely sure that a sequel could never hold a higher rank in my heart than the original. But that was before. And this is now, after the book cover has closed, after my heart has stopped thundering in my chest, after I caught myself squirming in tense anticipation and squealing in delight over the pages I poured over.The after me, well\u2026I am quite sound in the idea that yes, loving a sequel more than the first book in a series is in fact extremely possible, plausible, and currently happening.It helps that hero Deputy Sam Brooks is tall, dark, and reserved. A truly stalwart fellow if there ever was one. His only fault is that he loves the perfect girl, Sierra Rose, who happens to be a safer, more practical version of himself and perfectly complimentary in every way. Not at all like Sierra\u2019s free-spirited younger sister, Willow Rose,who gets under Sam\u2019s skin more often than naught for reasons he doesn\u2019t want to dig into. Besides, he\u2019s got more important things to do than worry about Willow \u2013 keeping the town safe and out of peril.But peril sort of follows Willow around, unfortunately, like a lost puppy. Amidst figuring out what she wants to do in life, Willow gets the bright idea for her church\u2019s youth group to go on a day hiking trip, and peril tags along for kicks and giggles. Which is basically when things go from bright and fun to dark and devastating. Stuck in a van hanging over a cliff kind of devastating. Its enough to make any person second-guess what they\u2019re doing with their life!With non-stop action, Susan May Warren takes her readers on a thrilling search-and-rescue adventure though the wilderness of Montana. Rescue Me is an unforgettable sequel to Wild Montana Skies in the Montana Rescue series. I am so excited to see what happens next in this series!! Is it July yet? Because I\u2019m totally read to dig into A Matter of Trust, the 3rd novel and story of daredevil snowboarder, Gage Watson. Cue the swoons! ;) Add this entire series to your TBR list \u2013 you\u2019re going to love them all!I was graciously provided a free copy of this novel from Revell in exchange for an honest review.

Now sigh. Wow! And that, my friends is one enticing cover, but that's not all. The moment you open this book and start reading about Sam, Willow, Sierra, Pete and Jess you will be so engrossed in their lives, you can't help but go onto the next page. That's Rescue Me. \n(Meme)\nDespite the handsome cover model, I could almost do a quick shake of Sam. He's so wound up. So burden by his grief and anger that he's not seeing. He's not seeing his brother, his 'girlfriend', himself and most definitely not seeing Willow and her heart. Willow, sweet and generous in nature and the sister of Sam's girlfriend. Now how is that going to work out? In the perfect way possible. Sam and Willow, one uptight, the other a free spirit, yet they bring out the best of each other. All the supporting characters were just spot on. I can't wait to catch up on the rest of them, Pete and Jess, Ian and Sierra and Gage. \"...for a second just wanted to grab her and tell her, in a crazy, impulsive declaration, that he would change his world for her...\" (192)With romance (the kisses!), in-depth character development, profound message of God's grace, and not to mention the action-packed story-line that will have your heart pounding with excitement, Rescue Me is a keeper and a must read. It is for sure my favorite Susan May Warren novel (granted this is only the third one of her novels I've read). Pick your's up now.  \"It's all about letting God in, with his grace to forgive, to heal. God's light can overtake the darkness.\" (220)This review first appeared on Just Commonly blog.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author/publisher.

This is my honest opinion."}], "description": "When Deputy Sam Brooks commits to something, nothing can sway him--not just on the job as liaison between the Mercy Falls sheriff's department and PEAK Rescue, but in his private life. He's the one who stuck around to take care of his mother after his father's accidental death. And he's the one--perhaps the only one--who believes Sierra Rose is the perfect girl for him. Safe, practical, and organized, she's nothing like her hippie, impulsive, bleeding heart sister, Willow.Willow, however, has been in love with Sam Brooks for as long as she can remember. But she wants her sister to have a happy ending. Besides, Willow has other things to focus on--namely, nabbing the job as youth pastor for her small-town church. Best thing for her to do is to purge Sam from her heart.Neither can predict the events that will bring them together in a fight for their lives in the forbidding wilderness of Glacier National Park. Stranded, injured, and with the winter weather closing in, Sam and Willow will have to work together to save a crew of terrified teenagers. As they fight to survive, they might just discover a new hope for love.", "title": "Rescue Me\n      \n          (Montana Rescue #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30259142-rescue-me", "average": 4.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467132269l/30259142.jpg", "reviews": 245, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54106.Susan_May_Warren", "name": "Susan May Warren"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary", "Christian", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30259142-rescue-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32710793-rescue-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656048.Happily_Ever_After", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17253180-take-a-chance-on-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18232501-it-had-to-be-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/672779.Flee_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19320758-when-i-fall-in-love"]}
