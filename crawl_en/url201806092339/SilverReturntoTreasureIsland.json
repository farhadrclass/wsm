Even more, I enjoyed the Muppets version of the film immensely, however that is a separate issue. As far as sequels of classic novels go, typically I am not a fan. Usually, they are glorified fan fiction works - a poorly written attempt to relive the glory of enjoying and loving a previous novel. This novel, however, was far more than just a higher quality of fan fiction. It was a work all to itself, drawing upon the history of the idea of Treasure Island to tell its own narrative. The style it used hinted at the previous novel and was beautifully written for a novel of two years ago. It felt like the classic prose of the 1800s or even the early 1900s and had a rhythm to it. As I read there were moments when the beauteous simplicity of a phrase as well as the clever conjecture of the main phrasing struck my eye. The plot follows the children of Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver: Young Jim Hawkins and Natty Silver. Natty Silver, being a female presence, adds an extra dimension to the story - a romantic element that was not so present in the original text, as well as allowing for a more feminist reading. These two children are tasked with venturing back to Treasure Island to retrieve silver for Long John, as was left behind. However, what they find on the Island is more than they had expected: the island is now inhabited by tyrannical pirates who lord themselves over Jamaican slaves.It's a novel with plenty of poignant themes and rhythmic moments and one I would not have read had it not been for university studies. However, I am glad I did read this novel and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of seafaring adventures and poetic language. Or for those who are interested in themes of slavery, colonialism and adventure as explored in the late 1700s or early 1800s but written from modern perspectives."}, {"userName": "Tom Vater", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9534135-tom-vater", "userReview": "Hey ho and a buttle of Rum, laddies, pull your cutlasses and sink this ship. It ain't fit to sail the pirate seas.I must admit, I had high swashbuckling hopes for Silver. A sequel of sorts to Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, a high rolling high seas adventure that's been a favorite of mine pretty much since I have been able to read.Unfortunately Andrew Motion's Silver is a moralistic dud, mired in cliches and stuffy as chintz. Motion is an accomplished poet and editor, and no doubt, the writing is assured, the style effectively harks back to Stenvenson's wonderful tale of pirate derring-do and the story starts off promising enough with Jim Hawkins the younger, son of Jim Hawkins, the boy who traveled on the Hispaniola to the dreaded Treasure Island in the original text, tending bar for his embittered aging father. His life is solitary and frustrating until one fine day Natty, the daughter of Long John Silver, the most charismatic character in Treasure Island, and perhaps one of the most remarkable characters in literature generally, turns up on his doorstep and suggests he join her on a return journey, financed by her dying father, to the island, to extract more loot. A bit thin but so far so good.The young teenagers have a ship at their disposal, commandeered by righteous Captain Beamish and manned by a crew of salt dogs vaguely reminiscent of the gang that shipped out on the Hispaniola, the ship in the original tale. But only just vaguely.As soon as the intrepid explorers head West, the story hits deep waters and begins to drown. Because the premise is feeble, the story feels episodic, the connections between chapters first appear flimsy, then appear merely connected by the author's far too obvious moral make-up and finally collapse into-pseudo Christian or Enlightened (depending on your point of view) nonsense.On the boat, young Jim, passive and ultimately boring throughout with not a filthy thought for Natty in his dull unimaginative mind, is challenged by the nephew of Israel Hands, one of the pirates in the original book, who gets so worked up about the boy's presence that he stabs a crew man to death and then jumps overboard drowning himself. The scene, through engagingly written, has little influence if any on the rest of the text and is symptomatic of Silver. One asks Why? expecting a punch line later that never comes.The boat eventually reaches the island which is inhabited by the three pirates who were left there forty years earlier in Treasure Island. These guys should be dead or at least seriously decrepit by now, but they are having the times of their lives, partying with a group of slaves and their masters who got shipwrecked years earlier.In Andrew Motion's book, literally and proverbially speaking, pirates are bad. There's no Jack Sparrow around and certainly no John Silver either. Pirates are bad, period. They drink, they rape, they kill, the island has made them insane. But not entertainingly so.Jim and Natty are good, incensed and shaken to the core by this depravity and the rest of the book is really just a tale about how the world's evil can and must be fought. Yawn.I doubt Andrew Motion has ever been anywhere other than the local supermarket or done anything other than give talks in Oxbridge - this is academic middle class white man's writing at its worst.Stevenson was an intrepid traveler who was ill most of his life and ended his days on a tropical island. His book drips with moral ambiguity and the most fleshed out character, Silver was vile and heroic, animal and human in turns.In Motion's Silver, these qualities are neatly separated between the bad guys and the good guys. And it gets worse.As Jim and Natty stumble round the island, they discover strange animals. The dodo is familiar enough but squirrels the size of dogs sound like they have escaped from Dr. Moreau. No explanation, no reason for them to be in the story. Another creature is heard but never seen.In the book's most depressing episode, Jim and Captain Beamish who behaves like a sentimental idiot who deserves to die (and die he does) encounter a beach full of sea lions that's straight out of a Greenpeace ad. Jim goes for a swim, underestimates the current, drowns and is saved by a sea lion pup. What?The comments on slavery are revolting - Beamish changes the mission he is endowed with from finding the loot and getting the hell off the island to saving the 'negroes', a passive, Bible-clutching bunch, who know their place, except for the leader Scotland who escapes the clutches of the pirates only to end his life later after his wife is killed (in one of the very few good scenes as one of the evil pirates kills her for fun). Beamish endangers his crew because he is a progressive thinker. In one of the most stomach churning moments, he reflects that while slavery is by no means finished (We are talking early 19th century. And hasn't Motion ever read anything about iPhone factories in China?), it is to be stamped out at any cost, even at the risk of sacrificing his crew, ship and mission and himself. He gets most of what he wants, including a bullet in his head for his pathetic idealism.No, this apparently is not a children's book written for retarded mid-western Christian families. Though it should come with a warning - Children's Advisory - Do not read this unless you want to go through life thinking that the world is a good place.Eventually the pirates are killed, the slaves rescued, the treasure found, the young couple separated and reunited. All's well, we set sail, a huge storm catches up with the ship which is promptly thrown against a reef and sinks. Only Jim and Natty survive. Why? For the sequel of the sequel of course. Now that is 21st century. Treasure Island 3 has been threatened. Oh well. Maybe Batman can join in the next one. I've spoiled it now.Andrew Motion truly missed the boat. What made Treasure Island so very brilliant was Silver's ambiguity. He was one of the very first characters in literature to be believable. In a sense, Motion has turned the literary wheel backwards to a pre-Victorian age, where men were men and sheep were nervous and for this he should be hung, drawn and quartered. Even drinking is frowned upon. What rot.An infuriating, depressing read, utterly out of sync not only with the pirate's life but also with the times we live in.

For a split second, I thought about posting this entire review in seafarin' hearty talk (aka pirate speak), but I quickly came to my senses. You couldn't blame me, though, if I did, because for the past few days I've been on a rollicking adventure across (one) of the Seven Seas in search of booty...err...treasure. Translation: I've been reading Silver: Return to Treasure Island\u00a0by Andrew Motion.A sequel of sorts, Silver\u00a0takes place some 40 years after the events of Robert Louis Stevenson's\u00a0Treasure Island, and tells the story of Jim Hawkins' son, Jim (I'll call him Young Jim to avoid confusion) and Long John Silver's daughter, Natty.\u00a0Young Jim lives with his father and works at the family inn called the Hispaniola. Young Jim's father is a man who lives in the past, and spends his present retelling the adventures of his youth to anyone who will listen. One night, Young Jim is beckoned by a lone figure in a boat, who turns out to be Long John Silver's daughter, Natty. Natty proposes the two return to Treasure Island in search of the buried treasure that was left behind by their fathers.\u00a0Up until now, Young Jim has led a fairly solitary and uneventful existence, so it doesn't take much convincing for him to steal the treasure map from his father's chest. Map in hand, ship and crew at the ready, and the promise of adventure awaiting him at every turn, Young Jim sets out with Natty and the two retrace their fathers' footsteps all the way to Treasure Island.The voyage to the island is not entirely smooth sailing, however, as Young Jim and Natty face nasty weather and troublesome sailors, but it's their arrival at Treasure Island that proves to be the biggest challenge of all.\u00a0It turns out a pirate's life is\u00a0not a wonderful life\u00a0after all, as Captain James Hook has led me to believe, at least not for the three pirates left marooned on Treasure Island by Young Jim's father and Long John Silver many years before. Years of desertion have driven the marooned pirates half-mad, and Young Jim and the rest of his crew are\u00a0appalled\u00a0at the\u00a0atrocious\u00a0acts they witness at the hands of the three stranded pirates.Silver\u00a0is a fun follow-up \u00a0novel, best suited for those who wish to return to Treasure Island, and has all the elements for a riveting tale: adventure, buried treasure, a secret map, sword fights, Mr. Long John Silver himself, and, of course, Treasure Island. Motion has done an excellent job in keeping with the spirit of the original, and I have to say the language is pretty bang on, not to mention lyrical. Take this passage, for example:All my senses quickened: every gleam of sunlight on the leaves around us seemed to be the blade of a sword, every scuffling bird the footstep of an enemy. - p. 174For the most part, I quite enjoyed\u00a0Silver, though I probably would have enjoyed it more if it were a bit shorter, since there seemed to be a bit of repetition and long-winded passages (as one reviewer calls it: \"Long(Winded) John Silver\"). Also, what this book is lacking - and what prevented it from receiving a four-star rating - are the archetypal elements that made Treasure Island such a defining piece of literature. I wanted to read about a one-legged pirate with a talking parrot on his shoulder; I wanted someone to yell \"Shiver my timbers!\" and sing \"Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum\"; and I wanted some unfortunate soul to walk the plank or fall victim to the Black Spot. In short, I wanted mutiny, plundering, and swashbuckling. Though we have Treasure Island\u00a0to thank for these pirate tropes, these\u00a0stereotypical pirate characteristics are not present in\u00a0Silver. Compared to the colourful characters in\u00a0Treasure Island, the characters in\u00a0Silver, with the exception of only a couple,\u00a0seem almost saintly, with their high morals, good deeds, and overall unpirate-like behaviour.\u00a0Indeed, Silver\u00a0has the basic elements of a pirate story, but it is decidedly less pirate-like than its predecessor.Overall,\u00a0a good read as long as ye be okay wit' th' fact that though 'twas a pirate's life fer Long John Silver 'n Jim Hawkins, 'tis more o' a sailor's life fer Young Jim 'n Natty.

Her dark dresses, severe bun and black glasses gave her a stern air which definitely deterred anyone from running and talking loudly in the library. But, it was she who fed and fostered my love of reading. I always asked her what I should read next. To her credit, she never, ever brushed me off. One summer she decided I would read the classics - Swiss Family Robinson, Robinson Crusoe, Treasure Island and more. It was the sense of adventure, the unknown and putting myself into the character's shoes that spirited me away for many a hot afternoon.With the release Andrew Motion's new book Silver - Return to Treasure Island - I was yet again transported away on a adventure with pirates, parrots and plunder.Jim Hawkins returned to England with his share of the treasure and now, in 1802, is an innkeeper. He runs the inn with the help of his son Jim. Jim has grown up hearing the tale of Treasure Island over and over again. And so has Natty, who shows up one night with a proposition for young Jim from her father - Long John Silver. Silver wants young Jim to 'obtain' the map to Treasure Island from his father. There is still treasure to be recovered and Silver will provide the ship, captain and crew for the voyage. He is too infirm to go himself, so Natty will go in his place, disguised as a boy.Andrew Motion is a superb storyteller. His tale pays homage to Stevenson, keeping the tone and language true to the time. The book isn't a fast paced swashbuckler, although there is of course a requisite sword fight. Rather, it is somewhat leisurely in spots, allowing us to take in Jim's narrative and descriptions. A third of the book is devoted to getting to the island. Once there, Motion does a great job of re imagining what the island would be like - and what happened to those left marooned many years ago. It is here that the story takes off - good vs. evil, love lost and found, duty and honour and more. In a sly nod to the original, the crewman most often in the crow's nest, keeping an eye out - is named Stevenson. The ending left me a bit unsatisfied. The door has been left open for a sequel's sequel. I'm not sure if children today would enjoy this sequel or not, but this adult quite enjoyed being transported back to her childhood."}, {"userName": "Dudley Namoins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41741941-dudley-namoins", "userReview": "I guess I'm in the minority in thinking this book was great but whatever.

Having left some pirates and silver on the island it makes sense that somebody would return for the treasure but daft not to have prepared to fight for it by remembering to bring some decent weapons and a few Marines rather than the author of the original tale. Jim Hawkins' son and Old Barbecue's daughter make an unlikely pairing, especially as Natty is disguised as a boy for long periods to reduce the risk of her being violated. The plot is fairly predictable but the writing is excellent. It does proceed at a cracking pace early on. I did wonder about some anachronisms - Brown Bread me hearties? Got to watch that fibre intake - and the inevitable political correctness that would not have been tolerated in supposedly contemporaneous account. Oh, and Billy Bones' map is hard to distinguish without a magnifying glass. The author certainly does not flinch from depicting the bloody details of sudden violent death. I did find the climactic battle scene to be overly drawn out as though it were being written to be viewed in slow (Andrew?) motion. There's even a long \"Nooooooo\" from Jim, as he tries to save his father figure that brought intrusive Star Wars parodies to mind. I had to skim through this bit and for some reason got terribly anxious about the silver afterwards. In fact I can't remember ever being so apprehensive while reading \"Just get the stuff on board and get the hell out you fools.\" Perusal of the chapter titles before reading does rather forewarn you that the ending is unlikely to be upbeat.Whisper it softly but I preferred the - to my mind - unsurpassable \"Biggles Flies West\" by Captain W.E. Johns. That book contains a really memorable (and short) climactic battle scene and a more satisfying ending."}, {"userName": "Carly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly", "userReview": "**edited 11/28/13Silver is a cute and very close-to-canon continuation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. If you check it out on audio, it is narrated by none other than David Tennant, alias The Tenth Doctor from the TV programme Doctor Who. According to the story, Jim Hawkins of Treasure Island fame got his treasure, bought an inn, and settled down to what turned out to be very short-lived wedded bliss. His son, also Jim, who I will refer to as Jim#2 (although as far as I recall he's really Jim#3), grew up with a distant, grieving father whose main interaction was to tell story after story about his adventures on the high seas. One night, Jim#2 is lured out of the inn by a young girl, who turns out to be none other than the daughter of the infamous Long John Silver. And when Jim#2 meets Long John, the old pirate has a story of his own: he tells Jim#2 that the original treasure seekers only brought back the gold from the island, leaving...wait for it...all of the silver behind. Soon, Jim#2 is tempted to steal his father's map and start an adventure of his own....And that's all I'm going to post here. \nThe rest of my (rather verbose) review is posted over here at Booklikes.\nWhy?

I was very excited when I heard that Andrew Motion was writing a sequel to Treasure Island! I had to go out and buy a copy as soon as it was released.I haven't been disappointed with \"Silver - The Return to Treasure Island\" it's set quite a few years on from the original and begins with the original Jim Hawkins, now an old man and running the inn, The Hispaniola on the murky eastern marshes of the Thames, his son also called Jim Hawkins longs for adventure having been brought up on his fathers tales of Treasure Island.

It's not that it wasn't beautifully written, it's just that it was a lot less exciting than I remember Treasure Island being. I suspect if I'd read more of Andrew Motion's work, I might have a different opinion, but coming to the book as a fan of Treasure Island, the characters just felt a bit weak to me. I kept waiting for the darker side to kick in, for betrayal and plotting, for the characters to grow up or change, but it was all in a rather philosophical reflective tone, which took a lot the punch out of the events. I kept seeing places where the story might take a more sinister turn, and instead it took an easier option. The parrot crying 'leave me alone' was a good example.However, that said, the description of the island, of the sound of surf pounding relentlessly on the shore, will stay in my mind for a long time."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6314445-emily", "userReview": "Yay I finally finished this!

Really, I should never expect any sequel (especially written hundreds of years later by a separate author) to be very good. I'm busy scratching my head this morning over how to God this book ended up on my to-reads.Anyhow, there are lots and lots of problems with this book, but I shall only highlight a few of them. The most egregious was the 40 years span between ending of TI and beginning of Silver. I do not understand why this was necessary. From the start, I was horrified to think that Silver (who was at least 30 at end of TI) had a kid the same age as Jim's kid (who was in my recollection more like 12 at the end of TI). At some point Motion tries to reconcile this by commenting that Jim Sr. was 18 at the end of TI (not sure I buy that one, but okay) and that Nat's mom is in her 60s. This still means that in the late 1700s, Silver was fathering a child at 50 (or older), his wife was pregnant older than 40 (again let me remind folks that THIS IS IN THE LATE 1700s) AND that the fearsome pirates that our young protagonists find on the island are also in their 70s. Huh? Really? I was trying to figure out the whole first 1/3 of the book why Motion felt he needed such a time lapse (couldn't it have been 25 years...both Jim and Silver had kids within 7 years of end of TI...much MORE PLAUSIBLE) and then we landed on the Island and there was a virtual city. Oh, yes, this makes sense he needed 40 years for a second generation to arise on TI and create awful nemesis and built a village. Uh, no. The pirates (leaders, those snarky 70 year olds) were actually ALONE on the island for 35 years. It is not 2nd generation slaves or masters that we see, it is the originals and their newly (only 5 years) acquired slaves. What? Again, why the 40 years?? As one can see, this part really, really bugged me.The only thing that makes even a bit of sense is that the 40 year lag went to explain the aversion to slavery felt by the people on the Nightingale (early 1800s vs. late 1700s), but I still thought that was anachronistic. I'm not sure any newly arrived boat load of folks (even decent upstanding ones) would be so horrified to find that a boatload of slaves crashed on the island and the slaves were still treated as slaves. I'm not defending the institution of slavery here, mind you, but come on...these were people who had been removed from one slave situation on their way to be sold to another slave master. Why, exactly are the crew of Nightingale so offended that they are treated like, um..SLAVES?Some other tiny things that bugged me: 1. Silver is living in his old place of residence, with his old wife and yet is never apprehended by police (I thought the whole point at the end of TI of him jumping ship is that he was to avoid going back to England and having to face trial). Not only this, but he and his story are so well known that all the sailors on Nightingale give Nat due respect. If everyone knows who he is and where he lives why exactly is he not in jail? Or hung on the gallows?2. Why does Israel Hand's nephew even have to come into play? And again, why is he not an old man?3. It was obvious that the silver was on the white rock as soon as Nat began walking there in the middle of the night.4. Why would marooned pirates who already have a perfectly comfortable life on the island (complete with slaves and booze) care about the silver? Clearly, if they are going to leave they would need some cash, but on the island their treasure is virtually useless.Overall it was a fast-paced action book. Mildly entertaining with plot twists and \"surprises\" that are visible from 4 knots. Not really recommended for an adult reader, might be okay for a kid who really liked TI and would not be very critical."}, {"userName": "D.L.

When I saw this on the shelf at my local library, I thought it takes a pretty competent and gutsy writer to try that. Well, why not? I picked it up, took it home, and read it over the course of the last few evenings. This is what I thought about it.I won\u2019t try to compare this novel to Treasure Island. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve read Stevenson\u2019s classic adventure tale of pirates and buried treasure. This is perhaps just as well since this novel stands on its own, albeit with settings and minor characters from Treasure Island. It takes place about forty years after that book ends. Jim Hawkins, the son of the original Jim Hawkins, is the first person narrator. Natty, the daughter of Long John Silver, is his companion and the instigator of their adventure together. Their goal is to return to Treasure Island and recover the remaining treasure -- a large number of silver bars.I loved the prose from the beginning. It definitely has a quality and style you see too seldom in recent writing. It did not try to \u2018grab\u2019 be at the beginning. It did not try to shock me or entice me with \u2018action.\u2019 (I normally hate openings like that.) It invited me in, the narrator almost seeming like a bashful host for the story he was to tell. In my opinion, the prose style alone makes this book worth reading.In other ways, though, I found the novel less satisfying. The plot tends to drag in places, with no mysteries or answers being discovered, just bits of well-executed prose marking the passage of time and reflecting. I also did not find the characters overly interesting. Jim, as the average young man grown bored by his father\u2019s retellings of his adventures, just did not ring true to me. He seems too subservient and has too little longing for his own adventures to be interesting until Natty shows up. After that, he mainly follows her lead. Although it would be historically unlikely, I think this story may have been better told from Natty\u2019s point of view rather than from Jim\u2019s. She is the far stronger and more interesting of the two main characters. I would not object to this lack of fidelity to historic sensibilities because this is not a story told by a Victorian writer for a Victorian reader. It is a modern story for a modern audience.Overall, I enjoyed this book. I recommend it to fans of the original Treasure Island and to anyone looking for a well-written new novel that is out of the ordinary."}, {"userName": "William Stanger", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6982357-william-stanger", "userReview": "I wasn't really sure what to expect from this book, but was excited to read it all the same. The story begins in 1802, 40 years after the events depicted in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, and concerns a return to the island to attempt to locate the treasure that had been left behind. The main characters are the young offspring of Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins (jr) and Natty Silver. There are many references along the way to characters and events from the original story and there are a few surprises encountered on the way.This book could not really be described as fast-paced, but it never seems to drag along either. The author has a great way of drawing you into the story with the very descriptive way that things and people are portrayed. It takes over a third of the book to even get near the island, but that's good, because getting there is all part of the fun.I didn't find this book to be too predictable. There were many clues to be had as the story progressed, but things didn't always turn out the way I thought they would. Even the ending, satisfying as it was, was not exactly as I pictured it.If you are a fan of Treasure Island, which I am, then you should find this book to be a satisfactory and fitting sequel, as well as tribute, to the original story. I should also add that you wouldn't have to be too familiar with the original book to enjoy this one, although it might help to understand some of the things going on. Besides are there many people out there who aren't familiar with Robert Louis Stevenson's classic?I'm not that familiar with the author, Andrew Motion, other than he presided as Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1999 to 2009. He has a number of books published, many of which are poetry. I may check out some of these as well.If you enjoyed Treasure Island then check out Silver.

Having one of the main characters be female, even though disguised, doesn't seem like something Stevenson would do, but it does allow for the love interest and appeals to today's readership. It's certainly something I would have dearly liked to read back in Gr. 7--all those swashbuckling adventures never had female main characters, and the historical fiction I liked always had titles like \"He [never She] Went With Marco Polo (or Vasco da Gama, or Richard the Lionheart, etc.)\" However, young Jim's agonizing over his feelings for Natty, and imagining hers for him, seems a little too 21st century. Although I think it's good for boys to read that stuff.The story starts out with lots of intrigue & suspense, but I found by half-way through I was losing interest. The attack on the stockade & confrontation with the pirates seemed to take way too long, and the scariness of the pirates, which the author did a great job in building up, seems to kind of fizzle out.Still a worthwhile read!"}, {"userName": "Ally", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3015887-ally", "userReview": "So. There are those who will accuse me of only reading this because the audiobook is read by David Tennant, and I could listen to that man read to me for YEARS. This is true. But more true is the fact that THERE ARE PIRATES! And man, do I love pirates.This is a really good story, and the language is similar to the original Treasure Island, which is awesome. I'm giving it 3 stars for two reasons: One, it's a bit heavy on morality, which, while it suits the language of the book, is still kind of annoying in the 21st century, which is when the book was WRITTEN, even if it wasn't when the book was SET. Also, there's a marked lack of swordfighting, which is the entire point of a pirate story, as far as I'm concerned. And Nattie Silver is no Charlotte Doyle. (DAMMIT! ANOTHER SNEAKY LOVE STORY!)

His descriptions are clearly well thought out because they are in the style of Robert Louis Stevenson. Motion was able to write in a way that did not betray him as a 21st century writer. At the same time, the story is still very readable even to those that do not normally read classics as old as Treasure Island.My criticism of this story is that Jim was a rather stagnant character. His internal thoughts were typical and did not develop much throughout the novel. The other characters, such as Scotland and the captain, were more interesting.My one other complaint is that the ending of the story was dissatisfying. Perhaps this is because I had little interest in Jim and his fate, but I still feel like the story ended without a real conclusion."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah", "userReview": "Except it wasn't ok.

For a hundred and fifty pages Jim Hawkins (junior) tells us things like 'she looked at the ground so I thought she must be sad' and 'I am older now but that was how I saw it'. Probably the original Treasure Island is written in the same way - but my memory is that the original allows the reader to see past the narrator's youthful narrative and see the other characters through that prism. The remainder 250 pages continue much the same but with more predictable action, more stereotypes, and less mystery. I had to skip through to the end so I count it as abandoned.

One is the kind you're hit over the head with in high school, (or forced to read it a few years too early, if you went to an aggressively academic school), and as an adult, if you remember the book at all, you don't do so with fondness. (Looking at you, Dickens and Hemingway.) Then there are classic novels like Treasure Island, which have stuck around because they are just that good. If you haven't read Treasure Island, you should. Everything you think you know about pirates comes from this book. Parrot on the shoulder? Treasure Island. Exaggerated Rs? Treasure Island. X marks the spot? Treasure Island. Peg legged captain? Treasure Island. If you didn't read this book in school, it's probably for the same reason you only ate over-boiled vegetables\u2014because the adults in your life thought that anything enjoyable couldn't possibly be good for you. Treasure Island has stood the test of time because it's an amazing adventure story with a host of an unforgettable cast of characters. Andrew Motion apparently likes Treasure Island too, because he wrote an entire novel of fanfiction about it. Yes, if you write a story using other people's characters without their permission, it's fanfiction. But he does a good job of it. Through young Jim Hawkins, he manages to capture the voice and the flavor of the original book quite well. Jim has grown up with stories of his father's adventures his entire life, and although he enjoys the relative affluence his father's share of the treasure has afforded his own childhood, he feels overshadowed by his relatively safe and domesticated life. The tumultuous and barbaric adventures of his father's time are not possible in Jim's own time \u2026 or so he thinks. All of this changes when a mysterious young stranger bids Jim to steal Jim's father's most precious belonging: the famed treasure map. Jim loves his father, and doesn't want to betray him, but the lure of adventure is even stronger. With the financial backing of Long John Silver, and a crew of doughty men, Jim and Nat set out on a quest to recover the rest of the silver, which was left with the maroons on Treasure Island.Motion, as I said before, manages to capture that flowery, overly descriptive voice that writers used to show off their chops back in the nineteenth century, but he (fortunately) didn't also pepper it with excessive contemporary references. So you get the poetic description of what the jungle on the island looked like, but you don't have to hit wikipedia every other sentence to look up obscure figures from Greek mythology.The storytelling is a lot simpler than the original story, with fewer defections and mutinies and people switching sides. This Jim isn't a youth adrift in a hostile sea so much as a young but loyal member of a ship's crew. I was a little disappointed by a couple of things. One, Jim's status among the crew goes up too much after the captain dies. I saw what Motion was doing there, it just felt a little forced, like it needed a few more chapters to develop. Two, I was disappointed with the ending. The description of the reef and the cliffs confused me. I had to reread it a few times, and even so, I'm not sure I understood how the reef and cliffs stood in relation to one another, so I didn't quite figure out how Jim got away. Also, the very ending paragraph was vague enough to make me wonder if I was reading it correctly, or if this was a lead-in to a sequel. I like endings that are ends.Whereas I think the target audience of Treasure Island was young boys who longed for adventure, I think the target audience for this book is people who loved Treasure Island and were sad when the story ended. Whereas in the 19th century, this was a great example of a much-beloved trope (naval yarns and the deserted island trope) modern youths may prefer something a little more accessible. I recommend this for people who liked Treasure Island and were sad when it ended."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9381926-elizabeth", "userReview": "Who could resist the chance for treasure, and a return to treasure island? Having recently listened spellbound to Alfred Molina's wonderful reading of one of my favorite books of all time, RLS's \"Treasure Island\", how could I say no when Audible suggested, \"Silver: Return to Treasure Island\" by Andrew Motion, read by no less than David Tenant , known for his \"Broadchurch\", \"Hamlet\", and \"Dr. Who\". I enjoyed this new addition , written by a former British poet laureate. He captures Stevenson's beautiful prose style and I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of nature by the budding naturalist, Jim Hawkins, junior. That said, though I enjoyed it, it doesn't hold a candle to the original. Long John silver of \"Treasure Island \" is one of literature's great characters. Vividly drawn, he starts as a father figure, and then is revealed to be a murderous mastermind in a scene that to this day makes my hair stand on end. The narrator in \"Silver:Return to Treasure Island \" is the original Jim Hawkins' son, who partners with Long John Silvers daughter, to return to the island and seek the rest of the treasure. There is excitement and vivid characters, but Andrew Motion's cast pales when compared to the originals, characters that have given us the stereotype of pirate. No one sings\" Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest\" in this book, and you can't imagine them doing so. Heinous deeds happen, but the evil characters seem more removed, less menacing, and a little contrived. Having said this, if you are a Treasure Island fan, you will still really enjoy this book., and I will listen to the sequel with gusto. The audio edition of \"Silver\" is fabulous. David Tennant brings everything to step-out-of-the-book life. The language is beautiful and poetic, a real paean to the original. It's just that Andrew Motion has gone up against such iconic characters, it's like trying to outdo Shakespeare."}, {"userName": "Alan Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47557713-alan-ferguson", "userReview": "A disappointing sequel to a much-loved masterpiece of adventure fiction.A reviewer has described Silver as a \u2018rollicking good yarn\u2019. Well, my yarn remained stubbornly unrollicked. This novel is billed as a sequel to Treasure Island, making comparisons with the original novel inevitable, so it\u2019s worth considering the factors that make Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s book such a masterpiece of narrative prose: beguiling characterisations, brisk action, an intriguing and eventful plot and spiky, earthy, naturalistic dialogue. Andrew Motion\u2019s book can boast none of these characteristics. The plot can easily be summarised: Tom Hawkins (son of Treasure Island\u2019s hero of the same name) and Natty (daughter of the unforgettable Long John Silver) conspire to steal a map from young Tom\u2019s father and sail off to Treasure Island to recover bars of silver left over from the original expedition. Once they reach the island, wicked pirates lie in wait. Can they defeat the pirates and liberate the treasure?Sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? But the promise remains unfulfilled. Why? Well, first, let\u2019s take a look at the characterisations. Unlike Treasure Island, none of the characters come across as rounded human beings displaying plausible motivations, actions or reactions. Crucially for an adventure story, none of them strikes a chord capable of generating engagement (and hence, excitement). This failure to establish an empathetic relationship with the reader is especially true of the two main characters, Jim and Natty. Jim (the first person narrator) is too passive and self-pitying to be an engaging or sympathetic action hero: his defining characteristic is the lengthy mope. If moping ever becomes an international sport, Jim would be the Lionel Messi of his generation - he mopes at home: he mopes in the marshes near his home: he mopes in his father\u2019s pub: he mopes on the ship taking them to the island: he even mopes on the island, despite being surrounded by blood-thirsty pirates. When he springs into action towards the end of the book it seems entirely outside the parameters of the character established up to this point \u2013 instead of cheering him on you find yourself wondering \u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 A moping teenager can be the source of great literature (see Catcher in the Rye) \u2013 but Jim\u2019s self-pity and dithering procrastinations sit uneasily in the context of an adventure story.It\u2019s also impossible to care about Natty because her character remains vague, hazy, and almost entirely enigmatic. Although named in nearly every page, she gets little dialogue, and the few actions she takes off her own bat are either ill-advised or downright baffling (for example, her decision to go wandering off into the pirate-infested island almost as soon as they dock). Jim\u2019s fondness for her is bewildering, given her opaque personality and the offhand way she treats him. If this was a movie, we would accuse lead actors of having zero sexual chemistry. All the other characters remain stubbornly two-dimensional \u2013 for instance, the Captain of the ship is implausibly saintly, and the pirates remain cardboard cut-out monsters borrowed from other, better, novels (Motion\u2019s portrayal of the pirates\u2019 moral corruption and debauchery seems to borrow heavily from Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness \u2013 a much better novel).As I mentioned earlier, he summary outline of the plot sounds promising, but the story is let down by pedestrian pacing (nothing much happens for the first 100 pages \u2013 Jim and Natty row up and down the river and Jim steals his Dad\u2019s map) and dodgy details. For instance, Jim steals a key that is held on a length of string hung round his father\u2019s neck by tugging it up over his head while he is asleep: even though his father is drunk, this seems improbable. Pretty, 17 year old Natty remains undetected as a female while on 4-month voyage on a small ship: she achieves this wonder of concealment by wearing a cap and speaking with a gruff voice. The Captain decides that some poisonous snakes might come in useful, so he captures a basketful, later unleashed at the pirates like some kind of reptilian WMD.As for the dialogue \u2013 it plods when it should sprint, it splutters when it should crackle and most of it is consists of stodgy exposition, a humdrum exchange of facts intended to help us make more plausible the plot\u2019s many unlikelihood\u2019s. None of the conversations in the novel are memorable: none are funny, or touching or confrontational. Generally, English upper lips stay stiff: there are no revelatory meltdowns here, no snarls of anger or cries of joy or despair.And finally \u2013 I was uncertain about the target audience for this book. Is it aimed at young people? This would explain the failure to explore the sexual tension or frustration felt by Jim, despite the close proximity of his beloved Natty (they sleep next to each other in a sweaty private cabin) and the relatively bloodless, cartoon-like nature of the violence at the end. A good example of Motion\u2019s unclear intentions \u2013 Natty is captured by the pirates, and is repeatedly, if obliquely, threatened with rape. But the rape never happens \u2013 the pirates decide to kill her instead. The author has worked hard to establish that the pirates are a debauched, thoroughly disgusting bunch of evil pigs \u2013 such barbaric creatures would surely rape Natty before they killed her. Now, the last thing I want to read about is a young girl being sexually assaulted: but given the circumstances and the characters involved, such an outcome seems inevitable. It\u2019s as if Motion can\u2019t quite follow through the logical consequence of the situation he has created \u2013 possibly out of fear of losing the book\u2019s PG rating?I see that Motion has written a sequel to Silver: it\u2019s called The New World. I won\u2019t be reading it, as I really don\u2019t care enough about the characters to invest any more time on them. And my edition of Silver has already been consigned to the charity shop."}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62415863-veronica", "userReview": "I am so deeply and genuinely pleased and surprised by how amazing this book is.

There is a degree of philosophising. There are important plot-lines involving women, and Natty is a major character, a co-hero. And there is certainly some 'fine writing', particularly in the descriptions of the weather, the vegetation of the island, the storms, and the portrayal of the physical appearance of the characters. The result is that this is not a book for boys, or indeed a book for children. It does not fit easily into any particular genre, but is none the worse for that.
