I think it was the Buddha, and along with this, many in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition who said, one should never believe anything until they have experienced it themselves. However I will say I've seen human auras and they are not anything special, they are the thing that surround a person that inform you whether that person is experiencing great pain or whether they are the kind of person who is full of energy. If you ever want to experience this yourself you simply have to look at your first instinct when looking at someone, similar to when you see a friend where something is 'off' or 'uncanny'. With practice one could probably be very well trained at reading people, and the visual cues associated with such, which can include, not only body language, but the use of one's own feelings in the context of the people that surround them (based on the theory that all feelings are shared, and that what you feel is the same as what others feel), similar to when someone walks into a room and the tone of the room changes."}, {"userName": "Ania", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7070820-ania", "userReview": "Some interesting ideas on the aura but ultimately I felt like something was missing.

Still, I can say proudly that despite all the above hindrances I completed three non fictions this month. Namely \u201cChakra Balancing\u201d, \u201cThe Secret\u201d and now \u201cThe Human Aura Astral Colors And Thought Forms\u201d. Strangely, I have to read all three of them simultaneously, as all are related to each other in some way or other. In order to understand the one, you should know about the other. That\u2019s why it took me so long to post a book review.Nevertheless, here I am. I completed \u201cChakra Balancing\u201d and \u201cThe Secret\u201d first. Human Aura I read about on and off, as required while studying the previous ones. Today, when I completed it, I realized just how much wisdom there is just lying in plain sight around us. So much energy and life, meaningful things that we completely ignore and rather focus on some trivial materialistic things. Coming to the book, it begins with revealing what is actually Human Aura or Prana or Aabha as we call in Hindi. Prana is the Vital essence The Life Force. This Prana Aura does not only reflect our being, but it reflects on what we are? What we are thinking? What state we are in? More importantly, how we are communicating with the universe?When we feel something or are going through a particular emotion we are projecting that feeling through our Aura. This is mirrored in so many different colors, each corresponding to various feelings out there. I have dealt with the same in one of my previous post \u201cThe Color Of Love\u201d. This topic is so vast though that it can not be covered in a single post. In the book, each color is explained with its corresponding state. Even the hue, tint and shade of a color make a huge difference towards the Aura visualization. But, what is the so called Feeling that gets projected in these Aura's colors. It is our Thoughts. Our thoughts who are manifested in our Aura in the forms of colors and vibrations. Vibrations that we send to our universe. They not only affect us, but also the persons who come in contact (not necessarily touching) with us. Have you ever thought how you feel sad in someone's company, or why a Hospital always feels like a Morgue, or a playground feels like freedom? Have you thought, why did you label someone as a positive person and some as dull and boring or a pessimist? Most of the times what we feel about others is what their thoughts are projecting about them to the universe. Another interesting aspect that this book talks about is about healing through Aura Magnetism. Healing with the help of a strong magnetic Aura is pretty old phenomenon. I have heard of many saints and god souls who have helped others by just touching them or giving them the life energy; Prana. This works on the same concept as Aura Projection. I have tried my hands at this too, and that too successfully. Cheers!!! This book has dealt with many such concepts related to Human Aura, but still this subject is too vast and knowledge is so ancient that one can not fully capture it in one book. For a beginners sake this book is pretty good in answering some of the basic questions. Good read. :)"}, {"userName": "johnkelm", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47548362-johnkelm", "userReview": "Enjoyed very much, Thank youStay in the light always, working on protecting my energy from a loved one's grief and sadness,Understanding that they mean no harm, but drains you just the same,She is muddled and her energy is negative,The book helped in reading the shades and tints, and the final egg of light will be a blessing _(\")__(gratitude)_"}, {"userName": "NattyD", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1599133-nattyd", "userReview": "This book is a brief, but interesting overview of the aura; how it functions and ways to influence, heal, and protect it.
