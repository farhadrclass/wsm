We each MUST choose God or Satan/Heaven or Hell for all eternity. For me I choose My Jesus the Christ!!! Make the right choice today! We have no promise that tomorrow will come.

These 12 books give understanding in a real life experience format. It was so wonderful to learn so much about the tribulation and the glorious return in words that were so clear and understandable. I can recommend this series to any level of believer. I myself am going to encourage my daughter who has fallen away from the Lord to read this whole series. Thank you for really great books."}, {"userName": "Linda Sellers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28341196-linda-sellers", "userReview": "FantasticI couldn't put this book down. There are scripture quotes that I have read in the bible. I know the characters and episodes had to be fictional, but seemed so true to every day life.

The authors, I believe, have used the Bible to change the ideas put forth to change the way people see the affect of Biblical predictions. Too many people believe the books are non-fiction and are trying to use the words of the story to bring about the second coming. The books are a made up story and should be read as such. I don;t know if the authors wrote the books to make money or to change the thinking of many. So the books receive 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Michael C Hoover", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59315453-michael-c-hoover", "userReview": "Fascinating!Fascinating read, leading to a thorough examination of scripture as it relates to current events.

Just ignore the theology, if it doesn't work for you. The character development is excellent - they change in fairly realistic ways. For example, just because one character becomes a \"Tribulation Saint\" (which is what they call the post-Rapture believers) doesn't mean he doesn't still cuss. He works on it because he believes it's bad but that's realistic, I think. I don't particularly like some of the stereotypes that the authors use but they are fundamentalist Christians, so I suppose that's to be expected.I view the theology of this as any other created world and just enjoy the story for what it is. There are a fair number of biblical quotations but they seem like they belong to the story, not just gratuitous."}, {"userName": "Coila J Lindemann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43071830-coila-j-lindemann", "userReview": "AssionsGood job did not want to put it down.

I was truly hooked from the very beginning, I have had my nose in this series for a few weeks. It is midnight as I write this review, I mean hey who has time for sleep when you have such an amazing read waiting on you. The authors did a wonderful Job putting the bible into perspective. If you were not saved before reading this series you will be soon! It is a emotional rollercoaster of excitement, joy, love, laughter, fear and any other emotion you can think of. I have fallen in love with every character.

Mainly because the last book went on a little long. It was an exciting series! I was glad I read it as a collection and didn't have to wait for the next book to be published! It was definitely true to the Bible, often quoting it word for word. And the message of how to have a relationship with Jesus was clear. Each book also did a good job of reviewing what had taken place up to that point. I am about to read the sequel, to be followed shortly by the prequels!"}, {"userName": "Csitzlar", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26220301-csitzlar", "userReview": "Captivating, Inspiring, and SatisfyingI read the three prequel books after watching the first two movies. Then I delved into the entire series beginning to end. I could barely stand to STOP reading!
