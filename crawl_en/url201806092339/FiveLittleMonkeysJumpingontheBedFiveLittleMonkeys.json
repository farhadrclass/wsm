This wonderful little book wasn't published until I was around ten years old, but I still read it one summer in a reading contest held at my library every year. I was so excited to pick out new books... sometimes children's books meant for kids younger than me, sometimes books meant for older kids... and by 12, I was reading the Scarpetta series about serial killers. What eclectic taste even at a young age!Who would not adore these monkeys? I remember being called a little monkey when I was a youngin'. And I call my cousin's and friend's kids little monkeys now whenever I'm around them. But this one was the best in the series, at least in my opinion... they were jumping on a bed. And Momma Monkey just couldn't control them... but when they got hurt, they learned their lessons.It's books like this that help make or break a child's interest in reading. If you take the time and read the story over and over again... kids learn what it means to tell a story, to write a rhyme, to sing along, to behave, to listen, to see what happens in a book series over the course of a character's journey... and this one is all about the numbers... and the countdown... 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. Where'd all my monkeys go????Writing this review makes me smile... I might have to go to the library this weekend just to re-read a copy of this one again. :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

It's just so readable, so funny, and so perfectly illustrated. Oddly, it was never read to me as a child, but read by my mother to her grandchildren. I loved listening in though because, in the book, what Mama does when she finally gets all her children in bed results, every time, in howls of laughter from all parties.

This book just showed up on my home feed as a recommendation. How could I possibly have forgotten the million times I read this with my daughters when they were still little ones. My precious and beautiful daughters and I read this all. The. Time. And they made me laugh & smile more than any other book ever did. We adored this and read it out loud with such fun. I'm totally crying as I've been going down memory lane for months, trying to come to grips with the fact that they're grown and almost ready to move on into this great big world, so I highly, highly recommend any and every parent to grab this book, cuddle up with your kids and create some of the best and most memorable times reading together. I know above I said \"how could I have forgotten about this book\", but life's been throwing an onslaught of hardship my way and I'm not handling looking at all the pics of my girls when they were still so tiny, very well. I never knew anyone could possibly cry so many tears. I forgot due to time and circumstances....this book is unforgettable so don't wait, don't put it off, embrace your babies and hold on tight for as long as you can. This book is very short, yet full of laughter and fun which then becomes a stronger bond, together time with love and beautiful memories. You will not tire of reading this one over and over again. Wow, seeing this out of nowhere is proof that a book can turn agonizing tears from one situation into smiles from this memory. Go buy it and have fun!!! :')"}, {"userName": "Chelsie Morrison", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12348617-chelsie-morrison", "userReview": "I can still hear the singing rhyme of the Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed as sung by my mother when I was a little Girl. Eileen Christelow brings this rhyme to life in the picture book retelling of this classic story. Five little monkeys climb into bed after saying goodnight to their mother. Not quite ready to fall asleep, the five monkeys jump on the bed until \"one fell off and bumped his head.\" The monkeys' doctor leaves them with the instruction: \"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!\" Alas, these troublesome monkeys fail to follow directions until all five have fallen off the bed. Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed is a fun, read-aloud book to initiate and promote counting in young children. This book would be great for preschool-kindergarten age children as five is a very small number and is easy to count on fingers. Not only can the children initially count the five monkeys, but can later learn to count backwards (5 monkeys, then 4 monkeys...) from five as well, gaining a better understanding of mathematical concepts. I could also see this book being used to teach music or language concepts such as rhyme and rhythm. Christelow's colored pencil illustrations are light and playful and help to bring the text to life. Each monkey has great facial expressions and they never distract from the story being told."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "This is a very cute, sing-song kind of book, one of a series of \"Five Little Monkeys\". It's funny, because I remember the counting song we used to sing in high school, \"There were five in the bed and the little one said, 'Roll over, roll over.' So they all rolled over and one fell out, he hit the floor and his guts fell out. Please remember, to tie a knot in your pyjamas. Single beds are only made for four in the bed and the little one said...\" and so on. This isn't the same song, obviously. It starts out with a bedtime routine (bath, pyjamas, brushing teeth, saying goodnight to Mama), then they all jump on the bed, one falls out and bumps his head. The mama calls the doctor and the doctor says, \"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!\" And it repeats until they've all fallen off the bed. I love the illustrations too, they're more detailed than what's on the cover. You can have some fun with this one, and I wouldn't mind getting some of the other Five Little Monkeys books, too."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10824808-courtney", "userReview": "Obviously perfect for toddlers"}, {"userName": "Alexandria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4692632-alexandria", "userReview": "The fun of \"Five Little Monkeys\" is the way it rhymes and the sing-song nature of it. This particular retelling loses a lot of that fun, interrupting the flow of the sing-song for interjected comments from Momma. I imagine this could have been done well but in this case it cause a lot of stumbling when the book was read aloud. It's not a terrible book but it's not the version of the sing-song that I would opt to read aloud, given a few options."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63688622-leila", "userReview": "This book is very engaging for young children because they sing along the book. it teaches number concepts,to count down 5,4,3,2 and 1.
