Robbins transcends the mystery genre with language as sweet and rich as a mint julep on a starry night. A child is born to a black man and a white women in a small Virginia town. The child dies, and is buried in the Baptist church cemetery. But the elders insist on unearthing the child, because only whites are allowed in their cemetery. The night after the child is exhumed and moved to the black cemetery, the church burns down. The father of the child, a black man, is arrested for the crime, and claims he is innocent.Nate, a heart-bruised lawyer returns to his home town to defend this man accused of burning down a church. When a charred body is found in the rubble, Nate finds himself with a murder case on his hands. As Nate peels back layers of history, grudges and racism, he encounters his ex-wife (with whom he is still in love), a corrupt prosecutor, a psychologically tortured priest, and a sheriff with a huge reason to see this black man put to death.It's not your grandmother's crime novel.

The language is pitch perfect; the narration is vivid, each character has a unique voice, and the dialogue feels authentic - truly charged with all that is left unsaid. The story itself is such a maze or moral questioning and compromise. I found myself constantly wondering what I would do in the place of various characters. An interesting question that seemed to come up a lot was how far one can go to remain loyal before entering the territory of corruption, denial, or delusion. This is not just a book about a crime, but about the role people play, passive or otherwise, in the smaller but equally painful injustices that fill daily life. Entertaining, thought-provoking, and certainly not easily forgotten!"}, {"userName": "Geraldine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11515452-geraldine", "userReview": "Reading this book is like a roller coaster ride.

(2002). Scorched Earth. New York: Bantam.This mystery and courtroom drama takes place in a small town in contemporary Virginia. It opens with scenes of Clare and Elijah living an idyllic life, filled with love, in their country house. They tend their garden, fish in the stream, repair the house, and make love outside in the grass. Elijah is a big, strong, quiet black man who works at the paper mill during the week. Clare is a tall, thin white woman of 22 years. We never learn much about where they came from, their families, or how they met.Clare gets pregnant, the baby is delivered, but dies within minutes. The couple is devastated. The child is buried in their church\u2019s ancient graveyard. But the deacons of Victory Baptist Church are not pleased when they learn that a mixed-race baby has been buried in the church\u2019s cemetery. There is a coloreds graveyard two miles up the road. The new pastor of the church, a recovering alcoholic, was not aware of the policy. The church elders decide the infant must be exhumed and moved to the other place. The pastor opposes the decision eloquently, to no avail. Clare and Elijah are appalled as they watch their baby dug up and re-buried.Shortly thereafter, the church is burned to the ground. Arson. The sheriff arrests Elijah, drunk, watching the fire and cheering. But he says he didn\u2019t torch it.His court-appointed defense attorney is a home boy who used to work for the county prosecutor before he left some years ago. The case for the defense seems hopeless. Elijah refuses any plea-bargain because, he insists, he is innocent. Gradually, and for reasons not entirely convincing, the attorney comes to believe him. Very slowly, new information is introduced into the story and tiny clues appear, which could possibly mean Elijah is innocent, although the whole town has, at this point, the mentality of a lynch mob. The surprise ending is to learn whodunit. I certainly didn\u2019t see it coming.The story is well-crafted, with good clues, good red herrings, and believable character motivation. The problem-solving investigation is a little slow to get going, and is a little off-center, focusing on possible prosecutorial misdeeds, because the defense actually has nothing to go on. The evidence against Elijah is overwhelming. The southern town racism trope is well-worn and not very original as a story theme or character motivation, but the author refrains from moralizing. Elijah and Clare remain throughout as representations, not well-rounded characters. Nevertheless, once you believe Elijah is innocent (and you must), the mystery keeps the pages turning.It\u2019s hard to write a good, satisfying mystery within the strict boundaries of realism and plausibility, but Robbins pulls it off. The writing is completely adequate, although for my taste, overwritten. There are long backstories dumped out in flashbacks and reminiscences. Characters soliloquize about religion, justice, racism, and small town life. The scenery and the weather are described in detail. The defense attorney\u2019s troubled marriage, separation, and reconciliation is mundane, although I think it is supposed to be some sort of symbolic representation of how anger can lead to self-destructive revenge when your church/wife betrays you, but I didn\u2019t need a symbolic representation. The story was plain enough without it. All the extra writing slowed everything way down for me. This 350 page novel would be more readable in 250 pages that stuck closer to the plot line. The superfluous narration is fairly well-written actually, sometimes insightful, often well-observed, but it\u2019s by no means scintillating or lyrical enough to justify itself.The main storyline is narrated in third-person, present tense, which seemed stilted to my ear. \u201cElijah\u2019s hand comes to the baby\u2019s cheek. Clare hears him whisper\u2026The baby gurgles.. Clare laughs\u2026,\u201d and so on. The reader is welded to the here and now because of that ever-present present. So when backstory and other narration appear in the past tense, the effect is like being booted off the field.Overall, if you skim over the parts that most readers don\u2019t read anyway, you find a well-crafted mystery with a satisfying, surprise ending."}, {"userName": "Rick Urban", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5981340-rick-urban", "userReview": "Scorched Earth is a compendium of man\u2019s inhumanity to man, a fable about the stoniness of the human heart and the racism and bigotry of an insular small town that reads like Scott Turow crossed with Harper Lee, or maybe John Grisham with William Faulker. In this mournful story, an interracial married couple in the town of Good Hope, Virginia, give birth to a baby without a brain, who dies within minutes of being born. A church elder and matriarch for the community, who also happens to be the grandmother of the baby, arranges for the child to be buried in the cemetery of the all-white Victory Baptist Church, but within a day the church deacons vote to have the body exhumed and move to an all-black church 3 miles away. The child\u2019s father, Elijah Waddell, is found that same night, drunk and cheering as he watches the Victory Baptist Church burn to the ground. He is the only suspect, and although he proclaims his innocence, he is arrested and thrown in jail. The not-so-prodigal son, Nat Deeds, is coerced into coming back to Good Hope to defend Waddell, which he has fled after discovering his wife\u2019s infidelity a year earlier. What begins as a difficult case becomes almost impossible when the troubled daughter of the town\u2019s sheriff is found dead in the church\u2019s smoking ruins.What follows is a narrative of unerringly well-crafted prose, thoughtfully considered, and wisely knowing. While the various characters stumble through the story as if the victims of a great conflagration, dazed and incredulous, author David L. Robbins knows exactly what he wants to achieve, and in the economical space of some 350-odd pages, he fully dissects and provide a post-mortem on the kind of quiet hatred that nevertheless poisons the ground of any community that defines itself by what it excludes. While it was written fifteen years ago, it resonates even now as the country uncovers more and more pockets of racist indoctrination and partisan hatred and mistrust. One can sadly imagine the tabloid-lurid secrets that lie buried at the heart of this story being uncovered practically anywhere, for they are the result of the worst elements of the human condition, elements that will always be with us. But there is also found within these pages: inclusion, determination, fairness, dignity, love and sacrifice. Though the odds against them are great, Elijah refuses to confess to a crime he insists he did not commit, and Nat puts his integrity, and even his personal safety, on the line to represent his client in an honorable and just way.What ends up being so satisfying and compelling about Scorched Earth is that, while it has all of the drive and suspense of a first-rate legal thriller, and the deft plotting of a murder mystery, it is at heart a meditation on what it means to be human in a place where others blithely deny you that humanity, and how to endure in the face of such adversity. The mystery at the heart of this excellent novel is the same one that confounds us every day: how can people hurt each other the way they do?"}, {"userName": "Aurora", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11102971-aurora", "userReview": "In diesem Buch geht es vor allem um Elijah und Clare Waddel \u2013 er ein Schwarzer, sie eine Wei\u00dfe -, die geheiratet haben und nun ein Kind erwarten.

The story begins with the untimely death of the child of an inter-racial couple, a couple who had seemed to be perfectly accepted in their Virginia town, even being held up as examples in the workplace diversity council. Suddenly all the racism that had been hidden surfaces, in the refusal of the deacons of the white church to accept the child for burying (in fact, digging up the dead body and rejecting it). There follow reprisals (the church is burnt down) and a gripping investigation and trial. The story builds the way a story should, with an inevitability to each action and discovery that makes the whole thing supremely believable. The story is the classic un-putdownable one. The plot is well crafted, with enough information being doled out along the way to keep you interested \u2013 as opposed to stories that deliver all the answers on the last page. The author also builds a superb picture of the town, built as it around its main industry, an evil smelling paper plant.

Robbins, bestselling author of The End of War and War of the Rats, comes a novel of searing intensity and uncompromising vision. Part mystery, part legal thriller, it is a story of crime and punishment set in a small southern town during one brutal, hot, and unforgiving summer that lays bare the potential of the human heart to hate\u2013and, ultimately, to heal. The inhabitants of Good Hope, Virginia, haven\u2019t felt the cooling effects of rain in weeks. The crops are withering. The ground is parched. There is no relief in sight. With the town a tinderbox waiting to explode, all it takes is a spark to ignite all the prejudice, the rage, and the secrets that are so carefully kept hidden. And then, in the midst of the terrible heat, a tragedy occurs. A baby is born and dies in her mother\u2019s arms. The child, Nora Carol, is buried quickly and quietly the next day in a church graveyard. It should have ended right there\u2013but it didn\u2019t, for Nora Carol is of mixed race.The white deacons of Good Hope\u2019s Victory Baptist Church, trying to protect the centuries-old traditions of their cemetery, have the body exhumed. That night the church is set ablaze, and the sole witness is the only suspect\u2013Elijah Waddell, Nora Carol\u2019s father.Nat Deeds, a former prosecutor and an exile of Good Hope, is pressed into service as Elijah\u2019s attorney. With a politically savvy prosecutor and a vindictive sheriff aligned against him, Nat knows it will be nearly impossible to get Elijah acquitted. But Elijah refuses to accept a plea.As the evidence mounts, Nat begins to suspect there is something his client isn\u2019t telling him, and the next revelation turns Good Hope into a powder keg: a body is found in the ashes of the church. Now Elijah is accused of murder, and the case is no longer a matter of winning or losing, but of life or death.The only way Nat can save his client is to scratch and claw for any shred of evidence, even if he has to bend the law to find it. As the summer heat intensifies and passions reach their boiling point, Nat must navigate through the incendiary secrets kept by friends and neighbors, by the guilty and the innocent, to an act of justice that has nothing to do with the law.", "title": "Scorched Earth", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311804.Scorched_Earth", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320419032l/311804.jpg", "reviews": 46, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23977.David_L_Robbins", "name": "David L.
