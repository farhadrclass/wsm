In many ways, this is a distant relative of the contemporary bestseller H is for Hawk. The book's structure is a day-by-day account of the author's determination to train this bird, 'Gos', and convince it to trust him. He sympathizes with the 'feral' animal and yet they are often in combat with each other - both have stubborn personalities. The book can also be read as a study of the English countryside, or a glimpse into the author's philosophy of life, a struggle of human willpower against nature, or the ineffectiveness of 17th century falconry books."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "In my reading life, I can go from being a shad fisherman one week ( The Founding Fish) to being a falconer the next. Without being drowned or clawed. To say nothing of my fiction choices, with all the myriad chambers of the human heart exposed. Once again without being drowned or clawed.One obstacle to learning about a new topic, though not insurmountable, is the beautiful strangeness of language. I speak here not of a country's or people's verbs, nouns and adjectives, but rather of the peculiar argot of a sport, hobby, or occupation. After reading about shad, for example, I wonder at my reaction the next time I meet someone named 'Milt'. Here, in this foray into falconry, I learned of the austringer, of imping, of jesses and creances; I stepped carefully around mutes and flinched at every bate. At times, my relative ignorance caused me to laugh:In the afternoons there was shooting to be done, and on the Friday I had despaired of a pigeon and shot him a Frenchman -- out of season.As if shooting a Frenchman is ever out of season.This is T.H. White's story of his attempt to train a goshawk, to 'man' him. It is not a 'How To' instructional so much as a 'How Not To'. Learn as you go, once and future austringer. Falconry for Dummies. White even says, \"It was like being handcuffed to a moron in a chain gang.\" The moron was not the bird. This is White's journal of his very amateurish beginning in falconry. Rather transparently, he says that he is writing this because, well, he's a writer and he could use the cash. So, at times this has a forced quality, a 'this is what I did on Tuesday' feel.Still, the writer exposes the savagery of the hawk, not just the soaring beauty. The exceptional nyrb cover shows a portion of this painting, which does the same: And too, he exposes the man at the other end of the creance:Blood-lust is a word which has got shop-soiled. They have rubbed the nap off it. But split it into its parts, and think of Lust. Real blood-lust is like that.Perhaps. As I said at the beginning, I'm just a vicarious reader, with quieter hobbies. But there is a red-tailed hawk which spends half the year soaring in the sky where I live. Some time this summer, as I'm staking gladioli or dead-heading coleus, I might see him again, black against the red-stained evening. I know he will have seen me before I see him. I'll stand, whatever cold thing in a glass in my right hand. And very slowly, remembering this, I'll lift my left arm, L-shaped, ninety-degrees. I'll whistle a tune, maybe a hymn. Maybe Cassandra Wilson singing 'You Don't Know What Love Is.\""}, {"userName": "Malacorda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22871526-malacorda", "userReview": "La falconeria mi ha sempre affascinato. Qualche anno fa mi sono incantata ad osservare da vicino le manovre di un gruppo di falconieri con i loro volatili, alla festa di Campora, e mi \u00e8 balenata in mente l'idea di iscrivermi anche io ad una scuola di falconeria. Avendo per marito un cacciatore impenitente che in parte si duole per il mio completo disinteresse verso l'attivit\u00e0 venatoria, quando mi sono illuminata alla vista dei rapaci, poco c'\u00e8 mancato che me ne procurasse uno - non certo per farmi un regalo ma piuttosto sperando in un futuro supporto e diversivo nella caccia alla lepre. Questo \u00e8 dunque il diario dell'esperienza di addestramento di un astore, e chiss\u00e0 se io con un poianone o un gallinaccio qualsiasi avrei saputo fare altrettanto. Non lo credo, n\u00e9 per quanto riguarda il diario, n\u00e9 a riguardo dell'addestramento.Diario che \u00e8 stato dichiaratamente scritto per poter essere pubblicato e consentire cos\u00ec all'autore di raggranellare qualche soldo, quel tanto che gli potesse consentire di mantenersi nella sua libert\u00e0 e nella sua selvaticit\u00e0 nella campagna inglese, senza un vincolo o un padrone, libero di dedicare tutto il suo tempo e il suo impegno alla caccia e alla falconeria: dunque un libro dove, un po' come ne \"La Storia infinita\" di Ende, contenuto e contenitore si incrociano e si inseguono in un loop senza inizio e senza fine. A volergli attribuire un qualche significato aggiuntivo, lo si potrebbe affiancare a Thoreau, oppure anche a tanti altri libri pubblicati in questi ultimi anni in cui si raccontano le esperienze di chi si vuole distaccare, in tutto in parte, dalla civilt\u00e0 moderna e caotica, per riscoprire un diverso spirito nel contatto con la natura e con i ritmi quotidiani. In questo, si pu\u00f2 dire che White sia stato uno dei precursori, avendo egli raccontato la sua esperienza nel primo dopoguerra. E' un diario, ma di quando in quando si porta sul racconto in terza persona, per meglio sottolineare l'intento ironico o polemico, a seconda del momento. White \u00e8 ironico in maniera pungente (nei confronti di se stesso, degli altri uomini, del falco, della natura, della storia, della guerra), e impeccabile come etologo. C'\u00e8 tutto il sentimento del rapporto uomo-animale domestico: ognuno leggendo ritrover\u00e0 qualcosa del rapporto con il proprio cane o gatto. Spassosissima la sfilza di appellativi ed epiteti con cui l'autore si rivolge al suo astore, pensavo di essere l'unica ad appioppare al proprio animale nomi e soprannomi a tale ritmo, e invece. Poi c'\u00e8 anche tutta l'emozione e il mistero del rapporto con l'animale selvatico, l'intraducibile \"call of the wild\", che mi ha fatto ripensare al libro di Rong, Il totem del lupo, dove il protagonista si cimenta nell'addestramento di un lupetto per giungere alla conoscenza dell'animo profondo della prateria mongola. E in effetti anche l'astore si presta bene come simbolo di un mondo \"sommerso\" o scomparso, come totem delle teutoniche foreste e montagne, sia per l'immagine che per il suo carattere. Sono in parte d'accordo con tutti coloro che hanno scritto che si tratta di una storia d'amore. Tra un uomo e un pennuto, ok, ma sempre sentimento \u00e8 - per quanto l'autore si affanni a ribadire che nella falconeria il sentimento non conta, per lui \u00e8 solo psicologia, ma dal suo stesso racconto emerge tutt'altro. Come in tutte le storie d'amore ci sono i momenti entusiasmanti e i momenti burrascosi. E in questo libro i sentimenti emergono bene, bisogna riconoscerlo: a volte contrastanti, magari non per tutti comprensibili e/o condivisibili, ma sentimenti veri e sinceri. E' un racconto tutto fatto di eventi minimi per non dire insignificanti, eppure riesce ad essere coinvolgente. I passaggi bucolicamente poetici si alternano a riflessioni filosofiche un po' spicciole e volte anche un po' noiosette. All'inizio ero letteralmente entusiasta, poi, procedendo con la lettura, l'euforia \u00e8 andata un po' scemando. Non che le considerazioni sulla guerra e sull'umanit\u00e0 intera non siano interessanti, arrivo benissimo a comprendere e in parte anche a condividerne i punti di vista fortemente misantropici; ma con tutta la faccenda dell'astore, volendo essere un po' distaccati e obiettivi, c'entrano come i cavoli a merenda, e se collocate in altra sede tutte queste riflessioni potevano avere ben altro rilievo e approfondimento. D'altro canto, ora mi chiedo, senza qualche considerazione e condimento un po' fuori dal seminato, non sarebbe diventato allora un resoconto anche pi\u00f9 noioso? Gli sbalzi di umore cos\u00ec come le divagazioni di ogni tipo sono perfettamente riconducibili alla categoria cui appartiene l'opera: un diario in tutto e per tutto, appunto. Dunque, chi cerca la corposit\u00e0 e l'intreccio di un romanzo, dovrebbe rivolgersi altrove. Chi invece vuole gustarsi una lettura lieve, piacevole e rinfrescante, si deve accomodare perch\u00e9 \u00e8 arrivato nel posto giusto. Farebbero meglio ad astenersi gli animalisti ipersensibili, gli iscritti a LAV, Enpa and so on: ne ricaverebbero solo una ulteriore irritazione rispetto a tutte quelle cose gi\u00e0 grandemente irritanti che possono vedere ogni giorno. Finale un po' forzato, l'autore sembra non sapere esattamente come chiudere il discorso. Sar\u00e0 che di storie di cacciagione ne ho gi\u00e0 sentite talmente tante da averne sopra la cima dei capelli\u2026 finisco per togliergli una mezza stellina."}, {"userName": "Karen Witzler", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125591-karen-witzler", "userReview": "Went there after reading H is for Hawk, stayed for the pure pleasure of T.

Somehow, it tears your heart out with just a word. Just right out. Because, this book is as much about what lies beneath T.H. White's words as what his words say. His words are telling us about a period when he trained a goshawk. (See that video for an incredibly gorgeous view of the creatures.) The rest of the story is in the underbelly, in what he is confessing about his point of view, of his little patch of the world. This is a book about war and pacifism, but told in a didactic code about falconry.**(It is not falconry. A goshawk is not technically a falcon, due to wingspan, and the term for the hawk's keeper is \"austringer.\" Do you see what I mean about didactic, anyway?)So this is 1937. White feels what the world is about to do, what it already is doing, and he can't really cope. The idea of violence hurts him deeply; he wants justice and peace, but admits more to cowardice: \"I did not disapprove of war, but feared it much.\" He wants, most, to live in his cloistered cottage, to talk to hardly anyone, and \u2014 quite desperately, I believe \u2014 to belong to another time.He isn't living a life the way his contemporaries are living life. He'll sit this one out. He's learned life from books, so far, and therefore why not buy a goshawk, captured in the wild \u2014 in Germany! \u2014 and train him per the methods of three textbooks: a volume of The Sportsman's Library, one of The Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes, and the truly incredible Bert's Treatise of Hawks and Hawking, published 1619. That is his only help and perspective. He is, as he says, an amateur \"four hundred years too late for guidance.\"That last draws us directly into what White is really saying: he reminds us, often, that the last time falconry (and its relatives) was truly relevant was in the time of Shakespeare. During his long watches, training his hawk, named Gos, he recites him Shakespeare's verse. Even as \"I was stroking a murderer, a savage,\" the bigger world around him is full of mounting violence, and of politics that pursue the kill; he concludes, \"we still lived in the Middle Ages.\" So why not be there together.A philosophical line is drawn directly between the training of the hawk and the practicing of pacifism. The training, primarily, consists of exerting an endless patience as you hold the hawk by its straps and wait until it no longer \"bates\" away, attempting to fly off your fist. This takes days. Sleepless days. And after it's happened, and the bird sits calmly upon you, you can expect to backslide again soon; a hawk is never tamed. The bird shows you hate, and you must show it kindness, or fail. \"Nobody could be a master of hawks without benevolence.\" It's something between a Christian's cheek-turning and a Buddhist's enlightenment. Not every soul can do it, surely.Part of this book is almost like the first half of a romantic comedy, the half where the players foil one another with petty fights and sardonic insults, yet are constantly drawn back together. Once he and Gos find their stride, we get so many wonderfully involved descriptions of the bird's personality. White uses the most sublime and funny language to describe him: Gos is both the hilarious \"tetchy princeling\" and the subject of tragic odes:\n\"Unfortunate, dark, and immoral goshawk: I had myself been subjected to his brutality. In the beak he was not formidable, but in the talons there was death. \u2026 Once, when he thought I was going to take his food away from him, he had struck my bare forefinger. \u2026 I should only have hurt myself horribly by trying to get away, and was already being hurt.\"\nThere are many of these dark shades; it isn't a cruelty-free story. He is following his forebears and his 17th-century textbook, doing what's always been done. It may not always be right. How does that make him different from the rest of the world, about to descend into a massive war? Certainly not wiser. After all, the whole point of hawking is to hunt; it is a sport inherently disrespectful to life. And this is the twisted contradiction White offers us in his self: he is an En-glish-man, he rules his little land. This is a repugnant point of view, really, privileged and imperialist; he is the figure to whom all cultural arguments are aimed today. In his world there are still old ways to rest upon, and wild things to take at will.Still I love him. He writes this book out of his compassion and his search for peace. He is the classic misanthrope, who loves animals more than people. There's a moment, when Gos is loose, that he lures him with a pigeon, as bait. But he stops: \"I had known this pigeon: it had sat on my finger.\" It had sat on his finger! His friend! He buys two more pigeons, instead, so he won't have to use his friend for the death for which it was bred. His life is full of these tiny encounters, a \"sentimental slaughterer,\" Snow White and the hunter both. He doesn't flinch from these gruesome habits, or permit us to. He brings us deeper inside them. On a day when the gentry conducts a foxhunt outside his home, he watches a young sow badger emerge at the wrong time from the forest and encounter two well-made-up women who sit and stare at it. When she is killed, later, White allegorically contemplates her body: \n\"Brock: the last of the English bears: I had been proud that her race lived in the same wood with me. She had done nobody any harm. \u2026 Hob would be a good name for a badger. She dripped blood gently over the gate, while I held up her muzzle in the falconer's glove and looked into her small, opaque, ursine eyes. She was dead. What could I use her for? Surely, being killed, some definite good would ensue.\"\nBut there's no purpose to the death for anyone:\n\"I did not want to remember a young, short-sighted, retiring, industrious, ultimately prolific female who had been turned back by two frightened ladies, cornered by lusty and unlettered puppies, knocked on the nose by a peer. \u2026 Never mind. I was a badger too, in my snug cottage that lay in the badger's wood: and when the war-world came to tear me apart with whoops and halloas, the young sow and myself would be quits.\"\nReading a passage like that, I'm just about quits myself.Something to understand: this is actually a nonfiction book about falconry. Though I'd say it's written like a memoir, and contains allegory, it gets into detail about what to do with a goshawk. There are many diagrams. (\"Hawk Furniture\"!) It has dull stretches, and doesn't properly follow a story for a while. But its strong moments sung so brightly for me. The details carry such pain: a lesson ostensibly on repairing a broken feather explains the tragedy of the bird's \"hunger-trace,\" a line of weakness in the feathers from growing when the baby had no food. This childhood suffering leaves a visible scar; his feathers will inevitably break there, one by one. His master must mend him. This makes me want to cry, everybody.White's project moved me in the way that \nWild\n did, the obstinacy of having no right to try this thing that they find they simply must, must do. Another author undertook this same spiritual legacy just last year in H is for Hawk, in which she copes with the death of a parent with this same project, examining T.H. White for his thematic dealings with grief. This piece by Macdonald explores something White mentions in his Postscript, the \"top-secret falcon squadron\" in the British Air Ministry of WWII, entrusted with capturing \"enemy pigeons\" (and their messages). She describes the birds' character as \"naturalising the ideology of honourable combat. Falcons were a moral predator.\" Cool soldiers in the very conflict White feared so much.\n\"It happened like this in the world. Old things lost their grip and dropped away; not always because they were bad things, but sometimes because the new things were more bad, and stronger.\"\nThanks to Shannon, as ever, for telling me so much about this."}, {"userName": "Bfisher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher", "userReview": "I had read Helen Macdonald\u2019s \u201cH is for Hawk\u201d, and was fascinated by her discussion of T.H.White and of his book \u201cThe Goshawk\u201d. I think that my response to The Goshawk was greatly influenced by Macdonald\u2019s book.As one reads The Goshawk, one becomes aware of the struggles within White, even as he struggled for mastery of the hawk Gos.I suspect that White fled from the life of a schoolmaster because of the terrible temptations it offered, as when he speaks of the use of punishment in the management of schools \u201c...because of the pleasures of flagellation.\u201d Perhaps he hoped for a new start, if he felt that \"\" In any setback, he reverted to the language of domination and punishment: \u201c...the authority established, the perserverance not now flouted lest it should be thought of as weak thereafter\u201d, \u201cYet it was sometimes difficult to believe that he was not merely being naughty.

He quoted a poem of William Blake\u2019s:\"Love seeketh only self to please,To bind another to its delight,Joys in another's loss of ease,And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.\"That is the ending of the poem and the tragedy of White\u2019s relationship with Gos, which must have started in hope of a better relationship:\"Love seeketh not itself to please,Nor for itself hath any care,But for another gives its ease,And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair.\""}, {"userName": " amapola", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70345018-amapola", "userReview": "Diario di un fallimento\u201cUomo demoniaco e brillantissimo\u201d diceva il necrologio di Terence Hanbury White.

H. White's memoir of trying to train a goshawk were it not for Helen Macdonald's wonderful analysis in H is for Hawk, her recent account of training her own hawk. White, as he himself admits, does a lot of things wrong: feeding the bird far too much, for example. This horrifies Macdonald, and I expected it to horrify me too. But, because he is unaware of his mistakes at the time, what comes over has no cruelty in it whatsoever; frustration and occasional despair, yes, but otherwise just the very honest account of a lonely man's struggle to bond with this wild creature of the air.And beautifully written! Which surprised me a little, but I should have realized that the author of \nThe Once and Future King\n (the source for Camelot and an inspiration for Harry Potter) would have pretty strong chops. But again, the amazing quality of Helen Macdonald's writing\u2014easily the best I had read all year\u2014had made me assume that no one could equal her. Wrong again! In fact, I realized that by embracing the comparison with White, Macdonald was writing for her life. \"Goshawks were Hamlet, were Ludwig of Bavaria,\" writes White. \"Frantic heritors of frenetic sires, they were in full health more than half insane. When the red rhenish wine of their blood pulsed at full spate through their arteries, when the airy bird bones were gas-filled with little bubbles of unbiddable warm virility, no merely human being could bend them to his will.\" For both writers, the elemental wildness of their captor-captive stirs them to flights of verbal magnificence on virtually every page. White, a former schoolmaster, calls upon a huge vocabulary\u2014words like banting, nasconded, silurian, circumbendibus, and perdue\u2014in addition to the technical language of falconry used by both writers: austringer, jesses, creance, bate, stoop, yarak, and the like. A further subliminal interest in White's writing is that this is the late 1930s, dictators every bit as imperious as White's hawk are flexing their talons over in Europe, and the idea of aerial combat to the death is no longer confined to the world of birds.The book is brilliant. But I have to say it is also a little boring. Good though White's writing is on the individual page, he is not nearly as good as Macdonald at giving the reader a sense of his progress overall. Perhaps because his mistakes are always sending him back towards the starting point, perhaps because of the journal format with day following day with little obvious pattern, I could never measure how far White had come towards his goal. And the last third or more of the book, which are mainly about White's efforts to trap birds of different sizes, lose momentum almost entirely. White is quite frank about his efforts as \"a second-rate philosopher who lived alone in a wood, being tired of most humans in any case, to train a person who was not human,\" but of course the book is about the bird, not him. Macdonald's brilliance is to look into White's entire life, his homosexuality, his traumatic upbringing, and the sadistic tendencies he kept rigorously in check, to produce a psychosexual analysis that would have delighted Freud.

Di una battaglia. Della appassionata battaglia per il potere tra un uomo solitario e problematico e un rapace inizialmente terrorizzato e vociante e poi sensibile e indipendente. La battaglia tra due esseri non malleabili, non corrompibili, non piegabili, non dominabili. Una battaglia paziente, anche se spesso la pazienza veniva meno. Una battaglia psicologica, dolorosa, con il morale continuamente altalenante. Dinanzi all'uomo un avversario coriaceo, che incuteva rispetto, ma anche tenerezza, come durante il primo bagno in una pozzanghera. Una battaglia di tensione, di resistenza fisica, iniziata subito camminando giorni e notti intere senza dormire con l'animale sul pugno, stravolto e incapace di resistere al sonno, per fare accettare la mano come posatoio.

Having just finished White's Sword in the Stone, and having just learned what an acciptor is (raptors, including goshawks, who diet on other birds) I discovered that T.H. White had written this memoir. But while reading it, I kept thinking that White, who referred to himself as an austringer (a keeper of goshawks) lived in the 1600s. The language of this \"sport\" is so specialized and near-archaic the book read as such. Plus, one of the handful of books of training guides he used was written in the 1600s. Then he would mention the world war or automobiles and I was snapped back into the 20th century. There was also an abundance of wildlife (are there any badgers left in England?) and uninhabited land. The year was 1938. I veered between fascination and repulsion. Good thing the book is short! The preoccupation with acquiring food for the goshawk, both live game such as mice, rabbits and other birds and market beef, and what could be perceived as the cruelty of taming such a wild and independent bird was often difficult to accept. But it was also fascinating to learn about his naive methods which amounted to extreme patience and trial and error. Also, there was this bizarre psychology between man and bird unlike anything I've ever encountered before.When the book was published in 1951, White added a third section with an overview of his continued practice with another goshawk, changes in method, and mention of the disappearance of the practice in England, but which he was glad to see continuing in America."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1160035-dan", "userReview": "I love T.

But he was tumultuous and frightening, repulsive in the same way as snakes are frightening to people who do not know them, or dangerous as the sudden movement of a toad by the door step when one goes out at night with a lantern into the dew. The sacking had been sewn with string, and he was bumping against it from underneath: bump, bump, bump, incessantly with more than a hint of lunacy. The basket pulsed like a big heart in fever.

The falconer (more correctly, austringer) overcomes the bird's resistance to settling on his glove by staying awake with the bird until the bird is so drowsy that it accepts to fall asleep on the glove. Bird and man typically stay awake 3 days and nights together, or if the man is clumsy, up to 9 days and nights.The Goshawk is a strange glimpse into another life and another century.

Hers is also a chronicle of training a goshawk, the most difficult of the raptors to train, and White\u2019s is an account of a failed attempt.This is a buried treasure for me (published in 1951), and what a delight it has been. He wrote this book out of economic necessity, or so he says, because he needed to write a book to supplement his income. He never says why he decided to train a gos, but the effort fails miserably for a number of reasons and the manuscript lay unpublished for more than fifteen years, when his publisher persuaded him to allow it.It\u2019s referred to as \u2018a masterpiece\u2019 and I\u2019d agree, on a few different counts. The writing is sharp and clear and poetic, and his rigorous self-examination during the process is evident on each page. It\u2019s laugh-out-loud funny at times, in the self-deprecating British way. It\u2019s also a bittersweet chronicle of a failed relationship. Neither the man nor the bird taught the other enough about himself to make the relationship work.White decides, for undisclosed reasons, to train the goshawk according to medieval methods, the first part of which required the austringer (falconer is a term used for long-winged hawks) to stay awake with the bird until the bird falls asleep on his glove. This is only the first part of a grueling regime of \u2018manning\u2019 the hawk to help it grow accustomed to people and their movements. White is determined to follow the regime but also not quite capable of the rigour it demands. He feeds the hawk more than he should because he worries about it, and so that part of the training fails because the hawk isn\u2019t hungry enough.His account of the many stages of the training includes his various inventions of equipment he needs, and there are beautiful drawings to accompany them. He was a man full of passion and invention and ingenuity, but also not quite an obedient soldier. He gives in to his need for sleep and food and drink, and his various worries about the bird he calls Gos lead him to over-feed him. All of this eventually causes the training to fail.There were times that this read like a chronicle of parenting for its various traps, and also of writing, for its various neuroses and necessity for total dedication and solitude. 'There was the man counting the diminishing number of bates at each visit: there were the walks along solitary ridings during the day-time, the mental calculations at each advance, the half-hours by the kitchen fire in which pen and whiskey tried to keep pace with sleep, the fingers which smarted from pecks, the fetching of coal through the dewy night grass under and enormous orange moon in its last quarter: there were mist, wet boots, silence, solitude, stars, success and obedience.'The grueling schedule leads him to this startling re-visioning of work:\u2018As I put Gos to bed in the darkness, a new thought emerged. This time it was a quotation: To scorn delights and live laborious days. But it presented itself the other way about, saying: To live laborious days for their delight.\u2019It\u2019s also a love song to the goshawk, that wildest of wild birds, and to Gos in particular. \u2018All the same, nothing would ever be as fine as Gos\u2026I always loved the unteachable, the untouchable, the underdog. And it had been difficult. For every minute of patience in quarrel my understanding of him and queer affection for his brave and somehow pathetic mania had grown insensibly. I felt lonely without him and caught myself at moments wondering what I ought to be doing now. After all, it had been quite right of him to resist to the last: to recognize, long after a falcon would have given in (you could train two or three falcons in the time of one goshawk) that I was an unnatural force. Why would he, a wild princeling of Teutonic origin, submit to an enforced captivity? He had hated and distrusted me, the intransigent small robber baron. He had the guts to stand up against love so long. I hoped he would snap his jesses safely, the ungovernable barbarian, and live a very long, happy life in the wild world: unless I could catch him again as a partner whom I should never dare to treat as a captive. He deserved to be free, but I wanted him still.\u2019This book has my highest endorsement."}, {"userName": "Gianluca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18547158-gianluca", "userReview": "Questo libro \u00e8 una storia d'amore, ossessiva e conturbante.

It gave out weird cries of protest, hysterical, terrified, but furious and authoritative. It would have eaten anybody alive.\"Surprisingly, this is T. H. White's first encounter with his new goshawk, not the beginnings of a horror classic. Delivered to him from Germany during the 1930s, White's challenge was to train this intoxicating predator. He named him Gos, and spent his time, in relative isolation, trying to tame him. It sounds simple enough, but Gos wasn't just White's first goshawk, he was White's first raptor. He'd never trained a bird of prey before, and made the fatal mistake of doing so with wildly outdated methods. Needless to say, he hits hurdle after hurdle and fails, bereft. I don't know if it was my mood, or if it was because I read The Goshawk right after H is for Hawk, but I didn't have the patience for White. In fact, I can't say I liked him all that much. He was cruel to Gos, and consciously inept. Time and again he chose self-sabotage instead of committing to what he knew he should do. Gos wasn't at flying weight. Far from it, in fact. White fed him and fed him, rewarding him after anything and everything like an insecure dog owner. \"Love me!\" he cried with each chunk of meat. Even when Gos so clearly didn't want any more, White actually thrust it into his beak. Of course, in this state, Gos disobeyed. As a result, White got angry. He went from crooning to his beloved hawk to pulling him from a railing to the ground, in a misguided effort to get him to fly to the fist. These mixed signals confused poor Gos, and White knew it. But he continued. In the end, his efforts lost him his goshawk. Now, I know White was a first-timer, but he knowingly ignored not just the advice of modern falconry books, but his own head. As White lost his temper with Gos, I lost my temper with White. I unwittingly skim-read chunks of the book. When I dipped in during the commute I started nodding off - when a book's really special, I never nod off. It happened with The Goldfinch last year, and it happened with H is for Hawk. It didn't happen with The Goshawk, and it was disappointing. I really wanted to adore it, but even with White's expert turn of phrase and touches of comedy, I was never completely engrossed.

H. White's fascinating account of when, \"a deluded and imaginative recluse,\" he fled from the world and human beings into a wood, pared his life down to essentials, and tried via old falconry books and trial and error to train a young, wild male goshawk. The first part concerns his attempts in 1937 to tame and teach \"Gos,\" the second his attempts to catch a new hawk, and the third his attempts to get a female hawk (\"Cully\") to make her first kill. He wrote the postscript in 1951, some fifteen years after the main events, when he finally published the book.White desperately wants to succeed with Gos. Unfortunately, as Helen Macdonald points out in her excellent book H Is for Hawk (2014), he sabotages his chances for success. As he himself says, \"It has never been easy to learn life from books.\" His old falconry books persuade White to prevent Gos from sleeping for from three to nine days to exhaust the bird into surrendering to the gloved hand as to a haven. To White's credit (?), he torments himself along with Gos, staying awake with the bird. But when White recites Shakespearean tragedies to Gos and plays and sings operas and so on to prevent him from sleeping, one may recall the loud rock music forcing awake prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Ironically, when White notices malnutrition-caused defects in Gos' feathers, he panics and overfeeds him, against the good advice of his books. Despite knowing that one must use patience rather than cruelty to train a hawk, at times White feels like an executioner in a torture chamber. Indeed, he talks about his relationship with Gos as a war: \"They were days of attack and counter-attack, a kind of sweeping to and fro across disputed battle fields.\" Hence White's numerous ways to describe the \"baleful and extraordinary\" bird, including names and similes that really reveal White himself: Caligula, Hamlet, Poe, Death, Byron, Van Gogh, Odin, Richard the Third, a sphinx, a Teutonic Tarquin, an insane assassin, an unfortunate tyrant, the accursed overlord, the hideous bilious princeling--my master. Interestingly, the name he mostly calls him, Gos, a hybrid of goose and gosling, expresses a foolish, innocent, and funny creature. White is for Gos mother, lover, teacher, master, slave. Gos is for White child, lover, student, tyrant, lord, enigma. Mixed feelings indeed.And when, after all the setbacks, White was on the verge of success, he--But that would be telling. The Goshawk, mind you, is not only a painful book. For White, contact with Gos is better than romance (conflict between men and women) and war (cruel and wasteful activity). Being with Gos leads to the fusing of human and bird, as when White feels with Cully that \"Our veins coalesced and the blood ran in a circuit through both of us.\" Being with Gos leads to transcendence, as when White feels himself sitting on God's fist as Gos sat on his fist: \"so transitory as to be eternal, so finite as to be infinite and a part of the Becoming.\" There are moments of pure joy, as when Gos first flies to the fist, and moments of comedy and numinous beauty, as when he takes his first bath.White's minute observations of Gos (careful, for hawks prefer regarding to being regarded) lead to many wonderfully vivid descriptions of him, like this early one: \"The yellowish breast-feathers\u2014Naples Yellow\u2014were streaked downward with long, arrow-shaped hackles of Burnt Umber: his talons, like scimitars, clutched the leather glove on which he stood with a convulsive grip: for an instant he stared upon me with a mad, marigold or dandelion eye, all his plumage flat to the body and his head crouched like a snake's in fear or hatred, then bated wildly from the fist.\" And his careful observation and contemplation of the natural world in general leads to many great descriptions, of everything from pigeons (\"Grey Quakers\") to maggots (\"crackling with life\" and \"perfectly persisting\").As we read The Goshawk, we learn terms and facts relating to falconry, which is as old as Babylon. An \"austringer\" (how White refers to himself) is a trainer of short-winged hawks. \"Bated. . . . meant the headlong dive of rage and terror, by which a leashed hawk leaps from the fist in a wild bid for freedom, and hangs upside down by his jesses in a flurry of pinions like a chicken being decapitated, revolving, struggling, in danger of damaging his primaries.\" White provides many details of hawks, from their not drinking water to their seeing farther and breathing faster than other animals (especially humans), and being highly strung: \"For him everything was danger and exaggeration, life was a quiver far more taut than anything known to us.\"The audiobook loses White's detailed drawings of various accessories of falconry (jesses, perches, etc.) and of the birds (hunger traces, etc.), but gains Simon Vance's superb reading.Though White says of his book that \"It would be about the efforts of a second-rate philosopher who lived alone in a wood, being tired of most humans in any case, to train a person who was not human, but a bird,\" like all great literature it is about more than its apparent subject. It's also about civilization, nature, and how humans negotiate the distance between them. It's about history, art, sport, life and death, and White's own idiosyncratic misanthropy. It's about writing books, about making something good and lasting, which is for White the best thing people can do. White's life goal and way of working towards it resemble Thoreau's in Walden: \"To divest oneself of unnecessary possessions and mainly of other people, that was the business of life. One had to find out . . . what things were really needed.\" And like The Once and Future King (1958), The Goshawk is an anti-war book written on the eve of and early in World War II, and fans of White's famous work will find echoes of it in this one: the mixture of comedy and tragedy and romance and the empathic imagining of animal life."}, {"userName": "Kevin Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22931479-kevin-lawrence", "userReview": "What a curious little book about an unrequited love relationship between a reclusive man and a feral goshawk.

Well, yes, he did.\""}], "description": "What is it that binds human beings to other animals? T.H. White, the author of The Once and Future King and Mistress Masham's Repose, was a young writer who found himself rifling through old handbooks of falconry. A particular sentence \u2014 \"the bird reverted to a feral state\" \u2014 seized his imagination, and, White later wrote, \"A longing came to my mind that I should be able to do this myself. The word 'feral' has a kind of magical potency which allied itself to two other words, 'ferocious' and 'free.'\" Immediately, White wrote to Germany to acquire a young goshawk. Gos, as White named the bird, was ferocious and Gos was free, and White had no idea how to break him in beyond the ancient (and, though he did not know it, long superseded) practice of depriving him of sleep, which meant that he, White, also went without rest. Slowly man and bird entered a state of delirium and intoxication, of attraction and repulsion that looks very much like love. White kept a daybook describing his volatile relationship with Gos \u2014 at once a tale of obsession, a comedy of errors, and a hymn to the hawk. It was this that became The Goshawk, one of modern literature's most memorable and surprising encounters with the wilderness \u2014 as it exists both within us and without.", "title": "The Goshawk", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1188127.The_Goshawk", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320461488l/1188127.jpg", "reviews": 120, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426944.T_H_White", "name": "T.H.
