I should wear a sign around my neck, everywhere I go, that states: \"Diabetic? Ask Me about...\" My husband was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 15 years ago. It had been steadily advancing along with all the insidious side effects. His diet strictly followed his doctor's advise but his diabetes was spiraling out of control. This book explains all the physiology involved, takes the blame off the \"lazy diabetics who can't control their cravings.\" Once one truly understands the affects of the disease on the body and the brain, difficult decisions suddenly make sense and therefore easier to make. I am not diabetic but decided to follow the diet to support my husband, and to also try to gain some understanding in how difficult a life change this might be. The first week was very difficult with highs and lows as we figured out his body's reactions. I felt utterly obsesed with food and fingerpricks, but his sugars completely stablized after four days. After the second week he declared that he would NEVER go back to his old eating habits. After 3 weeks, many of his complications began to dissappear. Now, after 3 months, the food choices seem natural and easy. I know I must be driving my friends and acquaintances crazy, but I will say it again: This book saved our lives."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7580284-lisa", "userReview": "This book changed my life. I've had Type 1 diabetes for 48 years and managed it well, but not until I read this book did I understand in depth the interplay of insulin, food, exercise, and. of course, the associated sequelae. I also learned, perhaps most importantly, that blood sugars kept within normal range can result in diminished or even reversed sequelae. That was a eureka moment for me: I'd always thought that diabetes-related decay of every organ in the body (barring hair follicles; they're not so sure about that. I have weird hair, but I don't think it's diabetes-related) was more or less inevitable. If you have diabetes, or have a diabetic relative who could use some help, you might want to read or recommend this book. Then again, you might not. I'll explain. Bernstein developed Type 1 diabetes as a young man. Following then-current wisdom on insulin dosing, diet and exercise, he was a wreck. As in, passing out at the wheel and crashing. That is not a metaphor. Bernstein, then an engineer in the medical devices field, began to research the disease. One thing he found was that lab animals, if their blood sugars were kept within the range of normal, could be, essentially, cured of diabetes and/or its sequelae. The thinking back then was that this was impossible for humans, for whatever bizarre rationale. (We are not animals? We lack discipline? Honey, show me a way to fix this malady, and I'll be a soldier who won't flinch when you slice off his nipple. That analogy courtesy of the season's opener for Game of Thrones. No, no don't thank me.)He heard of a new device, relatively portable (suitcase-sized), to test blood sugar on the spot, as opposed to the very long times it had taken (bear in mind the doctor is now in his 80s; this was long before at-home, portable, personal glucose testing devices). He wanted one. They wouldn't sell it to him. They said these were just for emergency rooms, for the purpose of differentiating passed-out drunks from hypoglycemic faints. They said diabetics would never test their own blood sugar. So Bernstein got his wife, a medical doctor, to get him one, and he set about normalizing his blood sugars. Well. He did darn good. He got his blood sugar within normal range (in the 80s), and his sequelae went *poof*. He also looks like somebody suffering from starvation. Which brings me to why you might not bother to read this book or have your diabetic loved ones read it. This stuff is hard. This stuff requires a discipline that's severe when it comes to diet and medication, to exercise, to cooking your own food, to all sorts of diabetic fun-fun-fun. Not many people can do things the way the good doctor Bernstein carefully lays out in this excellent book. That's why people die from diabetes. Thank God I'm blessed with discipline, and with the ability to cook, and with a rabid love of living. This is doable. It's all doable. I don't look like a Holocaust survivor. I look plump and happy. Albeit with weird hair. I eat like a horse. I don't feel deprived. I gorge myself on fat and protein, and I eat tons of low-carb vegetables. This is important. This is key. You can do this. Your diabetic friends and relatives can do this.But you, or they, have to really, really want to do it. Best of luck to all in dealing with the big D."}, {"userName": "Giuseppe Maxia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298984-giuseppe-maxia", "userReview": "This book is a must read for everyone with diabetes, suspect diabetes, or even for someone who is simply overweight. What Dr. Bernstein reveals, with plenty pf detail and provable facts, is the close relationship with blood sugar disorder and weight gain. Not only that. He gets the record straight about what it is that makes us fat, and why diabetes kills so many.That alone would be a reason to read this book, but he goes beyond it, and explains how anyone with diabetes can have a normal life, with normal blood sugar, thus eliminating all health complications such as heart and kidney failures or limb amputation.The remedies he proposes may not be fit for everyone. You will need a strong will to achieve the lifestyle change that leads to health. But there are so many testimonials, first among them the author himself, who has been living a healthy life with diabetes for more than 60 years, that you feel compelled to at least give this method a try. And I have to say that I did try, and the results are magnificent. Thus, the only thing I need to do is to recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Kevin O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7609801-kevin-o-brien", "userReview": "This book is a life-changing book for me. I have been a Type 2 diabetic for a little over 10 years, and never quite got my blood sugars as low as my doctor would like. I tried following the recommended diets, but while the results were not awful, it was a constant struggle. Meanwhile, my medication doses were slowly rising, and my doctor started suggesting that maybe we would need to move to insulin injections. But since starting this book and understanding what Dr. Bernstein is saying, my blood sugars have been excellent, I am losing weight, and I feel like I am in control of my life. IF you or anyone you know is a diabetic, I urge you to look at this book."}, {"userName": "Stephen Visio", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12557900-stephen-visio", "userReview": "This book is a life saver. Give it to anyone you know who is diabetic. I am a type II and after reading this book I lost 50 pounds, was taken off insulin and three of four medications, and am controlling my diabetes through diet and exercise. It's all about dietary sugar. The ADA teaches that sugar is sugar, Dr Bernstein shows otherwise. Limiting certain dietary sugars lowers your blood sugar and removes all the symptoms of high blood sugars. Diabetes could be viewed as a person's reaction to dietary sugars two hours after every meal."}, {"userName": "Iona  Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart", "userReview": "This is an extremely useful, detailed book that presents a low-carbohydrate diet that will keep your blood sugars down to normal levels.Dr. Bernstein has himself suffered from diabetes from the age of 12, and he describes how his health deteriorated due to lack of proper treatment, until he suffered from several dangerous complications resulting from the disorder. He had to find out how to normalize his blood sugars himself, and this he did. This normalization resulted in his getting rid of most of the complications. Then he had to go to medical school at the late age of 45 in order to be able to treat and help other diabetes patients. Because of all this I have great respect for him. He has devoted his life to helping diabetes sufferers all over the world.Bernstein advises that we must follow a diet based on eating 6g of carbohydrate for breakfast, 12 g for lunch and 12g for supper.He lists which foods are acceptable and which are \"No, no\". There is also a chapter presenting recipe suggestions near the end of the book.I personally have been much helped by this book, since despite my suffering clear signs of the illness, both high and low blood sugars, my doctor told me my tests were completely normal, and I had no problems of this sort whatsoever. An \"alternative\" (in this country) scanning method (actually a wholly scientiic method used in Russia and other Eastern European countries in hospitals and by doctors for over 20 years) confirmed my own diagnosis - auto-immune, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. I suffer also from pains in my toes. Because of the lack of official diagnosis I am unable to get free testing equipment or strips.However Dr Bernstein has confirmed my own and the scanning apparatus' diagnosis. My HcbA-IC value was 5.5%, which is equivalent to a blood sugar reading of 120 mg/dl. The HgbA-IC value is 4.2% in non-diabetics, this being equivalent to 83 mg/dl. On researching the matter Bernstein found that persons having a blood sugar level of 90 mg/dl or over had a higher mortality than those having a level under 90 mg/dl.I was also helped by the author's explanation as to why I felt shaky and weak in the morning as if I had low blood sugar, when actually it was 120 mg/dl. This is apparently a common phenomenon. It feels like low blood sugar only in comparison with the high blood sugars one experiences after eating.The author goes into extreme detail about the various types of insulin available, how and when to painlessly inject and so on. This information will be extremely useful to those who use insulin. There are also helpful chapters about hypoglycemia, gastroparesis (delayed stomach-emptying) and exercise, among other things.Since I can't get insulin, and wouldn't want to use it anyway, I appreciate the author's tip that R-alpha lipoic acid when used together with evening primrose oil mimics the effect of insulin and can help to reduce blood sugars (though ALA reduces the body's levels of biotin, which should thus be taken at the same time).Bernstein's main quality is the immense detail of his explanations.This said, I would like to note a few negative points. He advocates the use of micro-wave ovens, which are known to destroy the life-energy in food subjected to them. And he also recommends the use of aspartame, Splenda and other artifical sweeteners documented as being harmful. It is as though he knows everything about how to counteract the harmful effects of diabetes, but is not so aware of other threats to our health.Moreover, since he himself suffers from beta-cell burnout, he doesn't really go into the possibilities of healing the pancreas by natural methods and thus increasing the production of insulin. The author's beta cells may or may not be beyond repair, but this will not be the case with many others reading the book.For information about such natural methods i would advise the reading of Cass Ingram's book \"Natural cures for diabetes\" in conjunction with this book. But I absolutely recommend that you read this book too, especially if you use insulin."}, {"userName": "Arminzerella", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella", "userReview": "Dr. Bernstein is in his 70s (as of 2007 when this book was published) and has been a type-1 diabetic for much of his life. He has found that the best way to control diabetes and its deleterious effects is to keep one\u2019s blood sugar at an even keel and prevent spikes and drops that can wreak havoc on body tissues, organs, and systems (what eventually come to be called \u2018diabetic complications\u2019). He hopes to reach outside the physical scope of his practice with this book to others who can benefit from his research and teachings \u2013 it is the information and training that each of his patients receive when they enter into his care. His methods include a diabetic-specific diet (catered to the individual\u2019s tastes, but essentially low-no carb), exercise (highly recommended), and insulin injections/diabetic medications administered to help keep blood sugars steady and within a certain range (as determined by the patient\u2019s physician and adjusted accordingly). I am not a diabetic, and I picked this up because the threat (almost the inevitability) of diabetes looms so large in our society. The diet Dr. Bernstein espouses may be just what non-diabetics need to follow in order to remain diabetes-free. I skimmed or skipped much of the sections on diabetic medication (as they aren\u2019t pertinent to me), so I can\u2019t comment on those, but if I had diabetes, this is definitely the book I would start with, and I will definitely recommend it others. Dr. Bernstein wants to empower diabetics to take control of their disease, and in the case of many type-2 diabetics, overcome it. It can be done."}, {"userName": "Audrey L", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2628401-audrey-l", "userReview": "Are you on the road to diabetes? A simple way to know you have this problem is if you have excess body fat around your waist. That means your insulin levels are out of control. Insulin is the fat storage hormone. Diabetes is a disease in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced.After reading this book I went and bought a blood sugar monitor. I started testing my blood sugar five times a day to see what the food I ate was doing to me. I found that I cannot handle carbohydrates (carbohydrate means foods such as cereals, bread, and pasta or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts). I have a pre-diabetes condition and I wouldn't have realized this unless I started testing my blood sugar. This book is a must read for anyone who has diabetes or pre-diabetes with metabolic syndrome or syndrome x (metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions \u2014 increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist or abnormal cholesterol levels).

Though I\u2019ve not gone as low-carb as Bernstein promotes (i.e., 30 gm per day), I\u2019ve cut way back to perhaps 60+ gm per day \u2014 and the lower I go, the better my blood sugar numbers are. I\u2019m seeking to minimize blood sugar surges after meals, as well as to keep my overall blood sugar levels (A1C) as near \u2018normal\u2019 as possible. I\u2019m seeking to do this in concert with training to walk a marathon again, so I\u2019m also experimenting with maintaining my long-term endurance while on this low-carb high-fat diet. So far, excellent \u2014 though it is certainly a head-twister to so fundamentally change my way of eating ... Bernstein makes abundant sense, even though he goes counter to the established rhetoric of a high-carb diet for diabetics. (Why on earth would the American Diabetes Association insist that diabetics eat a high-carb diet when the very substance we can\u2019t handle is carbohydrates? Is there any wonder that high-carb intake doesn\u2019t work very well, except under high levels of medication? ...

This doesn't mean you should listen to everything he says; for instance, he doesn't believe in most vitamin supplementation (consult Ray Kurzweill on that question) and more than that, he's an extremist-- the ultimate Blood Sugar Perfectionist, which is not possible for most people in most situations. There's no room here for any middle ground. But his book is so chock full of suggestions and details that you literally will not read anywhere else, nor will you hear from your doctor. And these details are important ones because they are tested on himself and on his patients and they work.

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason", "userReview": "I'll start with this incredible quote on page 33: \u201cstudies predict that 95% of Americans born today will develop diabetes.\u201d Dr Bernstein didn't provide a source for that amazing percentage, but if you're reading this, chances are overwhelming that you or your kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors will develop diabetes\u2014or maybe all of you! This percentage is higher than the estimated population affected in medieval Europe during it's several plague outbreaks. It's even higher than the estimated numbers of American Indians decimated by smallpox in the 1500s.I don't have diabetes, but I've seen similar percentages from different sources. I've never seen the figure 95% before, but I've seen estimates that are all pretty high. Dr Bernstein goes on to say that\u2014even today\u2014deaths related to diabetes is probably way underreported. For example, if you die from stoke, sepsis, heart attack, etc, then your death will be attributed to the proximal cause, not necessarily the underlying diabetes that caused the eventual pathophysiologies. I feel like diabetes will overwhelm the health industry, will break Medicare and Medicaid, and will emerge in the next few decades, not as an epidemic, but as a pandemic of epic proportions. Governments will struggle to survive; civilization may even teeter with a 95% rate of incidence. It's from this macabre personal forecast that I felt compelled to learn a little more than I already do about diabetes.This is not the book to read if you're interested in diabetes forecasting, the science of future treatment, medical perspectives, or public policy regarding diabetes. Instead, it's a book that outlines, in great detail, personal treatment regimens. Dr. Bernstein has had Type I diabetes for over 50 years, and the treatment he writes about are methods that he has followed himself. In fact, he developed his insulin regimen and diet in the absence of what he felt was sufficient diabetic treatment back in the Jurassic period of diabetic knowledge--the 60's, 70's, and 80's. He offers recommendations that differ dramatically from standard diabetic treatment, for both Type I and II. Dr Bernstein makes clear up front that his book will offer advice that other clinicians may not fully support. For proof that it does work, however, he offers as testimony the thousands of patients that have journeyed to find him and learn his practices. And for people who have had little success with traditional practices, Dr Bernstein's methods must seem like a God-send.Again, I'm not a diabetic, nor do I have one in the family, but eventually I will. This book will humble you to the insulin and food restrictions followed by most diabetics. It also taught me that diabetes is not unsurvivable; on the contrary, Dr Bernstein has described how easily it can be mitigated. His overall thesis is something he calls 'The Law of Small Numbers.' In a nutshell, it's much easier and healthier to deal with your glucose levels when you're administering small amounts, but much more frequently. In Bernstein's words on page 102: the \"name of the game for the diabetic in achieving blood sugar normalization is predictability.\" So, yes, more injections, but a less maundering blood sugar level throughout the day. Here's some high points:- How and when to measure blood sugars- Establishing treatment plans- What you've been taught about diet is probably wrong (carbs = bad; protein = good)- Pros/cons of Insulin Sensitizing Agents & Insulin Mimetic Agents- Unique exercise program which helps with insulin dose absorption & timing- Types of insulin (most-rapid-acting, rapid-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting)- Insulin regimens- Recipes"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol", "userReview": "This book is almost exactly what I wanted. I have Pre-diabetes and having been inching to diabetes since my late twenties. I have been struggling to understand how much carbohydrates I should limit myself to and also what those carbohydrates are. Since I have never reached diabetes in my blood sugar readings, I never was qualified for the free diabetes training offered at hospitals. Also, I couldn't afford to pay for it.Dr. Richard K. Bernstein boils everything down in simple and not confusing language. He has Diabetes Type I and was never able to control it using the guidelines that were offered when he was young. He decided to figure out what works for him and from that sprang his plan that can be used by most diabetics.He explained the effects of blood sugar are on our bones, skin, moods and joints. He discussed the tests that should be used for the initial workup-including one that I have never had. I will discuss that one with my doctor on the next appointment.He also provides a list of prescription and none prescription medicines that can raise your blood sugar.I found one that I take twice a day so I will discuss with my doctor if it can be changed.I learned so much from this book but there were a few drawbacks. I wished for more recipes in the back, I am not sure that I agree with him on the use of malodextrin. Since I checked many websites on it with opposing views, I am now confused as to whether I should avoid it. Also, can I totally give up bread and all baked goods and fruit? I will cut down but can I totally eliminate it? I think I will slowly cut down and eliminaate the foods that he said are \"No No\". And I will look for and increase the foods that he says are safe for diabetics. Also in Chapter 13, he lists three exceptions to people who can do fine on his diet plan. I have one of the conditions and a possible second one that he lists. However he only discusses solutions for the third exception so I am left hanging with the question of what do I do? Beyond that I really love the clear language and the way that he explained things that I have been confused about for years.I recommend this book for all people with diabetes and pre-Diabetes.I won this book from GoodReads and received it from the publishers but that in no way influenced my review."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2145131-donna", "userReview": "Some of this book makes complete sense: carbohydrate raises blood sugar so eating less of it will raise blood sugars to a lesser extent. Other parts are just totally impractical: eat a total of 30g of carb a day, but basically only from a very limited number of vegetables - no fruit, grain products, milk, etc. Just protein, fat and a few vegetables. I have no idea how anyone could stick to this diet and lead a normal active life. In fact I think it is more restrictive than the diet I was recommended on being diagnosed with Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes 24 years ago. I do however understand the science behind the Bernstein method and can see the benefits to blood sugar control if you follow it religiously, but I do wonder at the lack of variety and the need to take supplements to cover what you are not getting from fruit and \"banned\" vegetables and other things like calcium from milk. I shall be cutting down on my carbohydrate intake but nowhere near to the extent of Dr Bernstein's suggestions.

And I think listening to your doctor is most important thing to do versus what the book says.If I did not win this book, I would not have bought it.I will try to keep this brief but here is where I found problems with the book. It appears to be unrealistic when it comes to advice about diet/ nutrition and exercise. It does a good job addressing proteins and calcium, but it seems ignore what happens with cholesterol levels. Your sugar levels may be great, but you could also be heading towards a heart attack.The eating habits seem to advocate Adkins like diet, and leave out fruits completely and limit vegetables. Cutting food out of your diet can be dangerous and run the risk of lacking in certain vitamins. Taking supplements are his answer.It demonizes ALL forms of sugar, natural and man-made.The recipes that are diabetic friendly in his book also happen to be rich people with a lot of time to cook. (examples Acorn Squash Bisque, Pan-Fried Swordfish with Ginger Scallion Butter, Filet Mignon with Green and Black peppercorn sauce, Grilled Cheeseburger with Canadian Bacon...)Exercise... is barely spoken about in the book, not even a diagram of which exercises he recommends to check if you are in proper form. It appears he has done little to no research on how exercise impacts diabetes. There are no recommendations about activity at certain weight levels in relation to insulin. It is very lacking.Overall I feel this book pushes CERTAIN medications over more natural ways to control diabetes. It is not for the average person with diabetes.
