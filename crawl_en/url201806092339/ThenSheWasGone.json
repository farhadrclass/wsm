Looking at it backward it was obvious all along. But back then, when she knew nothing about anything, she had not seen it coming. She had walked straight into it with her eyes open.\"Lisa Jewell has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and for good reason. Her writing is addictive and appeals to a wide variety of readers; not too light, not too dark, but just right. Her characters are full bodied and bloom like a spring flower by the end of her stories. Also, who doesn't like to read books by genuinely nice people?\u00a0If you've been active in the book community at all this month then you're sure to have noticed that\u00a0Then She Was Gone\u00a0is an April Pick by Book Of The Month, so naturally this is one that's being hyped for a reason-it's just that good! If you haven't managed to get your hands on a copy yet, then you'll want to make it a priority and here's why...Lisa Jewell knows how to take a classic storyline and make it her own. Most of her plots are traditional tales that have been told before in some form, but the difference is that she knows how to take something that could be predictable and put her own spin on it. The atmosphere, characterization, and raw emotion that is infused into each of her novels elevates their status to something that few suspense novelists have attained. The blending of multiple genres in each of her books really creates a unique reading experience; readers of every gender and walk of life have been able to connect with her writing and I feel that's a sure sign of the highest quality of writing.I'm positive you've noticed that I haven't mentioned the plot yet, and that's for good reason. You really truly want to go as blind into this one as you can. I'm going to avoid any details here, as I want you to have the most fabulous reading experience with this one possible, so I'll stick to describing it with some buzz words.\u00a0Breathtaking. Compulsive. Suspenseful. Poetic.\u00a0<--- But Chelsea, how can you describe something thrilling as poetic? Trust me, once you experience Jewell's writing, you'll understand.Gang, this one is more than just a a beautiful shell of a cover.\u00a0But that cover IS stunning, amiright?\u00a0You definitely want to add this to your reading schedule ASAP, especially if you're looking for a read that is so gripping you'll fly right through it. To say I'm waiting with bated breath for Lisa's next novel would be an understatement, and I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did. <3*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "This was a fairly average experience for me. It's a very quick read - I read it in a single day - and it goes down smoothly and easily, but it is so easy to predict everything that will happen. I was always several chapters ahead of the characters and it sapped a lot of tension out of the story.I can see why, with a better plot, Jewell is a great writer. The relationships and characters were fleshed out and interesting. Laurel\u2019s pain over her missing daughter is palpable and realistic. The loss of Ellie felt like a real thing, not something that exists only inside a book. It's a shame, though, that we know a major aspect of Ellie's fate almost immediately, seeing as this is probably what I would have cared about most.In the wake of Ellie's disappearance ten years ago, her mother and father have split and the family has been torn apart by losing its \"golden child\". Laurel, Ellie's mother, is struggling to get her life back on track and save her relationships with her two remaining children. A new romance with a guy called Floyd makes her think that she may finally be moving on, until she meets his youngest daughter, Poppy, who looks shockingly like Ellie.It sort of feels like I've read a hundred different variations of the missing daughter/grieving mother plot, and Then She Was Gone doesn't really do anything new with it. The writing is strong, but it's disappointing when you figure out all the major reveals in the first few chapters and even get the reasons behind them. As soon as certain characters are introduced, I was thinking \u201cah, got it\u201d and, unfortunately, I was right. I kept hoping something exciting would happen to prove me wrong, but it really is as obvious as it seems.I'm also not totally convinced about the biological possibility of one plot point.Then She Was Gone was fine as an undemanding beach thriller, but I wouldn't recommend it for readers looking for something new and innovative.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Holly  B", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39749481-holly-b", "userReview": "Edgy, Dark and AddictiveThis turned out to be quite a stunner.

I love her writing style and how she keeps me totally absorbed in the story line. The more I read, the more invested I became and started to care about some of the key characters.

She was the youngest of three children who left the house one day to go to the library and never returned. Her Mother, Laurel Mack, fell apart after her daughter's disappearance, as most parents would. Her daughter's disappearance forever altered her life. Her marriage fell apart, her other daughter, Hanna became distant and withdrawn from her Mother,her son moved away. Throughout it all she never gave up hope on finding her daughter. Was Ellie a runaway as the police suggested? Was she kidnapped? Was there an accident? So many questions without answers can wear a person down, can leave a hole, and can prevent a person from fully moving on with one's life.Then ten years after her daughter's disappearance, she goes into a bakery after getting her hair cut, and meets a man named Floyd. He compliments her hair and offers her a bite of his carrot cake. Laurel usually doesn't take chances, but after the last clue in Ellie's case was discovered, Laurel is ready to put her life back on track. Soon Laurel and Floyd are a couple and she has met his two daughters. She is shocked to see that his youngest daughter, Poppy has a strong resemblance to her daughter, Ellie. As Laurel gets to know the entire family, she begins to learn about coincidences, there is a certain individual who ties both of their lives together. I read this book in one day. I literally could not put this book down. Lisa Jewell has written a very good psychological thriller/mystery. I enjoyed all the characters even the bad ones. The bad ones were good characters in so much that they were creepy and sinister while at the same time being damaged. This book was a very well thought out and developed plot. The story moves at a very good pace. There were no dull moments. There were moments when I wanted to yell at Laurel \"Ask more questions!\" and \"come on, put it together\". Is the book a little predictable? Yes, yes, it is a little predictable. I figured the \"mystery\" out but that did not spoil the book for me, as I kept turning the pages to see who else was going to figure the book out. The suspense builds as some questions get answered. Do you need to suspend some disbelief? Sure, a little...but that didn't affect my enjoyment of this book at all.

Then She was Gone is not about what happened to Ellie, it\u2019s more about the how and the why she disappeared, as well as the after-effects of her disappearance on her family. \nOne morning, Ellie Mack heads to the library. At 10:43 am, she was never to be seen again. The police\u2019s investigation never turned up any clues to what happened to her, but believe she ran away. Her mother, Laurel, believes otherwise. After 10 years have passed, the family finally gets some answers--what they don\u2019t realize is how close they were to knowing the truth all along.As Laurel slowly finds closure, she begins to rebuild her life. She starts dating and it seems as if she has found love again with a single father named Floyd. But something isn\u2019t quite right about Floyd, especially his relationship with his nine-year-old daughter, Polly. The more and more Laurel spends time with Floyd and Polly, she comes to realize that what happened to Ellie was not at all what it seemed. The reasons behind Ellie\u2019s disappearance come to light through Ellie\u2019s POV. Her mother, Laurel, also has a main voice in the story.There are several things I loved about this book. While it\u2019s obvious what happened to Ellie, what is not are the reasons why. Jewell has a way of writing that is just completely enthralling. I always get sucked into her books, and one of the reasons why is her strong characterization. By the end of this, I really felt like I knew Laurel Mack. Although parts of the story are a little bizarre (Jewell says this herself in the Acknowledgements), she makes it work. This is a fast-paced, dark read with some interesting twists and some well-written psychopaths! I highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "I read a Lisa Jewell novel last year and connected immediately with her writing style, tone, and voice. When Then She Was Gone showed up on NetGalley last month, I immediately requested it and added it to my reading queue for April. I really find myself enamored with Jewell's characters, plots, and settings, so much that I've added ten of her other books to my TBR and hope to read a few more later this year.Domestic drama is the best sub-genre to describe this book. A 15-year-old girl goes missing, resulting in her family falling apart. Ten years later, her mother finds new love (divorced her ex-husband though they still remain friends) and slowly learns of connections to her missing child who was feared dead. The description in the Goodreads or Amazon summary says it all, so I don't need to add to it here. The book alternates between \"Then\" and \"Now\" to tell the story of what happened to Ellie, who kidnapped and hurt her, what the new love interest for Ellie's mother, Laurel, has to say transpired over all the years, and where things really fell apart. This book read itself. I intended to spend 90 minutes reading on a weekend afternoon to have a relaxing break from some outside chores. Three (3) hours later, I'd finished it. The book was so good that I lost track of time and read so quickly, everything just disappeared, but I was absolutely connected and attached to every part of the story and characters. Jewell clearly knows how to lead readers on a path where investment is deep and shock is wide. I'm sure a few readers will sideways glance at a couple of plot twists, and I can understand it. You have to suspend a tiny bit of your disbelief or questions as to how the kidnapping was truly pulled off. But it's fiction and it's part of a story and that's why it worked -- the writing supports it and carries you off into a world you cannot leave.I normally figure out what's really going on. But Jewell uses some clever disguises regarding timing that make it complicated, and when you do figure it out about 2/3 of the way thru, you have to stop for a few minutes and think about all the repercussions, Then, it all adds up. How did I miss it??? But for me, that's what makes an incredibly gifted writer. One who transports you into the story that you forget to try to solve it because you're just so stunned by its beauty. I can't wait to pick up another Jewell book this summer. So many to choose from! But this one gets at least 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Totally enjoyable .....As a couple of friends said - (Diane & Esil) - they were pretty sure \u2018what\u2019 happened to Ellie who had gone missing early in their reading \u2014 me too - but I didn\u2019t know \u2018why\u2019.

This happened in the first third of the book but...there was still much to discover. The author kept my interest by some very good storytelling, and by the way it was structured. Changing tenses and changing narators the fast pace continued, new discoveries, and the insidious darkness beneath, kept me turning pages.I have now read the last few books by this author and look forward to reading many more.

Ellie Mack went missing 10 years ago. Her mother, Laurel has never given up hope of finding her. Ellie was fifteen years old, full of life. The world was, in fact, her oyster. No one knew what happened to Ellie. The police have never found a trace of her. My interest was piqued from the very beginning. My breath caught in my throat - nerves jangled. Now, Laurel Mack\u2019s life is very different: her marriage fell apart years ago and her relationship with her remaining children is tenuous. Somehow, she meets Floyd - a devastatingly handsome man and she is immediately swept off her feet. Then Laurel is introduced to his little girl: Poppy, and she is dumbfounded to discover that Poppy bears a striking resemblance to Ellie, her Ellie. Of course, this isn\u2019t possible - it\u2019s a coincidence, right? And if it\u2019s not, what ever does it mean? Laurel begins questioning everything and those questions take her on a dangerous path, one she never envisioned. Can you feel the hair on the back of your neck stand up? Mine did.

After finishing this book I really had to wait a few days to sort of \u201cSETTLE ME DOWN\u201d as this mystery touched some very delicate feelings in me, more so than her first two books. Call me a snob but in my experience with thrillers, it has been hard to find many with the combination of great writing, past and present POV\u2019s that flow seamlessly together, and create emotions that well up inside of you and really stay with you. The main character in this novel is Laurel who has three children, two of whom are daughters whom she adores and they have great family dynamics. On a seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d day, her youngest daughter Ellie leaves for the library and never returns. There are no clues or hints to explain her disappearance and the police keep coming up empty handed. Laurel however still feels that her daughter is alive even though many years go by. It is hard to read the despair and feelings of inadequacies that the family members encounter and at one point it was a little hard for me to continue. Not because the plot was stagnant but quite the opposite, it was speeding along so fast and with an outcome that seemed too terrible that I just had to stop, just until the next day when I furiously turned the pages to find out the mystery.I won\u2019t go over the plot, I rarely do that, you all read the blurbs on the books I know you do! This is a true thriller to me as it contains an extremely deviant sociopath who is so mentally ill that it\u2019s painful to read her thoughts. You know where it\u2019s going but you just can\u2019t stop it.I love strongly character driven novels, including thrillers and that is what Ms. Jewell does so so well. I became invested in the feelings of Eliie\u2019s mother, and as a mother of four daughters, I wanted so badly for things to somehow turn out that this poor woman didn\u2019t have to continue without knowing what happened to her missing beautiful, intelligent, golden girl!If you loved \u201cGirls in the Garden\u201d and \u201cI Found You\u201d you will definitely love this book.

Her beautiful daughter, Ellie, disappeared one day on her way to her weekly lesson with her math tutor. There is no evidence, no clues, no remnants of a missing Ellie even after ten years. The police have leaned toward labeling this case as a teenage runaway. Nothing could be farther than the truth in Laurel's eyes.As time passes, the deep love imprint of the missing Ellie has left its mark on the Mack family. Laurel and her husband, Paul, have divorced. Grief sometimes forces a wedge between individuals who are saturated in its unspeakable sorrow. Their now adult children, Jake and Hanna, have carved out separate lives that interact briefly with their parents now and then.

But she doesn't allow you to sit with this reality too long in your lap. The chapters will occasionally revert from the present to \"Then\" as the rough edges of Ellie's story come to light. There will also be moments of celebration as Laurel slowly removes layer upon layer of her self-imposed isolation and begins a life with Floyd.As readers, we will note that Lisa Jewell tends to stretch the borders of reality in some scenes. But the main thread is captivating and it tugs at us to delve deeper into this story. As in a fine-tuned musical piece, there will be quite the crescendo at the end even though you may have a sense of where all this is leading. High interest, unusual characters, breadcrumbs into the fire will all make this a must read when you long for something to take you out of the doldrums. Looking forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Carter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter", "userReview": "Over the past few years there seems to have been a huge saturation in the market of psychological mystery type thrillers. Or maybe that's just me thinking this, simply because I've bought or requested viaNetGalley, many books of this type. Then She Was Gone, is another one to add to this genre.There's nothing much I can add really, the description is easily available to read. The narrative goes back and forth between the present day and the past, and is told from the perspective of four different characters, at different times throughout the book, although mainly from the pov of Laurel and Ellie. As a reader it's not at all difficult to keep on track, the perspectives don't keep changing continually, but rather gently weave in and out. Other than that, Then She Was Gone, is an enjoyable suspenseful read, filled with characters with shady secrets and questionable pasts. There are many emotional parts with plenty of moving moments. The book has some twists and turns, but I think I may have read so many books of this genre, that I was able to see where the story was going. However, I shouldn't let this detract from the fact this is a well written book, it certainly didn't drag, each time i picked my kindle up I was looking forward to reading it. It just wasn't \"omg that was original\" or \"well I never saw that coming\".I don't mean to put a downer on the book, I do think it's well worth a read, even if you have read a lot of this genre of late. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for more books written by Lisa Jewell. The ending is particularly touching and I defy anyone to not be moved. With thanks to NetGalley and Random House U.K, Cornerstone for the opportunity to read this ARC in return for an honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Brenda - Traveling Sister ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10841164-brenda---traveling-sister", "userReview": "Norma and I were lost in the dark and light earthy lush coulee with five of our Traveling Sisters reading Then She Was Gone. We all really enjoyed it and it lead to a great discussion amongst us. We all were immediately drawn into this intriguing story right from start to the rewarding and very satisfying ending that we all loved. We all agreed Lisa Jewell brilliantly creates a well-written and perfectly paced story to create a good, intriguing suspenseful story. Just at the right time, she reveals enough of the story to create suspense and then gives us understanding and insight into her characters rather than creating a shocky twisty story. She balances the darkest well by adding just the right amount of disturbing and creepy along with the insight into the well-developed characters\u2019 emotions, creating emotional layers to the characters along with layers to the plot.Some of us have read a few of Lisa Jewell's books and loved them all and the rest of us will be looking into reading more of her books. For me I have read a few and have a couple to review. We all highly recommend Then She Was Gone.Publishing Date: April 17, 2018Thank you, NetGalley, Atria Books, and Lisa Jewell for a copy to read and review.

The story follows Laurel Mack, though it is really told from multiple POVs (of which I tend to be a big fan). Her teenage daughter went missing ten years ago, and when she meets a man, Floyd, whose nine-year-old daughter is the image of Laurel's missing child, Ellie, and she understandably cannot let the mystery go. Laurel is amicably divorced, but has a strained relationship with her two other children, fixated on her daughter, Ellie, her favorite, she has to admit to herself.Initially, I wasn't sure about Laurel. She came across as a little cold, but after a while, I felt this was mostly a defense mechanism, because she was just so shattered by what had happened to her family. I really liked the multiple view points from which the story is told, jumping back in time as well, which Jewell did very smoothly. The story is fast-paced, though the action is slow and meticulous. I will admit, I guessed the revelation about half-way through, but that may simply be because I read a lot of crime fiction and it is getting harder and harder to find a book in this genre with a truly shocking twist. That being said, I happily continued reading, eager to know if my guesses were correct.Jewell has a style that makes you feel immediately involved in the story. Her writing is sometimes chatty, but never banal, and I think she has made the shift from chick-lit author to crime fiction writer very nicely. Her books are some of the best domestic suspense I have read, and would surely appeal to fans of Liane Moriarty or Sophie McKenzie.

The story is told in parts and changes the point of view between various characters along the way going between the past and the present day.Laurel Mack had the perfect family with her husband and three beautiful children until one day when her youngest daughter Ellie didn\u2019t come home. An overachiever Ellie was not the type of daughter to run away but that is exactly what the police concluded after months of searching for the teen.Ten years later Laurel\u2019s marriage had fallen apart as she took Ellie\u2019s disappearance pretty hard and pushed the rest of her family away. When meeting a new man Ellie still isn\u2019t sure about getting back out there but with the two both sharing a loss in their lives Laurel decides to take a chance.For me there is nothing more compelling than the story of a missing child and Lisa Jewell has taken that and turned it into so much more. For me this was almost a perfect read with the exception of part two which seemed to drag a bit but even then I still wanted to know how it would all turn out. Never would I have imagined where this one would go as the twists and turns were found all throughout the book. When finished I\u2019d definitely recommend this one to all the thriller fans out there.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "4 high starsI find that Lisa Jewell\u2019s books are always a cut above the spate of books with \u201cGone\u201d, \u201cGirl\u201d and \u201cLies\u201d in their titles. For one, she can really write. And also her main characters are not breathless naive young woman, but usually middle aged women or men with recognizable emotions. I\u2019ve now read four of her books, and Then She Was Gone is one of my favourites.The story focuses on the effects of the disappearance of Laurel\u2019s daughter, Ellie. The story is told in two timelines and from a few points of view. Mostly the story focuses on Laurel approximately 10 years after Ellie\u2019s disappearance, but parts of the narrative are from Ellie\u2019s perspective at the time she disappeared. Ten years on, Laurel still struggles with Ellie\u2019s disappearance but she is feeling emotionally buoyant enough to start a new relationship with Floyd, who has a lovely daughter Poppie. Somehow \u2014 I\u2019m not telling how to avoid spoilers \u2014 this leads Laurel down the road to figuring out what happened to Ellie.I must admit that I guessed much of the mystery early on. That\u2019s not because the plot is predictable, but because Jewell does a lot of foreshadowing. But I thought that Jewell did a fantastic job with the characters, especially Laurel. She is smart, devastated but functional, equally self aware and self deluded, at times funny, and doggedly determined to find out what happened to Ellie. For those who worry about gruesomeness, there are no gruesome details but, on an existential level, given what we find out about what happens to Ellie, this one is not for the faint of heart.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "Whoa! This book may have started out a bit slow but like all good roller coasters of the psychological thriller variety, it sky rocketed me into a mysterious family drama that ended up giving me whiplash with as many surprising revelations it held around every twist and turn. I hope with all my heart this situation is far fetched because I couldn't cope if I thought the main jaw-drop of this book could actually happen. Then She Was Gone is a crazy train of fairly unlikable characters in my opinion. You just know there is something off about each of them and that is Lisa Jewell's talent right there. Building these characters, allowing you to give each the benefit of the doubt, then finally turning them into someone redeemable or absolutely horrific. This book was mysterious, sad, crazy, but thoroughly engaging. If you are a fan of Lisa Jewell or if you have never heard of her before, Then She Was Gone needs to be on your list! Check it out!!My favorite quote:\"I remember being twenty-one and thinking that my personality was a solid thing, that me was set in stone, that I would always feel what I felt and believe what I believed.

A husband who loses a wife is called a widower. A child who loses his parents is called an orphan. There is no word for a parent who loses a child. That's how awful the loss is.\" (Ronald Reagan)As the above quote states there is no word for a parent who loses a child. There is no consolation one can give that will ever make up for that loss. The loss of a child is devastating but the loss of a child without knowing the why or the wherefore must be a pain that is worse than any other.In this story we learn that the Mack family has lost their daughter, Ellie, ten years ago. She was there one day a bright lovely fifteen year old with everything going for her and then she was gone without a trace. The family falls apart, divorce, separation from feelings, the drifting away from family that often accompanies a loss such as this. Who do we blame, how can this be, and where is our daughter, our sister, our shining star?Laurel meets a man in a coffee shop and seems to connect with him. They date, he brings her eventually to his home where Laurel meets his young daughter, Poppy. Strange as it may seem Poppy resembles Ellie. Is this a figment of Laurel's mind or is there some something that lurks in the back of Laurel's mind, some itch that she feels something is just not right, things are uneven.The story continues and as events are revealed we find that Laurel's initial feelings hold a secret that has been buried for quite some time. Will this secret bring Ellie back? While I did like the story and it held my interest throughout, I did feel that there was quite a large element of predictability to the tale. However, what must be said about how a family often falls apart after this type of disaster is ever so relevant and important.
