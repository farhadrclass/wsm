Which is odd, considering I went into this with very low expectations. I read World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War when it first came out and enjoyed it. I figured I'd at least enjoy this funny book as a mild distraction. But it left me with an overall feeling of meh. I don't regret reading it, but I could've done something better with my time. Like, say, trimming my toenails or shaving my ass.It was almost like an episode of Ancient Aliens about the undead. I'm not saying it was zombies. But it was zombies.In summation: I will not remember this comic in a week. The artwork was great but something about the way the stories were told got on my nerves. The book was $17.00 when it came out. I got it for a quarter at my local thrift store. I think I paid about a quarter of what it's worth.Final Judgment: Far more boring than World War Pitt."}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/325004-don", "userReview": "Reading this was enjoyable enough, but the more I've thought about it afterward, the more annoyed I've become.First, there isn't any new material here; all the material is taken directly from the Zombie Survival Guide. This in itself isn't terrible - it's just not what I had been expecting. But the stories are still as interesting as they were the first time around, and the art does make the incidents more immediate.What's entirely irritating, however, is the publisher's approach to the book. This is billed as a graphic novel, but Max Brooks is the only listed creator. On the cover, on the spine ... and even on the title page. The artist (Ibraim Roberson) is listed on the bottom of the back cover, but inside he is only credited in tiny type on the publication info page. This is particularly heinous because, given the above note about no new content, it's clear that Max Brooks had little if anything to do with the actual creation of this book. In other words, Ibraim not only drew the entirety of the book, but he also had the not insignificant task of adapting the tales in the first place - as opposed to drawing from a script in which Max had already done the work of figuring out which bits to keep, which bits to show, and which bits to excise. (Unless there was another, uncredited creator doing the adapting work. Which may very well be.)The difference between an illustrated novel and a graphic novel is that you could, theoretically, take the illustrations out of the former and still have a complete work, while if you take the art out of a graphic novel you don't; this is one of the many reasons why graphic novels prominently list both the writer and artist of a work as its creators, and not just the writer.Clearly, Three Rivers Press doesn't get that. Or maybe they just don't care."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "As a big fan of Brooks' World War Z and Zombie Survival Guide, I was really looking foward to this graphic novel that tells of zombie attacks through history. The stories are interesting and once again Brooks' writing shows that he's spent waaaayyy too much time thinking about tactics to fight off zombies. If there ever is a zombie apocalypse, I vote we put Brooks in charge of our defenses.But this is short and sweet, and didn't fill my craving for another Brooks zombie book. Plus, I think Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead series has the market cornered on great zombie comics. Fun to read, but just made me want a follow-up to World War Z in novel form."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa", "userReview": "I find it very distracting when a comic is written where sentences . . . ellipse through two pages . . . and it's only one thought . . . that's trying to be . . . conveyed. Supposedly this adds to the gravity, but I'm not buying it. Since I've been waiting for this book since 2008, I was hoping it'd be a little longer."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "3.5 Stars-OK... I really loved The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection From the Living Dead & the audio performance of World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War and I have plans to read World War Z next month (since the audio is abridged... I know, I know! Blasphemy. Yes, but it's awesome still. It's the exception. Trust me. Just look at the cast list.) and so I thought that I would round out the Max Brooks trio on my bookcase and pick this up. I enjoyed it for the most part, and I think that the artwork was great. I liked the stark simplicity of the stories regarding each historical attack, but there were times when I wished for a little explanation of what we were seeing in the frame and how it related to other frames, etc. These are just pen and ink drawings, and sometimes I felt that a little explanation or context (\"Meanwhile, overhead...\", etc) would connect the imagery into a cohesive \"story\". It wouldn't have taken very much, but I felt it would have benefited from those small additions.Regarding the artwork, this really is my favorite style - sketchy, not overly-processed drawings. I loved one scene showing hordes coming from afar, and they were just the barest subtle outline of a shape - but it gets the point across. I love that. But I do have one complaint - and this is really why I can't give this a higher rating. This is regarding the inconsistent way newly-turned zombies were depicted. I get that with this 90% wordless medium, the artist would want to differentiate between swarthy, dirty, rugged menfolk and the undead, and so would take a little liberty. The easiest way to do that is to \"monsterize\" the zombies. I'd have been OK with that if ALL of the zombies were shown that way, and if that fit in with Brooks' canon, but they weren't and it doesn't. Part of the danger of the zombie virus is that it turns people and those around them don't yet recognize the danger because other than a bite, they look perfectly normal. So there is one part where a woman's body is found bound and frozen, and some men take her inside, where she thaws out. The men are baffled, because she should be dead, but isn't. Then she starts nomming one of them and they kill her for good. The whole time, she looked normal, if a little deranged. Certainly NOT rotting or ragged. But the man that she bit comes back looking like he clawed his way out of a shallow grave after spending a couple months decomposing in the summer heat. It was just really inconsistent and slightly aggravating. Otherwise, I really liked this little book. I don't regret the purchase, and would definitely recommend it for those who like gory zombie graphic novels, because it was that. I'm just... kinda finicky about artwork. I don't apologize for that, dammit! ...I'm sorry!

This is a sort of journalistic reportage with episodes about the zombie phenomenon in human history: manifestation, distribution, transmission and in many cases instruction on how to stop it (in fact removal of all infected). Funny, graphically well done, but the short number of pages saved it from boredom. A little longer and it would be too repetitive. Nice, I think I'll try to read other stories of the author."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/361125-greg", "userReview": "This was a broadly amusing short read that attempts to create a pseudo-history of recorded outbreaks of the solanium virus and the resultant attacks by zombies on the living at various locations around the globe in the past 60,000 years. Illustrated in black-and-white, zombies are shown in varying degrees of decay, gore and savageness, in contrast to their usually startled and horrified victims! I liked linkages between zombies and aspects of actual Romano-British and Egyptian archaeology, but from the horror perspective, the idea of the crew and prisoners of a 17th-century slave ship being infected with the zombie-inducing virus was, perhaps, the most horrific story as the slaves could not escape their fate chained below decks. Also horrific was the story of a murderous Cossack scouting party in late 16th-century Siberia whose own cannibalistic behaviour met its match in a certain Siberian community.However, I was a little disappointed about the research put into some of the historical settings. It would be more likely for anatomically modern humans and Neandertals to have been using composite spears (made from a wooden shaft, a stone spearhead and the binding used to haft the head to the shaft) rather than just sharpened sticks to kill fish (World Prehistory: A Brief Introduction, p. 82; The Origin of Our Species, p. 127), while nets and fish traps are also likely to have been used c. 60,000 years ago. The story set in St Lucia, in 1862, when this West Indian island was a British colony, was wildly inaccurate on many points. As slavery had been abolished throughout the British empire in 1833, it could not still have been present in Lucia in 1862, making the story's ending impossible. There were other anachronisms - the militia and troops were shown wearing tricornes, a type of hat that was out of fashion by c. 1800, as was the powdered periwig (except for the British legal profession). The Union Jack would have been the flag used by the British navy while the tricolour would've been used by the French (even though it was then an empire) in 1862 (the flag of England and the fleur-de-lis for Bourbon France are shown instead). Perhaps the author had intended to set the story a century earlier or that the illustrator, Ibraim Roberson, had confused the 18th and 19th centuries. An outdated cannon is also later on shown to be used at a fort garrisoned by the French Foreign Legion in Algeria in 1893, and I'm not convinced that a fort would be left completely out of contact for three whole years - if you don't hear from a fort after a certain time you would surely send people to find out what was wrong! It's also unlikely that a fort controlled by the French Republic would've been named after a king (Louis Phillippe) who had been deposed to make way for a republican government in 1848.Overall, the book was fun but it would've been much better if it had been written to offer an alternative explanation for certain historical events or practices (as was done in the stories set in Roman Britain and ancient Egypt). The guillotine of Revolutionary France would have been very effective at dispatching captured zombies, for example, while the 14th-century Black Death may've involved something darker than the bubonic plague...."}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "This is a companion of sorts to Brooks's Zombie Survival Guide, which I seem to remember reading years ago. The basic concept is to briefly cover, in graphic novel format, a series of outbreaks occurring throughout history, starting in the stone age and ending in modern America. The narration is written exactly as you would expect if it were actually presenting a series of historical events. Apparently, this was all originally written for and published in the original Survival Guide.The art is by Ibraim Roberson. I had a hard time finding his name anywhere on the book, and eventually found it in eensy wee type on the bottom of the back cover. Considering that this was pre-existing material that was, it seems, entirely adapted by Roberson, it's a bit of a ripoff to hide his name as much as they did. (I have heard that later editions have corrected that by properly crediting him.) That said, I love his art and thought it was a perfect fit here. I loved the grayscale sketchiness of it, and the level of detail was just right. Roberson knows when to pull back a bit. There are a few inconsistencies in how the zombies were drawn, but that didn't bother me.It's a very, very quick read, because there simply isn't much content. It would have been nice if there'd been a few more stories, or if some of them had been longer. Most of them can be read in just a couple of minutes. Enjoyable enough, but there's just not enough there for me to rate it any higher."}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "1.5 stars. Well that was just beyond disgusting. I can handle a bit of gore, but seriously this was just too much. I don't think I want to eat anything for the coming hour or so. *shivers*The art is decent, though not really my kind of art. I am more more of the refined kind of art, not the action/harsh kind of art. The story and the history parts were really interesting and that is also why I rate this book a 1.5 stars. That is the only thing I enjoyed, though it scared me to bits. It was gruesome, it was horrendous, but it was also interesting. And history is often not fun or happy, so I am used to it being horrendous. But yeah, the gore.. Dear Lord, there was so much gore and also enough nakedness. I felt uncomfortable quite a lot of times. Well thanks to this book I will putting his other 2 books on hold.

Written by Max Brooks but illustrated by Ibraim Roberson, these twelve short stories left me wanting more. The stories began chronologically, with the first story set in Africa in 60,000 BC. The second story was my favorite, for it made a connection between zombies and explaining why ancient mummies that have been discovered have had their brains pulled out. The remaining stories criss-cross the world and move forward in time, with the last three being in the modern era (since the 1940's). While the art work was excellent, and the stories if told in isolation are interesting, it strained credibility that there have been multiple zombie outbreaks that haven't garnered world wide attention and been eradicated while the threat was small. I felt WWZ was plausible enough, but these stories were not."}, {"userName": "Dimitris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897834-dimitris", "userReview": "Ah..

While the first attack spanned several pages, the second one wasn't really even an 'attack' at all. It was more the discovery of the virus and speculation. The rest seem to vary in length, and went from moderately interesting to skim-worthy and back again several times. I don't know what I think of this. On one hand, I loved the art. Ibraim Roberson does an amazing job, making monochrome images that feel like they could leap off the page at times. There\u2019s one particular panel of a zombie, frozen solid in the snow, hand outstretched, which is disturbing and fantastic all at the same time. On the other hand, it takes a bit of the fun away from zombie attacks if you don't at least get a splash of red every now and then! Basically, I loved the art, but just didn't feel like it suited the subject.The synopsis says \"Scripted by the world's leading zombie authority, Max Brooks, \"Recorded Attacks\" reveals how other eras and cultures have dealt with-and survived-the ancient viral plague.\" They mean that. Literally. It seems like its just scenes of battle, interspersed with the occasional \"So maybe they did x because...\" I knew I was going to get to see zombie attacks \u2013 and I was cool with that \u2013 but I thought I\u2019d get a little bit more. I was wrong.The graphic novel itself only seems to take up about 2/3rds of the book. (It\u2019s sometimes hard to tell when reading in a browser versus reading on the Kindle.) The rest of it is advertisements for things related to the Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z. Readers are invited to download the Zombie Survival Guide Scanner app, given the chance to click on links that will let them read excerpts from the books, and finally treated to a several page excerpt from Zombie Survival Guide. And then another several page excerpt from World War Z.My final judgement? This was a cash grab, nothing more, nothing less. The illustrations are amazing, but everything else was lackluster.
