The parts where London was being destroyed by the beast gave me chills, the description of the \"nothing\" that was left after its destruction was eeiry and horrifying.Sadly though, just like in the first book, the characters didn't really feel anything special to me, apart from maybe Rilke, who was just delightfully crazy. I was really looking forward to characters and relationships similar to the ones in the author's Furnace series, but here those parts felt kind of pushed aside in favour of the more disturbing happenings. But after about the middle of this book the friendship parts were a bit more pronounced, it definitely played a huge part in defeating the monster, and the ending went in the right direction. I loved how the author ended this series, definitely a touching and heartwarming choice after so much horror. I enjoyed this duology, Alexander Gordon Smith just has a way with words; his stories suck you in, his scenes just feel crystal clear and you can picture practically everything that is going on. (Even when you don't particularly want to, because now you can't look out your window in fear of the possibility of a blackhole-monster. oops.)"}, {"userName": "Lorre", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6349980-lorre", "userReview": "The Storm was a realy good ending to this duology.Our group of teenagers and kids have been through some horrors in the first book and their situation doesn't get any better in this second book. It becomes very clear what they have to do and it is beyond frightening... but it's their only option. I was constantly frightened for them and was wondering how they would ever make it out of this alive.The ending was a bittersweet one... happy and sad at the same time."}], "description": "Imagine if one day, without warning, the entire human race turns against you.Every single person you meet becomes a bloodthirsty, mindless savage, hell-bent on killing you - and only you.
