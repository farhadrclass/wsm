Since this time I have read all her newer books, and each one is unique and engaging. The characters begin their journey here. There are so many stories  within this charming read and great takeaways. Each character brings a unique part to the novel \u2013each of the characters is dealing with demons of their own and the soothing seas of this quaint beach town of Stony Point help them all face their fears and begin healing.A story of real life  and connections, friendships, family, loss, secrets, regrets, and love. A captivating story which was hard to put down. You will fall in love with the characters and the writing style of seamlessly connecting the past with the present.Maris is a fashion designer from Chicago who travels back to her favorite beach town to tie up loss ends from her father\u2019s death while considering a marriage proposal from a corporate attorney in Chicago.Jason  is still guilt-ridden after his brother\u2019s death-a successful architect who returns home to this same beach town to deal with his demons. Could he have a life with Maris-something started years ago? Eva, her oldest friend,  is someone to whom Maris feels a very close connection. The others, like Lauren, Kyle, and especially Jason Barlow, whose life has tragically taken its toll on him....their connection also tugs at her, and as she extends her time at the beach, she begins to believe that there is more in this town for her. This sea environment is inspiring her as she completes her designs. While Eva is looking for her real mother, Maris finds out she has a sister out there somewhere, Lauren and Kyle fight for a life outside of Neil who died in accident years ago. This book holds so many mysteries and lives begin to come together. Each of the friends has a secret they are carrying around from their past. One by one, they reveal the tragedy that keeps them from the life they are seeking. Life throws us curves and sometimes what does not kill us makes us stronger.  My top New England author! An avid fan; everything the author writes is brilliantly crafted and compelling, and the characters linger long after the book ends.  Highly recommend,  along with Joanne\u2019s other novels, Whole Latte Life, Snowflakes and Coffee Cakes, True Blend, The Denim Blue Sea, Snow Deer and Cocoa Cheer, Beach Blues, and Wishing on Snowflakes.  You have to read them all. It is like visiting special friends. All 5 star winners.  Now, please: Wishing for a Hallmark TV series!

I loved the characters - a group of friends that either live or summered at Stoney Point Beach with an exception of one who died a few years back. Neil Barlow still makes his presence known though. Eva is looking for her birth parents - still. Kyle and Lauren are having trouble - he's unemployed again, but finds part time work at the local diner and Lauren is unhappy in their marriage. Jason Barlow has moved back to Stoney Point and has survivor's guilt. Maris is in Stoney Point to close her father's house and estate. She'll find more secrets than she wants to and maybe she'll stop running from her life.A little predictable, maybe. But I chuckled and shed a couple of tears here and there.

I thought this is book was an easy summer read but it was very short on creativity. It was painfully predictable. I also found the characters to be cliched as well as her \"come back to your roots\" story unoriginally done. There are a lot if books out there about finding oneself at the beach, dealing with past mistakes, and such. It must be hard to stand out.

The writing is gorgeous, the setting both soothing and provocative, the characters and their situations haunting. Believable, too. So believable you're bound to see something of yourself in one or more of the Stony Point crowd. And that familiarity is not always comforting \u2014 though it certainly does make for an alluring read.Settling into this story is like wading into a cool ocean on a sunny day \u2014 you just can't resist the invitation. Even when you discover a surprise or two underfoot, still you move on into deeper waters, not quite ready to turn back to the hot grit of summer sand. And that's the situation Maris finds herself in. She has a successful life waiting for her back in Chicago, but the Stony Point pull of memories and possibilities tug like a stubborn undertow. The most tempting of the possibilities is Jason, the friend who has changed the most since Maris moved to Chicago. Maris and Jason never shared more than a few kisses, but she has always been drawn to him. Now he's a wounded man, both physically and emotionally, but Maris envies him\u2014why can't she be as brave as he is, doing what it takes to get the life he wants, despite the guilt he can't shake? And that's the compelling core of Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans \u2014 the choices we make (or not), and the connections we make (or break) as a result.She walks first to the front porch doorway, sipping her coffee. Except for an early jogger passing by, the street outside looks still, yet liquid somehow, like a watercolor painting. Shadows and light softly blend in the greens of the maple trees, the blues of the sky. Summer quiet follows behind the jogger's footsteps, touching upon the porch and its comfortable old white wicker furniture. Above the windows, a high shelf holding brass hurricane lanterns and starfish and pale pink conch shells reaches around the room. Spiky cattails rise from the large clay floor vase in the corner, standing against the crisp white paneling. Outside, scarlet red geraniums and pretty petunias spill from the flower boxes Maris filled weeks ago.But seashells and white wicker and summer flowers can't keep complications away. She sits in a chair on the porch, cupping her coffee. This complication is a new one. No man has ever kept her from her work before. Her career had become a shell, curving around her like the intricate whorls of the conch, shielding her, until now.DeMaio tells the story through multiple points of view and with the help of an occasional flashback. I did find myself disoriented once or twice, but it didn't take me long to become thoroughly invested in every single character. The couples, too \u2014 I kept changing my mind about which was my favorite, and fretted over which pair would endure. What one husband did for his wife, to symbolize what she means to him and what he hopes their future will embrace, had me in tears and I thought, Now that's romance.Guilt, regrets, discoveries, realizations, old wants, tragedy, forgiveness, recognition, bitterness, competition, hunger, dreams \u2014 so many layers to savor. The rhythm of DeMaio's prose echoes the cadence of the sea that inspires the story's imagery and pace and her characters' choices. Like DeMaio's debut, Whole Latte Life, this Stony Point story will entangle and entrance you."}, {"userName": "Literary  Chanteuse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3731945-literary-chanteuse", "userReview": "Upon the death of her father, Maris returns to Stony Point and the summer cottage of her childhood.

I read a review at some time on Laurel Rain's blog - one of the books Joanne DeMaio wrote and I decided to try one. Now this is the second book I have read by this author.Plot It is set in Stony Point, New England and is the story of three women and three men. Each with their own life challenges at this point in time. Maris keeps taking on then off her engagement ring. Eva longs to know her real birth mother, Lauren doesn't want what she has. Jason is still dealing with grief, Kyle can't seem to make his wife happy and Matt is annoyed by Eva's addictive search for her mother.What Appeals to me? It is beautifully written, the seaside is very much present. Yes its a beach read but it is so much more as the characters struggle with their issues. Yet there are strong supportive ties among them. And there is some healing.And so... There are more books about these characters - at least two, maybe three so I am very keen to continue on and read the next one The Denim Blue Sea.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7797263-janice", "userReview": "I ended up caring about the characters by the end, but a lot of the descriptions of jeans design was too hokey for me.

Given the following description, how could I resist?\"What do a denim designer, a cherished New England beach and a dusty reel of an old home movie have in common? All get the story brewing in 'Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans.' Returning again to the sandy shores of Long Island Sound, the story follows a group of beach friends reuniting after a decade apart. But can these friends ever be who they were to each other all those summers ago? Now one of this circle is dead; another unemployed and struggling in a tenuous marriage; another regretting a fateful decision; while one is missing a mother, ever seeking a connection she longs for. To the backdrop of shingled cottages and a boarded-up beach hangout, to the soundtrack of whispering lagoon grasses and a vintage jukebox, 'Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans' asks if we can really design our own lives or if our fate lies somewhere in the stars.\"This book did not disappoint. When Chicago designer Maris Carrington returns to her childhood home on the coast of Connecticut to settle her father's estate, she reconnects with old friends, sharing old memories and making new ones. Then she discovers a shattering family secret; her search for answers keeps her at the from returning home as planned. As time goes by, she finds herself questioning everything about the life and relationship waiting for her; her old friendships deepen and she begins to succumb to the allure of the beach, finding inspiration for her denim clothing line in the sand, water and air. But when her Chicago boyfriend proposes marriage and she receives her dream job offer in New York City, she is forced to make a decision that will affect the course of the rest of her life, as well as the lives of those around her.With its great cast of characters with stories of their own, beautiful beach setting, and masterful weaving of plot and subplots, Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans will keep you turning pages until the very end and wishing for more.

It jumped around, there were too many shallow characters, and far too many words for the bits and pieces of real storyline. The denim design descriptions were cheesy and based on an idealistic view of what fashion designers do--not realistic. I agree with \"Amy's\" review from 7/14:\"I'm not sure what the writer was trying to achieve with this over written novel and it's easy to see why it was self published, rather than commercially published. The bare bones of the story, protagonist Maris returning to Connecticut after her fathers death, reconnecting with old friends who are also going through mid life \"crises\" is a solid, albeit predictable story.

They are real people with real problems.Overall, I thought the author did a great job in storytelling and bringing the readers right into the atmosphere of Stony Point.

The group of high school friends all of which still live in the same community except for Maris, who has returned to attend her father's funeral & settle his estate. With Maris' return, the group of friends is faced with memories & how they effect the present.

That is very first word that came to mind after I finished Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans by Joanne DeMaio. This is the second book I have had the pleasure of reading by Ms. DeMaio and let me tell you I enjoyed it just as much as the last. As I was reading this story the descriptions of the beach and the water are so detailed that I swore I heard the waves crashing on shore and felt the sand between my toes. Not only can Ms. DeMaio transport us to the beach, she has created characters that are memorable, charismatic, compelling, and Personable. I wouldn't mind sitting down with these folks for a visit. This is another one of those very emotional books that takes you along for the ride. This story revolves around a group of friends that knew each when they were young. It is a nice story of a reunion of friends that still have a connection all these years late. Maris Carrington has returned to her hometown to take care of her fathers estate. While she is cleaning and packing she finds questions that she has to answer before she goes home. Maris has some life decisions to make and longs for some time at the beach. She decides to extend her stay and try to work out her life. She meets up with some old friends while at the beach. She starts her search to uncover the mystery she longs to understand. I really liked Maris she is s strong, independent woman that I truly admired. Eva is Maris best friend and has been for years, she helps Maris find a cottage by the beach to rent for a few weeks. Eva has some family problems of her own. She longs to find her birth parents. She gets so caught up in her search that it's putting a strain on her husband and daughter. Eva has a wonderful husband Matt who feels a little abandon when Eva goes on her searches. Eva has a great life but feels like she is missing something. There is a huge mystery here that unfolds that left me speechless for a few moments. I'm not going to do tell you more then that. I'll let you read this wonderful story to find out for yourself. Jason Barlow went through a tremendous loss and is struggling to find his way back to life. He not only lost his brother but part of his leg as well. Jason is carrying a lot of emotional baggage around. Maris just may be the one person that can help him deal with his past. I really enjoyed learning Jason's story. If you have a box of kleenex handy you might want to grab it here when he's explaining what happened. I cried and hurt for him. His is a very emotional story. Matt & Lauren's marriage is suffering the impact of financial insecurity due to job loss and the economy. Matt is doing his best to keep his family a float but feels he's losing his wife and doesn't know how to get her back. Lauren has suffered a great loss and is living in the world of \"WHAT IF\" things had been different. These two pulled at my heart. What they need most is each other and their children. They just have find their way back together. Over all, this was one fabulously written story full of drama, friendship, love, a nice reunion, and lots of emotion. Ms. DeMaio has a wonderful way of telling a story that pulls you right in and touches you so deep you can feel the pain, the sorrow and the joy of each of her delightfully fascinating characters. I truly felt a bond with each character. I was so engrossed in this story that I hated to set the book down to do other things. I couldn't wait to pick it back up to see what in the world as going to happen next. Now that I have had the pleasure of reading two sensational stories by Ms. DeMaio, I will certainly be looking forward to her next release. I enjoy her unique writing style and way of transporting you to the beach with her phenomenal details. If you are looking for a great summer time read that you can read at the beach or just imagine you are at the beach, check this one out. But don't leave the Kleenex behind. I hope you find this book as enjoyable as I did. I had the delightful opportunity to read this book in exchange for my review. As always it has been a great pleasure to share my thoughts on this story with you."}, {"userName": "Mason", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908640-mason", "userReview": "Reconnecting with childhood friends can be both life-affirming and life-altering.Author Joanne DeMaio weaves a fascinating tale of friendship, loss, hope, loyalty, secrets, and finding one\u2019s self in BLUE JEANS AND COFFEE BEANS. She sets the story in the beautiful New England oceanside community of Stony Point. The ocean, with its mesmerizing waves and alluring sounds, plays a major roll in the story offering its calming and cleansing properties to those returning to visit.Maris Carrington, pursuing a denim design career in Chicago, has to return to the Connecticut coast to settle her late father\u2019s estate. While packing and cleaning, Maris discovers a forgotten home movie. After watching it, she decides to stay a bit long so she can reconnect with her best friend.

DeMaio has an eye for detail as she expertly describes the setting so that you can almost feel the ocean breeze on your face and feel the sand falling through your fingers.The story moves at a steady pace pulling readers in. The characters are well-developed and likable. They have flaws and are faced with daily challenges making them appear more realistic.

The last of her family, with only an aunt living worlds away in Italy, Maris finds herself overwhelmed by the effects inherited from her father, including a plucky German Shepherd and an 8mm role of film that will change her life completely. The only appropriate place to sort through these new revelations is Stony Point, the quaint beach town where she spent her adolescent summers; the town full of close friends and fond memories that she left behind for the big city. Time has gone on for them all, but Stony Point remains the same: it remains the youthful dream world of Maris, Jason, Eva, Matt, Neil, Kyle, Lauren, Vinny, and Paige. As the circle of friends find themselves drawn back to the beach they realize just how much has changed between them. Maris is torn between her steady Chicago life with her steady Chicago boyfriend and the gentle magic of life in Stony Point with the one who got away, wounded architect Jason. Jason is fighting his own battle, particularly a war of demons waging within him over the death of his brother Neil. Kyle and Lauren have found their marriage on the rocks. Eva just wants to know life as anything other than an orphan, a void that even her family with Matt hasn\u2019t filled. As they all come together at Stony Point, they\u2019ll find in each other the strength to face their troubles and overcome their obstacles.Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans has all the makings of a perfect summer read: the idyllic beach town, captured by beautiful descriptions; the cast of characters, each one endearing themselves to the reader; the poetic language of author Joanne DeMaio\u2019s writing style; the truly surprising plot-twists woven throughout a fascinating story. It absolutely fits the bill, much like DeMaio\u2019s first novel, the charming Whole Latte Life. But there\u2019s something bigger about Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans; it feels as though the author has graduated to a different level by taking on tougher life challenges and a fuller cast. DeMaio has a particular knack for her themes \u2013 namely friendship, family, romance, and the beach; combined with her terrific storytelling ability and the certain literary glow of her writing style, the novel leaves a decidedly impressive mark on its reader.As much as it struck me as being about a collection of deeply emotional themes, I also found it to be an interesting character study. Maris and her friends all have flaws, they\u2019re all very human, and the exposure of their imperfections struck me as very brave. At times I felt Eva\u2019s selfishness for not embracing the family she had, or I was exasperated with Lauren for pushing her husband away. If that were the extent of the characters\u2019 presence it would be easy for a reader to feel irritated by them, but there\u2019s a certain depth to them all that evokes the reader\u2019s empathy instead. Maris, despite having plenty of things to deal with herself, is perhaps the strongest of the cast, and the most relatable; it makes her an ideal focal point amid the numerous other characters and their stories. On that subject, with a group this large and with small plot points woven between them, it would be easy for anything to go awry \u2013 the author or the reader could lose interest, and the story could falter \u2013 but I found the novel to be solid, with every element taking deep root.A lot of things stood out to me, but especially the setting; DeMaio creates a dreamers\u2019 Connecticut that had me wanting to take off for the coast to discover my own Stony Point. While it is the recipe for a wonderful summer read, it\u2019s also not your average beachside book. Cozy and eloquent, Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans is a novel that truly feels like home.(Review \u00a9 Casee Marie, originally published on June 18, 2013 at LiteraryInklings.com. I received a copy of the book for the purpose of review.)"}, {"userName": "Susan (The Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516073-susan-the-book-bag", "userReview": "I read Joanne's first book, Whole Latte Life, when it came out and absolutely loved it. When I was contacted to see if I wanted to read her current one, Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans, I jumped at the chance.Once again, Joanne has woven a wonderful story of friends, relationships, and second chances. When Maris has to go back to Stony Point to take care of things after her father passes away, she sticks around for awhile to settle the estate. She uncovers a family secret while going through some of the things in the attic which really throws her for a loop and she digs until she finds some answers. While she is in Stony Point, the old group gets back together but it's really not the same. Being there makes her stop and think about what she has back home and to question if that is really what she wants or needs.I loved the setting of this story, a wonderful beach community with good friends all around. Blue jeans and coffee beans takes on a significant meaning in the book but it also made me think of the setting; the blue of the water and the brown of the sand. What a wonderful combination - relaxing on the beach in your jeans while enjoying some great coffee. And in my case, it would also include a good book. So there you go, this book made for such a wonderful escape. It made me smile to read the quick reference to the coffee shop in town, Whole Latte Life, which was the coffee shop in Joanne's other book. I loved the connection.Joanne has such a way with her writing, it is just beautiful. I marked several places as I was reading that were just amazing. Here is one section that really spoke to me ~~Time moves like the sea. She always felt so. Living right at the beach, time is placid and calm, soft waves of it rolling onto the shore of her days. One day follows the other, over and over, in a comfortable and reassuring was. No matter what she is doing, at any age, that awareness of the movement of the sea, and the waves of time, keeps her grounded.But as volatile as the sea can be, so too is any hour, any moment. Washing ashore, overtaking her very self with its insistence, with its forward movement rushing by the force of time. Waves of the past have that way of pulling at her, leaving her gasping and struggling to get her bearings, to breathe evenly.And another ~~Is Stony Point the place they forever return to for comfort, or is it the source of all their troubles?There are several other beautiful passage that I would love to quote here but it would give too much of the story away. And I can't do that. Just trust me when I say that this is such a wonderful story with great prose and characters you just come to fall in love with. And again, as in Whole Latte Life, Joanne includes creative people in her story so you get a lot of art and creative imagery, which appealed to my artistic side.I highly recommend Joanne's books and consider her one of my favorite authors now. I am excited to see what she writes next!"}, {"userName": "Valerie Hartman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7982656-valerie-hartman", "userReview": "\u201cSomeone once told her that the sea air and salt water are cleansing. They cure what ails you.\u201dMaris Carrington first met Eva Lane on vacation at Stony Point Beach as a girl. Reconnecting each summer until graduation, the women remain good friends into their thirties. Maris returns home to Connecticut following her father\u2019s death after twelve years away chasing a denim-designing career in Chicago. When on an impulse she decides to linger at the beach a few weeks and finalize her father\u2019s estate, Eva is thrilled. Together Maris and Eva decide to gather old beach friends for a July 4th party. Then Maris plants flower seedlings at her rented beach cottage, needing time to reflect on more than her father\u2019s death.Eva married Matt Gallagher and stayed close to home as a pregnant wife at eighteen. Though happy as a wife, mother and realtor, she was adopted and obsessively searches for her birth family. Local cottage renovator and architect Jason Barlow lost his brother Neil and part of his leg in a horrific motorcycle accident six years ago. Kyle Bradford struggles to keep his marriage together and his family local after another layoff in the steel industry. Meanwhile, his wife Lauren longs for a lost lover and dreams of an easier life of painting seascapes on driftwood by the beach.Told from the perspective of five characters, their stories wind through the regrets, memories, and distant hopes by the seaside of the Long Island sound. The novel, in keeping with its seaside setting, begins with a whirlwind of characters, present and past, and easing into a comfortable, soothing rhythm. Maris, Eva, Jason, Kyle and Lauren, though flawed, are highly relatable and complex people. Each faces either long-hidden family secrets or life-altering challenges.In both novels, DeMaio excels with themes featuring loss and redemption, lasting connections and unconditional love. In Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans, her poignantly told story weaves the power our past holds with hopeful healing by the sea. It is a sensory story where simple images spark strong memories: looking out the window in a childhood home, a weathered rowboat moored on the beach, and the train whistling past a summer hangout.Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans reconnects the beach and the past for old friends. In coming together they each find the solace and acceptance necessary to rebuild their lives, their relationships, their careers, and their connections to each other.\u201cThis beach has a way of casting its spell right through the windows under the guise of sea and salt, the call of the gulls, the sound of the waves.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "Designer Maris Carrington has returned to Connecticut to close up her family home after her father's death. Immersed in the memories that intrude as she searches boxes and watches an old home movie, she is reluctant to go back home to Chicago. And even though her boyfriend, Scott, has proposed marriage, she hasn't accepted; and while she knows that her \"real life\" is on hold, the pull of memories, her old friends at Stony Point, and the seduction of the beach life seem more real to her as time goes by.Eva, her oldest friend, is someone to whom she feels a very close connection. The others, like Lauren, Kyle, and especially Jason Barlow, whose life has tragically taken its toll on him....their connection also tugs at her, and as she extends her time at the beach, she begins to believe that there is more than nostalgia that is gripping her.Why do fleeting memories lull her away and threaten to change everything about her \"life sketch\"? What is the secret that seems to elude her, yet cannot be resolved? And while Maris is searching for more clues, Eva is also on her own quest. Adopted as a young child, she is now looking for her biological mother. Her search seemingly takes over her life, threatening her emotional well-being. How will the answers to these mysteries finally reveal themselves, and what ultimately astounding truths will change everything?Each character in \"Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans\" brought something special to the canvas, showing us the challenges of real life and the connections between friends, against the backdrop of a beautiful setting that called out to me as I read. There is so much more I could say, but lest I spoil the read, I will conclude with thoughts from the book, as Maris reflects on her love of the sea: \"Time moves like the sea. She always felt so. Living right at the beach, time is placid and calm, soft waves of it rolling onto the shore of her days. One day follows the other, over and over, in a comfortable and reassuring way. No matter what she is doing, at any age, that awareness of the movement of the sea, and of waves of time, keeps her grounded.\"A wonderfully captivating tale that kept me reading eagerly until the final page, this story of friendship, loss, secrets, and the regrets that can come with poor choices, is one that I won't soon forget.

When things were getting too tough or tempers were flaring I could tune out and \u201cescape\u201d into the pages of Blue Jeans and Coffee Beans. I absolutely loved Whole Latte Life so was excited when I was asked to review this one. I still can\u2019t believe this is only this author\u2019s second book. She as woven together the lives of the characters with the hand of a master.I think every reader will find they can identify will at least one of the characters. Eva, Matt, Kyle, Lauren, Jason and Maris are full, rich characters that all bring their own special qualities to this story of friendship, the choices made, love and regrets. Together they lean on each other and help each other heal, move forward and rebuild their lives. ?All the characters are extraordinary but Jason really touched my heart, maybe because we both have leg issues Truthfully he has been carrying a huge weight on his shoulders and seeing him start to deal with his misplaced guilt was empowering.The beach setting was a character in itself as so many answers were found just looking at the water and walking along the shoreline. I could smell the salt water and hear the surf and even find solace myself.This is a very moving story that takes you on an emotional roller coaster but is comfortable like your favorite pair of blue jeans. I was sad to reach the last page.

Everyone supports each other and helps them to deal with their issues.While Maris is the main character in this novel, I found myself looking for Jason, the friend dealing with guilt, throughout the story. His story line touched me the deepest. I hated seeing him struggle so much with his life. Yet, he was the one who stayed the strongest for everyone else. My favorite part was when he finally opened up and shared his demons, therefore dealing with his guilt instead of keeping it buried.Since I am reading this during the winter, I find myself feeling the heat of the sun and the hearing the crash of the waves, enjoying it enough that I dreamt of it. The descriptions of the scenes were that real to me. I could see the boardwalk, feel the sand, and see all the cute cottages on the beach.
