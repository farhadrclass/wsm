Knowing that, I held off on reading this for some time because it\u2019s going to be the last time I get to crack open one of Cooke\u2019s fantastic adaptations of the Parker series and get to enjoy his illustrated interpretations of one of my favorite crime fiction characters.At least it ends on a high note with Cooke\u2019s version of Richard Stark\u2019s (a/k/a Donald Westlake) Slayground. After the heist of an armored car goes sideways Parker has to hole up in an amusement park that is shut down for the winter, but some local mobsters and dirty cops know that he\u2019s in there with a bag full of cash so they go in after him, but they make the critical error of giving Parker enough time to prepare. Essentially this is Die Hard in an amusement park done years before Bruce Willis walked into Nakatomi Plaza, and it\u2019s a hoot. As with the other Parker novels that Cooke did he sets them in their original time frames and the artwork gives the whole thing a retro charm. Cooke also uses the format to do clever things like provide a fold-out illustrated map of the park like the one Parker uses to make his plans. Once again the graphic novels of Stark\u2019s novels seem like stylish storyboards for a movie that sadly never got made. (Hint hint, Hollywood.) There\u2019s a bonus with Cooke also doing a short version of The Seventh.As with all great things I\u2019m sad to see it end but happy I got to experience them. Cooke\u2019s vision of Parker make for excellent companion pieces for fans of the books."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "A re-read, 3/28/18, after finally reading the novel on which it was based and loving it. Original review, 8/20/16, edited a bit: The fourth and I presume last of the adaptations made of Richard Stark/Donald Westlake's Parker crime novels (since Cooke died this year). Parker is one of the hardest of \"hard-boiled\" detectives, and somehow you gotta like that, if not quite like him. I liked this volume least of the four books Cooke adapted, in part because it is very short, getting at the essence of the tale but missing some of the play in it. It takes place on a Fun Island, after all! Aren't playgrounds supposed to be fun?! Okay, there is one terrific fun thing in it; Cooke creates a fold-out park guide for Fun Island: The Happiest Place on Earth (heh, you didn't read the fine print!), complete with a map, which is wonderful.The art from Cooke remains strong to the very end, retro sixties design, though, really stylized and hip. And while the rendition of Stark's story is a little more straightforward than Cooke's first three adaptations, there is an attraction in that, too; it's lean and mean, stripped down to its bare essentials.The idea in this story is that Parker and two other criminals seem to have pulled off a successful heist of an armored car. But the escaping car ends up in a wreck, and Parker heads out alone, hiding out in an amusement park that only has one entrance, with a satchel of cash. Parker sets up traps for all the crooked cops who are trying to catch him, as you might expect him to do, and this is fun, a Fun Island for crime fans. Primarily because the art is just so good, I raised by initial 3 star rating to 4, in site of the leanness and predictability of the story.Cooke also adds a short story version (it's really just a vignette) of Stark's seventh Parker story, \"The Seventh\" which is way too short, but still well done, and fun. But if you like crime stories, you have to check out these 4 book adaptations, for which Cooke deservedly won Eisner awards. Comics like this, also excellent, includes work from Brubaker and Phillips (Criminal, The Fadeaway), Kindt (Mind Mgmt, Dept. H) and Tardi (Like a Sniper Lining up His Shot, West Coast Blues)."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "Darwyn Cooke\u2019s Eisner Award winning series continues with the fourth installment, Slayground. Following a botched robbery, Parker escapes to an amusement park closed for the winter. Boxed in by gangsters and crooked cops, will Parker be able to devise a successful escape route or has his number finally come up?I received an advanced copy from IDW Publishing and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Cooke\u2019s adaptation of Richard Stark\u2019s iconic character Parker has been nothing short of tremendous. I was actually a little shocked to see it completed so soon, considering that back in August, when I had the good fortune of meeting Mr. Cooke, he had indicated he was still working on it and he had in fact left it at home on his kitchen table to attend the Dartmouth Comic Arts Festival.It goes without saying that the artwork continues to impress. In keeping with the atmosphere of a cold winter\u2019s night, Cooke selected various shades of blue and black as the predominant colors, giving us a perfect backdrop to the conditions endured by Parker as he plans his escape. Cooke\u2019s signature style is tailor made for a period such as the 1960s so there\u2019s no doubt that given this is his fourth installment, he\u2019s here for the long run.There\u2019s not much else to say about this other than if you\u2019re not already reading the series, you\u2019re missing out. Slayground may be his strongest effort yet so get caught up before Christmas Eve and grab this when it hits store shelves."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6364929-martin", "userReview": "First thought I had when I received this book from Amazon was: \"Huh? Why is this book so thin?\" The reason for this is that this fourth Parker book [as adapted by Darwyn Cooke] - compared to the first three - really has less story to it, and there's only so much of stretching it out that could be done. Thankfully, Cooke doesn't stretch it out, and the result is a low page count (96 pages! - What the...? That even includes the 12-page adaptation of The Seventh)For this reason this adaptation can't stand up to its predecessors in the 'size' department. So - yeah, a bit disappointing considering the length and the expectations/anticipation re: Cooke's last Parker adaptation, but an otherwise entertaining read. I've read the original novel of Richard Stark's 'The Seventh', and it seems to me - at least to increase the total page count of the book - a more elaborate adaptation of this story could have been included (this short adaptation was first produced for - and included in - Richard Stark\u2019s Parker: The Martini Edition). Darwyn Cooke's art is great as always, but there's just not enough this time around (hence the 3-star rating). Oh wait - one more thing: at least the book has a lower price point than the first three books, so that's good; but the book is still too short!"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "Who does not like a Parker tale in a different medium as I have read before and the economic style of drawing does fit the style Richard Stark used to write his novels but while I have fond memories of the Slayground book I found this comic somewhat not covering the suspense of the original version by its original writer.I like comics but in this instance I found myself a bit shortchanged as I really enjoy the Parker novels and think that perhaps the comics were not meant for me.Slayground is the major comic in this book and we get a very curtailed The Seventh also written by Stark, it is a bloody waste of ink as it totally decapitated the original novel.You want to enjoy Starks Parker stories read the original novels.

Parker gets trapped in a fairground after a heist goes bad and has to survive as a third party is after him and his heist money.

Fun read."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Parker, Grofield and one other guy rob an armoured car in the middle of winter and drive off with the cash. However the new guy is a bit of a nervous driver and winds up crashing the car on the ice, killing himself and badly injuring Grofield. Parker, hearing police in the distance, grabs the loot and makes a run for it, hiding out in a nearby amusement park that\u2019s closed for the season. And then realises that some crooked cops accepting a payoff from the mob have witnessed his escape into the park and, listening to dispatch, put two and two together and decide to go in there, kill Parker, and keep the cash for themselves. Parker must set as many deathtraps in the park as he can to escape with his life. This is the fourth comic book adaptation Darwyn Cooke has done of Richard Stark/Donald Westlake\u2019s Parker books and the first where I was a bit bored reading it. The other books - The Hunter, The Outfit, The Score - all had complex plots involving multiple stages and double-crosses, and so on, whereas Slayground has a very basic premise of a cat and mouse that never goes beyond that. Parker sets deathtraps, mobsters/crooked cops wander into the traps, we move on to the next one, repeat. This is fine if you want to read a book like that and I feel like I should like this more seeing as this book really made me realise Parker is basically Frank Castle, and I love the Punisher - Slayground has the flavour of the best kind of Punisher stories where Frank\u2019s up against the odds and has to MacGyver his way out. I think partly why I wasn\u2019t as enamoured was because I read the original Slayground novel a few months ago so I knew what to expect going in. To be fair, this is both a very faithful adaptation of the source material and also works better as a comic than a novel - Stark\u2019s laborious descriptions of Parker setting traps are replaced by Cooke\u2019s silent panels as Parker swiftly sets a trap in a few panels, then moves on to the next, and so on; we get past the chaff and to the action a lot faster. But the predictability of it as everything goes right and Parker defeats the bad guys and the repetitive nature of the story as one person stumbles into a trap after another made for a fairly shallow read. There\u2019s no sense that Parker\u2019s in any real danger that he can\u2019t handle and Cooke\u2019s faithfulness to the source material only shows up Stark\u2019s minimal story. Cooke\u2019s \u201860s-styled art remains as superb as ever and he knows where to put the camera, so to speak, so we get some dynamic angles, great use of shadow and light, and a strong sense of motion when we need it. Also included is a short story, The Seventh, which has Parker pursuing a thief who\u2019s stolen money/double-crossed him as he chases him onto a construction site. Again, it\u2019s very predictable storytelling and feels rote and one-dimensional. I usually enjoy Cooke\u2019s Parker adaptations and while I didn\u2019t hate Slayground, I also didn\u2019t love it and found myself pushing through it to get it over with rather than savouring the experience. Slayground is ok but Cooke\u2019s other Parker books are much better."}, {"userName": "Brent", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297492-brent", "userReview": "To think we will have no more cartoon or comic art from the late Darwyn Cooke is hard.

Parker and his sometime associate Grofield pull an armored car robbery that goes sideways in inclement weather, forcing Parker to take refuge in an abandoned amusement park in the dead of winter. However, when he is spotted going in, unsavory elements conspire to relieve him of his ill-gotten gains, turning the park into . . . a \"slayground.\" Cooke's rendering of the novel is spot-on and completely faithful to the feel and ambiance of the source material. However, due to the descriptive nature of the novel vs the quantity of scenes this graphic novel is much shorter than the other three.

'The Hunter' was familiar territory for me, but seeing him bring Parker to life in his brilliantly economical retro-60's style, I fell in love with how perfect the book was -- it's 6\" x 9\" hardcover format, the design and materials of the book itself, the style and layout for the dustjacket... everything worked. But above all, Cooke had a firm grasp on the character of Parker. This fourth volume, 'Slayground', is a shorter but no less impressive venture into Parker's pitiless world of heists gone wrong, bent cops, and mobsters who think they've found an easy score. Cooke's two-tone brushwork is as tight and stylish as it's ever been with his portrayal of an iced-over amusement park as it becomes the setting for a reversing of roles when the hunters try to make Parker their prey. When they discover their mistake, it's far too late; the easy score becomes a bloody vendetta as a mafia boss is willing to raise a small army against Parker in his crazed thirst for vengeance. Also included is a great Parker short story, 'The Seventh'. For once, a job goes exactly as planned, as Parker's seven-man team take down a $115 000.00 score. But as they lie low and wait for the heat to die down, a crime of passion threatens to ruin everything. Even the shortest Parker stories are visual poetry in Cooke's hands. With a long list of Parker titles to choose from, Cooke can return to the character as long as he wants to. Now that he's produced over 550 pages of the very finest comics noir, I hope he sticks with it a long time. According to tne final page, 'Parker will return in 2015.' So far, the Canadian artist has honored his promises regarding Parker, despite being one of the most in-demand writer-artists in mainstream comics. IDW will also be reissuing the entire run of original Parker novels by Richard Stark, in a 'premium hardcover format with illustrated color plates', apparently by Darwyn Cooke."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric", "userReview": "This particular Parker story is an interesting one because it takes place entirely after a heist. However, there are still plenty of opportunities to witness Parker's guile as he eludes capture by hiding out in a small amusement park that is closed for the season. This key divergence from the \"typical\" Parker heist formula, as well as the unique and captivating setting, make it a very attractive graphic novel, and explain why a dozen other potential Parker novels were skipped sequentially when choosing to adapt this one.This is the second of the Parker graphic novel adaptations I have read, with the first being Richard Stark's Parker: The Hunter. I am happy to report that there is no drop off in quality with either the art or storytelling from that first volume to this one. The art is still severe and hard boiled, and the storyline is still bare, more charcoal sketch than oil painting. The only difference with this volume (and this is admittedly specific to me) is that, unlike with The Hunter, I hadn't read the source material for this one before reading the graphic novel. This, in many ways, made this one more interesting, as I had no preconceived ideas concerning the story ahead of time.Full disclosure: I received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a review."}, {"userName": "Dominick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913578-dominick", "userReview": "This is a very economical adaptation of Richard Stark's Slayground--especially since the final dozen or so of its 96 pages are in fact a separate Parker adaptation: the novel The Seventh, compressed into about a seventh of this overall book (which must be deliberate, mustn't it?). The Parker books are as a rule pretty lean anyway, but Cooke really boils them down to their essences. Well, perhaps he boils The Seventh down a tad too much, as about 80% of the original book gets precised in two pages, with only the climax given any breathing room. But Cooke does have a great eye for visual design and does an excellent job of getting the essentials across in pure visuals, even at times devoting a (proportionally) huge amount of space to very short units--e.g. the beautifully-rendered two-page car crash near the beginning of Slayground, which really does not need two pages to fulfill its narrative function but still makes for a lovely pair of pages. I especially liked the foldout that gave the layout of the amusement park, in the format of the map a visitor to the park would get. The original novels are superior, but Cooke does better at adaptation than most.

Darwyn Cooke's graphic novels based on the Parker novels of Richard Stark (aka Donald Westlake) seem to capture the tone and style perfectly. The series takes place in the same timeframe as the novels, and Cooke's style is an eyeful of style details from the late 1960s.In Slayground, Parker is involved in a botched robbery. He escapes over the fence and into an off-season amusement park, abandoned for the winter. He soon discovers it's a dead end, and that the only way out is being guarded by people who want the money he has stolen. But Parker is deadly and not the kind of person you want to try to trap.

The Richard Stark's Parker Collection seems to be well known in the comic world. However, I must confess I was unaware of both the author and his work.This volume is a sequel from the collection. Unfortunately, it couldn't quite captivate me. The main story at the beginning is interesting. The issue of the assault and how Parker was the only one to escape the accident with the money, hiding in the amusement park was intriguing. But all the subsequent action was predictable.

But Parker has already checked the perimeter of the park, has already seen them, and already deduced their plan, so he\u2019s already hidden the stolen money somewhere in the park, as well as set up a few traps within several of the attractions.After receiving Donald E. Westlake\u2019s blessing to adapt his series from the 1960s into a graphic novel series, comics artist Darwyn Cooke began publishing the first of four installments in 2009. This is the last of his series, it\u2019s the shortest, and to be honest, it\u2019s the least interesting. Unlike the previous adaptations, Parker\u2019s working alone here, so the plot development is silently conveyed through illustrations of black, white, and cool shades of bluish-gray, and while they are beautifully rendered, there isn\u2019t much drama through most of the book. Parker\u2019s brooding demeanor really could\u2019ve benefitted from a partner for him to interact with while confined within the abandoned park, preparing for confrontation with the cops, like the theatrical and effusive Grofield. I have not read Westlake\u2019s series as originally written, but my understanding is this series remains faithful to the original throughout, so Cooke wouldn\u2019t have been able to add characters, which I respect, but as a result, the inventive imagery was not enough to convey the nuances of Parker\u2019s internal dialog that likely existed in the original series, and would\u2019ve created the drama that was sadly missing from this adaptation. 2.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Paolo Macri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55078730-paolo-macri", "userReview": "Although this story started off with an interesting premise it quickly went into a story made to seemingly boost the author's idea of a really cool guy who is the ultimate badass.

He is absolutely ruthless, completely professional, unforgiving, unyielding, unpredictable and vicious to the core. So much so that he could easily be portrayed as the antagonist of any story. And therein lies the novelty of the Parker series by Richard Stark. Portraying the ruthless, cold, vicious, professional thief Parker as the protagonist as he goes on pulling one of his daring schemes is the trademark of the Parker series and it almost never fails to deliver. Especially when it is illustrated by Darwyn Cooke. This latest installment of the Parker graphic novel series is based on the novel of the same name by Richard Stark. In the opening pages of the book, we have Parker and his slightly wacky pal Grofield pulling a heist only to see their escape go bad resulting in Parker being on the run with the money. As Parker finds respite in a closed-for-season amusement park, a local mob coupled with some dirty cops spot him and they decide to make him their game. And so starts the methodical slaughter.It is a very simple story. A vicious hunt in a closed off amusement park in the middle of winter. But it is this factor that makes it work. The previous release Parker: The Score was about an elaborate scheme of robbing an entire town, which just seemed silly and fantastical. Here, we see Parker return to his base nature and it makes for a much better setting.Even better than the setting is the fantastic artwork by Darwyn Cooke. His choice of color to depict the snow filled winter is absolute gorgeous to look at. Comparing it with his other artwork for the same series, it is second only to (if not on par with) his noir defining artwork of Parker: Hunter. The choice of the color completely captures the severity of the winter and perfectly compliments the bleak setting of the story. The two pages showing the car crash is absolutely breathtaking. If there is a weak link, it is the size of the story, which is just about 82 pages long, along with the short story \u201cThe 7eventh\u201d (about 10 pages+ 4 pages of title and other filler) this makes the book to be an unsatisfyingly slim 96 pages as opposed to the usual 160 pages. The other minor weak link is that none of the characters have any room for development. Cooke seems to have decided to make this a simplistic, action packed cat and mouse thriller and it works for the most part. If only he had had figured out some way of adding in the details with the pace it has delivered, it could have been great. As it is, Slayground is very entertaining and only memorable for its brilliant artwork."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1687456-rob", "userReview": "More reviews can be found on my book blog.---I read the first three of these a few years ago, but I never got around to this final volume. Darwyn Cooke sadly passed away last month, in this year of startling deaths, which gave me an unfortunate reminder to pick it up.This volume is certainly a contrast to the last Parker book, \nThe Score\n, in which Parker and his team planned a heist to rob an entire town. It had a complicated Ocean's Eleven feel to it. This is a much simpler story, which is evident as soon as you get your hands on the physical book, as it's about half the size of the first three.Parker and two of his associates rob an armoured truck but crash on the icy roads during the getaway. Parker takes the cash and escapes into a nearby amusement park, which has been closed for the winter. Two corrupt cops, with mob connections, see him retreat and decide to find him, kill him, and take the cash for themselves. It then turns into a game of stealth as Parker tries to escape while using rigged amusement park attractions to thwart his attackers. It's a set piece that has been used many, many times, particularly in children's movies and horror novels. I remember stories like this from reading R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike novels as a kid. This is adapted from Donald E. Westlake's 1971 novel of the same name, so it was probably a more original concept at the time.It may not have the depth of the previous volumes, but it's still good fun. You get to see Parker set traps and ready himself, and even though the second half of the story is fairly predictable, it's still very satisfying, and conjures that Home Alone nostalgic feeling, to see it all play out. Cooke's illustrations and use of two-tone colour is always a joy flip through as well.This is a fun series, and I'm sad to see it end. I might have a look up some of the work he did for DC and Marvel as well."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4046161-james", "userReview": "The fourth and final book in Darwyn Cook\u2019s graphic novel series is the shortest of them all. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike the slightly more complicated story lines in the previous volumes, this volume, Slayground, find\u2019s Parker on the run. The story is very linear in this regard as Parker runs throughout the story before turning to fight through to the conclusion.Parker crashes his car early in the story and must make a quick escape if he\u2019s to hang on to the loot that he acquired during his last score. But on his heels, of course, are a couple of cops who are less interested in bringing Parker to justice than they are in relieving him of the burden of dealing with an unspecified amount of cash taken during an armored car robbery that ends in the death of his cohorts. Parker attempts to find a path to freedom in a nearby amusement park that has been closed for the winter and it\u2019s from this point that the cat-and-mouse chase drives the story. In typical Parker fashion, the threats to his freedom are dealt with one by one. The story is driven by Parker\u2019s singular desire to escape with his life and his loot. It\u2019s for this reason, however, that I found this story less interesting than the others in this series.On balance, the series was a good one and I would recommend it, especially to anyone looking for a graphic novel series unrelated to superheroes, what I\u2019ve long-believed to be typical fare for such a format. In fact, it was this series that was my own introduction to the graphic novel and my pre-conceived notions about the format were changed for the better. Richard Stark\u2019s Parker series, adapted by Darwyn Cook, prompted me to read another graphic novel series and kindled an interest in a number of books that, had I not read this series, I might never have known about.We\u2019re at the end of LAPL\u2019s Summer Reading Challenge, so thank you LAPL for a fun summer! I would like, very much, to do this again!"}, {"userName": "Michael Emond", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7853161-michael-emond", "userReview": "I am a huge Parker fan and all because Darwyn Cooke started making these graphic novels and it prompted me to go to the source material. I have now read all the original novels and I urge everyone to do the same. This adaptation by Cooke still has great art and it picks one of the Parker novels that is a fan favourite \"Slayground\" where Parker is trapped in a \"closed for the Winter\" amusement park in Buffalo by some members of the local Mob and a couple of cops on the take.  It is still a great read but I am rating it lower than the other adaptations because of its thin size and the result of the thin size is that the drama and suspense from the original novel doesn't get translated. The novel could take its time explaining what Parker was doing (setting traps; struggling to make his way to the roof; planning out his next move in his mind) but here we see it and it goes by a lot faster because of that. A fun read to be sure but this is a case where the novel suffers in the translation.  We also get a mini story \"The Seventh\" (or the sillier \"7eventh\" um...that number/letter substitution only works for me if the letter that the number takes the place of LOOKS like the number e.g. thr33...but I digress). This story was originally in the Martini edition and it is nice to see it here for those of us who wouldn't shell out for the Martini edition after we already bought the individual hardcovers. I had been wondering how the novel had been condensed into 12 pages but now I understand...he used prose to summarize the book and then just drew the very last scene where Parker tracks down the person who robbed from him. Since I read the novel this was okay for me but I do wonder if you hadn't read the novel if it would seem odd.  Overall, this was still a must buy for me as a Parker fan and a Cooke fan (my Venn diagrams of Nerdiness intersected) I would just recommend you get the other adaptations BEFORE this one."}, {"userName": "Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940-benjamin", "userReview": "I found this at my local Austin Public Library; so even though I haven't read the third of Cooke's Stark's Parker books, I jumped ahead to this fourth volume. After all, it's not like I'm going to miss a lot of character development, since, as I've said before, Parker has no real character to speak of. He's a collection of skills and a capacity to plan that edges towards the godlike (or the authorial).As usual, Darwyn Cooke draws in a blue-and-white crispness and the occasional impressionistic brushstroke that is really the highlight of these books.Which is no offense to the story, which has a nice tight premise that can get knocked out in less than a hundred pages--or probably an hour of the A-Team. In snowy Buffalo, Parker is part of an armored car heist that goes--wah wah--wrong: when the getaway car spins out, Parker makes off with a bag of money and hides out in a closed amusement park. Which would be fine, except he gets spotted by some gangsters and crooked cops, who decide to hunt him down. Parker being the awesome, all-knowing badass that he is (yawn), he knows what's coming and gets the amusement park prepped as a killing field.Again, there's not really that much suspense here when it comes to Parker's survival. When Parker throws an electrical cable into water, we know someone is going to get electrocuted. The only real suspense and interest--aside from the art--is generated by the other characters. While Parker prepares his death traps, we see the gangsters, including a very functional father-son team that turns out to be the most touching part of the story; and the cop partners who are slightly more dysfunctional.I don't love Parker, but this might be my favorite Parker delivery system."}], "description": "Darwyn Cooke's masterful and multi award-winning series of Parker graphic novels continues with Slayground!
