I watched The Walking Dead when it aired last year and I thought it was A-M-Azing. Before I read this book I had to do a little research on \"The Governor\" because I haven't read the comics and also the show hasn't introduced that character yet. Also keep in mind that I basically only read YA books with a female as the main p.o.v. So with that being said I started the book and all I can say is Wow! The ending was such a \"what?!\" kind of ending, leaving me wanting more. It's different to read a book where the main character is the villian and not the hero. I got to experience a characters descent into darkness and madness. Great read looking forward to the next one, if their is, and the season premiere of the show in October."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Realizing there wasn't enough horror in my reading world and being a fan of The Walking Dead tv show, I figured a book based on the backstory of one of the franchise's most notorious characters was a safe bet for some good reading. I was correct!Rise of the Governor is wall-to-wall anus-puckering tension and heart-thumping action. The author's workman-like prose powers the story forward at an almost non-stop pace (jesus there's a lot of dashes going on here!) from beginning to end.And what an end! I was legitimately bamboozled by a nice twist the author added. It was necessary to my overall enjoyment. I mean, it would've been a dang good book without it, but with it Rise of the Governor is elevated a notch or two in my overall estimation."}, {"userName": "Anthony Chavez", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876333-anthony-chavez", "userReview": "As I have read the first compendium of 48 trade paperbacks that ended the original Governor story arc, I jumped at the chance to pick up this collaboration by series creator Robert Kirkman and horror writer Jay Bonansinga. \"The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor\" is an amazing idea for a novel or trilogy. I hear that the Governor is one of the series', and even comic books in general, most notorious and loathsome villains, and the notion of exploring his back story is definitely going to be appealing to all dead head fans.It turns out that the Governor may not be as different as you might imagine. In many ways, this tale is a familiar survival story, breaking little new ground but giving the fan some real insight into the beginning stages of the zombie outbreak. The story opens in the first days of the zombie outbreak, the narrative follows the ups and downs of a small rag tag group of survivors, which consist of the man we know to become The Governor, his brother, a couple childhood friends, and a little girl. The group finds themselves trying to understand what has caused this outbreak and then try to conform to their new life as they know it. They try to exist in a retirement community, followed by a stint in the city, followed by isolationism, etc. so on and so forth. They try many various strategies to build a new life, none quite working out as long as they would like. Every time they get comfortable, the real NEW world comes crashing down in the form of a new undead or even human menace. At what point does the living in a world of walking dead reach their breaking point? The novel takes us on the journey of The Governor until he reaches exactly that spot and then pushes to the other side. The final two chapters, amazingly, bring everything together in a very unexpected way.You don't really see the rise of the Governor as much as the birth or origins of the Governor, the title is a bit misleading. The book ends at the beginning of a new chapter, you can see the light up ahead, and he is with familiar characters from the comic. It was an easy read, solidly written, fast paced as is true to Kirkman form. I wasn't blown away by anything fresh or new, as I feel this was sorta what was expected, right in line with The Walking Dead trade paperbacks. I did like learning about the area a little and getting to know the Governor's crew, but you don't have to be a fervent fan to enjoy this novel. This can definitely work as a stand alone piece but it has more impact, however, if you actually know who the Governor is! A good and fun effort that, ultimately, doesn't add a huge new dimension to the ongoing saga but more of a mirror or different point of view on survival.It was fascinating the way the book explored the emotional reactions of a survival group, I mean I liked how it was done in the comics but in novel form its different. Most of the reactions were understandable, but it always leaves me questioning what I would do, say, feel if I found myself in an unbelievable and terrifying new reality. The Rise of the Governor, didn\u2019t lack for action, in this world where the normal rules no longer apply, the zombies are at least the one danger in which you know what to expect, the humans are another story altogether. You would think that the struggle with the zombies would be action enough, but The Walking Dead always contains shocking twists and this is no exception, with an ending that will leave you speechless."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813315-lucy", "userReview": "I made a series of mistakes when I picked this book up. Everything I know about The Walking Dead series came from the television show. I've never been on this side of the street before, but suddenly I'm that annoying person Harry Potter fans have been dealing with since 2001. You know, someone who always pictured Harry as Daniel Radcliffe and was never at all pissed that Danny-boy over there has blue eyes (AND NOT GREEN DAMN HIM FOR NOT WEARING CONTACTS).In addition to being a film media and not paper consumer for the franchise, I'm also not a comic book sort of person -- so I ordered this book first when attempting to get deeper into the series; somehow this felt like a lesser commitment than the comic book. I had no idea who the governor was because the television series hasn't reached his introduction. I'm also an asshole who rarely reads book descriptions, in my defense I often find them misleading or too vague to be useful. (The most popular review I've written is a point by point comparison with a book's actual plot to its misleading jacket description.) So I routinely pick up books with no idea what they're about.In short: all I really understood was this book was set in The Walking Dead universe and it was the backstory for a character we had yet to meet in the series.I expected to read a bit more about the initial outbreaks, since the main character of the other branch of this series spent the beginning of the outbreak in a coma. I guess I thought the writer would use this opportunity to expand on things he didn't have the opportunity to show us before. No such luck though. It's extremely vague. Any time you think you're going to get some real information the story kind of screams \"stop looking for explanations and details! Can't you see this is too harrowing for those little things?!\" The survivors we follow bounce from place to place with little to no information. While this is not an inaccurate way to write a zombie survival story it was still disappointingly unambitious.I was also bothered by the fact that the only female character for much of the book is a little girl who spends most of her time catatonic. I find the television show extremely frustrating and most of the reason I started reading the source material was to see if my issues with the series were intrinsic problems or flourishes added by the screenwriters. Since my problems include rampant sexism and casual racism a bunch of white guys tearing through the South was kind of a confirmation of my worst expectations.The story shifts point of view at odd moments, dipping into different people's heads for a few pages or paragraphs, but the story is primarily told from Philip Blake's point of view. He's the father of Penny, our mostly catatonic little girl, and the brother of Brian, a nervous skinny guy who has trouble killing zombies. Other members of the group include two of Philip's high school drinking buddies, both of whom are fleshed out only when exhibiting a certain personality trait will be convenient for the plot.The group eventually lose one generic friend and then meet up with other survivors. As they settle in, a somewhat romantic relationship begins to develop between Philip and one of the female survivors, one who saved his life and was particularly kind to his daughter. The only indications this woman is interested in Philip involve a chaste kiss on the cheek and some light verbal flirting. This doesn't stop Philip from imagining that they can settle down and she can play mother to his daughter. They share a mutual kiss -- a first kiss. Philip pushes it aggressively towards sex. The woman begs him to stop. He doesn't.After reading him lament the loss of what could've been true love if only he'd been a little more patient, I finally read the book description and other reviews. I realized I was reading a book about the development of a monster. The Walking Dead series, really the whole fandom, is full of a lot of misogyny, but the main character on the television show is something of a white knight Gary Stu. I only knew something was wrong because the other main character was never morally gray before and this just didn't jive.(I personally like a morally gray character, but it seemed like a big leap in main characters for Kirkman.) So, anyway, I had to hastily readjust how I was reading the book. The book and the characters become darker, so I'm grateful I finally caught on. Penny dies when their camp is raided and Philip, who was already barely on the sane side to begin with, tortures the survivors in the raiding party. He rapes the female survivor over and over again. At that point I consider my dislike of the material my problem and not the author's or the book's issue. It's a story about a man who was once a functional member of society becoming a sociopath and it's not like it was hidden from me. I was just willfully ignoring every warning I could've got. At least the second rape and torture sequences were both being portrayed as the horrific acts they are, unlike the first rape which Philip considered it an act of over eager love the lady in question should be able to get over.The end of the book annoyed me for a variety of reasons. We lose Philip's POV as he really goes insane and the audience becomes more steadily entrenched in Brian, who alternates between being a victim of Philip's violence and being unaware of most of what is going on. It kind of felt like a cop out. The psychological damge was setting in at that point and it felt like the author was wiggling away from it because aside from vomit enducing gore and defilement he didn't know what else to do.Philip feeds zombie Penny recently dead people's body parts. He then snatches a girl and it's unclear whether he planned to rape her or feed her to Penny in bite sized chunks. Nick, the surviving of Philip's two original friends, finally takes a stand and puts Philip (and the girl too accidentally) down like a rabid animal... wait what? Wasn't the whole point of this book seeing Philip's transformation from normalish guy to monster? Oh, Philip's not the governor you say... so the rape and torture were entirely gratuitous and only thinly related to the 'rise of the governor.'The actual governor is Brian who takes on his brother's identity as a means of coping with the world around him. The shy tentative guy from the beginning of the story who only wanted to own a music shop in Atlanta and had trouble killing already dead zombies just picks up Philip's emotional baggage like it's dropped luggage and decides to carry on where he left off. Go ahead, say 'what the fuck' now if you want, I did a few times. Maybe in the next book Brian's transformation will be better explained because in the book it's practically just a matter of him putting on big brother's shoes and becoming him. It is a very Hollywood version of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, more Many Faces of Eve than true to real life in my opinion.Now, I don't know if I want to read the comics. It's no one's fault but my own that I walked into this book totally unprepared, but at the same time I feel like a lot of my feelings about the author and the series were confirmed. The writing was lazy, the character development inept. Of the four female characters that got any significant page time two were rape victims, one was a loud mouthed shrew, and the other was Penny, who was more a plot device than a character. The only character who is said to be of color gets shot in the back of his head 2 minutes after he is introduced. None of this is suggesting I have the wrong idea about Robert Kirkman's level of responsibility for all the sexism and racisim."}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "Rise of the Governor was an okay and interesting audio book. The pace was all over the pace to me though. The first half of this book was moving so agonizingly slow for me. It could've been because I was at work and honestly didn't want to be there for 8 hours.. or it could've been that narrator was so meh. I couldn't concentrate long enough in the beginning that I definitely had to back track a couple of times.Then the action got better. The zombies got crazier and deader (if that's a thing??). Phillip was probably the craziest character I've ever been introduced for. Pretty sure he raped like two girls in this entire book?? But don't quote me on that. Then there was Penny, who was his daughter. I absolutely loved Penny.. but what happened to her was completely predictable.Now the one thing that I didn't predict was Brian. I didn't see him becoming the Governor. No, I saw Phillip slowly coming into that role. However, that wasn't the only thing that left me surprised. Nope, Penny was still being held captive. Yes, she is still a zombie which is weird and freaky to me. I get that everyone loved this little girl.. but damn, she's dead. She should be actually dead now. Not kept like a pet.Overall, the pacing threw me for a loop. The action got better towards the end. So many unexpected deaths throughout the book too. I hope that the second book will be a lot better.

Holy Crisps, I could barely catch my breath.This first book stats with Phil, his brother Brian, his living daughter and two high school friends. The plague has just driven them from their hometown to search for the safe zone. They are unprepared for the horrors they face and the deaths that will happen. Phil was never a very nice guy, he seems to have alway had a dark shadow looming around him. Brian his brother is the older, kinder brother always at a disadvantage under his brothers power.

Toe tingling excitement and edge of your seat terror.I am off to read book 2 in this trilogy. :DHere is the order of these books which turned out to be more then 3-https://www.goodreads.com/series/6550..."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "The Walking Dead, Rise of the Governor, should be more aptly titled (as mentioned by several other reviewers): The Birth of the Governor. If this book has a sequel, it would tell of the actual rise of the Governor. In fact, I feel that given what this particular book is lacking, there would need to be a sequel to bridge the gap between what we have been introduced to with this story and what we see when Rick, Glenn, and Michonne stumble across Woodbury in the comic books. While this story wasn't quite what I expected, I had no issue with it as a stand alone tale in TWD universe. It is the story of a normal human being, doing his best to survive the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse. In that regard, this story parallels TWD. We are introduced to a group of survivors: brothers Philip and Brian Blake, two of Philip's friends-Bobby and Nick, and Philip's young daughter, Penny. Philip is the leader of this small bad of survivors trying hard to cope in this new world. Bobby and Nick follow Philip's lead, as they have always done in life before the apocalypse, which is usually a good thing, since he is willing to do what it takes to remain alive. The story covers their saga of survival as they travel across Georgia, from a wealthy subdivision outside Atlanta where they hide out for a time, to a barricaded apartment building inside the city that they share with other survivors, to their grim journeys out into the sticks, where they finally arrive at Woodbury, the town that the Governor rules with an iron fist in TWD comic books. As I mentioned, I would be willing to read a sequel to this story; one that would further explain how the man who enters Woodbury near the end of this tale transforms into the man who can do such unthinkable and horrible things to other survivors in the comic books-especially to Michonne and Rick. But if this book, and the psychological transformation that occurs within its pages, is the only justification offered up as to why the Governor is the way he is by the writers of this novel, I just can't buy it. There has to be more trauma put upon him to allow him to become such a casually evil and demonic creature. I firmly believe this. To elaborate further would reveal spoilers, which I'm unwilling to do. So again, my hope is that there is a plan to scribe another book...part 2, if you will, though I doubt that is the case. Again, this book, as a standalone tale of survival during the zombie apocalypse, is entertaining. Present tense writing is not the norm, but it does speak of the immediacy of everything going on around the characters and keeps the energy level high, for the most part. I didn't have a real issue with that. I did feel that the author could have toned down the descriptive verse a bit. He creates vivid images, but I often felt a bit overwhelmed by the details he would elaborate on, when simpler descriptives would have sufficed. That is a minor niggling detail though. My main concern with this story is that it only shares the beginning of the metamorphosis the man who turns into the Governor. There is a big chunk missing in the tale that goes from this story and ends when we come across the full blown Governor in TWD comic books. It is THAT tale, the middle portion of the man's saga, that I really want to read."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478711-brian", "userReview": "Okay, I am a HUGE zombie fan. I have also been collecting the Walking Dead comic book since issue #2 and when I first heard about this novel, I was excited. Kirkman explores the deeper thoughts/feelings/issues of a z-apocalyptic world via the comic (and now the TV show) and I thought a novel would allow him to really sink his teeth into the material. Also, he has never (not in comics or TV) dealt with the early days of the epidemic.If you haven't ever read the comic, but are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, then you MIGHT like this book. It's not badly written, per se. There are a couple of points where they really built suspense up for example. However, it is definitely not worth the price of a hardcover. Wait until it's in paperback, the ebook $$ goes down, or just check it out of your library.Now, if you're a fan of the Walking dead, you're going to be disappointed. Now, I'm sure there are fanboys out there that will attack me for saying that, but give it time. A couple of years from now, even the most hardcore fanboys will be ashamed of it. Major SPOILERSIf you heard that this novel will cover the early days of the outbreak, you heard wrong. Little is covered about the initial outbreak. Instead, we jump a few days into the z-plague with them just hiding in a house and then quickly fast forward weeks into it. We don't hear about how it spreads. You'd think that starting with the characters seeing their first walking corpse would be a big moment in a book like this, but it isn't. Heck, I don't even think they covered it. So let me reiterate, this novel adds nothing about the spread of the zombie plague EXCEPT them describing how television and radio stations go off air. Fine, chalk it up to writer's license. Maybe Kirkman and Bonansinga (the authors) didn't want to deal with those time periods. That's okay. Let's move on to the meat.The Governor is one of the most vile characters in the comic book medium because his actions are horrendous. He is evil. The comic deals with him torturing and raping a woman. It deals with him holding gladiatorial-style games where people fight off zombies to entertain the masses of the Woodbury community. He orders the killing of women and children. The frickin' title of this book is \"Rise of the Governor\"! The blurb on the back of the dustcover is \"In The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor, the world will finally understand what drove Phillip Blake to become... The Governor.Guess what? It's a lie. You do not learn what drove Phillip Blake to become the Governor. You don't learn what turns an average law-abiding citizen into such a monstrous being. Oh, and want to learn the bigger lie? BIGGEST SPOILER - Phillip Blake doesn't become the Governor. It's his lame-ass asthmatic brother who only kills one zombie (nearly accidentally) in the whole book and later only kills one man. Plot twist? It was a cop-out. What motivations would brother Brian have for his monstrous actions in the comic? The lame-ass ones the book give are not believable. I didn't care about the characters. Phillip was the most interesting, but he is killed off for the surprise ending, leaving us with a character who is still a wimp. The authors try to wring out his motivation for his evil personality in a two or three page description of him losing it and going insane. Seriously?"}, {"userName": "Gabriel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101529-gabriel", "userReview": "Won in a Goodreads First Reads.Sigh.After greatly enjoying the first season of the AMC show and getting deep into the comics, I was looking forward to this. I mean, good zombie novels are far and very few between. They seem to work better as film horrors over novel horrors. Even so, The Walking Dead comics did a wonderful job of transforming the brutality of George Romero zombie flicks into a written media.This book does NOT follow suit.Maybe it's due to the fact that it's written in the present tense (for no real reason) or has random details (from near the end, \"He ... puts on his only other pair of jeans and his only other shirt (an AC/DC silk-screened tee).\") as if these facts are important. They aren't. Why do I care that he has an AC/DC tee on? Maybe it's due to the random redundancies that abound in this book; some ideas repeated mere paragraphs apart. Maybe it's due to some of the worst writing I've ever had the bad luck to read (from the middle, \"Yes, they hear him, and now Brian and Nick are climbing out of the SUV. Over the course of a mere minute, Brian makes a series of observations - most of them, apparently, already calculated by Philip - beginning with the front of the store.\"). We're talking about writing that isn't sure whether it's trying to describe thoughts via different character's heads or just unsure of itself to begin with. We're talking stuff that I edit out of my OWN writing on the second draft if I get that far. Sigh.There was so much going for this. It's a cool idea to retell the beginning of The Walking Dead from a different perspective. There are so many great stories to be had here and neat references to the comics possible.I won't read anymore of this \"trilogy\" and probably am leaving the comic series after this book.

I liked it enough that I plan on reading the rest of the series. I did not however \"really\" like it or think it was amazing. Hence, the three star rating. For one, and probably my biggest issue with this book, is how part two of this book played out almost exactly like parts of season four of the show played out. I kept thinking, \"Wait, is this a novelization of season four, or is this really the story of way before we ever met the Governor in season three?\" Also, it has made me wonder, \"What is Robert Kirkman's fascination with sisters and older father figures??\"The ending took me a bit by surprise, but after an hour or two of mulling it over it also felt like the whole book led up to the author forcing that surprise on you because as a fan of the show, I thought I knew who the Governor was so it was the only way available to throw in a shocker. After coming to that conclusion it felt contrived. I am a big enough fan of the show that I will continue with the series because I am curious enough to want to know \"what happened next,\" but overall I just didn't feel the storyline was in anyway on par with the television show.

It freaked me out more than the show and I was cruising threw my chores that I was doing because of the adrenaline it made me feel. I gave it a 3 because after awhile, just like the show, I didn't want to go through the cycle of not having any supplies, biters coming, running, someone dies. Start over. Only so much I can take.The characters are super though! Phillip goes from caring father to one loco muchacho! He lost every marble he ever had and maybe some that were lent to him. Phillips brother, Brian, is the sweet uncle to Penny and tries very hard not to feel like a loser and keep Penny's spirits up. Not a small task. Nick, is a good friend that is traveling with them but after seeing corpses eat people and hunt and try to kill him he becomes a bit unbalanced too.

This does not change when the zombie apocalypse hits, but his circle of protection expands to include his two best friends, and, unfortunately, his hapless, sickly brother Brian.The Governor has been a frightening inclusion in The Walking Dead series, but as with all truly good antagonists, he is not simply mad and/or evil. This trilogy serves to reveal what made the enigmatic leader of Woodbury who he is by first showing us what he was and reminding us just how much of a struggle leadership is, especially when all the rules have gone out of the window. Variations of the phrase \"do what you have to do\" comes up often and with necessity. Although I figured out the plot twist from the first few pages, the journey was still worthwhile and I\u2019m curious to see where the rest of the trilogy goes.Interestingly, the book is written in present tense. I've seen this done in another book originally intended to be a comic and I wondered if that was the original intention for this. As an audiobook, the tense works well, amplifying the tension of the characters and events. 3.5 stars.See more reviews atThe BiblioSanctum"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1479345-matt", "userReview": "As far as prequels go, this rates up there with The Phantom Menace and Batman Begins Kindergarten. It's slow and boring and adds very little to the Walking Dead narrative. I don't think Kirkman had very much hand in this at all. Another author (Jay Bonansinga) is listed and, unless Kirkman really can't switch mediums (like Orson Scott Card, for example, didn't write a very good Iron Man comic), the fault lies with Bonansinga.The descriptions use far too many cliches, which detracts from otherwise quality painting of a scene.It retells the crisis from another point of view, which would be OK, except that I've already seen it. And when the comic heroes went through the original crisis, a LOT more happened. Whatever faults the comic series has, it makes up for it with a lot of plot. This prequel does not have a lot happen. When Lost had to retell the original crash landing, they at least had the foresight to tell a very abbreviated version of it.I figured the surprise twist out 16 pages before it happened. And then I thought about it and it wasn't plausible.And the other characters were uninteresting. All of them. And the most interesting things about the Governor (his governing philosophy) weren't revealed at all. The Governor: this book :: Darth Vader : The Phantom Menace without the good parts.Also, Bonansinga's picture on the back makes him look like a high schooler trying to look like a serial killer, but middle-aged.Anyway, I'm done. Back to the comic series."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "This was not what I was expecting. I read the comics long before the show came out, but have since become a fan of the show as well. I occasionally find it hard to remember what happened in which. That sounds a bit silly, but for those of you that read and watch, you know what I mean. Story lines from the comic are revisited in the show but with different characters or timing, names change, but personalities stay the same or even vice-verse. That being said, this was very, very obviously the story of the comic governor, NOT the governor from the show.Philip was a bit of a twist right from the start in my opinion. In this story we see that he begins his post zombie trek through life with his brother Brian, two good ol' boy buddies (it is Georgia) and his daughter Penny. It's a pretty common story about how they survive, get from here to there,and so on, until...it's not. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that by the end of the book the governor is alone. I won't spoil anything, but know, going in, that the governor is not who, and or what, you think he is. The world he lives in made him what he becomes, but that man was always coiled and waiting in his guts."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jessica", "userReview": "Not completely sure how to feel about this one.

Once I get hooked on a tv series, sitting around each week waiting for it to run on its scheduled night soon becomes unbearable. Like a junkie with no idea where my next fix will come from, I seek out ways by which I can keep the buzz alive.I first remember doing this with The X-Files and a few of their \"companion guides\". It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I do recall it calming the cravings between episodes. The next series I went die-hard on was Lost. Lost was a book lover's dream. I came to the series a year late, but caught up on the entire first season in a sleep-deprived, feverish mad rush three days before the second one premiered. Not too long after, I nearly died and went to heaven when I discovered the Lost Lit List, realizing the show was based loosely on and influenced highly by tons of incredibly smart and strange books. Hence the birth of my Flight 815er's Goodreads group. Mythology to discuss and books to read?! Both of these elements were welcome additions to the way I experienced the show. And yes, looking back, I see that I may have taken things a wee bit too far with that one. And no, I'm not sorry.So now, here we are, three seasons into AMC's The Walking Dead, and I'm starting to feel those same awful stirrings all over again. My co-workers are getting sick of talking to me. My oldest called it quits when Dale died and my husband just isn't getting into it the way that I am. And when I found out that the show was taking a two month \"mid-season break\", I admit it. I started to freak. But someone, let's call him The Walking Dead God, was looking out for me, because while I was wandering the audio bins at my local Book Warehouse a few weeks ago, I stumbled across Rise of the Governor.Now, yes, I know there were a gazillion TWD comics before the tv series came out, but I'm not really a comic book reader. Something about the whole \"cartoons smooshed consecutively into small panels, some of which might contain words, some not\" turns me off. But we'll come back to this in a minute. I promise.Did I mention how crazy the timing of this whole thing is? I mean, not only are we coming up on the mid-season break when I stumble on this audiobook, but we are ONLY NOW BEING INTRODUCED to the Governor. And this audiobook - which was first published last year - just happens to tell the story of how the Governor became the Governor. I mean, could The Walking Dead God have timed this any better for me? No. The answer to that is no.Rise of the Governor, written by Robert Kirkman (creator of The Walking Dead comics) and Jay Bonansinga, is the first in a series of three books that expand heavily on the Governor's story line. Had I listened to this last season, when it first released, without prior knowledge of Philip Blake and his daughter Penny, the novel may have had a much lesser impact on me. Don't forget, I only know The Walking Dead through the eyes of the TV series. I come into all of this without any prior knowledge or biases. With the introduction of the Governor this season, I happily devoured the audiobook, seeking any and all information the writers were willing to give me on the history behind this incredibly secretive, twisted individual. And Fred Berman works wonderfully as the narrator, his voice perfectly sets the pace and tone of the The Walking Dead universe.In this book, we learn very little about the zombie outbreak - a theme we're used to, whether we like it or not - and begin following Philip and Penny, his brother Brian, and two of their closest friends as they run from their hometown towards the hope of a refugee center in Atlanta. The group travels from place to place, scavenging what they can, fighting off hordes of zombies, and do their best to try and keep their wits about them. Though told in omniscient \"third person\" narrative, the book spends quite a bit of time focusing on Brian, Philip's older brother - a skinny, nervous man who plays babysitter to little Penny throughout most of the story - and, of course, on Philip, our Alpha Male.Everything Philip does is driven by his desire to protect his daughter and you get the sense that he is barely straddling the right side of sanity as the decisions he makes for the group push them further apart and deeper into danger. When they finally make it into Atlanta, and discover there is no rescue, no refugee center, no escape from the streets that are teeming with the dead, they meet up with another small group of survivors. Penny and our guys settle in nicely and things start looking up.. until Philip falls in love with one of the women and takes things way too far. In an instant, Philip single-handedly ruins what was, up to that point, the best thing the group had going for them, and as they're sent on their way with no supplies and no weapons, we begin to discover the monster within him that has been tensing itself just beneath his skin.As the group makes their way out of Atlanta and seeks out new shelter, Brian and Nick (the one remaining friend), worry over Philip's mental state. Their increasing concern only agitates Philip more, and it all comes to head when their newest \"home\" is raided by a bunch of druggie survivors who want what they've got. It is here that we uncover how little Penny turned, and it is here that we watch, helpless, as Philip descends completely and uncontrollably into madness.The story wraps itself up in the town of Woodbury, an off-the-beaten-path town that our dazed and damaged group manage to stumble into. A settlement of disconnected survivors that appears to be run by no one, Woodbury offers our men a place to call their own, and is the scene of the story's greatest twist.Though you can certainly see it coming, Rise of the Governor will deliver fans of the show - those who have not read the comics - a sucker-punch shot straight to the solar plexus. It will immediately change the way you view the show. And although I've been told this book follows the story line of the Governor as written in the comics, I have a hunch that the TV show is splitting off from the comics and giving our Philip a life he never lived...When I finished the audio, I read through a few of the reviews that were posted to Goodreads. Do I agree with the masses about the fact that the authors dwell a little too much on what everyone, zombies included, is wearing? Perhaps. Is the writing sometimes as clumsy and awkward as the shuffling, re-animated, rotting corpses? It very well may be. (Is it as bad as that analogy I just tried to pull off? erm....) Am I ashamed to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the back story and insight into he-who-had-been-named \"Villain of the Year\" when he debuted in the comics? Absolutely not. None of that mattered to me because I wasn't expecting this to be the next Nobel Prize Winner. I was craving more of The Walking Dead and this story satisfied my hunger more than Penny's bucket of bloody hands and fingers ever could. Rise of the Governor is the ultimate guilty-pleasure read and a kick-ass companion guide to the TV show.Even better than that, now that I've gotten a taste of the what the show is hiding, it's turned me on to the comic books. And if you think this book is a game-changer... you ain't seen nothing yet!"}, {"userName": "Cassie-la", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10214072-cassie-la", "userReview": "REVIEW ALSO ON: http://bibliomantics.com/2011/12/09/a......I was a little wary to start this book. Comics and prose novels are such different mediums, and I was suspicious of the success of the idea. Although Bill Willingham\u2019s Fables novel Peter and Max has amazing reviews to back it and the same can be said of Shawn Thorgersen\u2019s rewrite of the American manga series Bizenghast with Bizenghast: the Novel. Sadly, the same cannot be said of this novel, which is pretty much one giant FAIL.The story itself isn\u2019t horrible, but the writing sure as hell is. For one, this novel is co-authored by thriller author Jay Bonansinga who doesn\u2019t even seem to get many props since Robert Kirkman\u2019s name is way bigger. So it\u2019s difficult to tell who is at fault for this mess. Since his name is larger, and he\u2019s advertised as the author most everywhere, I will henceforth place the blame solely on Robert Kirkman. Sorry buddy, this isn\u2019t a Super Dinosaur review.My first indication that this would be filled with messy prose is a ridiculous sentence on the first page. It begins, \u201cSadly, the only hands Brian currently owns are busy right now, covering the tiny ears of a little girl in the closet next to him.\u201d I read this sentence three times, wondering if the pair was in two adjoined closets or if Brian has Shadow Cat powers and can magically reach through walls to cover the ears of small children. Things only get worse from here. Prepare yourselves.Confusing sentence aside, which any good editor would have made Kirkman fix, the next 300 pages are full of roughly 300 awkward similes to slog through. I say this is an estimate because some pages contain no similes and some pages contain three or more. I wrote down some of my favorites for the amusement of everyone:\u201c\u2026 The dead thing wilts like a noodle.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Launching into the air like giant flailing birds.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yanking the oxygen tank along\u2026 Like a stubborn child being pulled by an impatient nanny.\u201d\u201cHe pats the top of the codger\u2019s bald pate like he\u2019s petting a rabbit.\u201dAnd those are just my top four, imagine what other amazing similes are hidden within the pages that I zoned out too much to write down. Seriously though, do not read just for the lulz, it\u2019s not worth it.The next convention that is more distracting than anything is the abundance of medical terms. Kirkman writes really action packed scenes and then will pull the reader immediately out of the moment with words like: parietal lobe, fibrous membrane, dura mater, cerebrospinal fluid, and parietal hemisphere. Smashing bodies can be explained without hefty medical terms that detract from the only exciting bits in the reading. If Google spell check does not recognize the words, and you didn\u2019t invent them, nor is it a medical journal they should be chucked.Finally, I found a lot of events to be highly implausible. Reading this book was like watching a really bad B movie, or anything that involves an evil villain giving away all his plans to the hero. The first occurs when Philip and company take shelter in a McMansion. Despite their hammering alerting several zombies while building a barrier, it doesn\u2019t awaken the hungry zombie boy who has been locked in a dog house next to them FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK. The second instance is when three grown men find it impossible to chase down and catch a little girl. Lastly, Brian finds a town that still has power, enough to run an X-Ray machine, despite no mention of generators anywhere in the vicinity. I CALL SHENANIGANS ON THIS ENTIRE NOVEL!"}, {"userName": "Sue Moro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677076-sue-moro", "userReview": "This book is the first in a trilogy focusing on one of the most controversial characters in The Walking Dead series so far, that of the Governor of Woodbury. He first makes his appearance half way through the graphic novel compendium one, and his story line is just beginning in season three of the television series.As the story begins, the zombie outbreak has already occurred and people are struggling to survive. Brain Blake and his younger brother, Philip, are traveling with their high school buddies, Bobby and Nick, and a young girl named Penney. They are attempting to make their way towards Atlanta where they believe a refugee center has been set up. In typical Walking Dead fashion not all will survive the journey. Their group will grow as they meet up with other survivors, and dwindle yet again as they come to realize that danger lies not just from Biters but from other desperate survivors as well.The pacing of the book is quick and filled with plenty of action and nail biting encounters. Philip, the younger of the two brothers is also the stronger more natural leader of the group. He starts to break under the strain of protecting everyone and spirals down a very angry, dark path. The others notice the changes and become fearful of were they will lead and yet no one is prepared to step up and fill the roll. I was very frustrated and angry that the others failed to do anything to control Philip.I had some issues with this book. There were some inconsistencies within the story. At times they avoided using guns for fear the noise would draw the Biters to them, and at other times, they are blasting away irregardless of the danger all around them. Also, I was dissatisfied with the ending of the book. Throughout the course of the story, the reader is lead to believe something and then right at the end it's completely turned around. I don't want to reveal what that is (spoilers), but I felt cheated by the authors in their effort to create a shocking ending.The next book in the trilogy is called The Road to Woodbury. I feel that the titles of the first two books should be switched. The first book ends with our characters having arrived at Woodbury, hence the book has been their journey there. The book ends by revealing who will become the Governor, so his rise to that position will assumably be detailed in the second book.Overall, if enjoy the series and would like to know more about how the Governor came to be such a nasty bastard, or you just enjoy a good zombie story than this book is for you."}, {"userName": "Calypso", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6068064-calypso", "userReview": "\"The Walking Dead - A Ascens\u00e3o do Governador\" foi um livro que rapidamente me despertou a curiosidade, mais n\u00e3o fosse por ser eu uma f\u00e3 da s\u00e9rie \"The Walking Dead\". Apesar de nunca ter sido uma f\u00e3 do governador (na s\u00e9rie de TV) assim que tive oportunidade inicie a leitura deste livro. \u00c9 um livro repleto de ac\u00e7\u00e3o onde acompanhamos a viagem de Philip, a sua filha Penny, o seu irm\u00e3o mais velho Brian e dois amigos de Philip: Nick e Bobby.Desde cedo Philip mostra que tem capacidades de lideran\u00e7a sempre seguidas pelos seus companheiros, enquanto o seu irm\u00e3o Brian \u00e9 o elemento mais fraco do grupo acabando por se tornar numa esp\u00e9cie de ama para Penny, tentando proteg\u00ea-la do terr\u00edvel mundo em que se v\u00eaem encarcerados.Como todos os f\u00e3s da s\u00e9rie sabem, o governador \u00e9 um homem algo demente e no livro \u00e9-nos mostrado e porqu\u00ea de o ser. Como n\u00e3o sou verdadeiramente f\u00e3 da personagem e n\u00e3o o conseguia imaginar de forma alguma como \u00e9 descrito no livro mas sempre com a imagem dele na s\u00e9rie dei por mim a achar o livro um tanto ou quanto aborrecido, sim \u00e9 certo que h\u00e1 zombies, sim \u00e9 certo que eles s\u00e3o mortos e que \u00e9 sangue e massa encef\u00e1lica para todo o lado e sei l\u00e1 que mais flu\u00eddos a saltar sempre que lhe partem o cr\u00e2nio. Achei tudo isso demasiado exagerado assim, como as constantes repeti\u00e7\u00f5es de: merda, estamos fodidos e express\u00f5es do g\u00e9nero. Eu reconhe\u00e7o que s\u00e3o as express\u00f5es que mais seriam usadas se estiv\u00e9ssemos a passar pelo que eles est\u00e3o mas ainda assim, nunca gostei de este tipo de linguagem num livro, principalmente quando existe em praticamente todas as santas p\u00e1ginas dele.Nenhum personagem me cativou minimamente, nunca me senti dentro daquele universo e \u00e0 medida que ia vendo a dem\u00eancia do Philip aumentar s\u00f3 dava por mim a pensar: este gajo \u00e9 realmente doido.Estava perto de terminar o livro j\u00e1 com 2 estrelas (um it was ok) na cabe\u00e7a para lhe dar quando eis que a \u00faltima coisa que eu poderia imaginar acontece. Senti-me literalmente KO, claro que depois certas coisas que tinha ouvido pessoas dizerem durante a s\u00e9rie me come\u00e7aram a fazer mais sentido mas nunca, nunca esperei aquele acontecimento.Resumindo um livro que agradar\u00e1 sem d\u00favida aos f\u00e3s da s\u00e9rie que tenham especial interesse pelo governador e consigam mesmo vibrar com o seu passado.

To find out how the dreaded governor came to be.The book ultimately follows brothers Philip and Brian Blake, Philips young daughter Penny and their child hood friend Nick. Pretty much right from the beginning of the \"turn over\" you know that although Philip is the younger brother he runs the show, taking up the responsibility of keeping everyone alive. And throughout the book who really get to see how he handles some heavy situations, and how the result of his decisions chip away at his sanity.I thought the pacing of the book was decent, it kept me reading because I was eager to find out what exactly makes Philip snap and become the ruthless man that will take over Woodbury, there were some things that bothered me, for example, there's quite a few building up moments that kind of let me down, I was expecting some \"holy sh** kill me now!!!!\" Moments but it just didn't pan out that way for me. Another thing that really bugged me was the use of LOUD guns and ROARING cars, the group clearly knew the zombies are attracted to sound yet that didn't seen to stop them from blasting guns everywhere to kill them, I was hoping for some awesome ninja killing skills.

Honestly I was super excited for this book when I first heard about it, I mean it was a chance to explore the wider world of Walking Dead. Sadly it's a slow book that, while having a great ending, is paced like the comics. Don't get me wrong I love the Walking Dead comics, but a slow 30 page issue is different then 30 pages of slowness in a book. In the book it rises and falls like a comic book series, which works wonderfully... for comic books, where the reader is not only reading a page but looking at fantastic art. As i stated earlier, 30 slow pages in a comic book is different then 30 slow pages in a book, because 30 slow pages in the Walking Dead books is backed up by Charlie Adlard's amazing art work. In the book Kirkman and Bonansinga over describe things, almost to the point where it reads as a guide for an artist.... which is tiresome for a reader. Also there is little that one can connect to in regards to character. This book took me way longer then it should have to read and honestly I doubt I will ever re read it. That being said, if you are a fan of the comic book series you must read this book.... this book is full of little things that connect Rick's party to the Governor in ways that they would never know and while it's a slow read the ending is worth it to any fan."}], "description": "Written by the creator of THE WALKING DEAD comics and based on the world of the TV series starring Andrew Lincoln Based on The Walking Dead graphic novels/comic books and the series starring Andrew Lincoln ( Teachers , This Life and Love, Actually ) and written/produced by Frank Darabont whose previous credits include The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile , this is a new trilogy of books written by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga, author of Perfect Victim and Shattered .
