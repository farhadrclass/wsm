Celan\u2019s work first entered my life during research for my Master\u2019s Thesis on language and brutalisation in Nazi Germany. I fell in love almost immediately. Since then I have read numerous translations, with side-by-side German texts where possible, and any of his prose, correspondence or speeches I could locate. Any response to a reading of Celan in translation must navigate the fact that the German language defines him. His work is a response to, and a breathing through, that polluted and always-already shattered etymological world. And yet\u2026 Somehow, and most notably in these translations, something of his voice makes it through. And, as small as this something may be, it is worth more to me than any other poetry I have had the good fortune to read. He does not hide from words; not from their brokenness or their betrayal of us. He writes with an urgency made more pressing by the feel of each phrase crumbling between his fingers. These poems are essential reading."}, {"userName": "Jibran", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407952-jibran", "userReview": "Speak-But keep yes and no unsplitI make no claims. I am not so presumptuous as to give an impression of having telescoped like a Galileo into Paul Celan\u2019s poetic cosmos, his crumbling stars and dug up black holes, and a breathing, foaming spirit of life that is indestructible in the face of annihilation. So all I will do here is hang on to that stony oppression bearing down on my soul by the ferocious power of his verse; what I will do here is convey something of the havoc wrought in me through a medium as lamentably limited as words on a computer screen. It is not easy. Not many who have seen pain, misery, and death so up close are able to generate an intellectual distance that enables them to turn their harrowing experience into a language of poetry that purifies the misfortunes of existence in such a way as to transform them into a song \u2013 a song of death. As I charted his poetic journey I discovered a person who was trying to unlive his experience by removing himself \u2013 the I \u2013 from his writings by subjecting the dialectic of suffering to meticulous, pristine forms that elevated his words far above the confines of 'the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart'.Here is Celan\u2019s most well-known poem Fugue of Death which fits the epithet of terrible beauty to a tee. He captures his direct experience of a Jewish captive in Nazi death camps by turning it into 'black milk'. (I am quoting first few lines with a link to the complete poem)Black milk of daybreak we drink it at nightfallwe drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at nightdrink it and drink itwe are digging a grave in the sky it is ample to lie thereA man in the house he plays with the serpents he writeshe writes when the night falls to Germany your goldenhair Margaretehe writes it and walks from the house the stars glitterhe whistles his dogs uphe whistles his Jews out and orders a grave to be dug inthe earthhe commands us strike up for the danceBlack milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink in the mornings at noon we drink you atnightfalldrink you and drink you FULL TEXT\"Thinner you grow, less knowable, finer\"Strangely, Paul Celan renounced Fugue of Death in his later years for being \u2018too direct\u2019 and hindered its republication, without success. His desire for writing absolute poetry, under the influence of French surrealism, led him to search for a more refined mode of expression. For this reason it becomes very difficult to interpret his later work with any degree of certainty. What he did was weave an intricate web of cryptic allusions and variegated images into which we \u2013 the readers - interpose our own bone-and-blood in order to make some sense of what is being conveyed. His later poems may be seen as prototypes of poetry, sort of a template that sets the limits of what can be known about human perversion, which we \u2013 the readers \u2013 are welcome to sully by interjecting our own plebeian suffering into it. For instance:Speak, You AlsoSpeak, you also,speak as the last,have your say.Speak -But keep yes and no unsplit,And give your say this meaning:give it the shade.Give it shade enough,give it as muchas you know has been dealt out betweenmidday and midday and midnight,Look around:look how it all leaps alive -where death is! Alive!He speaks truly who speaks the shade.But now shrinks the place where you stand:Where now, stripped by shade, will you go?Upward. Grope your way up.Thinner you grow, less knowable, finer.Finer: a thread by whichit wants to be lowered, the star:to float further down, down belowwhere it sees itself gutter: on sand dunesof wandering words.Here is another poem that marks his new style.FlowerThe stone.The stone in the air, which I followed.Your eye, as blind as the stone.We werehands,we baled the darkness empty, we foundthe word that ascended summer:flower.Flower - a blind man's word.Your eye and mine:they seeto water.Growth.Heart wall upon heart walladds petals to it.One more word like this word, and the hammerswill swing over open ground.One fascinating aspect of his illusive language is to deploy one word wonders which turn the reading of the preceding lines on its head and force us to readjust our perspective, and re-read it. In Below, note the \u2018awakening\u2019.Led home into oblivionthe sociable talk ofour slow eyes.Led home, syllable after syllable, sharedout among the dayblind dice, for whichthe playing hand reaches out, large,awakening.And the too much of my speaking:heaped up round the littlecrystal dressed in the style of your silence.And look at these spine-tingling lines, a heartrending image of a captive who looks up but, instead of gazing in despair at the ceiling, feels the nearness of sky. From Language MeshEye\u2019s roundness between the bars.Vibratile monad eyelidpropels itself upward,releases a glance.Iris, swimmer, dreamless and dreary:the sky, heart-grey, must be near.And, towards the end of the poem, he sees two puddles made by rain which, though within distance of a kiss, are like crippled mouths - beautiful image, simply brilliant!The flagstones. On them,close to each other, the twoheart-grey puddles:twomouthsfull of silence."}, {"userName": "peiman-mir5 rezakhani", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "I understand that, as a general rule, assessment of a work's quality should not be confused with moral judgements about the author's character. Monsters can write like angels, and vice versa. It's immaterial whether or not T.S. Eliot was beastly to his wife - it does nothing to alter the uncanny power of his poetry, the way whole chunks of it worm their way into your brain to the point you find yourself muttering lines under your breath, without even knowing precisely what they mean.I also understand that human memory is so fallible that the only rational posture to adopt regarding the veracity of any given memoir/autobiography is one of extreme skepticism. Even if a writer has the very best intentions of presenting an unvarnished, spin-free version of past events, the resulting account will nonetheless be subjective, incomplete, and subject to error. It's just the way memory works - even the most meticulous author will, consciously or unconsciously, omit certain details and embellish or invent others, as he shapes the narrative to be consistent with the story in his head. Viewed this way, all professions of \"truth\" or \"accuracy\" are suspect where memoirs and (auto)biographical writing is concerned. Indignation about the perceived liberties with truth taken by someone like James Frey seems both naive and misplaced.In practice, of course, things can be more complicated. At an emotional level, we don't want the author whose work we really admire and enjoy to be a total a**hole (what would that say about us)? As far as memoirs go, suppose I stumble across one of those rare books where I feel a visceral connection, as if the author had been writing just for me. If serious questions then arise about the author's honesty, that he or she has misrepresented his own experience to \"heighten the reality\" (or some comparable weasel phrase), then I am likely to feel manipulated and disappointed. In fact, the more I was moved by the account that I believed to be \"truthful\", the greater my disappointment is likely to be.One of the most disturbing books I've read in connection with the Holocaust is Jerzy Kosinski's \"The Painted Bird\". First published in 1965, it tells the story of a young boy (possibly Jewish, possibly Gypsy) who is separated from his parents and wanders about small towns scattered around Eastern Europe (presumably Poland) during World War II. With few exceptions, the country people he has to deal with are portrayed as extraordinarily cruel, engaging in almost any kind of sexual or social deviance you care to name. The cruelty, viciousness and amorality of the villagers manifest themselves in episodes of incest, bestiality and rape. When the book was published, to great critical acclaim, the presumption was that Kosinksi's account was based on his own experiences during the war, which belief he did nothing to dispel.When \"The Painted Bird\" was finally published in Poland (it was banned there for over a decade), the Polish couple who rescued Kosi\u0144ski (then Josef Lewinkopf) during the war, even though in German occupied Poland any kind of help to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death often for the whole family, became highly indignant about how they were depicted. They recognized the names of Jewish children sheltered by them (who also survived the war), presented in the novel as victims of abuse by characters based on them. They informed the press about the fact that Kosi\u0144ski \"had lived through the years of Nazi occupation not only in safety, but in comfort\" under their protection. Jerzy was baptized and received Holy Communion; he served as an altar boy. Summing up the ensuing reception of the book in Poland, Phillip Routh wrote: \"The Poles branded Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski a Holocaust profiteer because the novel, which drew comparison with The Diary of Anne Frank, was immediately granted the status of a chronicle of the Holocaust,\" while \u2013 at the same time \u2013 exciting a form of lust reminiscent of the extreme part of modern day Holocaust pornography.\"I agree with this last assessment. Whatever you might think about the trustworthiness of memoirs in general, the deliberate faking of a \"holocaust memoir\" seems particularly shameful. When there are still people who would deny that the systematic killing of European Jews was carried out during WWII, it is all the more important to get the record straight. This means bearing witness not only to the atrocities that were committed, but also acknowledging the many acts of courage and refusals to bow to tyranny. That Kosinski not only failed to acknowledge the decency of the family that saved him, instead presenting a slanderous and inaccurate portrayal that reflected nothing of his actual experience, is despicable.It could be argued that what happened in Europe during the Holocaust was essentially too horrific to be amenable to treatment in a \"standard\" memoir or \"novel\". I think there is some validity to this argument (though I think it in no way exonerates Kosinski, who cynically exploited the sympathy engendered by \"The painted Bird\" as far as he could). This brings me ... finally ... to Paul Celan, and the two books which are the direct subject of this review. Celan, born to a Jewish family in 1920, survived the war to become one of the post-war era's major German-language poets. Although Celan survived, his family were killed in Eastern European death camps; after the war he experienced considerable survivor guilt, and eventually committed suicide in 1970.Celan's poetry is powerful and difficult. He has a penchant for neologisms that would give even a fluent German speaker pause. Fortunately, there are two translations that make his work accessible to English speakers: Michael Hamburger's \"Poems of Paul Celan\", and the more recent \"Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan\", translated by John Felstiner. Both are well worth your time. Neither translation is uniformly better, though if I had to pick a winner, I'd give the nod to Felstiner. Inspection of both translations of Celan's best-known poem, \"Todesfuge\" (Death Fugue) should make it clear why.Schwarze Milch der Fr\u00fche wir trinken sie abendswir trinken sie mittags und morgens wir trinken sie nachtswir trinken und trinkenwir schaufeln ein Grab in den L\u00fcften da liegt man nicht engEin Mann wohnt im Haus der spielt mit den Schlangen der schreibtder schreibt wenn es dunkelt nach Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margareteer schreibt es und tritt vor das Haus und es blitzen die Sterneer pfeift seine R\u00fcden herbei er pfeift seine Juden hervorl\u00e4\u00dft schaufeln ein Grab in der Erdeer befiehlt uns spielt auf nun zum Tanz.Felstiner: Black milk of daybreak we drink it at eveningwe drink it at midday and morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drinkwe shovel a grave in the air where you won't lie too crampedA man lives in the house he plays with his vipers he writeshe writes when it grows dark to Deutschlandyour golden hair Margaretahe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are all sparklinghe whistles his hounds to stay close he whistles his Jews into rowshas them shovel a grave in the groundhe commands us play up for the dance.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundownwe drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drink itwe dig a grave in the breezes there one lies unconfinedA man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writeshe writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margaretehe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are flashing he whistles his pack outhe whistles his Jews out in earth has them dig for a gravehe commands us strike up for the dance.Schwarze Milch der Fr\u00fche wir trinken dich nachtswir trinken dich mittags der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlandwir trinken dich abends und morgens wir trinken und trinkender Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland sein Auge ist blauer trifft dich mit bleierner Kugel er trifft dich genauein Mann wohnt im Haus dein goldenes Haar Margareteer hetzt seine R\u00fcden auf uns er schenkt uns ein Grab in der Lufter spielt mit den Schlangen und tr\u00e4umet der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar SulamithFelstiner:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at midday Death is a master aus Deutschlandwe drink you at evening and morning we drink and we drinkthis Death is ein Meister aus Deutschland his eye it is bluehe shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and truea man lives in the house your goldenes Haar Margaretehe looses his hounds on us grants us a grave in the airhe plays with his vipers and daydreamsder Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar Sulamith.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at noon Death is a master from Germanywe drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink youDeath is a master from Germany his eyes are bluehe strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is truea man lives in the house your golden hair Margaretehe sets his pack on to us he grants us a grave in the airhe plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master from Germanyyour golden hair Margareteyour ashen hair Shulamith.Felstiner's choices seem both closer to the original text (compare the two lines: \"he shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and true\", 'he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true'; only the first matches the driving rhythm which is such an essential part of the power of the original) and more daring, as for instance his decision to add more German words with each repetition of the line \"der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland\", until the German has taken over completely in the end. This seems like an inspired choice to me - the result is a much more powerful rendering of the sense of the poem.But this is just one poem, and Hamburger acquits himself well elsewhere. Both books are well worth reading. A web search on \"Todesfuge\" turns up links to the full text of the poem, with several other translations besides those considered here. One critic has called it 'one of the most important poems of the century', an assessment I completely agree with."}, {"userName": "Les ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3614074-les", "userReview": "Read in 1999.Devastating.Death Fugueby Paul Celan\ttranslated by Jerome RothenbergBlack milk of morning we drink you at dusktimewe drink you at noontime and dawntime we drink you at nightwe drink and drinkwe scoop out a grave in the sky where it\u2019s roomy to lieThere\u2019s a man in this house who cultivates snakes and who writeswho writes when it\u2019s nightfall nach Deutschland your golden hair Margareta he writes it and walks from the house and the stars all start flashing he whistles his dogs to draw nearwhistles his Jews to appear starts us scooping a grave out of sandhe commands us to play for the danceBlack milk of morning we drink you at nightwe drink you at dawntime and noontime we drink you at dusktimewe drink and drinkThere\u2019s a man in this house who cultivates snakes and who writeswho writes when it\u2019s nightfall nach Deutschland your golden hair Margaretayour ashen hair Shulamite we scoop out a grave in the sky where it\u2019s roomy to lieHe calls jab it deep in the soil you lot there you other men sing and playhe tugs at the sword in his belt he swings it his eyes are bluejab your spades deeper you men you other men you others play up again for the danceBlack milk of morning we drink you at nightwe drink you at noontime and dawntime we drink you at dusktimewe drink and drinkthere\u2019s a man in this house your golden hair Margaretayour ashen hair Shulamite he cultivates snakesHe calls play that death thing more sweetly Death is a gang-boss aus Deutschlandhe calls scrape that fiddle more darkly then hover like smoke in the airthen scoop out a grave in the clouds where it\u2019s roomy to lieBlack milk of morning we drink you at nightwe drink you at noontime Death is a gang-boss aus Deutschlandwe drink you at dusktime and dawntime we drink and drinkDeath is a gang-boss aus Deutschland his eye is bluehe shoots you with leaden bullets his aim is truethere\u2019s a man in this house your golden hair Margaretahe sets his dogs on our trail he gives us a grave in the skyhe cultivates snakes and he dreams Death is a gang-boss aus Deutschland your golden hair Margaretayour ashen hair Shulamite"}, {"userName": "S.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612774-s", "userReview": "Paul Celan stands among the most powerful poets. His poems are distilled and piercing, usually compact yet heavy constructions of well chosen words. Most poetry readers know his story. Born in eastern Europe to Jewish, German-speaking parents, he lost his parents to Nazi criminals, as well as any sense of \u201chome,\u201d I would assume. It\u2019s strangely just that the greatest poet of the holocaust is a native German speaker. S/he just as well could have been Polish or Dutch or Italian or Hungarian. But here we have the victim speaking in the tongue of the perpetrator, the two are united in language. How better to penetrate and reflect?Celan is most famous for his poem \"Todesfuge,\" which is a masterpiece (\u201cBlack milk of daybreak...\"). I think John Felstiner, the translator of this volume, does an excellent job of rendering it in English. Before writing this short review, I compared his with some other translations and he scores high. The translation by Jerome Rothenburg on www.poets.org, for example, is too stylized. Where Celan writes \u201cwir trinken sie abends,\u201d Rothenburg writes \u201cwe drink you at dusktime.\u201d First, \u201cabends\u201d is simply evening and not \u201cdusktime,\u201d and the \u201csie\u201d with a small \u2018s\u2019 is \u201cit,\u201d not \u201cyou.\u201d Later in the poem, Celan does say \u201cwir trinken dich,\u201d or we drink you, but this does not and should not happen at the start of the poem. I don't mind translators taking liberties for the sake of idiom and making the poem comfortable in its new language, but I do take issue with imposing unnatural 'flourish.'Because Celan uses a lot of German compound words in his poetry, translators often import them as single words into English, where they can look uncomfortable. I think compound words are one of the charms of Celan\u2019s poetry, and that charm can get lost whether the word is preserved as one or split as is more natural in English. Sometimes it works. Fadensonnen is fine as Threadsuns; Atemwende is fine as Breathturn. We do build such words in poetry in English, too, but they stand out more in English than they do in German. I think Felstiner handles them well, though not always.For me Celan is a poet who has really known despair, not the personal despair of the depressed insurance salesman cured by Xanax but the despair induced by having witnessed and experienced the depravity and inhumanity of mankind. He is shocked at once to silence and to speech. His is the terrible wound that won\u2019t close, that should not close because we need to know it. These are the things you will find in Celan poems: bread, almonds, roses, wine, ash, soil, snow, stones, breath, eyes. He is not a fancy poet, and he is economical with his symbols to great effect. **Count up the almonds,count what was bitter and kept you waking,count me in too:I sought your eye when you looked out and no one saw you,I spun the secret threadwhere the dew you mused onslid down to pitcherstended by a word that reached no one\u2019s heart.There you first fully entered the name that is yours.you stepped toward yourself on steady feet,the hammers swung free in the belfry of your silence,things overheard thrust through to you,what\u2019s dead put its arm around you too,and the three of you walked through the evening.Render me bitter.Number me among the almonds.**I would definitely recommend this volume, which offers a good selection of Celan in clean translations. It is not complete. The book Mohn und Ged\u00e4chtnis alone, Poppy and Memory in English, for example, has nearly sixty poems. There are only 15 poems from that book in this volume. I always have to remind myself that I speak German fluently and can read the original but I do like to have my native English, too."}, {"userName": "Irmak", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18184151-irmak", "userReview": "Ellerin zamanlarla dolu geldin bana - dedim ki:Kahverengi de\u011fil sa\u00e7lar\u0131n.

Adorno is probably most famous for saying something like, how can there be poetry after Auschwitz? Maybe that is not exactly what he wrote, or maybe he didn't mean that there can be no poetry after Auschwitz, but rather what would a poetry look like after what had happened, how can one return to the old poetry, to say Romanticism when what had happened happened and the words of old poetry had been co-opted into the totalitarian myths that fueled a most civilized barbarity. If you are of my demographic and you dwell too long on the barbarity of Europe's twentieth century you are accused of pessimism (an awful crime in our day and age), especially if you happen to be taking this stand against aging sixties liberal radicals who seriously don't want to think that they didn't make the world a better place, and that the last twenty eight years (give or take a couple of decades) of US gross misconduct is just some aberration of sorts that stands against the greater trend of progress the world has enjoyed under their influence and tutelage. When you're head is shoved up your ass far enough or buried deep enough in the sand you can tell yourself anything that makes you feel better about your role in the world. You can also say that the holocaust is the past, things are better now and then blissfully move on. That is sort of what the world did after Auschwitz, they vowed \"Never Again\", but that didn't stop it from continuing on, maybe it wasn't European Jewry, but say Soviet and Chinese dissidents, people in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, in East Timor, in Latin America and the list goes on. Mass killings, ruling by terror and violence, elimination of the unpure, the undesirables or just those who are different. But because you say Never Again you can go on your merry way and believe the world is a better place. In this world view Adorno's statement about poetry is absurd, poetry is exactly the same. Nothing about beauty, or any of that silly shit has been effected, so get over it say a fucking Kaddish and get ready for global hegemony. Celan's poetry is rather the answer to Adorno's question about poetry. It is poetry that tries to look in the face of the horror of what had happened and give an utterance to the unspeakable quality of it all. His poetry is a reminder of the magnitude of what had happened, and that almost any talk about it is an absurd reduction to phrases lacking in any real meaning. His poetry navigates this almost necessary silence and mourns the loss of not just the people who died but the death also of the world that has survived the holocaust. The poetry tries to express this loss, and express the way that words can only fail to adequately accomplish this massive task. In the spaces between the sparse lines, in what isn't said but which exists just under the surface of the words the meaning lies, the awful pain of mourning and attempts to understand the why of what has happened. God pops his head up quite a bit in these poems, because he's one of the big problems with understanding what had happened. If there is a God how could he let this happen, how can one still believe in the Old Testament God after this? The easy answer is to say, well he didn't exist to begin with; of course (well maybe not of course) this answer leads to the more horrifying relization that if God doesn't exist then we are some really fucked up people, and we have to cope with not just an absurd existence but a terribly horrific and absurd existence. Evil takes on a whole new dimension that I don't think most people want to seriously confront if it is separated from the religious dichotomy of good and evil. If you don't believe me on this one take a couple of minutes to just think about all of the fucked up things in the world, and take away any underlying meaning to the universe and try to come to terms with what it means for us all. Then think about how much nicer it is to think about the same evil existing but which is balanced off by some kind of redeeming factor, and see which view of existence seems rosier. So God is here in various guises, but God in a form that is both on the docket, so to speak, for what happened and as gone, or dead or whatever phrase you want to use. This is different than the contemporary vogue atheism that in a feel good way dances around about there being no God and comforts by making the horror of the world as the result of fanatic religion and narrow minded faith. Rather there is nothing to be joyful about the lack of God, what is the consolation prize in living in a world without God? Celan confronts this absent, mute, impotent, ignoble deity in a variety of ways, and leaves unsettling questions instead of any understanding. So, um, now that I've ranted about lots of things, I guess I can say that I liked this book a lot. It's not nice reading to make you feel good, but it is a great book to make you confront the dark side of humanity and the self."}, {"userName": "Leola", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7196445-leola", "userReview": "Thread Suns Thread sunsabove the grey-black wilderness.A tree-high thoughttunes in to light's pitch: there arestill songs to be sung on the other sideof mankind."}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "N\u00e3o \u00e9 de f\u00e1cil entendimento.

H. Lawrence, to determine where the lines should end\"); Paul Celan is no exception in that most of his poems leave me simply baffled. Part of the problem is the shadow of the Holocaust lingering over many of the poems: an event too awesome and sublime to reduce to words, seemingly reducing Celan to slapping down words and fractured lines in frustration and despair, and not a little guilt, circling around the themes again and again (reminding me of Wittgenstein's famous introduction to Philosophical Investigations).That said, a few of the poems or parts of the poems worked for me - not just the famous \"Fugue of Death\" (WP) but several of the others. In poetry, a few gems is enough, because they stay with one in a way that prose rarely does, and so I forgive Celan for the poems I did not like and myself for the poems I did not get. Some excerpts:\"Aspen Tree...\", pg24:\"Aspen tree, your leaves glance white into the dark. / My mother's hair was never white. / Dandelion, so green is the Ukraine. / My yellow-haired mother did not come home. / Rain cloud, above the well do you hover? / My quiet mother weeps for everyone. / Round star, you wind the golden loop. / My mother's heart was ripped by lead. / Oaken door, who lifted you off your hinges? / My gentle mother cannot return.\"\"Corona\", p32:\"Autumn eats its leaf out of my hand: we are friends. / From the nuts we shell time and we teach it to walk: / then time returns to the shell.\"\"...We stand by the window embracing, and people look / up from the street: / it is time they knew! / It is time the stone made an effort to flower, / time unrest had a beating heart. / It is time it were time. / It is time.\"\"Fugue of Death\", pg33:\"Black milk of daybreak we drink it at nightfall / we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night / drink it and drink it / we are digging a grave in the sky it is ample to lie there / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / he writes it and walks from the house the stars glitter / he whistles his dogs up / he whistles his Jews out and orders a grave to be dug in / the earth / he commands us strike up for the dance / Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night / we drink in the mornings at noon we drink you at / nightfall / drink you and drink you / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / Your ashen hair Shulamith we are digging a grave in the / sky it is ample to lie there...\"\"Thread Suns\", pg83:\"...there are / still songs to be sung on the other side / of mankind.\"\"I Hear that the Axe has Flowered\", pg106:\"I hear that the axe has flowered, / I hear that the place can't be named, / I hear that the bread which looks at him / heals the hanged man, / the bread baked for him by his wife, / I hear that they call life / our only refuge.\"Ironically, the reason I looked up Celan in the first place was a Japanese novella (a doujin for Touhou), Iyokan & Surrounded By Enemies's \nDream and Reality\n, included as a running theme quotes from Celan's From Threshold to Threshold (perhaps because Celan's poems in Japanese bring out the repeated themes of gates/thresholds/transitions, which complements the plot of the novella & a key character). I had been particularly struck by the poem \"The Guest\" from Threshold:\"Long before nightfall / someone who exchanged greetings with darkness / comes to spend the night with you. / Long before daylight / he wakes / and, before leaving, kindles a sleep, / a sleep echoing with footsteps: / you hear him going off, measuring distances, / and you throw your soul / after him.\"And since Selected Poems was available but Threshold was not, I downloaded it to read... and \"The Guest\" was not in it."}, {"userName": "Stela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela", "userReview": "\u201cHe speaks truly who speaks the shade\u201d\nI was eighteen and obsessed with this verse. I can\u2019t remember where I found it, maybe I had read it in a book, maybe someone had given it to me (we used to collect quotes then). I knew it was Paul Celan\u2019s, but I did not know Paul Celan. I did not even know how to pronounce his name \u2013 it sounded French to me, but I had a vague suspicion it could be Romanian. And of course, living in a communist Romania I couldn\u2019t possible make a genuine research and soon I forgot about him or abandoned him for I had just discovered Dostoyevsky, my greatest obsession of all. But, in some corner of my mind, Paul Celan always lingered and thirty years after I can at last put a title and a poem and a book around that strangely beautiful verse. I\u2019ve also learned I was both right and wrong in my assumptions: Celan, an anagram of his real name, Anczel, was used as a pseudonym while publishing in a Romanian periodical, but otherwise his links with Romania were complicated, as were those of all our writers in exile (Cioran\u2019s, Ionesco\u2019s, Eliade\u2019s, etc.) and in his case rather weak \u2013 it is hard to find a veritable influence of Romanian literature in his work, not at the same extent as French and German influence even though the poems he published at Bucharest immediately after WWII were in the Surrealist spirit still effervescent in Romania of that time. Anyway, his penname would eventually be pronounced in a French manner, since he lived in Paris until his death. That said, it is almost uncanny to discover the verse that impressed me so much that it stayed with me all these years contains \u201cin nuce\u201d all his poetic beliefs and obsessions, like a concise ars poetica that rejects confessional and realistic poetry, yet without resorting to the hermetic. The way found is the refuge into the poetic of darkness, both literally and metaphorically, an inexhaustible resource, which will take infinite, forms, all speaking of nothingness. Sometimes it pours inexorably over the destiny of some hopeless prisoners of wars, prisoners of racial hate, prisoners of life: \u201cBlack milk of daybreak we drink it at nightfallwe drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at nightdrink it and drink it\u201d (Fugue of Death)Other times it grows branches to shadow and protect a tragic memory...\u201cAspen tree, your leaves glance white into the dark.My mother's hair was never white.\u201d (Aspen Tree)...when it doesn't exchange the darkness of nothingness with the dryness of the knowledge prying like Argus behind the veil:\u201cGo blind now, today:eternity also is full of eyes \u2013 \u201c(Go Blind Now)For life is only food for death, for perishing is the only reality - and the only salvation from the lie of existence:\"That half-death,suckled big with our life,lay around us, true as an ashen image\" \u2013 (In Prague)Haunted by his tragic past, Paul Celan struggled a while with his inner demons, forever viewing life only as a transit point:\"I hear that they call lifeour only refuge.\" (I Hear that the Axe has Flowered)Like many a damned artist, he experimented Art as a cathartic liberation. But in the end, Death became the supreme poetry.

Monsters can write like angels, and vice versa. It's immaterial whether or not T.S. Eliot was beastly to his wife - it does nothing to alter the uncanny power of his poetry, the way whole chunks of it worm their way into your brain to the point you find yourself muttering lines under your breath, without even knowing precisely what they mean.I also understand that human memory is so fallible that the only rational posture to adopt regarding the veracity of any given memoir/autobiography is one of extreme skepticism. Even if a writer has the very best intentions of presenting an unvarnished, spin-free version of past events, the resulting account will nonetheless be subjective, incomplete, and subject to error. It's just the way memory works - even the most meticulous author will, consciously or unconsciously, omit certain details and embellish or invent others, as he shapes the narrative to be consistent with the story in his head. Viewed this way, all professions of \"truth\" or \"accuracy\" are suspect where memoirs and (auto)biographical writing is concerned. Indignation about the perceived liberties with truth taken by someone like James Frey seems both naive and misplaced.In practice, of course, things can be more complicated. At an emotional level, we don't want the author whose work we really admire and enjoy to be a total a**hole (what would that say about us)? As far as memoirs go, suppose I stumble across one of those rare books where I feel a visceral connection, as if the author had been writing just for me. If serious questions then arise about the author's honesty, that he or she has misrepresented his own experience to \"heighten the reality\" (or some comparable weasel phrase), then I am likely to feel manipulated and disappointed. In fact, the more I was moved by the account that I believed to be \"truthful\", the greater my disappointment is likely to be.One of the most disturbing books I've read in connection with the Holocaust is Jerzy Kosinski's \"The Painted Bird\". First published in 1965, it tells the story of a young boy (possibly Jewish, possibly Gypsy) who is separated from his parents and wanders about small towns scattered around Eastern Europe (presumably Poland) during World War II. With few exceptions, the country people he has to deal with are portrayed as extraordinarily cruel, engaging in almost any kind of sexual or social deviance you care to name. The cruelty, viciousness and amorality of the villagers manifest themselves in episodes of incest, bestiality and rape. When the book was published, to great critical acclaim, the presumption was that Kosinksi's account was based on his own experiences during the war, which belief he did nothing to dispel.When \"The Painted Bird\" was finally published in Poland (it was banned there for over a decade), the Polish couple who rescued Kosi\u0144ski (then Josef Lewinkopf) during the war, even though in German occupied Poland any kind of help to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death often for the whole family, became highly indignant about how they were depicted. They recognized the names of Jewish children sheltered by them (who also survived the war), presented in the novel as victims of abuse by characters based on them. They informed the press about the fact that Kosi\u0144ski \"had lived through the years of Nazi occupation not only in safety, but in comfort\" under their protection. Jerzy was baptized and received Holy Communion; he served as an altar boy. Summing up the ensuing reception of the book in Poland, Phillip Routh wrote: \"The Poles branded Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski a Holocaust profiteer because the novel, which drew comparison with The Diary of Anne Frank, was immediately granted the status of a chronicle of the Holocaust,\" while \u2013 at the same time \u2013 exciting a form of lust reminiscent of the extreme part of modern day Holocaust pornography.\"I agree with this last assessment. Whatever you might think about the trustworthiness of memoirs in general, the deliberate faking of a \"holocaust memoir\" seems particularly shameful. When there are still people who would deny that the systematic killing of European Jews was carried out during WWII, it is all the more important to get the record straight. This means bearing witness not only to the atrocities that were committed, but also acknowledging the many acts of courage and refusals to bow to tyranny. That Kosinski not only failed to acknowledge the decency of the family that saved him, instead presenting a slanderous and inaccurate portrayal that reflected nothing of his actual experience, is despicable.It could be argued that what happened in Europe during the Holocaust was essentially too horrific to be amenable to treatment in a \"standard\" memoir or \"novel\". I think there is some validity to this argument (though I think it in no way exonerates Kosinski, who cynically exploited the sympathy engendered by \"The painted Bird\" as far as he could). This brings me ... finally ... to Paul Celan, and the two books which are the direct subject of this review. Celan, born to a Jewish family in 1920, survived the war to become one of the post-war era's major German-language poets. Although Celan survived, his family were killed in Eastern European death camps; after the war he experienced considerable survivor guilt, and eventually committed suicide in 1970.Celan's poetry is powerful and difficult. He has a penchant for neologisms that would give even a fluent German speaker pause. Fortunately, there are two translations that make his work accessible to English speakers: Michael Hamburger's \"Poems of Paul Celan\", and the more recent \"Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan\", translated by John Felstiner. Both are well worth your time. Neither translation is uniformly better, though if I had to pick a winner, I'd give the nod to Felstiner. Inspection of both translations of Celan's best-known poem, \"Todesfuge\" (Death Fugue) should make it clear why.Schwarze Milch der Fr\u00fche wir trinken sie abendswir trinken sie mittags und morgens wir trinken sie nachtswir trinken und trinkenwir schaufeln ein Grab in den L\u00fcften da liegt man nicht engEin Mann wohnt im Haus der spielt mit den Schlangen der schreibtder schreibt wenn es dunkelt nach Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margareteer schreibt es und tritt vor das Haus und es blitzen die Sterneer pfeift seine R\u00fcden herbei er pfeift seine Juden hervorl\u00e4\u00dft schaufeln ein Grab in der Erdeer befiehlt uns spielt auf nun zum Tanz.Felstiner: Black milk of daybreak we drink it at eveningwe drink it at midday and morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drinkwe shovel a grave in the air where you won't lie too crampedA man lives in the house he plays with his vipers he writeshe writes when it grows dark to Deutschlandyour golden hair Margaretahe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are all sparklinghe whistles his hounds to stay close he whistles his Jews into rowshas them shovel a grave in the groundhe commands us play up for the dance.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundownwe drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drink itwe dig a grave in the breezes there one lies unconfinedA man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writeshe writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margaretehe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are flashing he whistles his pack outhe whistles his Jews out in earth has them dig for a gravehe commands us strike up for the dance.Schwarze Milch der Fr\u00fche wir trinken dich nachtswir trinken dich mittags der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlandwir trinken dich abends und morgens wir trinken und trinkender Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland sein Auge ist blauer trifft dich mit bleierner Kugel er trifft dich genauein Mann wohnt im Haus dein goldenes Haar Margareteer hetzt seine R\u00fcden auf uns er schenkt uns ein Grab in der Lufter spielt mit den Schlangen und tr\u00e4umet der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar SulamithFelstiner:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at midday Death is a master aus Deutschlandwe drink you at evening and morning we drink and we drinkthis Death is ein Meister aus Deutschland his eye it is bluehe shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and truea man lives in the house your goldenes Haar Margaretehe looses his hounds on us grants us a grave in the airhe plays with his vipers and daydreamsder Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar Sulamith.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at noon Death is a master from Germanywe drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink youDeath is a master from Germany his eyes are bluehe strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is truea man lives in the house your golden hair Margaretehe sets his pack on to us he grants us a grave in the airhe plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master from Germanyyour golden hair Margareteyour ashen hair Shulamith.Felstiner's choices seem both closer to the original text (compare the two lines: \"he shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and true\", 'he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true'; only the first matches the driving rhythm which is such an essential part of the power of the original) and more daring, as for instance his decision to add more German words with each repetition of the line \"der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland\", until the German has taken over completely in the end. This seems like an inspired choice to me - the result is a much more powerful rendering of the sense of the poem.But this is just one poem, and Hamburger acquits himself well elsewhere. Both books are well worth reading. A web search on \"Todesfuge\" turns up links to the full text of the poem, with several other translations besides those considered here. One critic has called it 'one of the most important poems of the century', an assessment I completely agree with."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg", "userReview": "In the introduction, Hamburger notes that Celan\u2019s \u201cwork confronts us with difficulty and paradox.

Alive!He speaks truly who speaks the shade.But now shrinks the place where you stand:Where now, stripped by shade, will you go?Upward.

Todesfuge (Fugue Of Death) is absolute masterpiece. I will return to this book soon. It was such a pleasure reading it."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3314902-ann", "userReview": "I haven't read this book since undergraduate college, but I felt I had to go back and sort through Hamburger's English translations (still the best) of Celan's poems with a more appreciative and critical eye. The intensity of my youth may have faded, but the intensity of these poems still burns like a sun.Briefly: Paul Celan was born Paul Antschel in Czernovitz, Romania, to a German-speaking Jewish family. His surname was later spelled Ancel, and he eventually adopted the anagram Celan as his pen name. In 1938 Celan went to Paris to study medicine, but returned to Romania before the outbreak of World War II. During the war Celan was imprisoned in a Nazi labor camp; his parents and other relatives were killed in the death camps. After escaping the labor camp, Celan lived in Bucharest and Vienna before settling in Paris.Along with Anne Frank's diary and Elie Wiesel's Night, Celan's poems are a small handful of essential first-account works from the Holocaust, or Shoah.Celan's early poems are deeply felt and profoundly lyrical. His most famous poem, \"Death Fugue,\" is furiously melodic even though the theme is horrific. (There is a temptation to quote it in full; it's best to look it up.) Here's a piece:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at noon death is a master from Germanywe drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink you.Death is a master from Germany his eyes are bluehe strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is truea man lives in the house your golden hair Margaretehe sets his pack on to us as he grants us a grave in the airhe plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master fromGermanyyour golden hair Margareteyour ashen hair ShulamithAnother early poem is also lyrical and moving but better demonstrates the pared down style that would become Celan's style by necessity.ASPEN TREE, your leaves glance white into the dark.My mother's hair was never white.Oaken door, who lifted you off your hinges?My gentle mother cannot return.Something happens as Celan digs depper and deeper into poetry. He starts to unravel the German language, as if he cannot say what he has to say in \"the oppressor's language.\" A good in-between poem is \"Speak, You Also.\" A snippet:Speak, you also,speak at the last,have your say.Speak--But keep yes and no unsplit.And give your say it's meaning:give it your shade.\"Pslam\" shows Celan's grappling with religious meaning:No one molds us again out of earth and clay,no one conjures our dust.No one.Praised be your name, no one.For your sake,We shall flower.Towards you.Celan goes even farther in his poetic journey. Take the fascinating poem, \"Once\"Once,I heard him,he was washing the world,unseen, nightlong,real.One and Infinite,annihilated,ied.Light was. Salvation.That \"ied\" is very peculiar, and perhaps the best example of how Celan broke apart words in his poems, and reached for expression beyond our spoken/written language. The suffix \"ied\" is used to make a verb past tense. Is Celan going one step beyond \"annihilated?\" Translator Hamburger questioned the poet about its usage but did not receive a complete response. Maybe there isn't one.Once an artist goes this far, what's left?Celan committed suicide in 1970, by drowning himself in the Seine. This is beyond tragic. It is tempting to remember his words:O one, o none, o no one, o you:Where did the way lead when it lead nowhere?But I also think of this late poem:I HEAR THAT THE AXE HAD FLOWERED,I hear that the place can't be named,I hear that the bread which looks at himheals the hanged man,the bread baked for him by his wife.I hear that they call lifeour only refuge."}, {"userName": "Dirk", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1148935-dirk", "userReview": "One of the things Noam Chomsky did to revolutionize linguistics was to point out that you could make sentences that were grammatically correct but did not make sense. His observation freed linguists to devote their attention to grammar without worrying about meaning, as they had tended to do. An example he used is this sentence: \u201cColorless ideas sleep furiously.\u201dIt seems to me that when Chomsky asserts this he is using \u2018make\u2019 in a narrow sense. The phrase \u201cmake sense\u201d for him means something like \u2018to harmonize rationally with the speaker\u2019s notion of the world.\u2019 But \u2018make\u2019 can also mean create, and \u2018make sense\u2019 can mean create meaning. I once had a teacher, Yousel Rogat, who suggested that any metaphor, as opposed to a simile, behind the scenes evokes a universe in which the metaphor is literally true. If you say, \u201clife is like a nightmare,\u201d you point to certain resemblances that you might be able to list. \u201cIf you say, \u201clife is a nightmare\u201d, you evoke a universe of darkness and suffering where sordid details struggle for realization.So it is with Chomsky\u2019s own sentence. If you speak it from the narrow, Chomskian perspective, then you say nothing about ideas or about sleep or about fury. But if you take \u2018make\u2019 in the sense of create, you have a resonant image of ideas, some reified (because they might have color), but without color and at once somnambulant and raging. And it does seem relevant to me that Chomsky is himself a furious wielder of abstract ideas intended to rouse others from complacency time after time.And so it is with Paul Clean. His poems for the most part do not make sense in the narrow Chomskian definition.\tHere's pelt sky. Even now\ta clear wing writes\tI, too, remember,\tdust-\tcolored one, arrived\tas a craneBut they make a great deal of sense by creating meaning. Of course I\u2019m reading in translation, but I doubt knowing German would make any difference. In fact I think the German inclination to create new words by joining old ones freely lends it self to this sort of sense making. You can put two words together in a way that does not harmonize rationally with the world, as you know it, but does create a new sense, a new batch of meaning. This generation of meaning is one thing that makes Celan so exhilarating to read, and, in his context so moving. You are constantly involved in making sense. Reading this book is a long struggle in which you time after time are forced to make (create) sense based on the chimeric materials Celan provides you. Nourishing your mind in the background as you work is Celan\u2019s tortured history, his upbringing as a German-speaking Jew in what had been part of Austria, was then Romania and is currently the Ukraine; the death of his mother in a concentration camp; his tormented attempts to recreate his nationality and his identity; his deep involvement with the German language though he was a Jew suffering horrors enacted by Germans; his eventual suicide. It is the history of a chimeric identity and the poems are chimeric. That the evocation is mostly of tragedy and suffering does not make it less wonderful, because it shows the capacity of the human mind to work with such dark material, and come out richer in meaning."}, {"userName": "Taka", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka", "userReview": "This is the first book of poetry I read over a long period of time, in snatches, and I have the feeling that Paul Celan is meant to be read that way. As Hamburger the translator says so aptly, \"The process of reception, therefore, cannot be other than gradual and slow...and it seems likely that the translation of his work will also have to be done in stages, patiently, for a long time to come.\" Besides, there are so many amazing lines that you have to just stop and let them linger in you. I have to admit, though, that I didn't really understand most of his poems, and by \"understand,\" I mean intellectually, analytically, as if poetry, like prose, needs to carry meaning expressible in words. But does it? Like with paintings, what poetry does\u2014or certain kinds of poetry anyway\u2014is to let us see through it. And what do we see on the other side? Probably depends on your experience and sensibility, but I've long stopped looking for prosaic meaning in poetry of Celan's stripe. Instead I focus on the imagery, sound, and the feelings the poems elicit in me, or \"The stillness waved / at you from behind / a black woman's gait,\" and that's enough, more than enough to enjoy them, to be \"transfounded by nothingness\" to use a line from a late poem by Celan. And some of the imagery and feelings evoked in the reader may be barely discernible and so I go back and retrace the lines, and this process is exactly like the following: \"I can still see you: an echo / that can be groped towards with antenna / words, on the ridge of / parting.\"And with patience and the right kind of attitude, Celan's poetry might take you in:Little night: when youtake me inside, take meup there,three pain-inches above thefloor...In short, great poetry, and I'll have to come back again and again."}, {"userName": "Harperac", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20647130-harperac", "userReview": "A key moment in reading this book was the thought \"Oh! Celan is just like Lorca!\" But while the Spanish modernist's use of surreal and disjunctive imagery seemed to affirm some kind of subconscious world thick with significance, Celan's seem to whirl away from it. All his poems exist in this weird, washy space, where imagery appears out of a void and sinks back into a void.His later poems especially begin to get very weird. At least in his earlier poems there's a palpable sense of beauty that keeps things together, even if I don't know what they're about. But later on, I felt really shut out of the poems. I didn't mind it exactly, but it meant I didn't feel much about the poems. They were fragments of a big Something that I neither liked nor disliked. I'm not sure anyone could expect anything more from them without a lot more study.A good example of his beautiful early poems, a poem I feel strongly about (as many must, I'm sure) is his poem \"Death Fugue\" -- Black milk of daybreak we drink it at evening we drink it at midday and morning we drink it at night is the opening -- very chilling -- very powerful. I have to give props to Michael Hamburger for his excellent introduction. With Celan, I might have picked up the book, been baffled, and put it down. But Hamburger said straight up how difficult Celan was, and gave the reader some important reference points. I suggest for everyone to keep Celan on their horizon. Whether you actually read him all that much, I leave up to you."}, {"userName": "John Woodington", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1485837-john-woodington", "userReview": "Celan is a great wordsmith, though I think my rating of this collection is lower for two reasons. First, certain nuances of the prose are lost in the translation from German to English, and second I think part of the popularity of this work stems from the circumstances from which he came. Celan's poetry grows out of his experiences as a holocaust survivor, which to me seems to add some sort of false weight to it. Not that holocaust writing shouldn't be treasured for the history it preserves, but the literary merit of a piece should not be influenced by the topic that matter covers."}], "description": "\"In the writing of Paul Celan even we readers who can hear poetry only dimly in German can sense the greatness of his invention: the cadences of a music tilted against music's complacency; words punished for their plausibility by being reinvented and fused together and broken apart; syntax chopped and stretched to crack and expose its crust of dead rhetoric Michael Hamburger has earned our gratitude for rendering these poems into a reasonably inventive English \"Robert Pinsky, THE NEW REPUBLIC.Parallel German text and English translation.", "title": "Poems of Paul Celan", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1258536.Poems_of_Paul_Celan", "average": 4.39, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510933483l/1258536.jpg", "reviews": 140, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/86816.Paul_Celan", "name": "Paul Celan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8282.Michael_Hamburger", "name": "Michael Hamburger"}], "type": ["Poetry", "European Literature", "Classics", "Literature", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1258536.Poems_of_Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150266.Selected_Poems_and_Prose_of_Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2321499.Poems_of_Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25800757-ellerin-zamanlarla-dolu", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1258533.Poems_Of_Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1258534.Selected_Poems", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23588717-n-o-sabemos-mesmo-o-que-importa-cem-poemas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150265.Poems_of_Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150274.Breathturn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150273.Paul_Celan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150275.Threadsuns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150271.Glottal_Stop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/404890.Lightduress"]}
