It has something of an Austen-esque feel - criticisms of middle/upper middle class society, paired with a subtle and clever humour and a love story (here deliciously scandalous). But it's taken me a few years to come back to this novel and appreciate the magic Wharton has brought to the table.This little book is so clever. Everything about it from the damn title to nearly every piece of dialogue is perfectly-placed and often ironic. Things that didn't hit me fully the first time around became so much more important in this reread. Wharton knows 1870s New York City like the back of her hand; she knows its habits, its traditions, and its expectations of people. She creates a rich, twinkly picture of parties and social standards that is both delightful and ultimately ridiculous - then she throws a spanner in the works.Never has a love triangle been so welcomed by me. This isn't the modern affair we're used to, where a girl must choose between hot guy #1 and hot guy #2. Nope, in this story, Newland Archer is torn between the stability, comfort and duty he can be offered by the socially-favoured match with May Welland... and his passionate, all-consuming love for the unconventional, rebellious and ostracized Ellen Olenska. \n\u201cEach time you happen to me all over again.\u201d \nIt's as important as it is beautifully written. Wharton casts an eye over this society, both disdainful and affectionate. Incorporating issues of female emancipation into the story, never has the idea of a woman enslaved by marriage and convention seemed so unattractive from a male perspective. Newland Archer is full of modernity and the call of new ideas, but finds that any freedom he poses to May she would receive only with the intention of pleasing him. Though, it should be said, I believe May is far more than she seems.It's hard to read the ending of this book without feeling emotional, but the exact emotion may differ with your interpretation. Ambiguity reigns supreme as this novel finds its close and even the coldest of unromantics will surely have their hearts pulled along for this... ride. One of my favourite tragic love affairs.\n\u201cOnly, I wonder \u2013 the thing one\u2019s so certain of in advance: can it ever make one\u2019s heart beat as wildly?\u201d\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "Part of why I love The Age of Innocence so much is for the very reason my students hate it--the subtlety of action in a society constrained by its own ridiculous rules and mores. In Old New York, conformity is key and the upper-crust go about a life of ritual that has no substance or meaning. Both men and women are victims in this world as both are denied economic, intellectual, and creative outlets. All the world's a stage in Wharton's New York and everyone wears a mask of society's creation. Such is the norm until Newland Archer.Symbolically, Newland represents an America on the cusp of modernization, the awkward period of transition between the Victorian era and World War I. At first a devout member of New York aristocracy, Newland is awakened as one from a trance with the arrival of Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen decides to separate from her abusive husband, Count Olenski, and is rumored to have escaped the Count by having an affair with his secretary--a scandalous circumstance that brings her back home to her native New York. Vibrant, intellectual, and free-spirited when compared with the dowdy and restrained women he's known, Ellen's predicament is a revelation to Newland. As he himself has just ended an affair with a married woman and knows the ease with which society forgave his indiscretion when contrasted with Ellen, Newland begins to acknowledge the inequality amongst the sexes. However, there's a serious roadblock to Newland ever being with the captivating Ellen: Ellen is the cousin of May Welland, Newland's fiancee. Wharton writes with cutting wit about the hypocritical and ludicrous customs of blue blood society and cunningly plots events to work against Newland, the archer whose target is a \"new land\" in which he and Ellen can be together. The pity is that, ultimately, May proves to be the more cunning huntress who cleverly stalks and traps her quarry in the labyrinth of society.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Lizzy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575403-lizzy", "userReview": "\u2018The longing was with him day and night, an incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten. He could not see beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her voice. He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it, the rest of the world might seem less empty.\u2019\nThere was never getting away from their circumstances for Newland and Ellen, the protagonists of The Age of Innocence. As I weep for them and their unrequited love, I realized it was not meant to be. Edith Wharton depicts masterfully New York\u2019s traditions and judgmental airs, which were from the start against them. This elite group within which they existed had very rigid rules of behavior, social rituals, fashion, and clear censures for those that violated them. There is a clear hypocrisy in their life that existed behind their conservative moral exterior.\n\"In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\"\nAs I started reading Edith Wharton\u2019s crisp prose and witty dialogues, I got to know Newland Archer, May Welland and Ellen, Countess Olenska. What was inescapable from the outset is that they were a product of New York society of their time.As Newland meets Countess Olenska, he is not prepared for her worldly persona. Thus it is that May and Newland make their engagement public right away, to ease the acceptance of Ellen into their social pack. May is considered the perfect model of what a young wife should be: young, beautiful, soft, obedient, pliant, conventional, and with no opinions on anything of importance. We would consider her boring, but those were different times. Newland starts out pretty much the same; he's a young lawyer, used to his luxurious and idle style of living; all in accord with the strict rules of society. Yes, both are good persons with many amiable qualities, but they simply are not exceptional. They were clearly not in love, just following rituals that defined that a young man should marry a nice girl with a good family. \u2019There was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the question from what point you choose. Of course such a marriage was only what Newland was entitled to\u2026\u2019Newland and Ellen\u2019s love story is nevertheless magnificent because it is the changes and character growth of both lovers that make it endearing and wonderful. When we first meet Newland Archer he could not have been more in tune with New York society\u2019s status quo: \nBut Newland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and May's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable. What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?\nIf Newland Archer seems indecisive and hesitant, it's in part because he is conflicted with his values and desires. He even starts defending new ideas, \u201dWomen ought to be free \u2013 as free as we are\u201d Nevertheless, it is easy to note how typical Newland Archer was when we first meet him, how judgmental, how hypocritical:\nThere was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man\u2019s heart, and he was glad that his future wife should be restrained by false prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but to receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer, was to be announced in a few weeks. No, he felt as old Sillerton Jackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on!\nCould he have been more traditional? \u2019He hated to think of May Welland's being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless of the dictates of Taste.\u2019 Yes, in the beginning, he hated the idea of his innocent fianc\u00e9 being contaminated by the worldly Countess.Nevertheless, Newland's careful and predictable world is flipped completely upside down when he meets and really gets to know the intriguing and intrepid Countess Olenska. As the plot moves on, we discovered all is not as we first envisioned. Newland is changing as he falls deeper in love with Ellen. He soon starts to show signs of rebelling against his previous ideals, begins transforming himself. A conversation with Ellen\u2019s grandmother and family matriarch is particularly revealing:\n\"Poor Ellen\u2014she was always a wayward child. I wonder what her fate will be?\"\"What we've all contrived to make it,\" he felt like answering. \"If you'd all of you rather she should be Beaufort's mistress than some decent fellow's wife you've certainly gone the right way about it.\"\nBut his transformation is not fast or deep enough, he is not able to entirely free himself from the constraints imposed on him by society and his own upbringing. He is not courageous enough?, you might ask. \u2018His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.\u2019 But there is much more at play here. He soon realizes how restrictive his marriage was, how loveless and lonely his life would be:\n\u2019There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that May's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.\u2019\nAnd much more,\n\u2019He perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in the future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him; nut as he paid the hansom and followed his wife \u2026he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage. \"After that I suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each other's angles,\" he reflected; but the worst of it was that May's pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.\u2019\nEven after understanding what his marriage would make of his life, he cannot escape. \n\"Outside it, in the scene of his actual life, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency, blundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room. Absent\u2014that was what he was: so absent from everything most densely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him to find they still imagined he was there.\"\nHe cannot break up from convention, although he dreams of going as far as Japan with Ellen:\n\"Archer had fancied that his path was clear before him. He had meant to have a word alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her grandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to Washington. In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her to Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go. His own fancy inclined to Japan.\"\n Even if the story is told through Newland\u2019s point of view, we cannot forget how much Ellen suffered. Probably even more than him, since it seems she had no choice:\n\"Oh, I know\u2014I know! But on condition that they don't hear anything unpleasant. Aunt Welland put it in those very words when I tried.... Does no one want to know the truth here, Mr. Archer? The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!\" She lifted her hands to her face, and he saw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.\nWe also soon discover that May is not so innocent. Although all her fight seems to be enforced to defend her marriage, its survival, and in that she would never change. What she learned with her mother she would repeat in her marriage 'Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland'. No, she was never weak just limited.\n\"I told her I was afraid I hadn't been fair to her\u2014hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to criticise, and yet didn't always know the circumstances.\" She paused. \"I knew you'd been the one friend she could always count on; and I wanted her to know that you and I were the same\u2014in all our feelings.\"\nBut Newland was still dreaming of breaking away from everything, of being with Ellen. He tells May he needs to get away, but she was ahead of him. Not an innocent at all:\n\u201dI want to take a break\u2013\u201c\u201cA break? To give up law?\u201d\u201cTo go away, at any rate \u2013 at once. On a long trip, ever so far off \u2013 away from everything\u2013\u201cHe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with the indifference of a man who longs for a change and is yet too weary to welcome it. Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated. \u201cAway from everything \u2013 \u201che repeated.\u201cEver so far? Where, for instance?\u201d she asked.\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. India \u2013 or Japan.\u201d\u201cAs far as that? But I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t, dear \u2026 Not unless you take me with you. \u2026That is, if the doctors let me go \u2026but I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t. For you see, Newland, I\u2019ve been sure since this morning of something I\u2019ve been longing and hoping for\u2013\u201c\u201cHave you told anyone else?\u201d\u201cOnly Mama and your mother. \u2026That is \u2013 and Ellen. You know I told you we\u2019d had a long talk one afternoon \u2013 and how dear she was to me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2013\u201c said Archer, his heart stopping.\nWhat I concluded is that Newland might be rebellious while May is until the end tradition itself. This pattern we witness endlessly, and when Newland ponders what their marriage and family life had been like it is all summed so clearly:\n\u2018This hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered. Her incapacity to recognize change made her children conceal their views from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first, a joint pretense of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated.\u2019\nFor one thing, his life as a man allowed him more freedom even to circumvent social customs for he was not as closely watched. Not that it was easier for him, for he struggles between social conformity and honesty to one's emotions. And not that May would want to change. She was set on her role without any uncertainty.And often we see him contradict himself. Despite his transformation, we realize he will always be a 19th century man, as we witness him saying things such as \u201cWhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?\u201d, while later he will dream of running away with Ellen.The essence of Edith Wharton\u2019s novel is whether Newland and Ellen ever had a chance? Not at their time. And Ellen recognizes reality: \u201dAh, my poor Newland \u2013 I suppose this had to be\u2026 You\u2019re engaged to May Welland; and I\u2019m married\u201d. And Newland replied, \u201cIt\u2019s too late to do anything else\u201d. To apart mean a return to their old respective life patterns, but to be together would mean going against what they both loved the most in the other. I can't love you unless I give you up. Being together would mean breaking too many rules, hurting loved ones, and carrying a guilt that would ultimately separate them if not physically for certain emotionally. \n\"But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands\u2014and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I'd never known before\u2014and it's better than anything I've known.\"\nThis great work is a bittersweet love story at the mercy of society\u2019s morals and ethics, with conflicting values that prevents them from realizing their most ardent desire to be together. I'd say this is the strong and beautiful point of this classic. \nThe idea that he could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying Countess Olenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\nEven more heartfelt:\nThe long was with him day and night, an incessant undeniable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.\nThe characters are forced to adjust and readjust to their changing life, but that is still not enough. At least it was not in their lifetime. The changes they go through are not deep enough to allow them a happy ever after. How painful to live through this changing times; and how dreadful to accept their fate. I can just imagine and suffer for them, and weep for them. Here lies the greatness of The Age of Innocence. Their fate was to be apart, and so nothing rests for them but to keep their memories intact. It's what we lost and our memories that stay with us. If he had gone up to meet her, it would be another story.\n\u2019\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.\u2019\nOh, I have to repeat myself: there is nothing more heartbreaking than unrequited love. So I weep again for them. ---My first impressions:\n\u201cI can't love you unless I give you up.\u201d\nOh, Vessey, I just finished The Age of Innocence! And I have to tell you that the last 10% conquered me. It made it me think that it had to be. They were set on their way before Ellen arrived and Newland and Amy made public their engagement. And I believe it had to end as it did. Suddenly, I discovered it deserved 5 full stars. It's what we lost and our memories that stay with us. If he had gone up to meet her, it would be another story.I loved how it analyzed his marriage with May, the old costumes that are no more. That hypocritical society that held him down is finally fading. But too late for Ellen and Newland. Well, it is all still too new to me, and the only thing I can say is that it touched me deeply. Maybe more because of my age, since I know enough of life and remember all that I lost and could never simply be revisited. \n\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.\nThere is nothing more heartbreaking than unrequited love. So I weep for them.____"}, {"userName": "Jr Bacdayan", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16587936-jr-bacdayan", "userReview": "\u201cEach time you happen to me all over again.\u201d Imagine that person you love most in this world, right within your grasp, but somehow out of reach. An invisible thin wall keeping you apart. Apart but not away from each other. Together yet not with each other. This is the worst form of torture, a torture of invisible chains and soundless screams. Constantly seeing each other, constantly being reminded of what cannot be. Constantly falling in love yet constantly falling apart. The urge, the love, the longing constantly growing, engulfing you until you cannot bear to live. Every part of your body numb and unaware of the realities around you. Because for you, only the pain you feel is real. The only truth you know is that everything is a lie. Edith Wharton paints a very delicate picture that resonates elegiac waves and enraptures its readers to the very bone. One can't help but succumb to this level of desire, of emotion and empathize because of the atmosphere that Wharton has created. Her prose is crisp, straight and true. One might say that her prose is a reflection of her New York socialite self. (Wharton was born with quite a few gazillion silver spoons stuck somewhere on her buttocks.) Aside from that, with such a dazzling foray of words, she evoked such emotion in me that I was afraid I might like her Facebook page at some point. So with that in mind, I vowed to refrain from using Facebook until I've finished reading this book. Well, it worked fine for me. On another note, I was really impressed with her depiction of the 1870s New York. Based on a little research I did, her canvas of the place was just spot on splendid. \"It was the spirit of it -- the spirit of the exquisite romantic pain. The idea that the mere touching of a woman's hand would suffice. The idea that seeing her across the room would keep him alive for another year.\" That sort of a relationship, that unique communication between two people savagely drawn to the other like moth to a flame is of a different level than all the other types of communication. This communication between them is that of the deepest kind. A communication that needs not one of the five senses. This communication of feeling, of intense knowing, of mutual understanding, this unity of the mind, this shared consciousness is the effect of a love that knows no bounds, strengthened to an insane proportion by the fact that it was never meant to be. \u201cThe real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!\u201d \"What's the use? You gave me my glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one.\"But what really struck me the most was that irony that these two people enlightened to be different from the \u201cpretend people\u201d, who revile them and mockingly laugh at their trained innocence and hapless practices were to be subjected to a pretend relationship as well. \u201cIn reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\u201d They that were above that \u201cInnocence\u201d were cruelly placed upon a circumstance in which they have to feign Innocence as well, as the only way to sustain their love for each other. \u201cI can't love you unless I give you up.\u201d This has led me to believe that such innocence can only be a result of circumstances beyond their powers. That altogether this Innocence is merely through the progression of unstoppable forces not necessarily known to the person it affects. Such is also the case with the New York Society. These people did not choose to succumb to this veiled innocence, it was mercilessly hurled at them. They were raised in these circumstances, in a society where conformity is the norm and to question this conformity would be self-abdication. Thus, these people will die by this code. This Age of Innocence reflects a view in which Newland Archer is also an innocent victim. He thinks his wife too much of an \u201cinnocent being\u201d that he is surprised in the end and utterly moved when he finds out that she is not so innocent at all. And the lifting of this veil seemed a wake\u2013up call to him at the very end, when he was about to meet the Countess Olenska with his son, that he realizes that he has lost this innocence. She had become the symbol of everything that could have been, all his hopes and dreams. She was the unreachable star. In the end, he was afraid that all that sustained his love was that invisible shackle, that sense of longing, that feigned innocence. And that the innocence was all that kept him to Ellen, and without it, he cannot bear to face her. \"And you'll sit beside me, and we'll look, not at visions, but at realities.\"\"I don't know what you mean by realities. The only reality to me is this.\"The dream has become a reality and the reality a dream.\"'It's more real to me here than if I went up,' he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.\""}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "Myself and the Pulitzer prize have previously not always seen eye to eye, but Finally, I have read one worthy of giving top marks to. This golden oldie captures the wholesome atmosphere of American life and the highest standard of American manners and manhood from a bygone era, where modern ideas are resisted and tradition overcomes compassion. The inhabitants of this hothouse of New York society is built on wealth, life is lavished, easy and comfortably cushioned, but this world may just as well have been covered in a blanket of cobwebs, as the lives are so sedate and uneventfully dull, despite their opulent surroundings, they appear colourless and motionless. It is ultimately a tragic tale that Wharton weaves, and yes, as with a lot of classic fiction based around love, it's told with air of melancholy because this love is one that doesn't really get off the ground. For Newland Archer, the leading male character, there is an imagining of an alternative existence to the one that convention has pressed upon him, he has built within himself a kind of sanctuary for his secret thoughts and longings. Within these walls are his bride to be, May Welland and Countess Olenska, who would change his whole world.\"The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend\"Archer is a perfect product of Old New York, a member of one of the most prominent, historic families, he lives in the obligatory sumptuous brownstone on Fifth Avenue with his mild mannered mother and spinster sister, and languidly pursues the law as most gentlemen of his age and inherited wealth do. He is engaged to the young, beautiful, and equally impeccably bred May Welland, who is sweet sweet natured but naive. After twelve years away returns the Countess Ellen Olenska, May\u2019s cousin, who through no fault of her own upsets the balance of Newland's life. She is beautiful, vivacious and intelligent, whose long period of living in more liberal European surroundings has made her innocent of the nonsensical, unspoken rules of the society she has reentered, and incapable of maintaining the shallow facade of her female relatives. Newland feels a life of quiet misery lies ahead, and despairs over Olenska as they grow closer and closer, because he is forced, by his own realisation, to know how Ellen will be treated if she dares to divorce her husband, and advises against it, even though he is devoured by love for her. Wharton mesmerizes with the sheer depth of emotion, pain, and frustration bearing down on Newland's shoulders, he really is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Through thwarted dreams, despairing disillusionment, unbearable regrets and the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience, Newland and Ellen share a secret love that enables each of them to be the best people they can be, fulfilled intellectually, emotionally and socially, and the fact they can never be together in harmony is just as unbearable for the reader as it is for the characters, and this is where Wharton excels with people you truly believe in. For May, she is neither clever nor truthful, and only rarely shows a spirit that reveals a depth of feeling in the face of connvention and social expectations. In telling the story of how Archer and Olenska, against all the strictures and taboos of their society, fall in love, Wharton seems to be siding with the individual in this universal tug-of-war. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever that simple. Certainly, New York's upper society in the 1870s was one of grandeur, but it is described in Archer\u2019s thoughts and Wharton\u2019s observations as a prison of the mind, one where the cells are sprinkled with gold dust.The finale, of many years later, moved me immensely, I thought of all that went before, a story that in terms of characterisation was searing on every page with the intensity of this doomed love affair. A stunning novel, impeccably told. And I think it's unfair to simply label this as old fashioned 'chick-lit' because it's about so much more than what appears on the surface. Her tone is sardonic and to some extent cynical of the social world into which the reader enters, and she portrays this society, its conventions and traditions, through the unforgettable vivid characters whose behaviour and thinking were moulded in time."}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "Appearances can be deceiving, as this superb classic novel reveals...Newland Archer, has the perfect life, rich , young, and good looking, a member in excellent standing, of New York's High Society of 1871, during the Golden Age.

At a family gathering in Newport, Rhode Island, Newland, is told to fetch Ellen, he goes down to the beach, sees her on the pier, passionately stares for a long time and retreats back to the house, it would not be proper, he thinks.

D H Lawrence and Henry James do the same, the first like a big dog gnawing at a bone and finding something it mistakes for God in the marrow, and the latter in his infinite cheeseparings putting the whole thing into the form of a three-dimensional chess game played by sardonic French subatomic particle physicists who you suspect own little dogs, the kind you want to step on and squish. And many other novelists great and small dance about on the same subject.Well, Edith Wharton starts off like she is trying to get at something very interesting in The Age of Innocence. Here is the young man contemplating his future marriage:What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a 'decent' fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal? ... He reviewed his friends' marriages - the supposedly happy ones - and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgement, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were : a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.Much later the young man sadly muses thus:There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free- apart from making you think \"how very rude!\" this begs the question what liberty, exactly, did this proto-feminist man suppose could be accessed by upperclass females in the 1870s in New York? Edith Wharton's clear intelligence makes me think that ambiguity clouds these various musings only because she fears she's already been too bold. So this compelling theme gets lost when she subtly changes gear. Still, there are enough zingers to keep you reading and relishing - for instance -What if 'niceness' [in a wife:] carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness?Hmm, what if indeed. Or, concerning the rigours of class in New York, It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country - nice one, Edith. There's no getting away from it, Edith is indeed Henry James in drag, and this novel is kissing cousins to the early HJs like Washington Square, The Bostonians and The Portrait of a Lady. These idle rich, they're dull buggers you know - indeed Edith goes on and on about just how boring their lives are as she describes the dining, the travelling, the frittering, the spending, the ladylike sports the ladylike ladies did (archery - no, not nude mud wrestling, what large sums would I not pay to read Edith Wharton describing such a scene), the families, the clans, their history, their posh houses, their posh horses - oh please spare us - half way through you really wish that the fabric of space and time should rend asunder and a scary bunch of Sendero Luminoso guerillas break into the great ballrooms and dining rooms and haul the whole pack of them off to the sweaty jungles of Colombia for some serious political indoctrination. Plot spoiler : this does not happen. Instead, this book is a study of circumscription and circumspection, of people (the hero, the heroine and the wife) not getting what they want. And as such, when we are able to skirt round the pages of orotund description (A winding drive led up between the iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highly varnished walnut under a striped verandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow star-patterned parquet floor upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian house-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus\" - did you get all that Mr Set Designer?) the heart of this tale is sad and almost beautifully done. But really mimsy with it.**PS - I saw the movie too which was as elegant as all get-out, apart from the dodgy Enya-like song splodged in the middle. That Michelle Pfeiffer - cor, blimey. I wouldn't kick her out of bed. Still and all, the movie is a 100-minute argument as to why you should read the book instead, because what's missing is Edith Wharton's mind, which is a great place to dally in. You get voice-overs in the movie which only serve to remind you how literary adaptations, however spiffily dressed-up (and aren't they all?) are not the real deal, they're the unreal deal. These movies are like aides memoires on gorgeous notepaper written with a ten thousand dollar pen. The note says : read the book."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[he knew he loved another woman but married anyway (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.\nJust when I think a classic unlikely to give me pause, it surprises me with relatable themes. After reading Wharton's short story, \"The Muse's Tragedy\" (one of the supplemental reads I'll be teaching this Fall), I knew I had to visit one of her longer forms. So rewarding it was, to be wooed by elegant prose and positioning; a plot that moves in practiced laps; a story that could be yours, mine, theirs; a setting that will always be known for both its vibrance and austerity. Wharton is a writer of words nestled in conscious rhythm, the director of a play that centers around societal distinctions like class and gender, yet still embodies universal themes of love, betrayal, and self-actualization. Wharton writing from a male's perspective reminds me of Cather, in My \u00c1ntonia: they do it so well, so authentically. She had Henry James as a mentor, and yet I prefer her books to his (although I see a resemblance to my favorite James book to-date: The American). \nHis whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.\nCountess Olenska is not just a woman ostracized in 1920s New York Society: she is symbolic of New York on the verge of change, the cusp of a new era; she is love and beauty and complications; she is pain, consolation, a new life which uncovers an insipid way of living. The Countess represents fresh ideas, a new way of thinking, a society that doesn't place class and materialism before all else, a bohemian way of being. The Countess is hope. I realize I\"m taking an unorthodox stand, seeing as how the Countess also represents infidelity and betrayal, and the uproot of normalcy. Yet knowing Newland's choices when he meets Ellen, one knows that in the end, he'll make a decision forced upon him by his society. In the end, we see his gratitude for life, and the regrets from his choices, which once again, reminds us of the complications of life. Wharton leaves us with an ending rife with speculative contemplations, and as readers, we become just like her characters. \nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life. But he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery.\nConventional New York was not ready for the Countess. The city had not yet formed itself into the diverse structure it now is, with a roadway tunnel that traverses the Hudson river, and a train station that connects you with New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In fact, conventional New York City was also unprepared for The Harlem Renaissance, taking place only a few blocks away, in the same decade and the same world, yet separate and forgotten--like Ellen Olenska. \nBut then you come; and you're so much more than I remembered, and what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit perfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my mind, just quietly trusting it to come true."}, {"userName": "Shovelmonkey1", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1", "userReview": "Before writing this review I decided to find out a bit more about Edith Wharton. Turns out that she is actually a lot more interesting than some of her books. If you turn to the Wikipedia page (not exactly hardcore research, I know but I'm not in a position to march off to the library and start wading through Wharton's presumably numerous biographies) you'll be faced with a picture of a timid and pretty dour looking lady with two disagreeable looking Paris-Hilton porta-dogs plonked on her knee. Don't let appearances fool you ladies and gentlemen, for Wharton was a regular social and creative dynamo; designer, socialite, writer, Knight (Chevalier of the legion of honour for her work in France during the war) there was no stopping this woman. So back to The Age of Innocence. What's it all about? Mostly about how being young, rich and desirable and mixing with the cream of society isn't all it is cracked up to be. Why? Well because high society is actually incredibly dull. Really? Yup. In order to set themselves apart from the grubby minions who do the dishes, drive the coaches and actually work for a living, \"society\" set about creating a set of hideously constrictive rules and moral guidelines which sap the joy, happiness, fun, freedom of expression and general day to day life out of everyone involved. It is incredibly ironic that everyone then strives to get accepted into this set when everyone who's already there is so damned miserable most of the time. Most of Wharton's principal characters are unhappy with their lot and lead a treading-on-eggshells existence because they're terrified out of their wits about any kind of scandal. Obviously scandal of sorts does ensue but everyone deals with it very nicely, calmly and diplomatically without any mud slinging or calling in Piers Morgan.Clearly a lot has changed... now massive scandal can be a potentially lucrative money earner if you have the right press connections and in certain cities (Lets pretend I don't live in one of them) people set out to bed a sleb (celebrity) and then launch a modelling/music/TV career based on the back of some good quality kiss and tell anecdotes.The best thing about this book for me was the names of the main characters. Not satisfied with a range of traditional names (you will find no James, Johns, Matthews or Mikes here reader) Wharton presented me with a barrage of people with names like Newland Archer, Manson Mingott, Sillerton Jackson, Emerson Sillerton and Dallas Archer. Eek! Perhaps the silliness of the names mirrors Whartons' own slightly mocking perspective on the society she herself inhabited.If I had been brought up in high society I would have probably had to kick off my satin slippers and throw myself under the wheels of the first passing horse and carriage as soon as I entered adulthood. Who would want to live in such constrained times? Not I."}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie", "userReview": "[Archer seems to have fallen back into his old groove, but he feels that he\u2019s missed out on \u201cthe flower of life.\u201d When he\u2019s given an opportunity to see Ellen once again, he resists, thinking that the memory of his association with her will be more vivid and real if he doesn\u2019t see her again.

Reflecting on his son\u2019s attitudes, he thinks, \u201cThe difference is that these young people take it for granted that they\u2019re going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldn\u2019t.

On the other hand, a more suitable title might be Anna Karenina Revisited. Here are a few similarities off the top of my head:- It's a novel based on societal etiquette. - A lovely woman is plagued with an unloving husband and somewhat ostracized from said society due to divorce.- A young man rushes to marry his fianc\u00e9 before troubling thoughts of cheating overtake him.- The fianc\u00e9 is a virtuous, virginal airhead. - And finally, the adulterous woman comes equipped with a very Anna Karenina-esque European flair. Their sensibilities are remarkably similar. Did Edith Wharton steal everything but the title? I don't know, but if you told me she read and admired Tolstoy's book, I wouldn't be surprised. However, let's set the accusations aside.This is a damn fine novel. It's poignant. It's well-plotted. It's funny. The characters pop to life. New York society of the 1870s is set as well as any Broadway stage. Deficiencies? Perhaps there's a little too much telling over showing, but I'm not complaining. Indeed it's difficult to fault Wharton on any point. This is a solid novel. Beyond the novel, it's difficult to fault Wharton even if she did pilfer the plot. Yes, she came from a very wealthy family and much of her time was spent penning novels from the comfort of her luxuriant bed, dropping completed pages upon the floor to be collected and collated by a servant. But looking deeper you discover all the good she did during the Great War. And when you learn how she put herself in danger by reporting from the front, well, you can't help but admire the woman. She's got true grit, even if it is gilded grit.PS: Here is my video review of Age of Innocence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8gD8..."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17025129-trish", "userReview": "The taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future.Soundtrack for this majestic novel?

Ah, Newland Archer, my love, my heart! As a woman in 2016, it was refreshing to read about a man in love. It feels like modern media usually portrays women as the desperate, clingy, unreasonable and unrealistically passionate ones. The truth is, we're all susceptible to the foolishness and intensity that comes with being in love.In the beginning of the novel, Archer is accepting and eager about his role and future in society - son, lawyer, bachelor, husband, father. It's the familiar and reliable path followed by the best of his male family, friends and colleagues. There's a comfort in knowing that your major life decisions are predestined, planned and orchestrated by others. Archer learns, however, what he must give up for that comfort. Complacent in his engagement with May Welland, he meets her vivacious and worldly cousin Countess Ellen Olenska and discovers how passionate and surprising his life could be. This awakening causes an internal crisis for Archer. By sticking to the status quo and doing what is expected of him, he gives up many of his liberties. But if he forsakes society, he brings dishonor to his reputation and isolates himself and anyone associated with him. It is this struggle that is the driving force in the novel. The Age of Innocence is a brilliant portrait of upperclass New York City in the 1870s. I went in with very high expectations for this novel - this is the second book by Edith Wharton that I've read, Ethan Frome being the first - and she did not disappoint. An intimate and critical expos\u00e9 of society coupled with Edith Wharton's elegant prose secures this novel as one of the greatest pieces of American literature I've read yet."}, {"userName": "Ahmad

Newland Archer is a wealthy lawyer of upper-class New York society, who is engaged to be married to May, a member of the same society. Ruled by well laid conventions, Newland believes him to be happy and content and eagerly awaits his impending marriage. The meet of Ellen, May's cousin, and his closer association with her that follows make him see the dull and empty life that he is forced to live which is tightly controlled by convention. Newland eventually falls in love with Ellen, but convention and duty requires that he should surrender his love and freedom. I didn't take in to the character of Newland Archer initially. His cowardice and inaction really bothered me. Even when May offers him that he may break the engagement if there is \"another woman\" whom he desires to marry, he does not grab the opportunity. Although he constantly lamented over his lost opportunity to love and live freely, it is his own inaction that brought him misery; and not only to him but to May and Ellen. But later, on reflecting on his character, I realized that I cannot judge his character by modern convictions. Given the time period in which the character is set, there was nothing surprising in the cause of action which Newland took. The conventions by which they lived were a second religion to them from which it was almost impossible to deviate. May was the representation of family, duty and convention. She is described as pretty, socially perfect but one who lacks imagination and room for growth. But I felt that she was severely misunderstood, especially by Newland. While she puts outwardly a face socially acceptable for a young woman of that time, underneath lives a strong, intelligent and an artful woman who goes to greater lengths to secure what is hers.My sympathy lay with Ellen who was an innocent victim of fate and convention. Her character represents the universal \u201cunconventional women\". She was always portrayed in soft, kind and truthful light with a mind of her own; and I believe, she was Ms. Wharton's heroine. The story, through the main characters of Newland, May and Ellen, and supported by quite a number of interesting supporting characters, is a true portrayal of the lives and way of living of New York upper-class society. Being herself part of that society, Ms. Wharton draws a truthful account of the old upper-class New York society coupled with subtle humour on their rigid conventional way of living. The story concludes with the final chapter being set thirty years later, which shows how the people have slowly managed to unchain themselves from the strict bonds of convention. This chapter was a breath of fresh air to the tedious conventional living which was described throughout the story. The writing is beautifully detailed and the psychological portrayal of the characters is cleverly done that it was easy to connect with the story and characters from the very beginning. Her writing style is easy going yet graceful which made the read both quick and interesting. This is my second read of Wharton and I really enjoyed the read. And finally, The Age of Innocence is a true story of an \"age of innocence\" where people were kept within strict social rules and imaginative and passionate living is not heard of nor sanctioned."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5895486-edward", "userReview": "IntroductionSuggestions for Further ReadingA Note on the Text--The Age of InnocenceExplanatory Notes"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "This was the first book I've read from Edith Wharton and it was better than I was expecting. The images of 1870's New York are rich and chilling and it's central theme so relevant and relatable. Newland Archer aches with the constraints of his time and the absurdity and hypocrisy of the society in which he lives. He longs to break free and yet ultimately lives a life of quiet remorse. It struck me just how little has changed in that regard. Most people still fall into a conventional life simply because it doesn't occur to them not to. You know that image of standing in the middle of the crowded room screaming at the top of your lungs and no one even looks up? That's Newland Archer. That's a lot of people; the sleepwalking majority. He shivered a little, remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much cited instance of the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because they had no use for them. What if, when he had bidden May Welland to open hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness?And by gosh this book is funny.  It was one of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to have discovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it. Ever been stuck in a mob trying to exit a movie theater, or worse, a plane? And oh, the maddening denial, one of my favorite themes in books. The frantic desperate clinging to airs. It did not hurt him half as much to tell May an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him.And love. Love. That once in a lifetime but we couldn't be together because of circumstances love. Each time you happen to me all over again.The ending just about killed me. Do it, do it, is he going to do it?!.... And yet it was perfect."}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "A masterpiece. Newland Archer, a young lawyer, is engaged to be married to May Welland, a sweet but (he soon comes to realize) rather limited girl. Their two families are prominent ones in 1870s Manhattan so everything is as it should be. And then Archer meets Countess Ellen Olenska, a childhood sweetheart and May's cousin, who is back in NYC after fleeing a disastrous marriage in Europe. She is unconventional, beautiful, and shares Newland's interest in art and books. Can you guess what happens?Wharton knows everything about this Gilded Age world. The prose is subtle and elegant yet so sharply observed; the central characters live and breathe and have a feeling of mystery; the sense of place is vivid; the plotting and structure are tight.And although it's set 150 years ago, the situations are universal. When the smitten Newland sees Ellen after a long time he exclaims: \"Each time you happen to me all over again,\" which gave me shivers because it sounds so contemporary.The final chapter, in particular, is a model of economy: decades flash by showing changing mores, and a poignant sense of regret and acceptance suffuses everything. I was sobbing during the final pages. It took me a while to get used to all the secondary characters and their foibles. And of course not all of that era's NYC population is represented. But there are fascinating insights into class and hierarchy and the role of women in this unique world. The Age Of Innocence is must reading, especially if you're engaged to be married. I will definitely revisit it and read Wharton's other novels."}, {"userName": "Ivana Books Are Magic", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic", "userReview": "There are many benefits to reading this beautifully written novel. For instance, if anyone ever asks you: \"Who was the first women to win the Pulitzer prize?\", you will not only know the answer, you will able to elaborate on it. This novel did win the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1921 and boy did it deserve it. It is set in a particular historical time and place (1870-ties, New York, the so called Glided Age) and it delivers a brilliant portrait of New York society of that time. The title of the book is said to be inspired by a rather well known painting titled Age of Innocence, but it might also be a reference to the author\u2019s upbringing and childhood. Wharton was in her fifties when she had written this novel and that is, quite often, the time when we recollect our childhood. After all, childhood is an age of innocence. The author is both critically and nostalgically inclined when she describes this period she had grown up in. This creates a rather potent mix of emotions that contributes to the novel\u2019s complexity. Personally, this title always makes me think of William Blake and his Songs Of Age and Experience. Like Blake, Wharton is bringing her own experiences in this novel (following that write about what you know rule) and describing the things she has observed, for Wharton has grown up in this somewhat rigid) New York society she described so eloquently in this novel.  The beginning of the novel is pretty straightforward. We get introduced to the main characters fairly quickly. A young and successful lawyer Archer is to marry a beautiful young girl named May Wellend. They belong to the same up class society and everyone is very happy and anxious to see them married. However, the arrival of May\u2019s notorious (notorious on account of being divorced, which was quite scandalous at the time) cousin will change everything. A few pages into this novel, I realized that the plot sounds familiar. I realized that I had seen the film adaptation. Well, coming to conclusion that there are worse things than seeing Michelle Pfeiffer's face in your mind as you turn the pages (Pfeiffer does have Ellen's delicate beauty), I kept reading. I'm certainly glad that I did because I immensely enjoyed reading it. Inspite of knowing how it is going to end, I couldn\u2019t help being sincerely moved by it. Strangely, it did not bother me at all that I knew how it's going to end. The novel was no less interesting because I had seen the film (which follows the plot quite accurately) and that says something about the novel. Perhaps it is not so strange that I found it moving despite learning the story before reading it. For one, this novel is so well written and with great attention to detail. In addition, the potrayal of characters is superb. It is not only about the story. It is one of those rare novels that manage to convey the very essence of being human. Both the tragedy and the beauty of it. In its immense analytical scope, it even reminded me of the great Russian novelist, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Turgenev. Indeed, in its complexity this novel comes quite close to above listed great writers.The Age of Innocence is not just about a love triangle or a love story. It is about the subtle pressures that society puts on individual. It is about innocence and about hope. Which of these two women represents these concepts? Perhaps both of them do, both for Archer and for themselves, just in different ways. Although the novel is often written in a light (sometimes even humorous) tone, it is actually surprisingly deep, subtly analytical and surprisingly profound. At times, it is even melancholically sad. The never-ending question about the conflict between freedom and duty is explored in an excellent way. The fact that the novel is elegantly funny makes it easy to read, but it is the philosophical undertones that are truly impressing. While reading, I was never bored, not for a second. I liked the description of New York Society. The author shows enough of the historical period to be interesting but she does not overdue it. The way Wharton creates characters is impressive, she does it so effortlessly. The characters are the stars of the book, realistic, thought trough- they really make sense and feel real. The theme reminds me of another well-known classic, Henry James' The Potrait Of a Lady. However, I would not call them similar. When I remember the frustration I felt while reading The Portrait of a Lady, I must say that I didn't feel it when I was reading this one. Yet my sould felt tortured in a similar way. I did not have the desire to tell Ellen what to do (in a way I wanted to tell Isabel) or anyone else for that matter. Everything that happened was somehow expected and I could understand it...Not because the story is trivial, but rather the other way around, it is quite timeless because it captures the repetitive patterns in human behaviour. Every action made sense in the context of character characterization. Their motivations were always on the point. They are what they are- and they can't help it. It's like watching the ancient Greek tragedies (whenever I consider some work of literature to be impressive, I always make this reference- I'm so predictable sometimes but yes I do still read and love ancient Greek tradegies and I see them as the spiritual parent of our modern literature). I mean in in the sense that you know how it is going to end, but you feel for the characters nevertheless. It takes a great writer to accomplish that. Someone who goes beyond being a simple story teller and Wharton has the complexity this kind of writing needs. I could make some other parallels to Henry James, because there seems to be this cultural clash between Europe (countess is American but she lived in Europe) and America. For example, I did feel a similar feeling of bad things bound to happen to Wharton's free spirited American protagonist as I did to all those Henry James' heroines. That's about where the similarity ends for me, for this novel is in many ways original.As I repeated again and again in this view, the potrayal of characters is exceptional. Wharton simply has this way of revealing her characters that it makes it hard for a reader to judge them. Life is complex and this novel captures that perfectly- I do admire that in a writer. Finally I love the finishing line: \"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\" This novel is truly a literature gem, it is in every sense of the world : enough. It is enough on its own to be considered a masterpiece, but read in the contex of Wharton's life and other writings, it is even more impressive. This is one of those classics that I can never get tired of. Quite possibly because it describes (as Jung put it- that final mystery) love so paintfully accuratedly:\u201cI couldn't have spoken like this yesterday, because when we've been apart, and I'm looking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great flame. But then you come; and you're so much more than I remembered, and what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit perfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my mind, just quietly trusting it to come true.\u201d \u2015 Edith Wharton, The Age of InnocenceTrue love is a potent and dangerious things.

Appearances are deceptive though and Wharton\u2019s prose is beautiful and the dialogue sharp, and with depth of meaning. The novel is set in high society New York in the 1870s; a social milieu where convention reigned on the surface, but where some of the men had slightly scandalous secrets. Newland Archer and May Welland and about to be engaged to be married and the novel follows their engagement and early married life. Newland falls in love with newcomer Ellen Olenska, who has fled a violent marriage in Europe. This is really about the society of women; Newland Archer believes in his own moral and intellectual superiority, but he really doesn\u2019t have a clue what is happening behind the scenes. Wharton dissects the hypocrisy of a society where customs and position take centre stage. But she also extols the virtue of stability and family life at the same time. This was really like a chess match between Ellen and May; the man being the pawn and the prize and unaware that he was either. The men in the novel are innocent in the sense that they are naive, but they are also corrupt because they are unfaithful and philandering. The women play their game to maintain family, stability and tradition; the men to follow their own devices and desires. Wharton analyses with precision and lays out the society she grew up in for all to see. A great novel and worth reading."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "[Newland's fear of, and failure to breach, Society Rules, leads to possibly one of the most heartrending endings of any novel in my recent memory: his ironic abnegation, sitting on a park bench outside Ellen's flat in Paris, after May's death, having refused an opportunity to meet with her (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "\u201cThe longing was with him day and night, an incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten. He could not see beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her voice. He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it, the rest of the world might seem less empty.\u201d\nOh my God, obsessed much?Actually that quote is misleading because The Age of Innocence is not about a man\u2019s obsession with a beautiful girl. If it was you wouldn\u2019t be reading this review because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it past the first chapter. I just put it there because it\u2019s a nice quote to get the ball rolling as it were.How many books do you read because Hollywood made a movie of it? Books you would otherwise not have heard of? Quite a few in my case. I saw the Martin Scorsese film adaptation in 1993, I didn\u2019t actually like it; I can\u2019t remember why, but the word \u201cboring\u201d springs to mind. In all fairness, I was not in a receptive frame of mind for character-based melodrama in those days. Anyway, I decided to \u201cread\u201d this audiobook version because it was recommended to me as one of Librivox\u2019s* best.The Age of Innocence is about New York\u2019s society during 1870, a time of rapid social changes (thank you Wikipedia!). The novel depicts the upper class \u201cOld New York\u201d society as ultra conservative, prejudiced and intolerant. As the book opens the protagonist Newland Archer is about to marry May Welland who he seems to regard as some kind of vapid trophy wife or arm candy. Winona Ryder as May Welland (no, not cosplaying)He is pleased with himself until Countess Ellen Olenska enters the scene and unintentionally rocks his world. She is something you don\u2019t see every day in \u201cOld New York\u201d a badass strong willed independent lady, beautiful too of course. Michelle Pfieffer as Countess Ellen OlenskaShe has just separated from a European husband who is a despicable cad. This makes her a controversial figure in New York\u2019s high society where women are supposed to stay married to their husbands for better or for worse. Her personality and circumstances fascinate Archer who is experiencing a feeling of ennui from the way his life is proceeding too precisely on track.What makes the novel interesting for me is the depiction of the New York society which I knew nothing about and the dilemma faced by the central characters. Newland Archer is about to \u201csettle for\u201d someone who would make him look good in society, suddenly he finds himself pursuing this enigmatic, charismatic and downright sexy countess. Poor Countess Olenska is tempted but is far too smart to bring even more scandal on herself, not to mention her consideration for the bride to be, May Welland, who is her cousin.I personally do not have a lot of time for Newland Archer who has to decide between Winona Ryder and Michelle Pfeiffer in their prime (movie reference). Though Michelle Pfeiffer (Countess Olenska) is not really an option. However, I am glad to report this is not a tale of adultery, it is more like a satire of the social mores of the time. The book is exquisitely well written, the characters are vivid though the protagonist is not particularly prepossessing. The book ends in a somewhat inconclusive note, as the author deliberately frustrates the reader by not giving the story a proper closure in order to avoid predictability. She did a good job of that, I am duly frustrated and will knock off one star in my rating for her troubles.My thanks to Ms. Brenda Dayne for her gracious and beautiful audiobook narration.

At this point, though, I think that he feels that the roads down which fate has led them have diverged too widely, and that these roads have made them into different people. Newland\u2019s roots are firmly dug into the New England soil now: this is his home, these are his people. When Madame Olenska entered his life as a young man, the possibility of becoming a different man than the one he was raised to be presented itself. Fate ultimately denied him that opportunity, and Newland accepted his destiny. Now he has spent his life among the traditional values of New York society, while Ellen has lived most of her life among the more cosmopolitan free-thinkers in Europe. What are they to do? Is he to leave his home, his children, his social circle, and move to Paris with Ellen and her bohemian group of friends, or is she to give up the freedom and intellectual stimulation of these people to move to New York and drink tea and discuss fashion and the latest gossip with the society matrons there? I think Newland feels he could have taken this drastic step as a younger man, but not now. And who is Ellen now, after all? I think, in his mind, she has become more of a symbol than a real person. \u201cWhen he thought of Ellen Olenska it was abstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed,\u201d (281).

More so, love triangles \u2013 and why they call it love triangles. Just look at this one \u2013 Archer has relations with May and Ellen but the two women do not love each other, so where is the third side of triangle? Shouldn\u2019t it be called love angle or love V? In fact, if you think about it, a love triangle is only possible when at least one of three people is homosexual or bisexual ... well, that is just the kind of thing I wonder about when not working on my paper on quantum mechanics involved in motion of Nitrogen particles in low atmospheric temperatures.Also, I don\u2019t much like leisure classes; for me they represent half the things that are wrong with the world \u2013 they are hypocrites, full of ideas of \u2018society\u2019 and \u2018common folks\u2019, vain, sinfully rich, are always talking about useless subjects like- other equally boring people, balls, marriages, clothes (clothes! Clothes!), food etc. The good thing is Wharton doesn\u2019t much like them either.\nInnocence\n There can be many meanings of the word \u2018innocence\u2019. The people of society pretend to have and collectively impose on themselves conformity to standard of an innocence that is more of an ignorance and a willingness to stay the same - \u201c the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience!\u201dBut in reality these things come involuntarily; you can\u2019t shut them out when they come; although you can always pretend. And so, almost all characters of 'society' are hypocrites. \n\"\u201cIn reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\u201d \nMay is a typical example \u2013 she knows that women are expected to be innocent in above mentioned meaning of the word and so acts naive to affirm to the standard. In affirming to social expectations, she refuses to be honest with her own emotions. The only time she breaks away from social expectations is out of compassion for Ellen and Newland -  \u2019her courage and initiative were all for others, and that she had none for herself\u2019 However, her need for conformity defeats even this exemplary compassion once institution of marriage is thrown into equation.One other meaning of the word \u2018innocence\u2019 is honesty to one\u2019s emotions and ideas \u2013 to cry when one feels like crying, to say and do what one thinks is right and not to take society\u2019s dictation. Far few people accomplish that - Ellen is explicitly told not to talk about her emotions. The only people in the novel who are innocent in this later sense are either misfits (Ellen) or from so-called common people (M. Riviere). And that is why I think that the title is ironic.Newland, the protagonist, is much more rebellious than May. For one thing, his training into matters of social form was not as closely watched; then there was all the sentimental education from novels. He struggles between social conformity and honesty to one's emotions. And that often makes him contradict himself. Sometimes he is saying saying sexist things like  \u201cWhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?\u201d and taking offence because too much of Ellen\u2019s shoulder is visible. At other point he is fighting for women rights. At one point, we are told \u201cFew things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against \"Taste,\" while later he will want to run away with Ellan.In the begining, he is revolting in that he argues for equality of sexes but only in as far as he knows his would-be wife won\u2019t be taking those liberties. But really people are like that. A lot of people I know in real life have this NIMBY attitude \u2013 they want equality for women but only when that \u2018women\u2019 represents distant vague sections of society like people from tv or newspapers \u2013 but they lack similar initiative in their family where habit of traditionally available advantages stops them from doing that.These themes are similar to Lawrence, when compared to his, the psychology of Wharton's characters is more believable and she doesn't preach in as obvious a manner.In fact, there is alternative way of looking at the novel \u2013 Archer\u2019s oscillation between passions and conformity represented in Ellen and May; is a story of many such people; had the novel been written by a man he would have been accused of using May and Ellen as metaphors (especially given how subtly the characters of two women are developed). \n\"\u201cHe had married (as most young men did) because he had met a perfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless sentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had represented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cIn reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\u201d \u2015 Edith Wharton, The Age of InnocenceA masterpiece of literary construction. There doesn't seem to be a word, sentence, or page out of place. At its core, 'The Age of Innocence' is story that shows the strength and the orchestrated customs and mores of social upper-class society of the 1870s, but also shows its narrowness, its contradictions, and its inflexibility. Inserted into this setting is a frustrated love story (almost a love triangle). It is the this frustration that illuminates the tensions between the coming modern age and the Victorian society that is united in its desire to keep the world from spinning forward and apart.I've recently seen a lot of this at churches I've visited and attended. There is this conservative and real need to protect what is considered essential and sacred, but the modern world thrusts all sorts of modern problems and challenges in the way. This happens every couple of generations. People and institutions can either deal with the chaos and disorganization (and beauty) of change or they can hide behind rituals and and a false-front that pretends that \"all is well\" as their world quickly erodes underneath them and they get left behind. Edith Wharton's novel is beautiful and a classic, but it is also timeless because she perfectly captures the emotions and the contradictions that exist in this type of change, this tension as one age dies and another is born."}], "description": "\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0646\u0627\u0647\u06cc - \u0627\u062f\u06cc\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631: \u062c\u0627\u0631 / \u0641\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647", "title": "\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0646\u0627\u0647\u06cc", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18811230", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1384700817l/18811230.jpg", "reviews": 5465, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16.Edith_Wharton", "name": "Edith Wharton"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/752060._", "name": "\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0648 \u0645\u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Historical", "Romance", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18811230", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545294.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1675988.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16283011-the-age-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53835.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216783.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1045327.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53836.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2228129.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6097267-the-age-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17913245-the-age-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8184433-the-age-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113312.The_Age_of_Innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1209893.La_edad_de_la_inocencia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13550459-the-age-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5246.Ethan_Frome", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17728.The_House_of_Mirth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212525.Ethan_Frome_and_Other_Short_Fiction", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26950.The_Custom_of_the_Country", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/269528.Summer"]}
