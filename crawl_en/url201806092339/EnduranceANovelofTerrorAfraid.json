Of course, I will be unable to assist you because I will be standing off at a safe distance with a flame thrower and a light saber ready to go either Medieval or JEDIevil on your ass if you so much as pivot in my direction.\u00a0This is WITHOUT QUESTION the most Fuckered UP family in the long illustrious history of murdering, inbred, nymphomaniacal cannibal family units. These people make the chainsawing Hewitt family from Texas look like the Osmonds on Thorazine. In fact, if Leatherface and Millard (one of the cuties from the book) ever got into a tussle, I am quite sure that Millard would have Leatherface \u201cPulpFictioned\u201d wearing a Tootsie dress with a rubber ball gag and squealing like Ned Beatty in Deliverance while Millard played a game of \u201cmore than just the tip\u201d\u2026 (Please let me know if you think I could have squeezed in another pop culture reference)\u2026.\u00a0So let me give you the baby got backstory on this gorrific literary stroll down Depravity Lane. We begin in West Virginia where we have an old, secluded Bed and Breakfast way back yonder in dem dar woods. Being as far off the beaten path as they are, this place doesn\u2019t get a lot of clubbed foot traffic. However, when the few hotel/motels in the area are overbooked for some big event (in this case a triathlon) there are some \u201chelpful\u201d locals who happen to know about a nice quite B&B that will likely have a vacancy or two for the night.\u00a0With me so far?...Good.\u00a0So these tourists end up at the Rushmore Inn where all of the rooms are themed after a former POTUS (e.g., the Lincoln room, the Truman room, the Nancy Reagan room\u2026jk\u2026). Well, in addition to the patriotic theme, the Rushmore has also been modified by the owners to be a sort of human \u201croach motel\u201d because once inside, you will not be checking out\u2026.until you \u201ccheck out\u201d\u2026.and maybe not even then.\u00a0So that\u2019s your basic set up. Now let me introduce you to a few of the more special hotel staffers starring in this literary snuff piece.\u00a0Up first we have Eleanor named for Eleanor Roosevelt who is the mama bear to this clan of the cave cannibals. Eleanor can trace her roots back a long way and thinks of herself as a gen-u-ine \u201cblue blood\u201d of royal lineage. She is also the only woman (and I use that word asking for a lotta leeway). Why are there no other women? Well that little nugget is for you to discover.\u00a0Next is Jimmy who is a real hoot and a half. You see Jimmy really wants to be doctor\u2026a surgeon to be precise\u2026but he doesn\u2019t quite have the book smarts to get himself a formalized learn on. However, Jimmy still needs to practice, practice, practice his techniques\u2026you see where this is going\u2026Yep\u2026it is just that bad. BTW, Jimmy boy\u2019s for most \u201coperations\u201d survived by a single patient is 8, but he sure hopes to break that record soon. Sorry about the lack of anesthesia so just lie back and try to pass out.\u00a0Third is a real charmer; the aforementioned  Millard. Millard is a huge, deformed mountain of a fuck who happens to be the special combination of crazy, strong, sadistic and horny. Millard is the one person that all of the other \u201chotel staff\u201d are afraid of so you can just assume he is all kinds a nasty.\u00a0Next up is Ronald who is our surprise mystery family member. Ronald lives alone in a cave next to the Rushmore and has a real hankering for meat\u2026a real hankering.\u00a0As for the others, we have a large supporting cast in this little show tune of horror but I don\u2019t want to give away any of the surprises. So I will just say that the rest of the group are all various degrees of male, depraved, sadistic, MASSIVELY DEFORMED and hornier than Charlie Sheen at a strip club on ecstasy.\u00a0 Not a good combination!!!\u00a0So, did I like the book\u2026abso-frickin-lutely. I thought it was fantastic. I knew I was picking up an extreme horror read and Mr. Kilborn did not disappoint. The writing is very good. The horror is scary, disturbing in the extreme and very shocking\u2026but it is not overly gratuitous. By this I mean, while a ton of really bad things that happen and the author is not shy about telling us about them, he doesn\u2019t spend two pages describing a graphic scene of blood and gore so that you are squirming in your seat. The terror is that you know what is happening and he paints some very vivid images in your mind. For me, that is the best kind of horror.\u00a0Still, this is certainly not for the squeamish and I wanted to make sure you knew what you were getting into if you decide to read it. However, if you like horror, this is very, very good.\u00a0 4.0 STARS."}, {"userName": "RedemptionDenied", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55677020-redemptiondenied", "userReview": "Another freebie!

Endurance is some sick and twisted shit. Some of the sickest and twisted-est shit I've read in a very long time. BUT ... and this is an important \"but\" folks ... Endurance is also solidly written, sublimely creepy in parts, with characters you can root for and other characters you can hate. And that's what saves this novel from the unsavory pit of mere torture porn. In a recent documentary, Stephen King makes a very interesting point about graphic violence and horror. This is how he distinguishes 'torture porn': there are times when we are reading/watching to see the monster killed, and there are other times when we are reading/watching to see the monster kill. It may seem like a nebulous distinction, but I think he hit the nail right on the head. That's why the latter makes us feel so dirty; King refers to it as \"morally queasy\". In most horror, we want the monster to be slain, we want the good guys to prevail. Bad shit can happen along the way, but the monster should not become the hero. We root for the victims, we do not root for the sick motherfucker and the pain and carnage he/she/it is inflicting. That's the difference between the first movie in a franchise, and the last movie in a franchise; in the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy is the monster and we want him stopped. By number 5, we're there to see what kind of sick shenanigans he can come up with next, knowing full well that the victims are now fodder to support his starring role. Suddenly, he's the guy we're cheering for (well, sort of, but I hope my point is clear). Don't get me wrong, I'm just as guilty as the next person. I've watched all the SAW movies as each has degenerated more and more into gratuitous violence. But none of them will ever be as satisfying as the original, when I really, really wanted those two guys to survive and slay the monster (before Jigsaw started getting top billing and the best trailer).More to the point (and I've said this many times before), I don't scare if I don't care. Give me characters I can care about and suddenly I start fretting for their well-being and safety. I don't want to see them hurt (no matter how imaginatively), I don't want them to die. I want them to survive and for the monster to be slain. Endurance has a surprisingly large cast of characters for this type of story, and I actually liked them all. I wanted them all to survive and I definitely wanted these freakazoid, in-bred monsters tormenting them to be stopped. There is nothing original here (it\u2019s got Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn all over it, not to mention an unforgettable X-Files episode called \u201cHome\u201d), but Kilborn still manages to give it a nice, ruthless twist of his own.

The author did an excellent job of bringing the characters to life and making them likable before placing them in extremely hazardous situations.Yes, we have read the degenerate hillbilly story before. This author, however, takes a common theme and spins an intensely uncommon story around it. The story alternates between various groups of characters, each as round and likable as the other. He skillfully weaves a razor sharp plot that never feels unclear or confusing, and uses several techniques for building tension and suspense that are so successful it left me wondering why no one had used them before.

Even though the rational part of my brain was telling me, \"This is terrible, you're wasting your time, read something you're actually interested in,\" I just could not look away from the awfulness.Kilborn/Konrath seems to think that \"horror\" and \"gore\" are synonymous terms, but coming up with graphic, creative ways to make your characters bleed to death is not enough to make something scary (neither does having a family of people with grotesque genetic defects trying or threatening to rape every woman that crosses their path). After a while, it becomes almost comical. Or maybe that was just the presidential thing getting more and more ridiculous with each page. Either way, this is far from \"a novel of terror.\"In the Afterword, the author talks about how he chose to publish this book independently because his editors hated it and he didn't want to make the edits they wanted. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to make me think he's ~edgy~ and ~controversial~ and ~unwilling to compromise the integrity of his art~, but instead he comes across as a guy who's trying to make a quick buck by publishing a piece of crap as an ebook.You have an editor for a reason.

This is SICK SHIT! Lord knows I have a high tolerance for the grotesque but this tested my boundaries. Think Texas Chainsaw Massacre times ten. My least favorite horror theme is the one having to do with \"mutant weird psycho family terrorizes and tortures innocent women\" and that is exactly what you get here...multiplied by ten again. At least Konrath does it well. He piles surprise upon surprise and throws in lots of dark humor. Despite my reservations for the plot, I read it in one sitting, staying up late in the night waiting to see what became of our unlucky innocents. Don't get me wrong. I actually liked this. It is a well written tale of terror. Kilborn may be a pulp writer but he kicks pulp writer ass.

I picked this one up because of the glowing reviews of others saying it scared the beejezus out of them. I must say this is one of most nerve-racking, spine-chilling books I have ever read. I started it at night before bed (great time to read horror) and didn't go to sleep. To rephrase, I finished it four hours later and could not go to sleep. After reading this you will check under your bed EVERY time you stay at a hotel. Books that claim to be \"edge of your seat\" thrillers usually aren't. Not \"Endurance\". Reading this was like being repeatedly sprayed in the face with blood and enjoying every minute of it. It's \"Hills Have Eyes\" meets \"Deliverance\" with MORE violence and has a plot so drum-tight that you have to pay attention to every detail because the whole thing comes back full circle. This book contains absolutely zero filler. The characters are strong and original. Jack Kilborn weaves the reader seamlessly through multiple character's viewpoints so effortlessly that by the end it feels like you have known them for years.

A. Konrath's first two forays into straight out horror, Afraid and Trapped, I was looking forward to this third title he released under the name, Jack Kilborn. The afterword reveals that his editors wanted significant cuts, but he refused to give up on it, and his desire to see it released in the form he intended led to him expanding into ebooks.Well, good for Konrath/Kilborn, but truth be told, I can see why his editors had their issues.Endurance depicts the tale of several female triathletes who fall victim to a group of backwoods types who happen to run a very out of the way inn. It might not be anywhere near California, but it's definitely the type of place where once you check in, you can never leave. Though I won't reveal the whys and whereto-fores, it's all fairly bog-standard stuff. Except for the interesting variation Kilborn brings to his cast of (mostly) women in soon to be distress. As triathletes, you expect all of the women to be stronger than the typical characters in this type of novel, and they are, but one is an amputee, and others form three generations from the same family, all of which make for more interesting than usual dynamics.I've said it before, but Konrath is the emperor of teasing character mysteries and then only dolling out critical answers when it mattes most. He also ends every chapter on a cliffhanger, which did begin to grate after awhile, but had the desired effect of making me say \"Just one more...\"Aside from being fairly pedestrian in its narrative, my other bugbear about Endurance was how one-note and interchangeable almost all of the villains of the piece were. I quickly lost track of who was who - other than the matriarchal maniac leading them - so never cared when one or another met their end or did something that might have seemed significant. Less would definitely have been more when it came to the cast of antagonists.All in all then, Endurance is the lesser of Kilborn's trilogy, but it still passes muster and is worth checking out - especially for those planning to continue on with the next book in the series, Haunted House.3 Face-Marring Bone Growths for Endurance."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104823-kate", "userReview": "Deep in the (inbred) forests of West Virginia, the Rushmore Inn has a policy of \"You can check in, but you can't check out!\" Several female contestants in the Iron Woman competition, referred to the Inn due to overbooking, are about to find this out...There's Deb, a mountain climber who lost both her legs in a fall and crawled to safety while being attacked by a moutain lion, who arrives at the Inn accompanied by a flirtatious reporter, and there's Florence, Letti, and Kelly, 3 generations of tough women. And there's Maria - who went missing a year ago, now being hunted for by her fiance and her possibly crazy little brother.This entire crew is going to come head-to-head with the largest, most inbred group of freaks you can imagine...I've read many positive reviews of books by this author here on Goodreads, so when I saw that my library had added several of his books to their ebook collection, I decided to check one out. To my delight, this was a huge violent gore-fest that read like a movie. I loved the army of spunky heroines, and found myself pulling for Mal and Felix (two of the men) to survive as well. There were several unexpected developments along the way, and I was happy when the turn from the women being victims to the women getting their revenge happened early on. The evil inbred Roosevelt clan was interesting, both in their genetic mutations and their motivations, although I kind of wanted to see a little humanity left in them.

Everything is so perfectly paced, characters so perfectly described, situations so out of control and intense that you find yourself breathing heavy, your heartbeat rapidly approaching 180 bpm, your palms sweaty in anticipation of what comes along in the next paragraph. I am one of those guys that goes by the maxim \u201cThe faster, the better\u201d when referring to books. Don\u2019t give me a long backstory, or side plots, or an over written description of settings. Just plunge me straight into the thick of things. Kilborn did EXACTLY that. The action and speed of \u201cEndurance\u201d are truly relentless. From the opening scene of Maria\u2019s paranoia to the final sentence, there is never a second to catch your breath. And just when you thought you couldn\u2019t possibly take anymore, that there cannot be anymore to possibly say, Kilborn is there to grab you and take you along even further.As I just stated the plot is similar to films like \u201cTexas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d, \u201cThe Hills Have Eyes\u201d and \u201cVacancy\u201d but who cares when something like this is so well structured from beginning to end. Plus, you have some of the best characters I can ever recall reading about in a horror novel. Imagine, a legless mountain climber, an ass kicking martial arts grandmother, a distraught fiance who will stop at nothing to get his woman back, and not to mention a whole SLEW of inbred, mutilated, and all together disgusting backwoods, murderous rednecks.I wouldn't go as far as to say \u201cEndurance\u201d is \u201cscary\u201d but it is without a doubt, a creepy novel of terror and this could easily be a blockbuster summer horror film. Kilborn is an immensely talented author and it\u2019s a shame he isn\u2019t as well known as less skilled, higher paid writers in this genre.

I finally broke down and got the book. By the time I finished, I was laughing.Make no mistake \u2013 for the average reader, Endurance scores high on the gratuitous gore chart and may be too uncomfortable for some. But in my opinion, Endurance suffers from two fatal flaws: 1) painfully awkward development of unbelievable characters and 2) a plot that is far too busy with said outlandish characters, scenes and set ups. It\u2019s about as messy as one of Eleanor\u2019s spawn. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate, because had the book focused more on a simpler plot that involved fewer victims and monsters, this tired story might have actually lived up to inspiring terror. As it was, I didn\u2019t really care about any of the victims, all of which apparently possess some kind of superhuman (and superdog) strength and resilience. Good fantasy contains an element of truth; in Endurance, that gets hacked to pieces. I don\u2019t think the author has ever been severely injured to understand just how incapacitating pain can be; because here we have severely broken people running around, climbing trees and doing things that even in an adrenaline-fueled situation would be next to impossible. Each supposedly \u201chorrific\u201d set up is not so much, because you know the characters are somehow going to survive.

Great for horror fans that he put this to good use by writing stuff like this! Endurance is a nasty, twisted, exciting and entertaining tale about a family of backwoods freaks who run a remote hotel to suit their own dastardly ends.Despite being such a nasty piece of work, Endurance isn't constantly explicit. It's clever enough to leave much of the mechanics of the brutality to the reader's imagination which of course can have a greater effect than cataloguing every gory detail.The story follows several people/groups of people and each chapter ends on a cliffhanger for one group then moves to a different group so you don't get to find out what happens for maybe 3 chapters or more. This makes it difficult to put down as the pace never lets up due to the perpetual peril. Occasionally the chapter endings get a bit \"and that's when the screaming started\" cheesy, but it's a tongue in cheek (I think!) style that suits the story well enough not to be too off putting.I'll certainly be reading more Kilborn/Konrath in the future and can recommend Endurance to anyone who enjoys imaginative balls-to-the-walls horror."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17069712-dale", "userReview": "First of all major props to the author for not conforming and publishing some watered down version of what we in our literary community call \"peculiars\", or books with odd, disturbing, or horror plots.What seem to be random circumstances for groups of triathletes are not random at all.

Add to that someone who has no legs and you make for some interesting ways of trying to fight for your life.There are more than one main character in this story, each with their own haunted past and reasons for survival.And this may reflect badly on my own character, but there was a stage in there where I was thinking:Please, whatever happens next, to whomever, just don't kill the dog!Had I read this one before TRAPPED, I may have rated it five stars, but this is more like a 4.5 and I couldn't rate the stories the same.A very solid horror story, highly recommended for fans of the genre."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3606372-tara", "userReview": "I pretty much bought this book because it was only $2.99 on my Kindle, and I love a good horror novel. Also, I might have been born and raised in West Virginia, where this novel takes place. Don't judge me. And no, in the 18 years I lived there, I did not see any mutant inbreeds living in the woods.Endurance is about a group of people who find themselves staying at a very peculiar bed and breakfast out in the middle of nowhere, WV. Most of the guests are attending an Iron Woman tournament in a nearby town. We have Deb, who lost her legs in a mountain climbing accident who came with a reporter named Mal, a family trio entering the Iron Woman competition (grandma, mom, and 12-year-old daughter), as well as Maria, who went missing during last years competition.When I first read some reviews on this book, everyone kept talking about the gore and how it was so awful. I honestly didn't think it was THAT bad. It was definitely gory, but it wasn't any worse than a lot of Stephen King books. Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many horror novels, but if you can tolerate any sort of gore in books, I think you'll be fine with this one. The descriptions of the mutants freaked me out more than the actual gore.I thought the characters were well written and I actually cared whether they got out alive or not. Although I did think it was kind of convenient that most of them were trained athletes, although they were fairly varied - grandma, young kid, woman with no legs. Although the Cam character (Maria's brother, who along with her fiance, have been trying to find her for a year) felt a little forced. I don't really understand why he was thrown in as a \"monster\", when we have enough of them to deal with already.I actually loved the book and already put a few more Jack Kilborn books on my to-read list. I think it's awesome that he publishes his novels on his own as e-books and only charges $2.99. I probably wouldn't have picked up a book by an author I'd never heard of if it wasn't that cheap. Endurance probably isn't the most intellectual book you'll ever read (I hope not anyways), but it's a fun read."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7311297-christopher", "userReview": "I checked this book out from the digital library because it met my high standards:1) I wanted to read a horror book (for Halloween.) and 2) It was available for check out.Also, the rating did not suck on goodreads. So, do you remember that episode of X-Files? You know that creepy one with the inbred hillbillies? Did that episode change your life? Good news! This book is a (sort of) spiritual sequel to that episode. Our heroes are in a small West Virginia town for a Triathlon. And there is no room in town. But there is room at the creepy Presidential themed bed and breakfast. You should go there!What I leaned from this book:1) Don't participate in Triathlon's2) Don't go to West Virginia3) Don't vote (just to be safe.)4) If you have Type O-Negative blood, watch out for inbred hillbillies.In all seriousness this was a pretty good horror read. It tapped into that primal sensation of being watched and not knowing who was watching you. The Rushmore Inn (or whatever it was called. I can't be bothered to remember details) is a super creepy place that definitely added to the tension. About half way through it became kinda gory as we find out what is actually happening. It kind of kills the tension a bit (I always prefer suspense to gore) but the action scenes for the most part are believable and tense. I do want to give kudos to the author for his believable portrayal of a woman who competed in the Triathlon and had previously lost her legs. She had several different prosthetics, including those cool runners \"blades.\" Definitely my favorite character. You will love her too.Time for the list (another one!)The good:1) Super creepy hillbillies that will give you nightmares2) Is someone watching you right now? I bet so...3) Strong female leads including a 12 year old girl who is not completely stupid and a Grandma who can mess you up.4) Learn about mountain climbing, leg prosthetics, and blood disorders!The bad:1) Turns into a splatter fest about half way through killing some tension.2) One character arc takes a weird twist that seems unnecessary.Overall, very satisfying read with a satisfying ending."}, {"userName": "Kathy Jenkins", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4870663-kathy-jenkins", "userReview": "I promise I'm not working for J.A. Konrath or Jack Kilborn, (who, by the way, are the same person) but he is my new best friend. Endurance is sick and gory and a lot of fun! It begins with an athlete who was offered a free stay at a remote bed and breakfast while she participated in a triathlon. However, once she got there, she was attacked by a bunch of deformed, insane, self-proclaimed descendants of royal and presidential blood lines; psychopaths who wanted her rare blood type for transfusions and to impregnate her with royal seed. One year later, her fiancee and her brother are still searching for her when they get captured after torturing one of the perverted family members and another, the sheriff of the town, finds them and takes them to the inn. Meanwhile, there's another triathlon and several more contestants are sent to the bed and breakfast on a free-night stay. If it weren't for JD, the beautiful German Shepherd one of the families brought with them, they'd all be toast. The story is about their escape from dozens of mutant, inbred family members trying to preserve their royal bloodline in the hopes one of them one day would become President of the United States. It's a fast-paced book. The characters are well-developed. In the first few chapters, I was disconcerted because it kept flipping from one group of people to another, but they all came together beautifully."}, {"userName": "Adam Light", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7004622-adam-light", "userReview": "I have now completed the trilogy of terror from J.A. Konrath's nom de plume Jack Kilborn. Well, since I started reading Afraid there has been a fourth - Haunted House - but most of the people I know that have reviewed have panned it. Not sure if I will skip it for that reason, but we shall see.As for Endurance, wow! What a thrill ride. This book was nicely paced, expertly written and suspenseful and horrific as hell. I will certainly reconsider staying in B&B's not listed on any maps in the future!This story was fun and entertaining, but it lacked the brutal balls to the wall tone of Afraid, in my opinion. I felt similarly about Trapped, but I think I may have enjoyed that one slightly more than Endurance.Regardless of those feelings, I would recommend this book for a fun and thrilling trip down terror alley with Jack Kilborn. He has a nice way of making you feel sympathetic with the characters he draws, and then you never know which ones he is going to gleefully kill off.By the way, I was born and spent a lot of my childhood in West Virginia, and yes it really is like this book portrays it. Lots of cleft palates and inbred freaks roaming around. So be careful if you ever go there... you have been warned."}, {"userName": "Deviant-Muse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5156512-deviant-muse", "userReview": "This book reminded me of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" mostly. It was a quick and easy read. The story builds the more you read. Some may think it is slow in the beginning, but it picks up sooner than you think.There were pretty many suspenseful parts leaving me looking at my closet to ensure it was closed. I'm just glad that my bed is flat on the floor so I did not have to keep looking under there too! I love stories like this that make you check your locks and windows 2-4 times before even considering going to bed.I do not scare easily, but this book did have me double-check various rooms and doors in my house. I love when stories can get to me in that fashion. It is not often that they are able to do that. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel a little paranoid after each reading session.An Inn, off-set in the backwoods, is the setting for this paranoid-horror ride. Blood, incest, deformities, torture, and former presidents of the United States are poured into your soul as your read each page.

I love horror of all kinds and I have read other books by Jack Kilborn and loved them so when I came across this one on sale I had to jump on it.Was it scary? I would say not really. Creepy more than scary. Creepy with that I better check under my bed going through your head even though you know you are being silly. Was is gorey? HELL YES and then some. A little over the top even for me at times and good thing I didnt eat and read.Characters you quickly come to love. I could close my eyes and put myself in their place and feel the fear they felt. There were the always present \"dumb ass\" moves that we all see in horror. WHY go up the road that is surrounded by woods and has no true road and lots of things telling you to turn around? Why, because that's what makes these books fun! Part of you is saying TURN AROUND DUMB ASS and the other part is saying GO, SEE WHAT'S THERE. Morbid curiosity?
