Scobie is bound by strict integrity to his role as assistant police commissioner and by severe responsibility to his wife, Louise, for whom he cares with a fatal pity.When Scobie falls in love with the young widow Helen, he finds vital passion again yielding to pity, integrity giving way to deceit and dishonor\u2014a vortex leading directly to murder. As Scobie's world crumbles, his personal crisis makes for a novel that is suspenseful, fascinating, and, finally, tragic.Originally published in 1948, The Heart of the Matter is the unforgettable portrait of one man, flawed yet heroic, destroyed and redeemed by a terrible conflict of passion and faith.My Review: An excellent book. Simply magnificent writing, as always, but more than that the story is perfectly paced (a thing Greene's stories aren't always, eg The Power and the Glory) and deeply emotional (another thing Greene's stories aren't always, eg Travels With My Aunt).Greene himself didn't like the book, which was a species of roman \u00e0 clef. I suspect, though I don't have proof, that he was simply uncomfortable at how much of his inner life he revealed in the book. Scobie's infidelity and his fraught relationship with the wife he's saddled with must have been bad reading for Mrs. Greene. But the essential conflict of the book is man versus church, the giant looming monster of judgment and hatred that is Catholicism. Greene's convert's zeal for the idiotic strictures, rules, and overarching dumb \"philosophy\" of the religion are tested here, and ultimately upheld, though the price of the struggle and the upholding aren't scanted in the text.Stories require conflicts to make them interesting, and the essential question an author must address is \"what's at stake here?\" The more intense and vivid the answer to that question is, the more of an impact the story is able to make. Greene was fond of the story he tells here, that of an individual against his individuality. He told and retold the story. The state, the colonial power whose interests Scobie/Greene serves, is revealed in the text to be an uncaring and ungrateful master; the rules of the state are broken with remarkably few qualms when the stakes get high enough. It is the monolith of the oppressive church, admonishing Scobie of his \"moral\" failings and withholding \"absolution of his sins\", that he is in full rebellion against...and in the end it is the church that causes all parties the most trouble and pain.Greene remained a more-or-less believing Catholic. I read this book and was stumped as to why. The vileness of the hierarchy was so clear to me, I couldn't imagine why anyone would read it and not drop christianity on the spot. But no matter one's stance on the religion herein portrayed, there's no denying the power of the tension between authority and self in creating an engaging and passionate story. A must-read."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88967-ben", "userReview": "I know exactly why I love Graham Greene novels; and this, The Heart of the Matter, is a shining example of Greene at his best. It is vintage Greene, containing all his themes and strengths. No, it's not my favorite from him; but from I've read thus far, it is the best example of all he's capable of -- it is the novel I recommend you try if you want to find out if he's for you. For one, this has the classic Greene love struggles: men and women caught up in that irresistible, uncontrollable force. Greene's depiction of love is not a glorified one; rather, it is an accurate one. He displays the struggles involved with it; he shows that it makes no fucking sense; that it is something that can be manipulated, and that it can easily slip through one's fingers. Love is the epicenter of his character's lives, at times giving them uplifting hopes of glorious heights; but mostly it tears them apart as they try to control, cope with, and intellectually understand something that can't be understood. \"At the word \u2018books\u2019 Wilson saw her mouth tighten just as a moment ago he had seen Scobie flinch at the name of Ticki, and for the first time he realized the pain inevitable in any human relationship -- pain suffered and pain inflicted. How foolish one was to be afraid of loneliness.\"\"If I could just arrange for her happiness first, he thought, and in the confusing night he forgot for the while what experience had taught him -- that no human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another's happiness.\"The characters that one grows to care about in a Greene novel -- those that are the centerpiece of his stories -- are always complex. They have a multitude of opposite natures in their head and heart stuggling, competing, pushing to break through. His \"heros\" and \"villians\" are never easy to decipher and are not reliable, and his likable characters are never perfect men and women -- rather, they are real and human. These epic battles of the mind and heart are not only with love, but often with faith, as well. This provides a deeper element to the internal musings of his characters, and -- as providence (or lack thereof) is always a factor -- brings weight to their actions. Along with this, death is always a thought, always a possibility; always somewhere in the back of the mind. Life is always questioned, always taken seriously, in a Graham Greene novel.Lastly, his novels are awesomely quotable. Often with a line or two he manages to sum up life\u2019s most important issues, offering nuggets of wisdom that can make one gasp for air. My favorite from The Heart of the Matter :\"Innocence must die young if it isn't to kill the souls of men.\" Fuckin' gravy."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james", "userReview": "Graham Greene\u2019s powerful story of morality, integrity, love, betrayal, intrigue, corruption, life changing events and Catholic guilt set in war time Sierra Leone.This is a great book and only the second Graham Greene that I have read (Brighton Rock being the other).

Love is here and now you\u2019re gone what a bitch but then this shipwreck happened, not a metaphor a real one, and the young Keira Knightley (I think we could get Keira - couldn't we?) winds up widowed and prostrate in front of him and it\u2019s oh what a night late September in 42, what a laydee, what a night and he\u2019s a bit Dawn Go Away I\u2019m No Good For You but she props herself up on her one good elbow and says stay...just a little bit alongerrrr, another pink gin Major?

Poor guy doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s on his elbow or his arse and the religion appears to be no help. Anyway he decides to walk like a man for a change and take drastic action. I shan\u2019t give the ending away but I will say this much \u2013 it turns out that big girls don\u2019t cry much. If at all.*******I got to feeling a bit guilty about the above review, thinking well, maybe Graham Greene deserves to be taken just a little more seriously, because, God knows, his books are serious stuff. So I must say that this novel is pretty good stuff and even quite compelling, but I had a crucial problem with it. The central crisis, the horrible dilemma he contrives for his man Scobie to find himself in, is religious. I can\u2019t discuss it without giving the whole show away, so **big fat spoiler warning in dazzly orange lights** . Scobie believes to the core of his very self that if he takes Communion without having confessed his sins and received absolution and \u2013 crucially \u2013 without a genuine desire not to commit the said sin again \u2013 then he will be damned to hell for eternity. Ironical twists abound, as you may well expect \u2013 the woman he\u2019s committing his adulterous sins with and with whom he fully intends to continue, because he loves her, is a non-believer and thinks his convictions are quaint. He doesn\u2019t love her less for that - in his eyes God hasn\u2019t, for inscrutable reasons, given her the grace to see the truth. So, he\u2019s driven to go to Mass with his wife to avoid her being suspicious. And go he does, and gets his soul damned to hell as far as he's concerned. For all eternity! He says : \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done is far worse than murder- that\u2019s an act, a blow, a stab, a shot : it\u2019s over and it\u2019s done., but I\u2019m carrying my corruption around with me.\u201d I mean, really? Is GG seriously saying that going to Mass and taking communion if you\u2019re still intending to carry on sleeping with your mistress is far worse than murder? Really? That\u2019s crazy you know. So if I can't take that very serious point in this serious book seriously, then maybe I the Non-Believer have to turn away muttering \"It's Chinatown, Jack, leave it\" like a gumshoe too far over his head in other people's business. Of course it turns out his wife pretty much knew all about the affair so this abandoned act was really not needed. So there was the irony. There was I say plenty of that sloshing around. However, I could read it as a novel which was an intensely observed case of mental illness and gross self-delusion. Scobie is about as wrong as a person could be about the situation he finds himself in, so maybe GG is implying that he\u2019s wrong about God too, that the ugly version of God Scobie appears to believe in which God is half cruel puppetmaster and half lascivious voyeur of human pleasures and sins and repentances, a very repulsive version, is as wrong as his presumptions that both his wife and his mistress actually care about him. The speed with which they drape replacement male companions about their persons after Scobie\u2019s demise appears to give the lie to that one. This novel hangs in the air like cordite after you\u2019ve finished it with its awful pathetic denouement. So, it's pretty good. A GENERAL COMPLAINT ABOUT A THING NOVELISTS DO While I was reading it something bugged me which is a general point about novels. Authors like to drop nuggets of wisdom into their prose and sometimes I think they should be told to stop because their nuggets aren\u2019t actually wise at all. Examples from this book \u2013 these are from the narrative, not from dialogue, so they\u2019re as it were spoken by GG himself \u2013\u201cHappiness is never really so welcome as changelessness\u201d (p87) [who says it is? I don\u2019t - do you?:]\u201cHe listened with the intense interest one feels in a stranger\u2019s life , the interest the young mistake for love.\u201d (p126) [oh yeah, do the young mistake it like you say? or would they think this intense interest in a stranger\u2019s life was merely really creepy?:]\u201cEvery monologue sooner or later becomes a discussion\u201d (p242) [no it doesn\u2019t:]\u201cWe are all of us resigned to death : it\u2019s life we aren\u2019t resigned to.\u201d (p242 \u2013 two on one page!) [and, er \u2013 no, I\u2019m NOT resigned to death AT ALL, where did he get that idea from?:]Possibly this nugget-dropping is an old-fashioned\u2026 fashion\u2026 which modern writers don\u2019t do. I haven\u2019t made a scientific survey. But if they haven\u2019t stopped nuggeting, they should because it\u2019s not big and it\u2019s seldom clever."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "Four stars, because of the quality of the writing. But I am going to disagree with the label that goes with it, that of \"really liked it.\" Because I did not. I feel no affection for this book, and I doubt that I will ever re-read it for many reasons that I will state below. But for those just reading this to get a quick glance about whether they should read it or not: you should, in short. It is worth it. I just would not expect to fall in love.The book focuses on Major Scobie, a policeman in a British colony of West Africa, where Greene himself spent some time. It's set during WWII, which serves to set up the mood of distrust, fragility and vague apprehension that is to haunt the novel and our hero. Major Scobie is a Catholic, and he is married to a shallow, mild horror of a woman named Louise. Insert her unhappiness, his distance, another woman, another man, and you have your novel right there. Those are the basics. Okay, now I can move forward with this.The book is essentially a character study of Major Scobie. And in that function, it is incredibly thorough, and makes sure to search into every area of his soul, several times over. We really do see the man laid naked in front of us. Which is appropriate, given that he's meant to be Christ figure (and casts himself in that role several times.). Even one of the priests says that \"when people have a problem they go to you, not to me,\" and bemoans the fact that priests are not as useful as policemen. It's an interesting thought, but in any case. To me, he was an embodiment of abstract Catholic virtues, set out in one man, going about life as the Catholic Church would have you do. This made real sense to me for the first part of the novel, where Scobie is deconstructed very well, and Greene's conceit was quite effective, I thought. He shows us the difference between living your life as a man and living your life as an abstract virtue. Scobie stays untouched by the animal side of humans, the love, the anger, all vice ridden emotions found in the world that are not learned, but come from within. We do not see him exhibit any of these emotions. And honestly, you sort of dislike him for it. He is inhuman, which drives his wife and everyone who knows him crazy, and honestly, it drove me a little crazy too. But. I appreciated it as a message about living in the world rather than living apart from it, untouched by it. Scobie's major motivation is pity and compassion, which is exactly what Catholicism would tell you to do. But it seems so distant, so resigned, that its rather awful. You end in pitying Scobie as much as you do the clearly inferior characters around him. Or at least, I did. Graham Greene peppers this study with a great many insightful observations about death and the attachment that we really have for people, and what love really is.**spoiler alert***Which builds into the second half of the novel, which annoyed the flying fuck out of me, confused me and I'm really not sure if I agree with the premise of it at all. Essentially, Greene has Scobie become involved in an affair with a shipwrecked widow named Helen, who has absolutely no one. It's an incredibly sordid affair like one would expect to see in a soap opera, and Scobie is meant to seem all wrong for the role. He has Scobie motivated by pity for her, has him express that it is the weak, the ugly who demand his allegiance, not the beautiful and the intelligent. So this is what makes him succumb to Helen. And then on top of that, he says that he stays with her out of pity. That it was love in the beginning (which I don't believe, as they never show it at all, but skip forward to the part where he is lamenting how love is over) and then it is about duty and responsibility and keeping her happy because if he left, then she would be in pain, and he doesn't want to cause anybody pain. And then his wife comes back, and everyone tells her about the affair, and then she's in pain. And he can't leave either of them because they need him more than God does. That's a direct quote from him. Which is how he squares it with his sinning conscience, carrying on with the whole thing. And then he kills himself because people who love you forget you the second you die, and then nobody will be in pain anymore, and so he's sacrificing himself for them. I just cannot agree with the whole premise and excuse that Scobie makes for his conduct there. I don't believe he ever knew what love was, I don't believe in his reasoning for why he would have succumbed to Helen in all noble motivations. As a Catholic and a girl who's done it before herself, I can certainly see why you would be attracted to someone out of pity. Why you would feel love for people who need you. Fine. But there were many other ways to help Helen other than screwing her, sir. I don't buy that such a distant guy would have \"fallen in love\" due to pity. I buy that he stays with his wife out of pity and responsibility. I don't buy the whole affair, so I can't believe in his moral dilemma. Helen is painted as such an awful whore character I cannot believe why he would have been there at all. (We'll get to that in a second.) Then he goes screaming to God over and over again. I get the penchant for drama. I'm Catholic. Yes, it was interesting to try to see a man live exactly as the Church would tell him, and still to be a human being. But I don't buy that it happened to Scobie. I just hate the whole sordid interlude. I know I'm supposed to hate that its so sordid. But I just think that he made Scobie a much less interesting character throughout it, and everyone else involved were mere representations of what he needed to progress along his moral dilemma, not real people.But. Given that. The last few chapters where he methodically plans his suicide, tries to save everyone the pain around him, quietly goes about his business, and the meditation on what it is like to know that you are leaving the world\u2026 that was good. That was heartbreaking. It was that effective quiet whisper of endless pain that I just thought was incredibly skillful and well done.Okay, I really need to talk about what really offended me in this book though: the terrible misogyny. The characters in this book are horrific. There is an extremely strong Madonna/whore complex that runs throughout it, and is represented by the cardboard cutouts that are Louise and Helen. These women are represented exactly as a man who knew nothing about women but what he read in books would represent them as. Grasping, shallow, bitter, angry, small, but with amazing flashes of insight that awe men!.. and yet they are so childish at the same time, so fragile!.. and then they are so stupid the next second. I hated all the women in this book, and I'm pretty sure Graham Greene did, too. I hated that Louise and Helen weren't women, weren't people, but were mere representations of his moral dilemmas, one dimensional harpies who enacted him scenes, had emotional fits, and generally made his life a living hell. Poor baby man who only wanted peace, but no no, these screeching women just insist upon ruining his life! Women are the root of all evil. If it weren't for them, Scobie would be a perfect Christ angel! No wonder Greene converted to Catholicism, if this was his opinion of women. The Church agrees wholeheartedly. Women must be madonnas who look after your home, to be worshipped, who look after your spiritual well being, and stick by their men when they are unfaithful- i.e: Louise. Or they are lost souls who are ready to fuck the first man who comes by when their hero does not support them- like Helen. They have no inner strength of their own except in those first meetings that drew our hero to them, before they became harpies, like all the rest of women are! The two girls were virtually indistinguishable in their manner sometimes. Maybe that's why I just couldn't get into Scobie's dilemma. The women involved made me want to barf, and his bad taste in them, and his opinions of them as people just revolted me just as much. End opinion: Graham Greene's writing: good, elegant, with quiet insight. Graham Greene's misogyny: godawful."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "551.\tThe Heart of The Matter, Graham GreeneThe Heart of the Matter (1948) is a novel by English author Graham Greene.

Cockroaches, rats and diseases abound. The British colony shares a border with a Vichy French (German-allied) colonial country so there is much intrigue about industrial diamond smuggling and the sinking of ships off the coast. This capital city is a melting pot with Africans and British of course (and the n-word is frequently tossed around by the latter over gin), Germans, and Syrian merchants, some of whom are Muslim and some Catholic.Our protagonist is the chief of police. A man devoted to duty, he manages to create a totally loveless, duty-bound relationship with both his wife and mistress. He grows to dread spending time with either one. We watch his gradual and painful descent from stellar civil servant into evil.The Heart of the Matter is a very \"Catholic\" novel. Unlike Brideshead Revisited, also considered a Catholic novel, the discussions of Catholicism aren't incidental to the plot and characters, but very much in the fore. There are discussions of points of Catholic theology with priests, the protagonist's wife and mistress, and religious discussions at cocktail parties as well as the debates that go on in the police chief's mind. But these aren't prolonged discussions; the plot moves and it's quite a fascinating book, suspenseful to the (bitter) end."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5895486-edward", "userReview": "Introduction, by James Wood--The Heart of the Matter"}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "ALLA FINE IL PRINCIPIOOgni tanto bisogna sgranchirsi, fare due passi, fare un po\u2019 di moto, e respirare una boccata d\u2019aria fresca\u2026 Cos\u00ec come ogni tanto bisogna leggere Graham Greene.O, come nel mio caso, rileggere, visto che Greene l\u2019ho sempre frequentato molto. In entrambe le lingue.Nel secolo di Joyce, un grande narratore che mette sempre al centro dei suoi romanzi una storia da raccontare, impannucciata nel genere giallo, thriller, suspense, spy-story, a me fa gola. [Come mi fa gola Joyce, nessun giudizio di merito]Anche Greene, e il narratore nei romanzi di Greene, non giudica. Mai.E, scende sempre all\u2019altezza dei suoi personaggi. In questo brano, narratore e protagonista arrivano a confondersi: Che stoltezza aspettarsi la felicit\u00e0 in un mondo cos\u00ec pieno di miserie! Aveva ridotto al minimo i suoi bisogni, nascosto le fotografie nei cassetti, cercato di cancellare i morti dalla memoria\u2026. ma rimangono pur sempre gli occhi per vedere, le orecchie per udire. Che mi si mostri un uomo felice, e io vi mostrer\u00f2 il suo egoismo, o la sua cattiveria, o perlomeno la sua ignoranza assoluta. \u201cThe Heart of the Matter\u201d, il nocciolo della questione \u00e8 da molti considerato il miglior romanzo di Greene: sembra contendersi la palma con \u201cIl potere e la gloria\u201d. Personalmente per\u00f2, credo che la darei a \u201cI commedianti\u201d.Se uno sapesse le cose fino in fondo, dovrebbe sentir piet\u00e0 anche per le stelle? Se uno raggiungesse quello che chiamano il nocciolo della questione.E, nonostante il fastidio che sempre mi generano le questioni di fede religiosa, specie se cattolica - perch\u00e9 il pensiero corre subito al vaticano, e a quel referendum per rispedirlo ad Avignone che non si \u00e8 mai fatto, e a tutti gli ipocriti bigotti altezza senso di colpa e family day - nonostante questo, io amo i romanzi di Greene, li godo proprio. E amo anche questo che fa parte del ciclo cattolico. E, di cattolicesimo \u00e8 intriso, come quei cuori grondanti sangue in certe statue del cristo. Cos\u00ec come \u00e8 intriso di senso di colpa fino alla costa e alla cucitura, perch\u00e9 le cose che fanno davvero male sono quelle che \u00e8 cos\u00ec terribilmente facile superare, perch\u00e9 gli esseri umani sono condannati alle conseguenze.\u00c8 ambientato in un posto che Greene non mette voglia di visitare, pur trasmettendone sia il fascino esotico che ferale: Perch\u00e9 mai amo tanto questo posto? \u00c8 forse perch\u00e9 qui la natura umana non ha ancora avuto tempo di mascherarsi? Qui nessuno avrebbe mai potuto parlare di un paradiso in terra: il cielo rimaneva rigidamente al proprio posto al di l\u00e0 della morte, e al di qua prosperavano le ingiustizie, le crudelt\u00e0, le grettezze che altrove la gente riusciva abilmente a mascherare. Qui si potevano amare le creature umane quasi come le ama Dio stesso, conoscendo il peggio di loro.In un clima che limita gesti e parole, Dio pu\u00f2 aspettare, perch\u00e9: come si pu\u00f2 amare Dio a spese di una delle sue creature?In mezzo a uomini e donne qualsiasi (mediocri) nel modo pi\u00f9 assoluto, riuscire a mostrare Scobie come eroe, pur nella sua ordinariet\u00e0 e banalit\u00e0, richiede un\u2019arte che Greene possiede pienamente. Non \u00e8 forse un eroe chi sa comprendere e perdonare gli altri ma non se stesso? Chi non si reputa pi\u00f9 importante della sofferenza inflitta alle persone che ha intorno?Il suicidio di Scobie, protagonista che all\u2019inizio vediamo attraverso gli occhi di un altro personaggio, Wilson, come si farebbe in un film (e quanta frequentazione cinematografica dell\u2019opera di Greene!), \u00e8 gesto catartico e insieme atto di generosit\u00e0, di giustizia, di amore (compassione) verso l\u2019umanit\u00e0.Eppure, Greene sembra incurante del plot: in fondo si capisce dal principio chi \u00e8 Wilson, il mistero sembra avere le gambe corte come le bugie [che invece le hanno lunghissime]. \u00c8 Scobie che riempie la scena, che ci interessa seguire, di cui vogliamo sapere: Scobie ancora un novizio nel mondo dell\u2019inganno, un uomo buono onesto integro nella sua ordinariet\u00e0. Circondato da figure che sono veri personaggi e che Greene descrive con tocchi concisi ed esperti aggiungendo elementi alla trama, arricchendo lo scenario: serve davvero poco a Greene per calarci dentro, to put us in the picture.E condurci in una costante caduta: dallo stato di grazia, caduta nell\u2019amore, caduta nella disperazione, caduta in una terra di menzogne dalla quale non c\u2019\u00e8 ritorno: Ma pare che, alla fin fine, non ci debba mai essere risparmiato niente. Per essere veramente umano, tu devi bere il tuo calice fino in fondo. Se una volta sei fortunato, o un\u2019altra volta codardo, il calice ti viene presentato una terza.Nonostante ci\u00f2, Scobie conserva tutta la sua umanit\u00e0, e brilla in una luce che dura nel tempo:Non gli era mai venuto in mente che la sua vita avesse una vera importanza. Non beveva, non fornicava, non mentiva, ma non aveva mai reputato virt\u00f9 l\u2019assenza di questi peccati dalla sua vita."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "\u201cIf one knew, he wondered, the facts, would one have to pity even the planets? If one reached what they called the heart of the matter?\u201d \u2013Graham GreeneI was raised, as they say \u201cin the church,\u201d and even taught English in parochial (religious) schools for several years, as faith drained from me, inch by inch, year by year. I think of myself as an agnostic now, though I sometimes do pray, just in case, I say jokingly. Though I am not and never have been a Roman Catholic, I am quite familiar with the intricacies of Catholic theology. I was once a doubt-driven Christian. I loved reading the anguished novels of Coetzee, Camus, Dostoevsky and yes, Greene, especially the three central \u201cCatholic\u201d ones that some of have told me emerged out of his own life and moral struggles. Greene was once asked about what he thought was the fate of the three central male characters in The End of the Affair, The Heart of the Matter and The Power and the Glory, and he said he thought Scobie of Heart of the Matter might be in Hell, Maurice in End of the Affair might be in Heaven, and the whiskey priest of Power and the Glory was in purgatory. All three books deal with infidelity, or adultery, which is something Greene himself, a lifelongRoman Catholic, had some painful experience with. Scobie is a British intelligence officer in a colony in British West Africa during World War II. He is married to Louise, and together they had a daughter, Catherine, who died many years ago. Both of the Scobies are observant Catholics. Louise, approaching fifty, doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore, and so he borrows some money to send her away indefinitely. While she is gone Scobie, who has fallen out of love with Louise, and loves no one anymore, not even himself, meets a young refugee woman, Helen, who reminds him of his daughter. He knows she has suffered deeply; he pities her and wants to take responsibility for her, and out of his own anguish and what might just be love, he begins an affair with her.When his wife returns abruptly. Scobie realizes he can leave neither woman, as he knows he will then cause them pain. He wants Louise to be happy, he wants Helen to be happy, and he mainly just wants peace and solitude. He finds in the process that he does love Louise, and Helen, and God. But when Louise encourages him to go to confession, and take communion with him, he realizes he can\u2019t confess something he doesn\u2019t regret, even if he knows it is mortal sin. That\u2019s the heart of the story, what brings Scobie to greater depths of despair, an unforgivable sin in itself.Some quotations that lay out Scobie\u2019s dark psychological/spiritual state: \u201cIt seemed to Scobie that life was immeasurably long. Couldn\u2019t the test of man have been carried out in fewer years? Couldn\u2019t we have committed our first major sin at seven, have ruined ourselves for love or hate at ten, have clutched at redemption on a fifteen-year-old deathbed?\u201d \u201cHe gave her a bright fake smile; so much of life was a putting off of unhappiness for another time. Nothing was ever lost by delay. He had a dim idea that perhaps if one delayed long enough, things were taken out of one's hands altogether by death.\u201d \u201cWe are all resigned to death: it's life we aren't resigned to.\u201d Later, in his struggle with what to do about his dilemma, he talks to Father Rank, and confesses, without making a commitment to change, which is no confession at all, they both know. Later on, Father Rank says to Louise:\"I know what the Church says. The Church knows all the rules. But it doesn't know what goes on in a single human heart.\"Greene remained a Catholic until the end, but he never stopped wrestling with the church even as he engaged in what he admitted was sinful behavior, hurtful to his wife and family. Scobie, like Greene, is no saint. He\u2019s a sinner, deeply flawed, struggling as most humans do in ways we come to sympathize with\u2014if not admire-- him for.The Heart of the Matter was ranked #40 in the list of greatest English-language novels of all time, and from my rereading of it, it\u2019s a deservedly high rating. Greene himself didn\u2019t like the book as much as his critics did, nor as much as his many followers. It\u2019s heavy, even grimly agonizing in places, but it deals with issues of love and morality, betrayal and corruption brilliantly and moving. I actually think The Power and the Glory is even better, but in these books we know Greene is unflinchingly examining the human heart in all its complexities."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050765-laura", "userReview": "Every time I read Graham Greene, I vow to read more Graham Greene. He digs so utterly, completely into the souls of his characters--really, you know them better than most of the real people in your life. Major Scobie is no exception. In fact, everything about this man is laid bare. Scobie is a good man. He is upstanding and moral in a place (British colonial West Africa), time (WWII), and profession (the police) that values deception, injustice, and corruption. The petty colonial British society in the unnamed West African country where he is stationed finds it disagreeable that he has nothing to hide, so they make up scandals to pin on him. Another reviewer mentioned the unsympathetic and shallow portrayals of the women in Scobie's life; they are that way because the whole society is that way. If one looks at the other important male characters around Scobie, one finds that they are equally shallow and unsympathetic. It's not misogyny that drives Greene's portrayals; it's disgust for upper-middle-class colonial British society (see Forster's A Passage to India for another take on that). The point is that Scobie is different than they are.But back to Scobie himself. He is a Catholic who truly believes in God, suffering, and redemption. He won't take communion in a state of sin, but he also won't confess when he knows he has no intention of quitting his sin and feels no remorse. There is a scene towards the end, when his wife practically begs him to go to Mass--and communion--with her, and he finally agrees. The wrenching torment he feels at receiving the Host in his disgraced state is as harrowing and traumatic as a battle scene would play out in any other writer's work. And after he's taken it, he feels as bereft as any soldier who's lost a limb would. My heart actually beat faster, and I felt a sucking horror on reading it (maybe that's just because I'm Catholic, though--hehe). Scobie is moral in the the traditional societal sense--but he also feels an irresistible responsibility towards others. The turning point for him is when his wife insists she must get away to South Africa--for her sake, for his sake--to give him some peace, she says. He can't afford to send her, but he knows how much she wants it, so to make her happy, he gets a loan from a disreputable businessman. The loan is on the level, but it leads to other favors being asked, and hence to corruption for Scobie. Then comes another temptation in the form of a fellow human who is weak, desperate, and alone. Again Scobie must (or feels he must) be the savior, and becomes the lover of a young widowed shipwreck victim. It wasn't what he intended, but intense friendship, especially when pity or gratitude is a component, does at times turn passionate, even without the consent of the parties involved.In the end, Scobie is so conflicted and unable to see a way to making everyone happy--everyone he cares about, anyway--that he decides the only solution is to remove himself from their lives. And he does so; but in doing so, he condemns himself to eternal damnation, at least in his mind. He makes this ultimate sacrifice of his own salvation because of his love, pity, mercy--whatever you want to call it--for those who are petty, misunderstanding, undeserving, and unworthy.This is true tragedy: the hero has a tragic flaw, that which is within himself, that leads him to his own demise. It was very affecting.

Scobie is incorruptible, but not na\u00efve. Even though it's not a glamorous posting, he actually loves his work and the area. However, when he gets passed up for a promotion to the top police job, it puts stress on his marriage to Louise. Scobie doesn\u2019t love her anymore, but does feel responsible for her. He can\u2019t resolve his wish to stay with her desperate pleadings that they should leave. Despite his desire to just do his job and try to keep the peace and limit the diamond smuggling that is flourishing during the war, Scobie is soon facing a host of problems. Rumors are flying that he was passed over for sleeping with native women or taking bribes from Yusef, the local smuggling kingpin. A new British official named Wilson seems to have fallen for Louise and may have a larger secret agenda, Louise is falling apart and Scobie can\u2019t raise enough money to send her out of the country. Trying to fulfill Louise\u2019s wish to leave will cause Scobie to bend his own code, and that sets off a chain of events that trap him in an ethical dilemma that he can\u2019t square with his own Catholicism. It\u2019s bad enough to make mistakes that put you in a situation that someone you care for will be hurt no matter what, but when the Catholic rule book assures you that you\u2019re going to be damned for eternity if you can\u2019t do things exactly according to the manual, it makes for a rather shitty moral dilemma.Great writing, believable characters, a unique setting and a tragic situation made for very compelling reading."}, {"userName": "Roberto", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15956368-roberto", "userReview": "La legge interioreE' un po' che giro intorno a Graham Greene, scrittore cattolico, di cui ho letto Fine di una storia, Il potere e la gloria e poi questo Il nocciolo della questione.Che ci fa uno scrittore cattolico negli scaffali di un lettore non cattolico? La risposta \u00e8 semplice: se lo scrittore \u00e8 bravo: incuriosisce, fa riflettere, costringe a ripensare alle proprie convinzioni.Il nocciolo della questione \u00e8 un romanzo cupo, angosciante, introspettivo, senza ironia. Ma anche sincero, lucido, chirurgico, doloroso.La trama \u00e8 ben poca cosa. Potremmo dire che c'\u00e8 un triangolo amoroso, ma questo potrebbe far pensare a ben altre cose, che qui non ci sono. Non c'\u00e8 morbosit\u00e0, non c'\u00e8 sessualit\u00e0, non c'\u00e8 ardore. C'\u00e8 solo molta solitudine.Il protagonista \u00e8 un poliziotto, un uomo giusto, tormentato, che si interroga e si giudica in continuazione. Un cattolico, che per\u00f2 interpreta la figura di Dio in un modo diverso, un uomo che si chiede la ragione per cui valga davvero la pena di vivere. Un peccatore, anche, come inevitabilmente lo siamo tutti.Un peccatore che vive tragicamente questo dissidio tra moralit\u00e0 e azioni. Una persona di buona volont\u00e0 ha dentro di s\u00e9 un dio che guida, che fa fare le cose seguendo delle regole di moralit\u00e0, che guarda costantemente, che costringe a pensare a ci\u00f2 che si fa e che giudica. Soprattutto un dio da cui non ci si pu\u00f2 nascondere.Questo dio siamo noi, che siamo i pi\u00f9 spietati giudici di noi stessi. \"Sapeva per propria esperienza come la passione morisse e l'amore se n'andasse, ma la piet\u00e0 rimaneva sempre. Nulla mai diminuiva la piet\u00e0: la condizione umana la alimentava di continuo. C'era solo una persona al mondo per cui egli non poteva aver piet\u00e0: se stesso.\"Ma non tutti sentono veramente la presenza di questo dio. Alcuni seguono semplicemente dogmi, sembrano magari osservanti le regole, ma dentro di s\u00e9 si lasciano andare a pensieri tutt'altro che lodevoli. In altre parole, le persone migliori non necessariamente sono quelle che appaiono tali; o, detto in altro modo, non \u00e8 il rispetto dei dogmi che ci rende migliori, quanto il cuore pulito con cui facciamo le cose.Ma se il nostro giudice siamo noi stessi, con che diritto possiamo permetterci di giudicare gli altri?Il nocciolo della questione per Greene \u00e8 che viviamo inseguendo delle emozioni, che ci portano a fare azioni che devono poi essere giudicate dal nostro dio interiore. Non possiamo evitare di peccare. Non possiamo evitare di seguire le nostre emozioni. Non possiamo evitare di guardarci dentro, ma nel contempo dobbiamo evitare di giudicare gli altri, perch\u00e9 non sappiamo le intenzioni che hanno guidato le azioni altrui. \"La disperazione \u00e8 il prezzo che si paga per essersi proposti una meta che non si pu\u00f2 umanamente raggiungere. \u00c8 il peccato irremissibile; ma \u00e8 un peccato che il corrotto e il malvagio non perpetra mai. Costui spera sempre, non raggiunge mai il gelo della consapevolezza di essere totalmente fallito.

He has this essential misunderstanding about God: he thinks that it is hard, and the struggle to reconcile your actual life with what you think God thinks it ought to be is a terrible battle that deserves empathy.

I won't lie, like Monsignor Quixote it has dated more than some of his other works - possibly due to their exploration of internal religious conflict with faith playing a heavy role, rather than just an ethical or spiritual debate without the exploration of Christianity. Nevertheless, The Heart of the Matter a powerful novel. It possesses the love elements along with the spiritual conflict of The End of the Affair, yet it also has the deeper historical layering of Greene's The Power and the Glory. I personally think it better than the former and not quite as strong as the latter.In The Heart of the Matter, Scobie, an officer situated in an oppressive Africa, has sent his wife away for a holiday. In her absence he falls though for a younger widow, Helen. Scobie battles with his loyalty and faith, as he spirals into a life of so-called sin. The Heart of the Matter is a tragedy in every sense of the word - and a bloody good one too."}, {"userName": "Krok Zero", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1373169-krok-zero", "userReview": "Policeman stationed in colonial Africa cheats on his wife, gets involved with shady diamond smugglers, struggles with his Catholic faith, and endures no end of anguished self-analytical rumination. Funsy!Three stars means \"liked it.\" I liked it. But the thing is, I recently read Greene's The Quiet American, and looooved it, and hoped this would be in the same vein and that I would loooove it, but it wasn't and I didn't.The Quiet American is tightly plotted, full of witty irony, sharply drawn characters, exquisitely cynical melancholy, and still-relevant political anger. It's just a great novel, so great that I didn't even write a review because nothing I could say could measure up. This one............I dunno. It's good, Greene writes fabulously readable prose and has a knack for stinging aphorisms that nail down certain miserable aspects of human nature. I enjoyed it, wasn't bored. But the character work was weirdly flat (esp. the women), and the story's rather mundane events never justified the emotional fever-pitch at which the protagonist is consistently operating. Fowler in Quiet American was a miserable bastard too, but he wasn't constantly going on about it like Scobie in Heart, who often repeats repeats himself, or rather Greene often repeats repeats himself on behalf of Scobie. Also, Fowler was miserable in some specific, concrete, logical ways; Scobie is just kind of broadly emo. I also wasn't really into the God stuff. I skimmed the God stuff.So not a huge fan of this one, but definitely a fan of Greene generally and looking forward to plowing through more of his prolific oeuvre.

I first knew him from reading an excerpt from his \"The Power and the Glory\" (typed and roneoed sheets) in one of our English literature course 40+ years ago. I found reading him simply amazing to me then, I couldn't help wondering how he wrote superbly and why, his narrative was so powerful that I had to go out at Asia Bookstore in Bangkok on Sukhumvit Road in search of a Penguin paperback and kept reading off and on from Book 1 onward, and left it at that due to probably my fledging skill in English reading proficiency, limited understanding on his writing style as well as background knowledge on its characters especially its rare synopsis in which we can now conveniently search and read as we like from Wikipedia, for instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hea... or his biography: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_... in which, again, we can gain more familiarity on his writing career and essential information related to any particular novel.Good news! I've just finished reading this acclaimed fiction after my hesitant delays spanning some four decades. A reason, I think, was that I didn't enjoy reading him whenever I picked him up, in other words, my motive was not powerful enough to push me forward, no one pulling me; however, this was my case and I hope to read him more because I've seen something glimmering after reading for some information, ideas, inspirations, etc. from the aforementioned websites. I\u2019ve since had my deep pity toward Major Scobie, as a 50-year-old Deputy Commissioner, the protagonist trapped by his fate in supporting his wife to travel to South Africa unknowingly exploits himself further by borrowing 200 pounds from cunning, cold-blooded Yusef. Eventually, he comes across to know a widow named Helen, 30 years younger, whose sarcastically sharp and bitter tongue he has to endure as a secret mistress. Desperately, he tries to solve his seemingly lingering ethical-related problems but in vain so he finally takes his life, it is too sad to read this part in which, I think, the author has done his best till we nearly know nothing on such a horrible decision. We can see Greene\u2019s narration is so powerful that few modern writers can surpass him; his life-like dialogs always are enjoyable to read on and on. In brief, those keen Greene readers should not miss this fantastic novel famously acclaimed by the Modern Library in 1998 as the 40th novel on its list of 100 best English-language novels in the 20th century. However, I think its readership would not be limited to specific time because this novel has amazingly portrayed such a fateful life worth pondering with pity and compassion."}, {"userName": "Paula M.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52538555-paula-m", "userReview": "\u00c1frica, por altura da II G.G.

I've read only one other Greene besides this one, 'The Power & the Glory', and I found this the more impressive of the two. But perhaps I did not buy/believe the other as much as I did this one; I read it when living in Mexico (where it was set). Of course I was also much younger then.who knows. But you can be sure I'll be reading many more of his."}, {"userName": "Gela", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30717519-gela", "userReview": "A nice man who is a people pleaser marries a manipulative, cunning woman.

Ma non sa ci\u00f2 che avviene in un solo cuore umano\" Cosa guida l'agire di un uomo?- Emozioni- Interessi- Conformismo- Regole- ...Ma quanto la leva che muove l'uomo si compone di misericordia? Una parola talmente desueta da esserci divenuta quasi estranea.Misericordia chi era costei?\"Nobile sentimento di compassione attiva verso l'infelicit\u00e0 altrui, di solito promosso da una virtuosa inclinazione alla piet\u00e0 o al perdono: avere m. di un povero infelice. Dio perdona tante cose, per un'opera di misericordia! (Manzoni)\".Scobie, il protagonista di questa storia, \u00e8 un uomo che \u00e8 mosso sostanzialmente da questo sentimento dal nome antico e cos\u00ec poco agito da parere quasi deprecato. Egli prova nei confronti di chiunque tranne che verso se stesso questo \"nobile sentimento\".\"L'amore \u00e8 soltanto il desiderio di capire; e adesso, a causa di quel costante fallimento, anche il desiderio di capire moriva; e l'amore pure, forse; o, ecco, si mutava in quel penoso attaccamento, in quella lealt\u00e0, in quella piet\u00e0...\"E oltre questo sentire, \u00e8 caricato da un altro gravoso sentimento, la responsabilit\u00e0 nei confronti di chi ama. Nessuno delle persone che ama deve soffrire a causa sua.Scobie si pone continuamente in discussione. Ogni mossa che Scobie fa viene sottoposta al vaglio della sua coscienza. Coscienza che risulta essere un giudice assai poco misericordioso.\"\u00c8, cos\u00ec almeno si dice, il peccato irremissibile; ma \u00e8 un peccato che il corrotto e il malvagio non perpetra mai. Costui spera sempre, non raggiunge mai il gelo della consapevolezza di essere totalmente fallito. Solo l'uomo di buona volont\u00e0 si porta sempre in cuore questa capacit\u00e0 di dannazione \"Se l'azione compiuta va contro le regole che ti sei dato ma \u00e8 agita con cuore puro ed intenti onorevoli, l'uomo che la compie deve essere condannato/giudicato? E da chi nel caso: da altro uomo o dal suo Dio (se crede)? L'uomo di 'buona volont\u00e0' pu\u00f2 avere un giudice pi\u00f9 severo di s\u00e9 stesso?E chi \u00e8 pi\u00f9 puro? Chi rispetta formalmente tutte le regole senza provare la bench\u00e9 minima emozione, completamente privo di piet\u00e0 o 'desiderio di capire' alcuno? O chi compie azioni non proprio correttissime per cercare di preservare chi ama?Ed arriviamo subito al nocciolo della questione che \u00e8 ben espresso dal pensiero di in epigrafe:\"Il peccatore \u00e8 al cuore stesso della cristianit\u00e0 ... nessuno \u00e8 cos\u00ec competente come il peccatore in materia di Cristianit\u00e0. Nessuno, se non il santo\". Come dire che (santi esclusi) solamente bevendo il proprio calice fino in fondo, riesci a essere veramente umano.Un romanzo opprimente, ossessivo, angosciante, cupo tormentato al pari del suo protagonista. Il rapporto di Scobie con Dio o con la propria coscienza non lascia spazio ad alibi o a giustificazioni. E questo essere cos\u00ec severi con s\u00e9 stessi, \u00e8 proprio tipico del puro di cuore, dell'uomo di buona volont\u00e0.Mi vien da dire che i gesti che ciascuno di noi compie andrebbero forse accompagnati da un foglietto di intenti. E dovrebbe essere proibito per legge l'esprimere giudizio sull'altrui agire.Se la piet\u00e0, la misericordia e l'amore costituiscono il motore che muove l'uomo, non credo possa esistere un Dio non assolve questo uomo dai suoi peccati.\"Pu\u00f2 sembrare una cosa strana da dirsi, per un uomo che era nel torto come lo era lui, ma io credo, per quanto lo conoscevo, che egli amasse veramente Dio\""}], "description": "Scobie is an officer in a war-torn West African state.
