Lovie said, \"to not merely know nature, but also feel nature.\"This is also a companion to Swimming Lessons by Mary Alice Monroe.An excellent read with kids before heading to the beach and learn the magic of the turtles.Interesting facts:*In May, Loggerhead turtles return to the island to lay their eggs. In July, first nests begin to hatch.In August, Turtle Teams do a nest inventory. 3 days after hatchlings emerge, they record the number of hatched and unhatched eggs.*Turtle tracks look like tire tracks.*Turtle eggs look like ping pong balls. After nests are laid, 55-65 days for eggs to hatch.*When the hatchlings merge out from a nest in mass, it's a \"boil\" like a pot boiling over.*If Turtle team has to move a nest, they use a large cockle shell to dig a new nest. *After 30 years, the adult female turtle will return to the same area they hatched to lay their eggs. From 3 inches to over 3 feet, and up to 350lbs.*On average, a loggerhead lays 4 nests a summer about 2 weeks apart. She lays between 80-150 eggs in each nest. She lays nests every 2-3 years. *Tip: if you play in the sand, smooth it out before you leave. Turtles or hatchlings might have a hard time going around big holes and sand castles.*Kiawah shells I get yearly are: whelk, cockle, clam, & I see molted horseshoe crab shells (huge)"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "A companion book to the author's earlier Swimming Lessons, this short book chronicles a season spent by a mother and her daughter at the beach. While the daughter picks up seashells for her mother, the author spends time observing and caring for sea turtles and their hatchlings. Clearly, both family members love the turtles, and the photographs show how large the mother turtles are and how small and helpless the little ones. The book is filled with astute observations about turtles as well as cautions about how lights from houses along the beach or even flashlights can disorient them when they are heading to see. It's amazing how such a little thing can make all the difference in the world, and it's inspiring to read about how one mother passes on her own passion for turtles to her daughter. While I might have liked to have had more text, young readers and their teachers will surely relish this fascinating book, primarily for those fantastic photographs."}, {"userName": "ACS Book-finder", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12808357-acs-book-finder", "userReview": "This is an amazingly informative book about sea turtles. I loved the photography and explanations for each photograph. I learned a lot from this book and that it will be a great book for all ages. The excellent photography will help to keep the reader engaged while learning all about sea turtles. Identification of other sea life and shells creates a multipurpose read or study for children to learn about the seacoast. The back of the book has a special section, \"For Creative Minds,\" which helps the reader (and the adult to guide the child) in learning about the wonderful cycle of sea turtles and shell identification. This would be a wonderfully engaging book for families to read prior to a trip to the coast and to take with them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItMm...DISCLOSURE: A complimentary copy was provided by Arbordale to facilitate this review.
