Festering disputes between neighbors, or an angry wisecrack aroused suspicion, and spectral evidence \u2013 reports by possessed girls that a person\u2019s invisible specter tormented them \u2013 was enough to sign a death warrant. Rebecca Eames of Andover was one of hundreds accused of witchcraft, and she was lucky to survive being jailed for months in horrific conditions.Peni Jo Renner has vividly portrayed Rebecca\u2019s story in her 2013 historical novel, Puritan Witch: The Redemption of Rebecca Eames. Ms. Renner combed through historical documents to write about Rebecca and her ordeal, and produced a fresh, spellbinding tale. It deviates sparingly from actual events, mostly in shedding confusing duplicate names, and Ms. Renner\u2019s notes inform readers what is fiction, and what is the searing truth.

Personally, I am not a fan of witch trial stories, but can honestly say that Peni drew me into her story and engaged my senses with each word.Rebecca\u2019s character is intricately woven and filled with experiences that make our heart quake. From the imprisonment and feelings of depression, the tale is crafted in a manner that makes the reader feel everything that Rebecca feels. I personally, living in a country where loss is a regular occurrence, could easily identify with the situations and feelings that were written by the author. That realism helps the reader connect with the story. From the first angry words that start the ball rolling to the final curtain, I found myself enthralled in the story.I believe that the author has crafted a story that will shock, disturb and bring people into a greater understanding of the life and times during the Salem Witch Trials in the 17th century. She has gone to great lengths to get the dialogue and language in sync with the time period and has given the reader an emotional roller-coaster throughout the pages of the book. If you don\u2019t come away from this story with a different perspective on life, loss and conflict, you have missed the experience."}, {"userName": "Lise Gagn\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23860896-lise-gagn", "userReview": "As a friend of Peni's, I had the opportunity and the privilege to read, as it was written, Puritan Witch; The Redemption of Rebecca Eames. As I was reading, it made me go through a bundle of emotions. It made me travel back in time in an era where religion was ruling. The author has such a way to tell her story that you are transported into Rebecca's life and you're able to feel what she was going through. A very special and emotional journey.

Rebecca's outburst leads to her being branded as a witch and her capture is nothing short of horrific, played with a brutality that is fitting with the paranoia of the times. The way everyone quickly turns against her is delivered with such malice and wonderfully written in a way that makes the absurdities of the time feel very real.Rebecca's story is one of heartbreak and suffering. There is no white knight to save her and even she is truly a victim of the proceedings that surround her. Her story is a passive one (there's very little sign of escape plans or her having any control over her own destiny) and that makes the violence all the more harrowing.Every time we return to Rebecca in the narrative she experiences another trauma either to her or the friends she makes within her cell. Although many of these events are horrific they are quickly told without dwelling on the gory details or glorifying the violent nature of them. Nonetheless readers who dislike the idea of torture in any form may be put off by this.Readers may also find the aforementioned passive nature of the story frustrating as the resolutions to the character's stories tend to come from outside influences that take hold of their lives. This is mainly because the book is based on real life events and in that regard it is a triumph. The author resisted the urge to embellish events and what we're left with is a great character study on how extraordinary events can change an individual and how their faith can carry them through the darkest of human nature."}, {"userName": "Hock Tjoa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705351-hock-tjoa", "userReview": "As someone who has tried to research my genealogy I rejoice in the success of a fellow traveler, but as a reader, I am distracted.Mixing fact and fiction is like patching an old garment with new cloth. Readers will be more conscious of how \"facts\" have been handled and, when in a fact-checking mode, are not the most flexible. Increase Mather and Thomas Brattle did, over time, become troubled by the witch trials and speak up against the assumptions and procedures on which and by which the trials were conducted, but were their actions the reason why Goody Eames and some of the women were finally released? I found the novel vague on this.Fact requires that we ask if prison conditions were as described and how long men and women could have survived on a ladle-ful or two of water or gruel a day. Fact would inquire if Dorcas Good, a four year old was indeed sexually assaulted, and fact is wounded if all the reference to such an assault produced was an instance of the MC's capacity for outrage.The suffering of the Eames family and its quarrels with the Swans are well imagined. The book is long enough that readers expect to learn the differences in character between, e.g., Lydia and John (but we don't). The scalping of two Abenaki bucks seems a distraction. Regardless of the evidence, we want/need to know why it is in this story. The rose does not need this kind of gilding. The use of the Geneva Bible has an authentic feel and the reference to Goody Eames as a \"Puritan\" witch captures the very real likelihood that persons of good faith were indeed falsely accused, tried and imprisoned.I read this novel with a blend of appreciation and discomfort."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24261992-sandi", "userReview": "This is a very well-written book.

It paints a gruesome, mind-blowing tale of a dark period in America's history -- the Salem witch trials. The author, Peni Jo Renner, says in her 'about the author' section that she is actually a direct descendant of the story's protagonist, Rebecca Eames, and that is truly something to think about. People flock to Salem every year by the hundreds to 'vacation' in these places where hundreds of men, women, and children were murdered in the name of God, and it's just 'SO COOL!' to visit Salem. And I've been there, myself, and it was incredible. But I think that we often forget that the people who died there were just people. They weren't part of some super fun reenactment trial. They were real people who lived and died horrible deaths. This book does a great job of bringing the human element back into the story of the Salem witch trials. Reading about the horrifying struggles that the Eames family had to suffer through simply because Rebecca spoke her mind to a man whose family had hated the Eames' family for years... it's just... Wow. What a perfect example of how much damage hatred and ignorance can cause. However, it was also very uplifting at times. Seeing how the Eames family managed to keep their faith in God despite all the horrors they suffered... very inspiring. I know that the book itself is fiction, but as Ms. Renner says, it is a fictional book based off of real events and real people.It's one of the better books I've received through the Goodreads giveaway program.

My mother and Uncle are Ames', and my sister still lives not far from Boxford, MA. And I had just taken my kids to see Rebecca's grave site over a Christmas visit to the area this past year (Mount Vernon Cemetery for those looking for a tie to the book!)My father had uncovered some of the original trial scripts, but it was hard to envision what life was like at the time. This book did give a great insight into the surrounding hysteria of the Salem witch trials - and the almost perfect normalcy that it seemed to convey at times. And for that - I'm grateful to the author. I guess my main complaint that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the freedom with which she mixed truth and fiction. I shouldn't let this bother me, and she did \"come clean\" in the epilogue about where she had taken liberties, and it wasn't billed as a totally non-fiction book...But taking my emotional ties away, the book won't go down as a 5-star classic. While the topic definitely is one that demands the reader to go into some dark places, it was just a little too much drama at times.

The physical paperback itself is very high quality, which is something we are not seeing quite enough of with all of the changes that the industry has taken in the last few years. Ms. Renner's writing style is engaging, and the dialogue quite realistic. Not many authors catch the dialect of that region and era half so well. It became evident as I devoured this book page by page, that Ms. Renner did not limit her research to the historical aspects of her story, but also into the normal day to day living of the time. This attention to detail brought life to her characters and realism to the unimaginable events that transpire within the tale.The flow was flawless with the exception of one area, I will attempt to explain without giving too much story away. I will just say that it was a revert in time, involving Native Americans. It was short, and no doubt, needed in order to clarify an event, but it almost read like an after thought.There were a few areas, not many, where the text seemed a little hurried, but enough so as to distract. These rare instances caused a slight disappointment only in that I would have liked to have read more.At roughly 224 printed pages, I believe the novel could have easily been much longer but I have always loved a lengthy novel :-) I would have enjoyed having the novel begin at an earlier point in the lives of Robert and Rebecca Eames. There was enough back story to indicate that this would have been very possible, and I think it could enrich the story further.However, the way Ms. Renner describes the hideous conditions that Rebecca and her cell-mates endure is impeccable. The reader is able to envision the cell perfectly and quite easily imagine the anxiety and hopelessness these imprisoned women endure while they await their fate.I felt like a witness at the trials and hearings.Remarkable book, I gave it a solid, well-deserved 4 stars.

The reader is led into a world of heart breaking and brutal horror, when hysteria gripped a community and neighbours allowed their fear to turn them against innocent friends. These victims suffered persecution, incarceration, pain and miscarriages of justice. We are allowed to witness Rebecca's imprisonment, terror, physical and mental pain, and feelings of hopelessness; all of which cause her to sink into a malaise of madness. Her tragic tale begins with an angry word, said one day, during a quarrel with a member of the Swan family, with whom there is a long standing feud. The author\u2019s treatment of these events illustrates well how such an everyday incident could cause someone, like Rebecca Eames, and their family to lose everything and makes one realise that no one was truly safe then. Although, I must admit it did make this reader pause to think of what similar atmospheres probably exist in communities governed by the Taliban, or even amongst the past societies of Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin.This is a well written, if disturbing, first novel. The book is well researched and from it I gained much additional knowledge. Peni Jo Renner's writing style is engaging, with realistic dialogue that seems characteristic of the region and times. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, which normally does not include myself as I find the blend of fact with imaginative fiction unsatisfying and usually full of holes. It was not the case with Puritan Witch which I found absorbing and strangely enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Carole P.

Painstakingly researched, Peni Jo Renner tells the story of one family and how the the witch hunt affected each person. She starts at the beginning, with the first teenage girls afflicted and describes how it spreads through the entire community. Whether spawned from ignorance, malice, or jealousy, the accusations spread to affect an entire population. No one was safe, men, women and children were thrown into prison to rot and eventually be hung. Many confessed out of sheer terror, while others self righteously clung to their innocence, to die on the scaffold or in other hideous ways. The pressing death of Giles Corey was retold in horrific detail, as was Dorcas Goods and Rebecca's slow descent into madness. Graphic, realistic, and heart breaking, Renner captures the breakdown of society as neighbors turn against each other, using the laws of God and humanity to punish and destroy without conscience. This is the story of one family who faced the fires of this countries inquisition and emerged to once again find solace in their faith.

Peni Jo Renner has used the facts she has uncovered about her family members who lived during the period of the infamous Salem witch trials, and the details of what life was like then, in a way that is sympathetic to the flow of a good story; she blends fact and fiction in such a way that we are simultaneously entertained and informed. The pacing is good for the nature of the story and the various events give a good insight into how the Salem trials came about. There\u2019s nothing worse than having historical research rammed down one\u2019s throat in a work of fiction; thankfully there\u2019s none of that here, but there is a helpful little glossary at the back for anyone unfamiliar with some of the more archaic words.The characters are well-rounded individuals with whom I could live that life as seen through their eyes.

Although a quick read I found that it was an emotional read. Human nature, mistakes of the past that come back to haunt you, fulfillment with life, there was a lot going on.

I enjoy colonial-era literature quite a bit, though most traditional publishers won\u2019t yet publish them, so anytime I see a book come along from this era I am more than happy to take a read. Generally, though most of self-published, they are well-researched and well-written as this one was also.Taking place in 1692 Massachussetts during the Salem Witchcraft Trials, Renner\u2019s debut novel follows Eames\u2019 life and struggles in this tumultuous time period of history. As Eames is wrongly imprisoned during the trials, what she and her fellow captives had to endure was enough to make you feel nauseous, let alone those women who were actually killed. The portion of the book dealing with the imprisonment and death sentences were emotional, especially as Rebecca lived through the dreadful day.The novel is authentic in feel, the history fairly accurate, and as I already noted, the research was obviously done. With it being based on the author\u2019s ancestral line, it makes it feel even more real. The dialogue was realistic for the time period and yet still easy to read and you felt connected to most of the characters and their feelings. I did appreciate how Renner gave us an account of how all family members and other felt during this time, not just those sentenced.It\u2019s a very quick read, at just over 200 pages. With such depth of history, I felt that she could have easily added more intrigue or background information and details in order to not only tell her family member\u2019s tale but to educate reader on the Salem Witch Trails. I hope she considers giving her novel more room to grow the next time around and adding more character developments and historical information. However, if you are looking for a fast read you can breeze through in a night due to length and subject matter, this novel would allow for that.Renner\u2019s writing style flows well and is easy to read. It\u2019s absorbing and harrowing. It isn\u2019t like reading Katherine Howe (one of my fave authors who wrote The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane), but it is a definite addition you\u2019ll want for your book library if you enjoy colonial history. I enjoy family history and genealogy myself, tracing my ancestors back to 1600s early America as well, and think it was amazing of her to put her family\u2019s history into words.

While in church on the Sabbath a verbal argument broke out between the Eames and Swan families as Mr. Swan accuses one Eames boy of assault and the family of owing money for lost wages. His accusations eventually go too far and Rebecca Eames (aka Goody Eames) eventually fires back with spiteful words of her own. While Mr. Swan deserved the harsh retort Rebecca\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t have been more terrible. Two young girls are in town helping to seek out the cause of recent terrible events and suddenly Rebecca Eames is accused and arrested for witchcraft. Puritan Witch is inspired by historical fact as the author, Peni Jo Renner, is a descendent of Rebecca Eames. It is this connection between author and character that makes this book such a delightful read as Renner\u2019s passion is more than evident.While Puritan Witch is certainly not the most in-depth, most detailed or even most distressing account of the Salem Witch Trials it is a personal journey for the author and readers will connect with her passion and drive to share her family\u2019s story. Fiction details are included to flesh out the story but enough of the facts remain to make this a great read.Do I dare spoil the ending of Puritan Witch? Of course not but I do believe that readers will enjoy that this novel ends differently than the great majority of other novels based around the Salem witch trials. This may be because it is based upon Renner\u2019s own family and a true historical account. It is a refreshing change and created many points for readers to ponder when considering the future of the Eames family especially in their small town after so many had stood as Rebecca\u2019s accusers. Renner also explores the impact of the Salem witch trials as they affected the accused family, not just the \u201cwitch\u201d Rebecca. It is this expanded character set that helps Puritan Witch stand apart from so many others in the same subgenre. There are flaws in the book as there are historical mentions that could have benefited from greater details and conversations or characters that deserved more attention. This is a short book and Renner could have easily added another 50 to 100 pages and still kept this reader\u2019s attention.

It serves to remind how fear can treat others. Because of this, I have decided to read The Puritan Witch. It is based on the true story of Rebecca Eames, who was accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts during the trials of 1692. I had never heard of Rebecca Eames, but this novel shows how fascinating this woman was.The story starts when Rebecca makes an angry verbal outburst at a mean man, who she views as a troublemaker, who attacked her family in front of her church community on a Sabbath. Her congregation is stunned by her comment and takes Rebecca's word as literal. She is soon arrested for witchcraft. She and her son, Daniel, who has caused trouble on the Sabbath, are taken to Salem where they become prisoners. She then endures imprisonment and humiliation. She feels that she is being punished because of her sin that happened in the past.I came to admire Rebecca in this story. She is a strong person that is prone to impulse and anger sometimes. Over time, I felt that she was a human who made mistakes. She is a woman that went through a lot of pain and suffering and I felt for her. She is a woman that questions her God that puts her through so much suffering. She is a person anyone can identify with and she never loses faith even when she feels she has no hope.Overall, this book is about family, faith, love, loss, sacrifice, hope, repentance,redemption, and survival. The message of the book is that where there is darkness, there is light. When all seems to be hopeless, there is hope. This book shows the true meaning of family. While reading this book, it sort of reminded me of the short story, \u201cThe Minister\u2019s Black Veil\u201d by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Indeed, it also reminded me of The Scarlet Letter because of a strict Puritan society and a woman having to be punished because of her sin. The characters are very realistic, and the story is beautifully told. It can be slow sometimes, but overall it held my interest. I recommend this novel to anyone interested in the Salem Witch trials and Nathaniel Hawthorne.(Note: This book was given to me for a blog tour in exchange for an honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1603234-darlene", "userReview": "I have always been fascinated and horrified by the events of The Salem Witch Trials so it should come as no surprise that I wanted to read Puritan Witch by Peni Jo Renner. It is based on the true story of Rebecca Eames, who in 1692 in Salem, found herself falsely accused of witchcraft after throwing a curse out against someone who was insulting her family. Puritan Witch is a well researched and highly emotional telling of one woman\u2019s plight in a time where fear ran rampant.Once Rebecca is accused of witchcraft she appears before the magistrates and is thrown in jail. The author describes the jail and the horrific conditions so vividly that it was hard to imagine anyone being able to live through something like that. These women weren\u2019t even allowed the basics of human necessity. Even more disturbing was that there was a young child accused of witchcraft. People allowed their fear to turn them against their friends and neighbours \u2013 people they had known for years. I found it very hard to read of the brutality and starvation these women suffered through for no just reason and many ended up dead. Others descended into madness and lived within the confines of their minds to escape the harshness of their situation.I came to really care about Rebecca. She was just a typical woman \u2013 one that we could find ourselves friends with. In those days though saying what was on your mind wasn\u2019t always a good idea as in Rebecca\u2019s case. Yet Rebecca was strong and compassionate especially in taking the young girl in the jail under her wing when no one else would. Always in her mind was her faith and how much she loved her family.This book held my interest from the first page to the last and even while I found myself horrified at how these people were treated I stopped to think of those who had actually had to live through it.

Rebecca Eames was one of the survivors of the trials, now her direct descendant, Peni Jo Renner, has brought life to her story. I love reading about the Salem Witch Trials, it was such an interesting part of our history. I enjoyed that this book focused on the story of a survivor of the trials. Peni Jo Renner offered insight into how Rebecca's life before she had been accused of witchcraft and gave the reader a good feel of what it was like to live during that time period. Rebecca Eames lives a hard-working life on her farm with her family. However, the Eames family have been in a long dispute with their neighbors, the Swans. When the hysteria from Salem reaches Andover, the Eames and Swan family dispute reaches it boiling point. Rebecca lashes out against her neighbor.\" It was known that out of sheer spite, Robert Swan had ordered his sons to chop down a neighbor's orchard. The Eames family had also fallen under Swan's wrath, and a cavernous rift had grown between the two households. Blood simmered in her veins like a kettle over a low fire, and she bit her lips to keep from speaking her mind...'Damn you, Robert Swan!' Rebecca blurted. 'And may the devil himself visit your home!'\"There is a clear picture of some of the small small political disputes that caused the demise of so many people. Rebecca's story begins with an emotional outburst against her neighbor. Soon after, she is accused of witchcraft and a clear picture is painted of the time Rebecca spent in prison enduring physical and psychological pain. There is a good mix of fact and fiction; enough fiction to keep the story interesting and kept me reading, but also enough facts to match what I already know of the trials. It was probably the most interesting to learn of how Rebecca Eames survived the trials and the hangings and returned to her former life."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5005350-donna", "userReview": "Rebecca Eames...Wife, mother, grandmother, WITCH!!!

You were mean to me and uttered sarcastic comments- you're a witch! You have a birthmark on your face- it's a sign of the devil and...well you get the picture.Growing up in Massachusetts, not too far from Salem, I've visited all the sites.

I enjoy reading about the individuals accused during this dark period in America's history.Rebecca Eame's was an intersting charcter. She actually confessed to the sin of witchcraft, and she implicated her son Daniel. She stated he was baptized by the devil himself! She later retracted her confession and was eventually exonorated.

This makes the story even more interesting! Renner doesn't sugar coat anything. We see Rebecca with all her flaws. We see the pain Rebecca and her family suffered as a result of the trials. I really enjoyed this book. Ms. Renner has written a fascinating book. I was not able to put it down and actually re-read the book once I was finished. If you are a fan of biographies, Salem witch trials or American history, you will most likely enjoy this well written, well researched book. I give it 5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5714509-annette", "userReview": "Source: Free copy from author Peni Jo Renner, Historical Fiction Virtual Book ToursSummary:In 1692, at a church meeting in Andover, Massachusetts, the Eames family is faced with their neighbor Goodman Robert Swan's \"outburst\" and accusation against them. Rebecca Eames, holds her tongue as long as she can, until she responds in defense with anger. Her rebuke to Goodman Swan, will require a payment of suffering. The village of Andover, is aware of the girls in Salem, who've been accused of being witches. A fire-storm of hysteria takes over their village. People who dislike someone call them a witch for revenge. People who are not able to understand a mysterious illness, believe it is caused by witchcraft. My Thoughts:Puritan Witch, is a harsh and weighty story for two reasons. 1. It's an example of man's inhumanity to another man (or woman). To be accused and set apart from family and community, placed in a dark and fearful prison, filthy living conditions, starved, bullied and beaten, threatened and tormented with death, and fearful for family at home. It is too much to imagine what a person accused endured. 2. Puritan Witch, is a story which provokes empathy and emotion. Anger over the injustice. Anger over prejudice. Anger over men who are in power and abuse their authority. Anger over a mob mentality. Puritan Witch, is a teachable and memorable story for two reasons. 1. It reminds me to engage my individual rights and independent thinking, and stay away from the herd mentality. 2. In my response to people who inflict pain and suffering over another, I cannot become like them, because that would make me just as they are--fearful and ignorant and heartless."}, {"userName": "Michelle (True Book Addict)", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1823219-michelle-true-book-addict", "userReview": "I have been lucky in my historical fiction reading lately, as I've been privileged to read fictional accounts of two subjects I have always been fascinated with. One being ancient Egypt and in the case of this book, the Salem Witch trials. Puritan Witch is based on the true story of Rebecca Eames, who experienced the trials as one of the accused. The author is a descendant, Rebecca being her ninth great-grandmother. The story is told from Rebecca's point of view and has an authentic biographical tone. One could almost believe that it was an actual written account from Rebecca's own hand.The horrors experienced by the people accused in the trials are almost beyond belief. And anyone could be accused on a whim. If you had a vendetta with a neighbor, you could just accuse them of witchcraft. It really was mass hysteria. That's the only way I can describe it. The author tells the story vividly and so the reader really feels what Rebecca went through. The deplorable conditions in the 'dungeon', as they called it, and the shocking humiliation of the physical examination in front of all, including the shaving of the hair on the head and pubis, was almost too much to bare. One cannot read such a book without a heavy heart.This time in our history is one that all Americans should regret. It is something that should never have happened, but it did. Books like Puritan Witch are important because they remind us of a terrible history that should never be repeated. If you are interested in the history of the Salem trials or American history in general, this is a book you should definitely read."}, {"userName": "WTF Are You Reading?", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3603515-wtf-are-you-reading", "userReview": "Puritan Witch: The Redemption of Rebecca Eames is a beautifully rendered tale that while often hard to read, is equally as difficult to put down.Authoress Peni Renner ushers readers into a Colonial America far removed from that which has been heralded as the bastion of burgeoning liberty.Set in and around Salem, Massachusetts. Puritan Witch tells the story of one woman's fight to save her life, dignity, and sanity, amid the chaos, lies, and hypocrisy of The Salem Witch Trials.Goody Rebecca Eams is a lot of things. She is a loving mother, grandmother, wife, and \"a good Christian woman.\" What Mrs. Eams is not however, is a pushover.Fire, spirit, and an opinion are not welcome attributes in a woman of her ilk however, and a few choice ones, uttered in anger, will change her life forever.Though the story told here begins as a story of one, its scope quickly broadens to encompass Rebecca's family, the people that she meets in prison, and the community as a whole.The countless injustices brought to bear in the lives of Rebecca and countless others, make this a very emotionally taxing read.Interlaced with the darkness, is the resiliency of the human spirit and love that trumps the evil done.Rebecca proves to be the ultimate heroine by doing nothing more than simply living.Is she afraidYes.Does she make mistakes?Yes.Is she always right?No, but she lives with dignity and grace...in a time when it is so easy to die.Peni Renner has written a stellar work in Puritan Witch. It is my sincerest hope that this is not the last of her creations."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33438041-becky", "userReview": "First, I would like to thank Goodreads for making me a winner of this book. Second, I would like to graciously thank Peni Jo Renner for her timely sending of this book to me, and the lovely note and autograph (I had forgotten the contest was for an autographed copy, so imagine my delight) it got here in less than 3 days. I managed to pace myself and spread the reading over two nights! I savored every single word. Impressive historical accuracy. I could \"feel\" each characters feelings, love, fear, despair and downright terror. I felt as if I could each one's voice as I read. I almost felt as if I was there. The fact that the author is actually the ninth great granddaughter of the title character resounds in Ms. Renner's writing. I understand it is a work of fiction, but the history is there, well researched and brought to the fore in a most plausible and enthralling way. I applaud Ms. Renner for bringing to light the story of her ancestor's (fictional though it is), in a most endearing and honorable work. I was thoroughly engaged in reading this book and will not sully my review with spoilers."}, {"userName": "Deborah Swift", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3493727-deborah-swift", "userReview": "A vividly told recreation of real events, this is a book which takes the reader to the heart of the 17th century witch hunts with all their savagery and hypocrisy. More than a novel, this is written in a way which will appeal to lovers of memoirs. Most novels do not introduce more than twenty named characters in the first few chapters, and this is the level of detail that makes the story hover between fiction and non- fiction. This could have been a weakness, but in this work it becomes a strength. It reminds the reader that this is a true story - that all these people were actually THERE and played their part. From this honouring of reality I was taken on a powerful and moving journey.Peni Jo Renner is an excellent writer, with clear uncluttered prose and a good ear for dialogue.

This first novel is artful. The characters begin to draw breath and become people to be cared about. The careful research into the culture and life-ways of the times gives trustable authenticity to the story without bogging it down in detail. There is no fat in this story, it is fast moving and engaging and so interesting as to make every word important. No temptation to scan ahead marred the experience of living in the moment with these people of a different time. Put your life aside when the covers of this book are opened.

Puritan Witch stands apart from other Salem works with the degree and range of emotions invoked. I highly recommend this book, which features the perspectives of a falsely accused witch and her family, capturing the enormity of their sufferings. The book is a great read, with a lot of action, and compelling insights into the minds of the victims. Many others dump large amounts of historical information and contrive scenes to share history, but Renner does not commit either soon. The story in Puritan Witch flows naturally, and history is metered out tastefully."}], "description": "On a cold night in 1692, two young girls are caught up in the divining games of a slave woman\u2014and then begin to act very strangely when the game goes wrong.
