In just over 150 pages, Binebine manages to capture the innocence and depravity of childhood in the Moroccan slum, Sidi Moumen (\u201cwhere all downward slides converge\u201d); the dreams, hopes, and desires of our now-deceased narrator, Yachine (not his given name, but a name he adopts for himself after Soviet soccer champion, Lev Yashin), whose voice comes to us from after (beyond?) death; and the collective and ritualistic violence that marks Yachine and his young friends as byproducts of the socioeconomic structure that crushes dreams before they can be realized\u2014making them susceptible to outside influence: any pathway out of the slum, any proffered hand, any kind word extended are the balms these teenagers need to eventually carry bombs on their backs.Perhaps it is natural that a novel about the allure of Islamic fundamentalism and a deadly act of terrorism that ensues would be viewed as either exploiting post-9/11 fears or else as toeing the line dangerously between sympathizing with terrorists. I seem to recall some of the former at work in criticism leveled at Mohsin Hamid\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist, which, to keep it brief as this is not a review of that novel, I think was largely unfounded and can be traced to a misreading of Hamid\u2019s narrator\u2019s idiosyncratic sense of deprecatory humor\u2014one that can be misinterpreted as elitist or holier-than-thou, but which is in fact working in a different vein altogether. As for the latter side of the fence when it comes to literature and film, Julia Loktev\u2019s 2006 film Day Night Day Night is one that many critics problematically viewed as a psychological portrait of a young, unnamed woman\u2019s preparation to bomb a location in Manhattan. That the camera never has her out of the line of sight seems, to many, to suggest that Loktev is forcing viewers to identify with this unnamed terrorist, and therefore evoke empathy of some sort.\u2028\u2028Rather, the major problem with all of the criticism leveled from any angle when it comes to cultural products dealing with fundamentalism and terrorism, is that a binary opposition is perpetuated, one that these very works are trying to suggest should not be invoked in any discourse on the subject. Instead of an us-versus-them or a \u201cgood-guy\u201d-versus-\u201cbad guy\u201d dialectic, these works\u2014and Binebine\u2019s Horses of God is among them, but in a much quieter and more subtle way\u2014suggest that we all have the potential to become terrorists, provided that environment and psychological factors collide while faced with influential and seemingly embracing figures who offer something\u2014love, salvation, purpose\u2014one\u2019s life had hitherto lacked so utterly, so fundamentally.Yachine, our narrator, is recounting events from the beyond, but it\u2019s unclear where this is:I won\u2019t describe where I am now because I don\u2019t know myself. All I can say is that I\u2019m reduced to an entity now, to use the language of down below, I\u2019ll call consciousness.Is it heaven? Is it an external sort of consciousness? Is it a wraith-like limbo haunting stage, causing him to relive his past wrongs? And now, as a lovelorn ghost, I feel the futile need to pour out my feelings and finally tell this story I\u2019ve been turning over and over in my mind since the day of my death.What makes Binebine\u2019s prose so incisive in Horses of God are the ways in which he is able to vacillate back and forth between the young Yachine\u2019s memories of his childhood, his triumph and loss at soccer, his heterosexual love for both Ghizlane, and friend Fuad\u2019s sister, and also his queer love for Nabil with a voice that is young, naive, childish but brash; by contrast, when recounting familial events, events going on more globally (typically relayed at the family table by his brother Said), and his induction into the fundamentalist world of Abu Zoubeir, Yachine\u2019s voice is more mature, steady, stern, and almost weary from the world\u2014something that makes this read as much more than the thoughts of a sixteen-year-old boy. Binebine\u2019s skill here is in interweaving these two voices of Yachine\u2019s, and at no point do they seem discordant. Rather, we are getting a complete psychological portrait of our narrator at various stages in his development, but without a normative chronology, a portrait that is at times eerily reminiscent of Robert Walser\u2019s choice of narrative voice in the eponymous novel Jakob von Gunten (link to my Goodreads review).And yet what separates Horses of God from the other cultural products\u2014e.g., film, literature, art, and so on\u2014on fundamentalism and terror is that despite Binebine\u2019s emphasis on Yachine\u2019s individuality, his inner subjectivity is rarely stressed. True, we get his young infatuations, his disappointments, his bitter childhood feuds with slum friends, his dreams for something larger, but in some ways Yachine reads like a stock character. This kind of narrative distancing can be dangerous in a novel that makes use of the first-person narrative style: it often causes readers not to feel sympathy for the narrator. But I think that is just Binebine\u2019s point: one already feels an affinity for Yachine, so need there be sympathy as well? Isn\u2019t it enough to feel an affinity as we can all relate to feelings of isolation, alienation, disappointment, hardship, and struggle in our formative years? Aren\u2019t these enough to make us realize that, in reality, we\u2019re not all that dissimilar from Yachine or his other friends who choose the path toward violence, self-annihilation, and death feeling there is no other alternative? If faced with similar circumstances and living in the same, claustrophobic world of Sidi Moumen\u2014which Binebine, also a painter, fleshes out in such telling narrative strokes here\u2014would we have turned out differently, or would we, too, be wanting to confess, dissuade, and ask for pardon from the beyond?Coupled with the lack of subjectivity is a marked shift in focus: whereas the other texts and films I mentioned above center almost wholly on individuals who either have or do not have back stories\u2014one can, of course, always imagine what places a would-be terrorist into such a position as the female jihadist in Day Night Day Night\u2014Horses of God instead causes the reader to see the slum of Sidi Moumen as a crucible for these kinds of violent acts. Even classic literature on terrorism\u2014e.g., Conrad\u2019s Secret Agent or James\u2019s Princess Casmassima\u2014touches lightly on environment and external factors, but only insofar as these relate to the individuals\u2019 adoption of terrorist activities and belief systems. Instead, what Binebine is doing here, and what is Horses of God\u2019s great novelistic and also humanitarian message, is that we are all shaped by the environments in which we are raised. Yachine\u2019s socioeconomic life filled with a potent combination of abjection, boredom, malaise, and a youthful camaraderie rooted almost wholly in violent outcomes\u2014e.g., rape, murder\u2014does not make him a terrorist. Rather, these are all factors in the trajectory of a life\u2019s pathway. Yachine is both us and yet not us: in Binebine\u2019s skilled hands, and in prose that is haunting, nonjudgmental, and compassionate, Yachine\u2019s story is a warning, a wake-up call for society\u2014for if we do not address the underlying socioeconomic issues that ravage the lives of Yachine and his friends, then that is but one of many issues to which we are turning a blind eye when it comes to fundamentalism and terrorism. These are not things that are external to us: they are inside of us all, as all of the titles mentioned above also emphasize in their own ways; but it is only in recognizing this sameness (along with culpability), and beginning to change the world in which we live collectively\u2014without dichotomizing, without ostracizing, without othering\u2014that we can begin to address the complex network of factors that culminate in such individual and psychical violence on a global battlefield on which we all stand."}, {"userName": "Thodoris Fotoglou", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658589-thodoris-fotoglou", "userReview": "\u03a4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03c5 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1.\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1.\u039f \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2,\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03cd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd.\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c5\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd.\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.\u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5.\u0397 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03a3\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03c5 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.\u039f\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9,\u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd,\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ae \u03c0\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ac \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2"}, {"userName": "Marcia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7921951-marcia", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I have read.

Interestingly, Binebine does not blame these young men for committing such a terrible act of violence, but he rather accuses the socioeconomic conditions that has made them an easy prey for the religious mafia that takes advantage of their status quo. To Binebine, the real monster is not these young men, but the civil society that is responsible for maintaining these children's status quo, the society that does not move a finger to fix this problem. Hence, Horses of God is a warning against the socioeconomic situation of this marginalised young people that can lead to awful outcomes if this phenomena is not resolved.The terrible life conditions of these boys makes them the perfect prey for the radicals who manipulates people by their empty promisses of being rewarded in the afterlife. Yachine and his friends, being a subject to poverty, ignorance, and violence, are easily convinced to embark on this journey as the following passage implies : \u2018\u2018No, you cannot defeat a man who wants to die. And I wanted to, fervently. Nabil, Blackie, Khalil, Fuad, and Hamid wanted to die too. Living in Sidi Moumen, surrounded by corpses, the groveling, and the lame, the truth was we were almost dead already. So really, what did it matter, a little more or less ?\u2019\u2019 (p.141) What is interesting about this narrative is that Binebine emphasises on the importance of education in saving the lives of these boys. Throughout the narrative, the reader is informed that all of these boys either dropped out of school or are completely illiterate, with the exception of Fuad, who attends school due to the efforts of his grandmother. Surprinsingly, in the day of the attack, Fouad did not show up, implying that education can have a great impact in detouring young boys such as The Stars of Sidi Moumen from submitting themselves to the Islamist\u2019s influence.The story begins with Yachine\u2019s childhood in Sidi Moumen, playing football with his friends, who call themselves The Stars of Sidi Moumen, and ends by informing the reader that he constantly visits the place and that nothing had changed, instead the situation is getting worse: \u201cI often go there at night to watch the shifting shadows take possession of the place, as the last lights go out. Then I weep, in my own way, waiting for daybreak. The slum hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s grown even bigger, and the shacks that were once separate now form a city. A vast city of the living dead. I wait and I cry, watching the wheel that keeps on turning.\u201d and he ends his narrative by stating that he \u2018\u2019can see some scrawny kids running after a flat ball, without a care in the world: the new Stars of Sidi Moumen\u201d suggesting that if nobody does anything to improve the lives of these children, they will end up like himself and his friends, a victim of the Islamic fundamentalism.In order to understand the reasons these boys were pushed to commit such an act, Binebine traces the background of four boys, who ended up blowing off themselves in the Casablanca terrorist attack. Interestingly, the story is narrated from a dead martyr's point of view, namely Yachine, who looks back at his childhood and the circumstan ces that has resulted in his death. As the narrative progresses, Yachine\u2019s voice is more mature and almost weary from the world\u2014 something that makes this read as much more than the thoughts of a sixteen-year-old boy.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Yachine\u2019s tone makes the reader sympathise with him; his tone conveys a sense of regret, not the regret of escaping his degraded life conditions, but rather the regret of committing this act of terror, as it is manifested in this passage : \u2018\u2018From the depth of my solitude, when memories of my ruin assail and torment me, when the weight of my faults becomes to heavy to bear and my mind is already old and tired (..) I go off wandering in the sky of my childhood.\u2019\u2019 (p.161)In order to convey to the reader that he has indeed repented, he need a thorough confession in which he faces this mistake. Hence, as Yachine traces his life story in Sidi Moumen, the realisation that he has hurt innocent people only exacerbate his sense of guilt, so by the end of the story, he reaches that stage of repentance. By the end of the story, he realizes that he has been lost, and he has caused pain all around him \u201cIt was tough, very tough, hearing the children\u2019s laughter, seeing their hands and their eyes and their guardian angels dangling from the thread I held. I was like a puppeteer. I had their destinies at my fingertips. Yes, it was a butchery, it was hell. It was the end of the world.\u201d (p.158) His sense of repentance grows even more as the story progresses; for example, a few moments before he commits the attack, he notices children playing at the hotel and he has second thoughts : \u2018\u2018I was wrestling with Satan, who, by some diabolical trick, had turned the blond kids playing near the suitcases into the Palestinian boy who\u2019d died in his father\u2019s arms. I muttered a sura under my breath, then louder, but the kids were still Palestinian.\u2019\u2019 (p.157) His inner struggle is manifested in his hesitation, as he is approaching death, he questions whether it is the right thing to do ; nevertheless, the influence of the Abu Zubeir\u2019s brainwashing turns out to be stronger than his own will. He simply knew that \u2018\u2018 there was no way back. It was too late to abandon the ship\u2019\u2019 (p.142)While writing Horses of God, Binebine visited Sidi Moumen and encountered many youngpeople who inhabit this uninhabitable place. As a result, Binebine felt the necessity to protect these children from the danger of becoming future radicals. His sense of empathy for these children grew even stronger when he has returned to Sidi Moumen in order to shoot the film adaptation with Nabil Avouch, consequently, he created cultural centres that encourage young people to love music, art, and cinema as a way to alienate young people from the impact of terorism. To conclude, Binebine\u2019s Horses of God is a cry for help wherein he problematizes the situation of the poor marginalized slums and its detrimental effects on its inhabitants as his way draw people\u2019s attention to the gravity of the situation."}, {"userName": "Antonomasia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6249204-antonomasia", "userReview": "[3.5] Horses of God is a pretty good, worthwhile book and an engrossing read. But I read it at the same time as some really outstanding novels, and its weaknesses were shown up. Especially in the company of several other titles longlisted for the Best Translated Book Award, which concentrates on artistic merit and somewhat off-the-wall literature. Horses of God, whilst pretty well-written (it seemed almost blandly wordy and imprecise straight after Rodrigo Rey Rosa) is a didactic political novel - at least one encased in an involving story. Based on attacks which happened in Morocco ten years ago, it's narrated by the ghost of Yachine, a teenage Muslim fundamentalist suicide bomber, telling of his life in Moroccan slums - scavenging at the tip to earn money, parental thrashings, and the escape of playing football - and his subsequent conversion and training by men who provided him and his friends with decent jobs and a sense of purpose. I think it's very important to point out how issues like poverty and cultural imperialism can influence people to become extremists, but even though this is a good story and I think its message is a good one, I just don't like obviously, straightforwardly didactic literature. Better non-fiction with proper referencing. The author, a Moroccan writer and artist who has lived in New York and Paris, has made the narrator understandable for Western readers of accessible literary fiction by changing his personality significantly. Yachine explains to the reader that he has become wiser and more articulate as a revenant. \"I'm reduced to an entity that, to use the language of down below, I'll call consciousness: that is to say, the restful outcome of myriad lucid thoughts. Not the dark, narrow ones that dogged my brief existence, but thoughts with aspects that are infinite, iridescent, sometimes dazzling.\" \"When I was alive I wouldn't have been able to describe her as I can now. I wasn't taught the words to describe the beauty of people or things, the sensuality and harmony that makes them so glorious.\" He is able to reflect on his life from the standpoint of the European cultural elite. I agree that insight and articulacy are good things, but this is a worse than usual case of using literature to put words into someone's mouth. I can't for the life of me remember what the [another] book was, but a review (possibly on John Self's Asylum blog) of a book I may even have read, described how a narrative was a character's voice but enhanced: these were the things they would liked to have said if only they could. That seems fair enough. But if writing a contemporary political novel, I'm not sure it's right to make a character say things so different from what [you imply] they would have in life - to give an angry, uneducated, devoutly religious teenager musings similar to a wise old man who follows liberal secular values. Imposing a voice and ideas like that is, I think, something more fairly done when overt, and signposted by way of non-fiction or a third-person narrative. Even if I do agree with the intention behind it (and I carry around a similar idea that everyone has an essence that's good and kind and wise, just that it may be hopelessly obscured and walled up by damage and anger and all the rest of it) : perhaps the book and film affect the way a few people see the politics, if their audience are not simply the converted being preached to."}, {"userName": "Lila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4656570-lila", "userReview": "This novel is powerful and well written, but of course due to the subject matter, which is based on a real life event, it is very tragic and bleak. The author Mahi Binebine spent a lot of time working in the Sidi Moumen slum interviewing people and working with the impoverished youth there, so his portrayal is accurate. This quote from the following interview http://en.qantara.de/content/intervie... sums it up:\"also talked to the families and friends of the bombers. They told to me how the Islamists very gradually begin to work upon the children. They are literally pulled from the rubbish heap and told that they should be clean. They are given a place to stay, somewhere they can wash themselves and get something to eat. Then they are taken to the mosque, where they pray five times a day and study the Koran. Separated from their old friends and families, they become part of a different community. Jobs are found for them and their radicalisation is the final stage in the process. Propaganda videos are shown to them and the content of the film linked by the Islamists to conspiracy theories about supposed Jews or alleged American imperialists. Of course, the poor Arabs are always presented as the victims of aggression. The children are shown films of bomb attacks that glorify the bombers and they are told that they have now become the chosen ones. From then on, around two years are needed to turn them into human bombs.

Set in Sidi Moumen, a shantytown outside Casablanca, the novel is narrated by Yachine from beyond the grave. Raised with his ten brothers in the midst of poverty, depravity, hopelessness, they form a football team with their friends: the Stars of Sidi Moumen, which incidentally is the original French title of the book. The wretchedness of their lives makes for a harrowing read, but sections that display their sense of community are heartwarming:\nThey stick together; they support each other. Hunger may well stretch out its tentacles, gripping throats till they choke, but in Sidi Moumen it does not kill, because people share what little they have. Because they look to each other to measure their common distress. Tomorrow, it will be so\u2013and\u2013so\u2019s turn. The day after, someone else\u2019s. The wheel turns so fast. \nIn this abyss of despair, the charismatic Abu Zoubeir appears who enthralls the boys with his lofty ideas of justice, god, and paradise. Binebine does an excellent job of giving an insight to the boys\u2019 otherness and unwanted status not just because they are in a slum but also because their parents \u2013 in most cases \u2013 see them as an extra mouth to feed. You can see how this going to lead them to do something that makes them feel important and worthwhile, even if it\u2019s something horrific. As Yachine says, Sidi Moumen was full of the living dead, so what difference did it make if they were any less or more dead. So maybe despite their families, despite their brief spell of independence, which of course happened because of the Islamists, they didn't see a way out of the slum alive. It took me a week to read this slim book. I can't say I enjoyed it because of the subject matter, but the translation was stunning and I was hooked from the first chapter.

Sidi Moumen is where the ghost grew up, in one of Casablanca's poorest slums. The author described Sidi Moumen as a place \"where all downward slides converge.\" Around Sidi Moumen, \"everyone got used to everything - to the stench or rotting and death, for instance, which became so familiar and clung to our skin. We couldn't smell it anymore...I'm not ashamed to tell you I was sometimes happy in the hideous squalor, in the filth of that accursed cesspit; yes, I was happy in Sidi Moumen, my home.\"The ghost tells all about his childhood living in the slums. Every slum had a soccer team, and the ghost was an exceptional goalie. His brother, Hamid, was fiercely loyal, protecting the ghost at all costs, on the soccer field and off, even killing a child who had dared to cross his younger brother. The ghost tells tales of violence throughout the slums. He had a gang of friends who taunted others as children, and lived together in a small \"home-made\" area as they got older and left home to be independent from abusive parents. Is it not a wonder that when offered good food and good jobs from a Jihad elder, that the gang joined to live a better life. They learned to pray and fight the \"infidels\" who caused all of the poverty in that slum and others. They were ready to die to go to a better world, the paradise that had been described to them. Why choose suicide? \"I'm glad to be a long way from the corrugated iron, the cold, the sewers spilling their guts, and all the putrid stench of my childhood.\" As a ghost, however, he knows he has been had as he weeps above the slums he grew up in."}, {"userName": "Scott R. Larson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32503603-scott-r-larson", "userReview": "Based on an actual terrorist attack committed in Casablanca in 2003, this novel by Marrakech-born writer and painter Mahi Binebine imagines what the lives of the suicide bombers were like and what led to their participation in the atrocity. First published in French, the novel's original title Les \u00e9toiles de Sidi Moumen translates as the Stars of Sidi Moumen, name of the youngsters' soccer team in the impoverished slum where they grow up. There is not a lot of suspense, as the narrator Yachine makes clear from the beginning that he is speaking from beyond the grave and how he died. Instead, there is a sickening inevitability in the trajectory of his and his friends' lives, even as they seek escape in sports and games and do their best to survive in a world where life is cheap and brutal. The book is not particularly satisfying in that it does not really answer our most obvious question. Why exactly do they decide to commit murder and suicide? The boys seem to sleepwalk into their terrorist indoctrination. They do not even seem particularly religious or political. But maybe that's point. The most intriguing character is Yachine's fair-featured friend Nabil whose beauty proves provocative to just about everyone around him. But his motivations are no clearer than Yachine's. The one image that sticks out as a motivation is a video of a Palestinian father holding his dead child. But it feels as though Yachine is speaking more for the author than for himself when, in the end, he is surprised to see his own blond victims appear to transform into Palestinians."}, {"userName": "Alan   Mauldin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6513223-alan-mauldin", "userReview": "Told by a \"ghost\" of a teen suicide bomber, \"Horses of God\" recounts the last days of childhood in a Casablanca garbage dump he and his friends called home. Befriended by seemingly kindhearted men, the main character, his older brother and four friends are radicalized into thinking striking a blow against the \"satans\" in their own country who have cooperated with the West and what the adults call crusaders from those countries.Only in death does he learn that he and his self-chosen family of companions have been used for evil to kill innocent people. Unfortunately, for someone living in a shack roofed by tree limbs in a dump, instant passage to Paradise may sound like a pretty good deal. Bombing or invading any number of countries will not help in defeating these ideas as long as millions of people live in poverty and hopelessness. Actually, those actions, as often as not, have the unintended consequences of making the radicals' point that they are under attack. The end of ISIS's caliphate won't mean the end of terrorism; it actually makes it more likely as they go underground and strike out the only way open to them -- many individual terror attacks wherever they can stage them.. It's something to think about."}], "description": "On May 16, 2003, fourteen suicide bombers launched a series of attacks throughout Casablanca. It was the deadliest attack in Morocco\u2019s history. The bombers came from the shantytowns of Sidi Moumen, a poor suburb on the edge of a dump whose impoverished residents rarely if ever set foot in the cosmopolitan city at their doorstep. Mahi Binebine\u2019s novel Horses of God follows four childhood friends growing up in Sidi Moumen as they make the life-changing decisions that will lead them to become Islamist martyrs.The seeds of fundamentalist martyrdom are sown in the dirt-poor lives of Yachine, Nabil, Fuad, and Ali, all raised in Sidi Moumen. The boys\u2019 soccer team, The Stars of Sidi Moumen, is their main escape from the poverty, violence, and absence of hope that pervade their lives. When Yachine\u2019s older brother Hamid falls under the spell of fundamentalist leader Abu Zoubeir, the attraction of a religion that offers discipline, purpose, and guidance to young men who have none of these things becomes too seductive to ignore.Narrated by Yachine from the afterlife, Horses of God portrays the sweet innocence of childhood and friendship as well as the challenges facing those with few opportunities for a better life. Binebine navigates the controversial situation with compassion, creating empathy for the boys, who believe they have no choice but to follow the path offered them.Winner of the 2010 Prix du Roman Arabe and Prix Litt\u00e9raire Mamounia\"The novel provides context and perspective to often little-explored issues, offering incredible insight into the complex lives of poor boys who are groomed to kill themselves for a cause and commit violent acts in the name of religion. Binebine portrays these young men as supremely human, victims of powers much larger than themselves, and like any Kafkaesque anti-hero, cogs in an incomprehensible and monstrous machine.\"--Starred Publishers Weekly\"Moroccan painter, novelist, and former math teacher Binebine (Welcome to Paradise) writes with humor and pathos amid the novel\u2019s grinding tragedy but never allows the narrative to veer into self-pity or cheap sentimentality. The book is based on the 2004 suicide bombings in Casablanca, and Binebine\u2019s unblinking eye for detail makes this a haunting tale.\" --Library Journal", "title": "Horses of God", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16000334-horses-of-god", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347985405l/16000334.jpg", "reviews": 59, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/246330.Mahi_Binebine", "name": "Mahi Binebine"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/949472.Lulu_Norman", "name": "Lulu Norman"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Northern Africa", "Cultural", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16000334-horses-of-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33368715", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17593965-horses-of-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27406885-los-caballos-de-dios", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10532040-les-toiles-de-sidi-moumen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27087813-les-toiles-de-sidi-moumen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12761300-welcome-to-paradise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7877408-le-sommeil-de-l-esclave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17665910-le-seigneur-vous-le-rendra", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34649935-le-fou-du-roi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437189.L_ombre_du_po_te"]}
