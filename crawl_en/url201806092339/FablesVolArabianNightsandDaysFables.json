This volume was filled with a lot of great moments. The stuff in fabletown is all about political affairs and the main thing is about a nation of people, Arabian, and how they will conflict with ideas that are placed in Fabletown. On the flipside we get a little bit more information on the farm, what's happening with snow white, red, and boy blue and of course the little kids. Last but not least we have a two issue story of one of Geppetto creations, or two of them, falling in love and wanting to become human. It sounds silly but by the end...wow. Good: Loved the very end. It was powerful, scary, and well done. The fabletown political stuff was solid, interesting, and pretty entertaining. I also loved anything to do with Snow White's children as they are all interesting and fun. Bad: Not enough boy blue! Overall this was another great entry. While not AS good as the last it's still pretty damn high up there. I want more!"}, {"userName": "Jelinas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2297897-jelinas", "userReview": "They say that too many cooks spoil the broth. I would say that, sometimes, it's too many ingredients that spoil it. Arabian Nights fell a little flat for me. I was excited when Willingham started including characters from the Arabian Nights world. But the storyline involving them wasn't all that captivating. Also, one of the characters kept calling Sinbad, supposedly the head of this royal retinue, \"sirrah.\" I gathered that he meant it as a term of honor, but I couldn't get over the fact that, in English, it has a negative connotation. If what they're saying in Arabic is going to be translated into English, then shouldn't that term be translated, too?The one thing I will say is that Frau Totenkinder is pretty ossom. She's the wicked witch of \"Hansel and Gretl\" fame. Her name is German for \"dead children,\" and she's ossomly creepy, and Willingham uses her well.There was a vaguely interesting secondary plotline involving a wooden soldier from the Adversary's armies. Rodney, a wooden soldier, falls in love with June, a wooden \"medic\" -- she repairs damaged wooden soldiers' limbs. Together, they travel to find Geppetto and ask him to turn them into flesh so that they can marry and raise children. It's a sweet, little love story, and a reminder that the soldiers in the enemy's army are people, too, with cares and lives disturbingly similar to ours.It's a nice aside, but I still hope that the next volume gets back to top form again."}, {"userName": "Sud666", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666", "userReview": "Another excellent volume in the Fables series. The Arabian Fables have sent Sindbad as a visiting emissary to speak with the Western Fables about setting up a Fabletown East. Unfortunately there are some differences between the Arabian and Western Fables. The Arabians still keep slaves, which goes against the anti-slavery laws of Fabletown.Sindbad tries to emulate the Western Fables (Prince Charming and the former Mayor) and this causes his Vizier, Usuf, to think that Sinbad is becoming an infidel. Usuf summons a Djinn and gives it three commands. First to kill all the people who support Sinbad; second kill all the Fabletown leaders and third to grant Usuf a wealthy and powerful life. This might seem bad save that Frau Totenkinder knows what's going on. She changes Usuf's words to the Djinn and wreaks havoc with his plans and ends in his painful demise. But the former Mayor is made into the Ambassador to Arabian Fables.The second part of the story has to do with one of Gepetto's wooden soldiers. He falls in love with a wooden girl and requests that both be turned into flesh. Gepetto agrees but in return the two must carry out a mission for him. They are infiltrated into the Mundy world and now act as spies and occasional assassins for the Adversary. But spending time among Mundy's, and expecting a baby, they begin to question their future.As with the rest of these volumes, it is beautifully illustrated. A smooth, fast paced story. There are too many different subplots and stories to list in my review. That's why this is such a great series. The events play out over volumes and that gives it a grand scale. Still while this grand tale is being told Fables has a remarkable ability to make even the subplots and side stories (that may take up an issue or two) become some memorable moments. It is also becoming clear that even the little stories may have a large effect down the road. That is good writing. The addition of the Arabian fables is a cool idea. But as varied as this motley collection is by far, my most favorite character is Frau Totenkinder. She always seems this nice, old and frail grandmotherly type sitting in her rocking chair and knitting. This hides one of the most powerful, devious and skilled magic users in this world. Period. Her utter destruction of Baba Yaga was proof enough, but her brilliant ploy to destroy Usuf's plan was truly superb. Hats off to Frau Totenkinder a great character and one of my favorites in any series. Fables is a gem that I recommend to any one who is interested in good art, great writing and a large cast of characters."}, {"userName": "Celise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4653644-celise", "userReview": "I was so excited for this one. I've been adding a lot of Arabian inspired things to my read and watch lists, so seeing that this was the title of the next Fables volume, I raised my expectations WAY up.And... meh. It was quite boring. I never watched Sinbad as a kid so I didn't really have much of a connection to that. I really thought they'd include Aladdin, but they just passingly mentioned his name once. Then there was a genie which I thought would be such a cool storyline for the volume, but that lasted for an issue. The last two issues of this volume also followed two new characters in a sidestory that I didn't care about, and found painful to read due to the cursive font choice.This one was definitely a miss for me."}, {"userName": "Brent", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297492-brent", "userReview": "More great stuff from the (Vertigo) Fables team.Maybe some time I can read the end of these...

The Arabian Nights arc is good. As some reviewers have mentioned it did feel like it was praying on fears of the \"scary\" Arabs. I feel like it started that way, but didn't end that way. I thought it was a good example of showing that one person could ruin others impressions of an entire group. If you look back on the story it actually showed how a group of people can be different and still be good. Plus, you have to remember this is a book of FABLES. There are many exaggerations placed in these stories to teach lessons. If you look at the original fables they were MUCH more violent then the watered down version most of us know today. Some of the American Fables actions (throughout all the stories) may have been questionable, but I think the writers are trying to show (over a very long story arc) how the Fables society with the best intentions is not always fair to the individual ; possibly moving the society to a place it never intended to go. Look around the world today\u2026.good allegory. I love these stories. They are a great interpretation and modernizing of stories and characters most of us know. I love the idea of making adult commentary using children's fairy tale characters. Of course you don\u2019t have to approach these stories that way at all. You can just sit back and enjoy a well written and well paced story. Now you may ask, Why 3 stars? The last 2 stories in the trade are from the point of view of 2 of the Wooden Soldiers. The 1st of which is told by the male, in the form of a letter. It is ill paced and honestly very hard to get through. This in itself dropped the rating down, it was that annoying. The 2nd is told from the other wooden soldier who is female. While still not paced very well, it is much easier to get through. In the end, I was glad the story was told because I can see how it can be used as a very interesting plot device for future stories. I just didn't enjoy the way it was written. Also, the art in these stores was different and did not feel up to the quality and atmosphere of the preceding stories."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "Another 3.5* volume becuase this one has two storylines which I enjoyed.

The folklore of the Middle East fits into this series very well, especially as the Adversary is expanding his takeover of the Fable lands into the Middle Eastern worlds now. I think that it would be impossible to integrate all of the encompassing Arabian Nights lore into one volume, and I don't think Willingham ever intended to try. Instead, he uses this story as an introductory volume, and it has some elements that really stand out in the 1001 Nights lore. One well done example was the Jinn that the Arabian delegation brings alone with them. I think that perhaps that shows you the powerful motifs of the Arabian Nights in one large sort of concentrated burst at the audience. And of course, the Fables of Fabletown have to account for the power of such a force of nature, and counter-attack or at least attempt to neutralize it, much as one would consider taking on a nation with a stockpile of nuclear weapon that you want to maintain peaceful negotiations with. Never fear, Fabletown has some potent tools in their own toolkit.Another effective aspect of this volume was the addressing of cultural differences that the Middle Eastern worlds had from what I would consider the European Fableworlds. Prince Charming is a big buffoon, and is completely unequipped to handy any diplomatic relations, thus his predecessor King Cole is called in to do this important job. I did find myself agreeing with Charming on one aspect of the Middle Eastern Fablelands culture though. Sinbad is a diplomatic leader of the Middle Eastern contingent, with a very wicked advisor who might open a few cans of worms that need to be dealt with. Not related so much to the Arabian Nights storyline but to the overall Fables arc was a story about two wooden creations of Geppetto who fall in love for each other and wish to be human, but will have to pay a hard price. This story reveals Willingham's wonderful storytelling skills and the bittersweet tone and content of this volume in a nutshell. He shows that the opposite side has players that can also evoke the sympathy of the readers, even though their acts and methods might be reprehensible or just neutral morally in the scheme of things. I'm sure there are some heavy underlying themes in this graphic novel, and I have only scratched the surface. I feel that I would love to reread all of these and revisit the whole series at my leisure, which is why I definitely want to get copies of these for my collection one day."}, {"userName": "Michael (Mai)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884422-michael-mai", "userReview": "Why I read this: I read this because, duh, it\u2019s a fairy tale retelling.

But the empire is ever-growing, and the Arabian tales are next. A delegation from the Arabian Homelands arrives in New York's Fabletown and provokes much diplomatic consternation. I enjoyed the meeting-of-minds between King Cole and Sinbad, and love any instance Frau Totenkinder gets to deploy her deceptively twisty magic. Beast and Beauty's relationship deepens; it's not all true love conquering all. But overall, this subplot underwhelms. A whole new arena of stories and characters to choose from, and yet the only fables Willingham bothers to name are Sinbad and a djinn. Come ON. The Arabian characters (and their homeland) seem troublingly Disneyfied. The second and much smaller half of this volume concerns the love affair of two wooden soldiers in the Adversary's army. Their story is beautifully illustrated (Jim Fern's style conveys a Renaissance beauty that is clean-lined yet earthy) and initially, amusing. As their attempt to love each other continues, however, the story grows darker. While Arabian fables are celebrating a new beginning built on trust, the wooden lovers start their lives under the shadow of deception."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Terrington", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "As far as this series go, this was a little move away from the overall story we've been looking at in the previous volumes. But as far as the stories in this volume are concerned, they were solid fractured fairytale storytelling.The world of the Arabian Nights comes to Fabletown and bring a deadly D'jinn. At the same time Bigby's dad deals with his grandchildren and several other minor details add to the humour and mix of fun and fantasy that occurs. Of course Bigby himself does not really have a place in this volume which is a sheer disappointment as he is fast becoming my favourite character in this entire series. He's gruff, a drinker and very much like Wolverine - as you'd expect from The Big Bad Wolf.Again, if you want a graphic novel series that moves along from strength to strength and has some of the smartest ideas on the market I recommend these. Depending on your personal taste you may be lead to think that they are 'awesome' or 'suck' but at least give them a try. They've won plenty of acclaim and are to my eyes fascinating works with fantasy themes and modern issues.

They are the married couple that have been together so long that they 'safely' bicker and they have their fights but they still love each other. There's a very interesting catalyst to that realization involving Prince Charming and Beauty. All in all, this book is gearing up toward the inevitable battle.

And I'm a little worried about the sensitivity of the treatment of the new characters from the Muslim and Arabian traditions. But this volume provides an interesting minor element in positioning Fabletown within the real-world context of the war in, and occupation of, Iraq, and what that means for legendary beings from that region. It also builds on a concept introduced in the previous volume: that of everyday life back in the Homelands under the Adversary. The juxtaposition of these two elements can't be coincidental. Evil is starting to look terrifyingly banal, with tax collectors and outposts and a surprisingly cosmopolitan, if still casually racist, society taking shape. That the fabulous \"Empire's\" current project is the invasion and takeover of the \"Arabian Homelands\" only further underscores some comparison to the American Empire that was stretching its muscles during the period this was published. Along the way we meet sympathetic characters among \"the enemy,\" people--to use a general term--who simply want to live and love and find opportunities to develop. So maybe I'm reading too much into it, but what I'm getting is a refreshingly complex, if subtle, parable of American interventionism, with Fabletown serving as an outside force that I imagine will ultimately play a role in deciding the fate of Empire and Free Homelands alike.

Bill Willingham seems, at this point, to perhaps be following a three act structure. Of course, bear in mind, dear reader, that I\u2019m reading these for the first time with only the knowledge that the mainline series ends at issue #150. Still, while much is setup for future volumes, he does seem to put a bow on all the plot points until now. Snow and Bigsby, who\u2019ve had a will-they/won\u2019t-they and star-crossed lovers arc since issue #1 end up married. Last volume we learned the identity of The Adversary and while it\u2019s not in the storylines, the supplementary materials contain a map that note The Adversary now has an embassy in NY. Rose Red has taken responsibility and is helping raise Snow\u2019s cubs. Prince Charming has also had a Han Solo-esque character arc. And so, since it was mostly clean up, not much happened. Still, there are some ideas to explore in these volumes.The biggest one comes from Willingham coming right out and stating what I noted in earlier volumes: the analogy between Fabletown and the Israeli diaspora. The first time I noticed it was at The Ball in which they toasted \u201cNext year in the Homelands\u201d which is a reference to \u201cNext Year in Jerusalem\u201d and other such toasts. In fact, I noted in a later volume that, while the obvious analogy was with Israel, that the Fables have much in common with all refugees and some of their stories match those of people I know personally. I\u2019m sure some Syrians will be toasting this year with \u201cNext Year in Damascus/Aleppo/etc\u201d. But in volume 8, Willingham calls out Israel specifically when he has Bigsby address Gepetto. He makes references to the 6 Days War and other conflicts in which Isreal punched above its weight class when it had an existential crisis. And so Fabletown attempts a truce with the Adversary by demonstrating how it will get revenge when attacked \u2013 as revenge for the wooden soldier attack, Bigsby blows up the entire sacred woods, preventing Gepetto (or so we think?) from adding to his wooden army corps.Whatever you think of the real life Isreali situation, it\u2019s certainly a tempting strategy for Fabletown to adopt. What makes it interesting is that, while the strategy is that of Israel against its neighbors, the actual actions are those of the Arab terrorists. Indeed, Bigsby mentions that the Adversary\u2019s empire is so vast that he cannot possibly protect it all. Fabletown can always find an unprotected corner to attack and wreak havok upon. However tempting it may seem to the seeminly outmatched Fabletown, however, there may be one thing they\u2019re overlooking \u2013 the strategy isn\u2019t a long-term one, nor does it get them what they really want. It simply ensures that Fabletown remains, but it does not allow people to return to their homelands. It does not defeat the Adversary. It just creates a stalemate. Just as it has in the real world \u2013 Isreal is still under existential threat and the Arabs still do not have the state and territory they crave.Although the Arabian story ends with a return to the status quo and may only be setup for soem future plotline, it does remind me a bit of a certain scene in the movie Snatch. After Tommy gets swindled by Mickey, but tries to once again play off the reason for having brought Gorgeous George with him, Mickey replies, \u201cYou don\u2019t bring a man like that unless you\u2019re trying to say something.\u201d Once the reader learns how powerful Djinn are relative to the other Fables Willingham has exposed us to, it becomes clear that by bringing the Djinn to Fabletown, they intended to intimidate and send a message that they were negotiating from a position of power. Of course, Prince Charming and the others didn\u2019t take that lightly. As with the Isreali gambit, while there\u2019s certainly a valid strategy involved in negotiating while intimidating your opposite party, it can also backfire and lead to a more stubborn negotiation. Until robots are involved, there will always be an element of irrationality to negotiations. The leaders of a country may be willing to doom they country (and even themselves) to save face. At this point in the story, we don\u2019t know if there will be ramifications to this negotiating style, but it may be that when the Arabian fables find themselves in a position of need, they may end up getting less help than they\u2019d have engendered with a more amiable negotiating tactic.As I said above, it appears that we have merely ended the first of three acts. I imagine the next fifty issues (more or less) will reveal the new conflicts that will evolve based on the new \u201cIsreali\u201d stance that Fabletown has taken and how the Adversary reacts to that.Join me as I continue to write about Fables (and its spinoffs) and, also remember that I love conversation so feel free to comment wherever you happen to read this article."}, {"userName": "Yehia Shehata", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7842151-yehia-shehata", "userReview": "Another entertaining (if a bit slightly so) foray into the fable universe.

Nothing happens in this latest installment to significantly impact the war against the Adversary, nor are there any major changes in the established cast, though we see a lot of new characters introduced who will no doubt play major roles in the future. There are basically two stories in this volume. The first story arc concerns the arrival of a delegation of Arabian Fables in New York, led by their envoy, Sinbad. Unfortunately Sinbad arrives complete with his retinue of blackamor guards and harem slaves. Such did not sit well with the Fabletown authority, especially when they learned that Sinbad is carrying a djinn with them (yes, the Genie in the bottle/lamp type). This is immediately interpreted as an act of war from the camp of the Arabian Fables since a djinn is the magic equivalent of a nuclear arsenal.We've read references to non-European Fable lands in previous volumes and knew that the Adversary had already begun his invasion of the worlds of the Arabian Fables. Now we learn that the Arabian Fables are quite aware of the threat, but still have not decided whether or not to ally themselves with the Fables who have fled to the mundane world. For more of the initial attempt of Fabletown\u2019s attempt to communicate with the Arabian Fables, best to read \u201cFables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall\u201d.There are a lot of culture clashes and the requisite amount of treachery and bloodshed, along with a few subplots highlighting the personal lives of Beast, Beauty, Prince Charming, Flycatcher, and Red Riding Hood. Newly elected Mayor, Prince Charming and Deputy Mayor Beauty have to deal with their own residents who are fed up with the way that Charming has been running Fabletown; as well as the sexual tension brewing between the two of them (as witnessed by Bufkin, the flying monkey & Business Office Librarian). While Beast has gotten used to his role as Fabletown Sheriff, Charming is still regretting his decision to unseat King Cole as the mayor. He receives an earful from Boy Blue in this regard. \"The Ballad of Rodney and June\u201d as the final section of the book is a real change of pace. The wooden soldiers of the Empire were introduced in March of the Wooden Soldiers\u201d, and we learn that they are exceptionally powerful and merciless foot soldiers, given that they were carved from the living wood of the Sacred Grove. However, two subjects: a decorated soldier named Rodney and a wooden \"medic\" who helps repair injured wooden troops named June begin to show human emotions, which are regarded by the wooden soldiers as being among the worst things that have to do with being human. The wooden soldiers discuss at length their disgust with humanity: citing that humans must eat (shoving dead animal and plant matter into one hole), must excrete waste material (out of another hole), must sleep one third of each day, and are easily injured. No matter, June reciprocates Rodney\u2019s love and they petition their father, Gepetto, to be made human so that they can really and truly marry. Their wish is granted with the grave condition that they move just outside Fabletown and live among the Mundys (with Rodney ironically taking a job as a butcher--meat is abhorrent to the wooden sons and daughters of the Empire). Talk about being spied upon in your very own camp! Most moving was June\u2019s emotional predicament of wanting to protect her future child from the knowledge of what they truly are or to let their future brood live blissfully ignorant in the mundane world.
