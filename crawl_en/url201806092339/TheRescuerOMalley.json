Completely burned out from his job (driving a squad to emergencies in Chicago is no tea party), emotionally exhausted from the illness and death of his youngest sister, and frustrated because the rest of his family have all become Christians and he can\u2019t understand why, Stephen leaves for a long break. When he returns, he buys a small farm in a small town outside of Chicago, and is ready to start his new life.I really enjoyed this book, as I have the entire series. This one involved a jewel thief parallel story line that seemed a bit obscure to me, but Stephen\u2019s love interest, Meghan, is one of my favorite characters in the entire series, so the book was a bit of a toss-up for me. :-D I will say that it contains more excellent conversations about religion. I greatly appreciated this exchange\u2013 \u201cWhy does it feel like God has conditions on loving me?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re projecting your own list of what you think He should expect. It gets pretty intense when you realize He accepts you despite the fact that you\u2019re a mess as the moment \u2026 Jesus is the kind who moves in, says I love you anyway, and then starts helping repair the mess. He means it when He says He loves you as you are, not based on what you\u2019ve done. But He loves you too much to leave you in that chaos once you know Him.\u201d Henderson manages to capture that beautiful tension of the Christian life\u2013Christ accepts us for who we are, without demanding us to \u201cclean up\u201d our lives in order to approach Him, but once we give our lives to Him, He helps us to clean them up, working alongside of us\u2013a holy life is a result of a relationship with Christ, not a prerequisite.I do feel like this book ends a bit abruptly. We\u2019ve traveled along with this family for six fat books, and then it\u2019s just sort of \u201cand everyone lived happily ever after\u201d kind of feel and that\u2019s the end. Still, I really enjoyed this series as a whole, and this book in particular is an easy 4/5"}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63600007-courtney", "userReview": "There was a wrench thrown in this book that was too much. The town Stephen goes to find solace is hours away from his hometown Chicago,with no hospital. A couple of times, family just drops by for the day, an emergency cause a patient to have to be transported and low and behold it puts Stephen in a position to just drop by Chicago to see his sister. Another time, Kate calls the blind nurse to \"drop\" by when she feels ill. The logistics should have included the jet that so quickly is used in previous books. Stephen's previous love interest is just kind of looked over with a mere sentence as if the reader will just accept it and move on to a new chick. The author merely mentions Stephen's soul searching as he travels the country after the death of his sister. A climax is alluded to in a previous book when Lisa mentions a landmark she wants him to visit, and it is forgotten in this book. His new love interest has such a back story with the family, I keep asking myself why was she not in previous books. The O'Malley family is so close and yet Stephen has cut himself off from them only to desperately need a girl we have not met. Again there is another evangelistic dating thing going on, that I think especially for teens is misleading. This book seems more like the writers brainstorming than an actual thought out story. The series is one I definately am glad to be finished. The problems with basic Christian teaching and realistic spiritual self discovery caused me to sit down with my kids and clarify many things. I did tell them that Henderson was published and I was not, so to take my opinions about her writing style with a grain of salt."}, {"userName": "Teresa Snyder", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6246084-teresa-snyder", "userReview": "It can't be the end! I'm not ready to say goodby to the O'Malley's. Stephen was our focus in this book. We first met him in book one, when he was having breakfast with Kate. His love interest, Megan, is a childhood friend. Megan had a crush on Stephen when she was a teenager and never really got over it. Stephen had a very hard time dealing with the death of his sister. He's doing the only thing he knows to do. Run. The night he plans on leaving, he offers to give Megan a ride home to the small town where she now lives. Megan knows all about running. She did it for a year after the accident. She is the only person that truly understands how Stephen is feeling. When Stephen decides to come home after a year of traveling from place to place, he stops to see Megan. And falls in love with the town. Buys a farm and puts down roots. Now if he can convince Megan to move their relationship beyond friendship, but the only way that will happen is if he becomes a believer. Absolutely adore Dave and Kate, so it was an added bonus that the series began and ended with them in a very special way. Kate giving birth to the first of the next generation of O'Malley's.

I enjoyed the series. It was a mixture of romance and suspense in every novel. You have to read all of the books though in order to really understand each character. Even though the books are about each of the siblings, the other siblings are developed through out all the books. It would be really hard to understand what was happening if not read in sequence. I liked the cool jobs that the O'Malley's had- athough realistically it may be a little far- fetched. Still it was very good, clean reading.A word about the Bible refrences and concepts. As a reader of the KJV of the Bible I found some of the scriptures interpreted very differently.

Even though you know who the \u201cvillains\u201d are from the beginning, it was interesting to see how the story & plot unfold.

As a Christian I am able to relate to the questions the O\u2019Malleys all had and I enjoyed seeing how their perspectives changed through out the series. I thought this book (and the series) ended well, though I am a little sad that we won\u2019t know how Stephen & Meghan end up.

Argh! We'll see if I can recreate. It's been said in almost all the reviews, but this was such a great series. It kept me turning pages and trying to figure things out too. Plot twists; suspense; human characters; emotion; pain; joy; relationships.... The romance was kept clean, sweet, and more of a side topic. Stephen is grieving. I can't imagine the pain. He can't deal with the grief and memories so he runs. Driving around the country for almost a year, he's running from the pain of losing his sister and feeling like he's lost his family too. Not only is he the last unattached O'Malley, he is the only one who doesn't believe in God. He's endured too much loss to believe in a God. He finally returns when he learns Kate is pregnant. (Yep, an O'Malley baby!) But he's not ready to go back to Chicago life and his paramedic job. He finds some peace in nearby Silverton, which also happens to be where his childhood friend Meghan lives. Stephen's story is raw and honest. He discusses his reservations about faith honestly. In none of the books is the Christianity pushy or forced. It's the natural questions and answers from the characters. Meghan follows the convictions of the other Christian characters who find themselves loving an unbeliever. I think that is part of what draws the non-Christians to faith; seeing the conviction and commitment the other person has. That and their peace in the midst of trials. This story was much more human interest, but the jewelry thievery was an interesting angle. It was fun guessing when and where the next piece would turn up. The Rescuer was a satisfying conclusion to this series. Cole and Rachel got married, as well as Jack and Cassie; Stephen and Meghan are going to get married; baby Holly makes her appearance. I could read about this family forever, but it's great to leave them in such a good place and know that things are going to be okay. Someday I'm going to add this series to my personal library."}, {"userName": "Kaisa", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34789948-kaisa", "userReview": "4 solid stars. I'm lucky that I took a chance on the hideous cover of the first audiobook in this series, since it's been quite the pleasure to read these stories. The Rescuer is a sweet ending to the O'Malley family story. Not really much of a mystery per se, but I didn't mind too much. All the relationships in this book were interesting, I only wish Lisa and Quinn would have made an appearance. I've been re-reading this series so many times, because each book seems to give me so semblance of hope and comfort. I know myself well enough to know what it is that draws me into these books. The downside of reading them more than once is, that I start to pick up on the nuances and the flaws. Or maybe they aren't flaws, they're just things I don't like. Things I'd like to see more, but aren't there. I get that each of these books have a solid story, theme and a message they want to convey, but I wish the characters were given more time to deepen even more, since now they usually just feel like talking heads once they come to the scene outside of their own books. Kate and Dave are pretty much the only ones who seem to have longer story arch than the others, whereas I feel like the others could offer even more. Then again, the series is over 10 years old, so there's really no point in complaining about this. On the plus side, if a series that is 10 years old, holds up for reading in 2018 and re-reading after re-reading, there must be something good about it. It took me a while to realise, that possibly one of the reasons why the same names seem to come up in each book on different characters, is maybe not laziness or the author's deep love for the certain names, but maybe the fact that pretty much every name in her stories can be found from the Bible. And I'm sure if I read the Bible better, I'd get even more out of these books. We'll see."}, {"userName": "Kyra G", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72417063-kyra-g", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book! Henderson closed the series out beautifully. I love how each of the O'Malleys struggle with their relationships with God in realistic ways. I see Stephen 's doubts and questions out in the world. Henderson writes wonderful Christian novels that don't sound like a Sunday morning service.
