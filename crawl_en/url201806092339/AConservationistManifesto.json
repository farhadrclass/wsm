Before this class, I thought I liked the earth. I thought I was fairly environmentally friendly. Apparently, I had no frickin idea just how nuts you have to be to consider yourself Earth-friendly. Take Mr. Sanders, for example. When he's not railing against the media being responsible for everything wrong with the planet (see, consumerism makes people only think about themselves - if we eliminate advertising, this problem will be solved immediately), he's getting misty-eyed about the perfect world we'll all create together, where everyone lives in harmony with nature and we spend our days doing organic farming and skipping around in a circle singing Kumbaya. Then he explains how the Middle Ages were a fantastic model of sustainability, because they used a communal system where everyone shared the land and farmed it equally (he glosses over the fact that the people doing this awesome communal living were illiterate, essentially-enslaved, poverty-stricken individuals who were likely to die of a common cold by age 25). His actual Manifesto outlines many ideas on how we can change the world and stop the planet from its current state of Totally Fucked. (\"there's a moment you know...\") The problem is, most of his solutions seem to rely on drastically changing basic human nature. Apparently to save the planet we need to: stop breeding like rabbits (you know, like China, whose \"One Child Rule\" is working out so well), not consider our own personal needs before the needs of the entire planet, and stop war. Yes, Scott Russell Sanders believes that to save the planet, humans have to stop wanting to kill each other. I'm totally on board with this idea, but how, may I ask, do we accomplish this insanely optimistic goal? Good question. He doesn't share this information with us, because I guess he started singing \"The Colors of the Wind\" and got distracted. That being said, it amuses me immensely to picture Scott Russell Sanders leaping around his study belting \"You can own the earth and still, all you'll own is earth UNTIIIIL YOU CAN PAAAAIIIINT...with all the colors....OF...THE WIIIIIND!\"Read for: Environmentalism and Sustainability Studies"}, {"userName": "Mackenzie Gregory", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64838768-mackenzie-gregory", "userReview": "While Sanders offers some captivating insight into environmental issues and offers some viable proposals for conservation (some not so much), the overall feel of the book is pretentious. The man wrote it in his garden cabin/hut he had built to \"get more in tune with nature.\" How can you write a book about conservation from an unnecessary building that used raw materials? Come on."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5926332-claire", "userReview": "\"Whatever else we teach our children, we owe them an ecological education (...) By the time they finish school, children who have received an ecological education know in their bones that the wellbeing of people depends on the wellbeing of Earth, from the neighborhood to the watershed to the planet\". The practice of conservation is both an individual and collective, societal matter. It is a personal and a public virtue, one that will seal our fate - no less. \u2018A Conservationist Manifesto\u2019 reminds me of the seminal work of Aldo Leopold. As such it is not new content. It does not redefine ecology or environmental ethics. It is rather a renewed content fueled by 70 years or so of human history since Leopold\u2019s \u2018A Sand County Almanac\u2019. A Conservationist Manifesto is as necessary and as beautifully written as the essays from the past, there be from Thoreau, Carson, Muir or Leopold. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!"}, {"userName": "Christian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3155943-christian", "userReview": "Sanders's writing style is the stuff that legends are made of: smooth, clear, vivid, spare. The essays in this collection are uneven, though. From the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of \"The Warehouse and the Wilderness,\" a prolonged rant against postmodern literary theory, a subject about which Sanders admits he knows very little, to the brilliance of \"Stillness,\" a tight essay structured by his first visit to a private cabin on a piece of property he owns. My favorite piece was \"Simplicity and Sanity,\" which offered an insightful and careful reading of Thoreau's work, primarily Walden, and which related Thoreau's lifelong search for a better life to our present economic and ecological condition.The collection is worthy of a read, but readers should not feel guilty about abandoning an unsatisfying essay and jumping to the next."}, {"userName": "Karen Mcintyre", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1097509-karen-mcintyre", "userReview": "I heard Sanders speak at a library re-dedication and searched for his work. I really did not want to read another ecology manifesto --- but this one is different. He creates a hopeful world view in the midst of the potential disaster that will come unless we get a grip on our consumerism and overuse of the worlds gifts which we quickly trash!His writing is almost poetic and his use of both metaphor and etymology is both beautiful and helpful in understanding the concepts he promotes. Along with being individual \"arks\" as we practice individual simplicity, he shows the beauty and gift of community for our salvation and for the salvation of the whole earth! READ IT!"}, {"userName": "Longfellow", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/964474-longfellow", "userReview": "This collection of essays inspires me to seek out the many other quality nature writers our country has been blessed with over the last one hundred and fifty years or so. Sanders makes it clear that these voices, whether still living (Wendell Berry, to name one) or long dead (Thoreau and Emerson), offer us observations crucial to repairing our current relationship with the earth. In addition to holding this responsible and humble view in common, these writers (and Sanders belongs in this group as well) offer an aesthetic and contemplative perspective that reminds us to appreciate simple beauties as well as to intentionally seek balance between tasks and stillness."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2093580-mary", "userReview": "Sanders is one of those writers who ought to be much better known than he is. This book collects several of his previously published essays, all of them centered in some way around the satisfactions that come from living simply and lightly upon the land. I especially liked his reflections on the meaning of words such as \"commonwealth\" (hint: not about money) and his thought-provoking suggestion about using the Sabbath as an occasion to give the earth a rest from us. This is also a beautifully packaged little book, as irresistable in form as it is in content."}, {"userName": "Indiana University Press", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2517379-indiana-university-press", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I've read lately. Sanders' call to move from a culture of consumption to one of conservation is more timely than ever now in the wake of our uncertain financial future, depleting oil supply, and global climate change. This book makes me think twice about my actions as they not only affect me, but also the planet and everyone else who lives on it. I am better for reading it, and hopefully this positive impact will be felt by the Earth as well. I can't recommend this book enough. It will change your life."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/420227-jen", "userReview": "Scott Russell Sanders is an inspiration! I heard him do a reading recently and was able to have lunch with him--a joy! I am not too far into this book yet, but it raises great questions/thoughts! Also, his compelation of short stories \"Wilderness Plots\" is amazing and I highly recommend it too!"}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1599196-christopher", "userReview": "What a wonderful, caring, simple (in a good way) book.

How might we shift to a more durable and responsible way of life? What changes in values and behavior will be required? Ranging geographically from southern Indiana to the Boundary Waters Wilderness and culturally from the Bible to billboards, Sanders extends the visions of Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and Rachel Carson to our own day. A Conservationist Manifesto shows the crucial relevance of a conservation ethic at a time of mounting concern about global climate change, depletion of natural resources, extinction of species, and the economic inequities between rich and poor nations. The important message of this powerful book is that conservation is not simply a personal virtue but a public one.", "title": "A Conservationist Manifesto", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6201158-a-conservationist-manifesto", "average": 4.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383166755l/6201158.jpg", "reviews": 13, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33375.Scott_Russell_Sanders", "name": "Scott Russell Sanders"}], "type": ["Environment", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Environment", "Politics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6201158-a-conservationist-manifesto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548100.A_Private_History_of_Awe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548101.Hunting_for_Hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/496162.Staying_Put", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1137443.Writing_from_the_Center", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/719890.The_Paradise_of_Bombs"]}
