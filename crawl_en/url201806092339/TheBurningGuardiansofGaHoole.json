It was a good story with a plotline continuing from the previous books, and a great resolution when Soren's brother and archenemy is killed. There are a few references to burning throughout the book, but not nearly as strong a theme threaded through as there was in The Shattering.\tWe are introduced to the Northern Kingdoms for the first time in the series. We find that they speak different languages, have different weather, and practice different customs. The author makes the point that different kinds of people must come together in times of need to resist spreading evil.\tIn chapter five, we see Soren begin to doubt his worthiness for the mission that Ezylryb has assigned to him. As the story goes on, he is continually disappointed in what he is able to accomplish, though he is quick to take full responsibility for any failures. As you would expect, this great leader is truly his own worst critic. I think even in the end he fails to see how much the Guardians were able to accomplish because of his leadership. Although I must point out that a constant theme of this series is the lesser characters stepping up and doing great things. We see that in this book with Gylfie and Twilla in huge ways, and other characters to a lesser extent.\tThere is a discussion in the book about vanity. This hearkens back to the mirror lakes when the band was mesmerized by their own reflections and deceived. Gylfie mentioned that \u201cshe knew that vanity deceived, and was not a strength, but a weakness.\u201d Having that previous experience helped her to succeed in her mission. I think of how often in our society people are mesmerized by their own looks, and fixated on how they are viewed. Later Gylfie refers to vanity as a \u201cthief of flight.\u201d The loss of flight, perhaps the most precious ability of an owl, makes the point of how destructive vanity can be.\tThere is a brief discussion of forgiveness between Gylfie and Twilla. Twilla had come to the point of forgiving her greatest enemy, Ifghar, and treating him extremely kindly. Only then could her soul heal. Even when she saw no change in Ifghar's heart, she valued the change in her own heart brought about by forgiveness. This is in sync with Soren and our great old war hero, Ezylryb, and a far cry from the hatred and revenge that consumes the heart of Ifghar, Nyra, and Kludd. \tIt is also notable that Soren is extremely affected by the death of his brother, Kludd, even as evil as he was. In the end there is some closure when his parents absolve Soren of any wrongdoing.\tThe Burning was a good book. It did not have the elements of a great novel that its predecessor had, but it did resolve the war with Metal Beak and the Pure Ones. It also set up the expectation of the next great villain. There's also an intriguing loose end with Ifghar. Lasky does a nice job of setting up the next book."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/635549-amy", "userReview": "JUSTICE!!! BYE BYE, KLUDD!!!!!!!:DPardon my excessive exclamation points, but I really hated Kludd. It's really hard to like a character who's been given a wonderful home to grow up in, only to attempt fratricide and teach that certain owls are OBVIOUSLY superior to others. Kludd's mate, Nyra, is no better.Anyway, good job to Twilight. He ended a great evil in this book. (I also loved how he bullied the vultures. That was hilarious!)Onward, to glory! (And more books!):D :D :D"}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2191574-liz", "userReview": "Bringing closure to the Cain and Abel dance between Soren and Kludd, this book is what I like to think of as the 'final' in the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series. Indeed, when I was younger, as the first six books were the only ones the library carried, I thought it was the final. It mostly centres around Otulissa's plot to invade the St Aegolius Canyons, which have by now fallen to the Pure Ones, and, were there no more books in the series, would do a credible job of wrapping it all up.For a Ga'Hoole book, it was excellent. All the owls are dropped into a new land, facing the perils of the Northern Kingdoms, which gives Lasky scope to reveal new aspects of their characters.I especially enjoyed reading the sections with Otulissa and Gylfie--they are great foils for one another and I've grown to love Otulissa for her intelligence, cunning, ideals, upset outbursts, and of course, her unintentional moments of humour. Probably the best example of character development in the entire series with her sudden but understandable turn to a colder, less charitable version of herself. And yet she is by this point my favourite.Twilight, on the other hand, has a scene of shocking cruelty, one of which I do not understand and which Lasky makes no judgement on, though the situation richly deserves it. Apparently it's all right to harass a group of vultures who just helped you out even though you shore their tailfeathers off, simply because they aren't owls. Twilight is a character I like, but at this point I like him in spite of himself.Digger, as always, never gets enough screentime.And Soren is one of the most likeable, thoughtful characters I've ever read. As far as I can tell (I've read up to about book 10), this is the last book that focuses much on him. I'm sorry to see him lose the limelight.The richness of the owl culture and history as always sucks me in, with all its cheery poems, songs, and Twilight's chants (raps, really). Meanwhile Lasky retains a subtle but firm touch of the mystical, with ice weapons that never dull from an ice spear that never melts, and Soren's starsight dreams, which are excellent foreshadowing, and are rarely if ever used in a heavy-handed way. The epic tone of the story is still there, bolstered by the aspiration of the owls to be better versions of themselves, and Lasky's use of telling rather than showing at times, which hearkens back to the songs that bards would sing. They are the Chaw of Chaws, the best of the best, and they will fight for their freedom.However, the elitism of the story also proves its undoing. The Burning loses a star, as any Ga'Hoole book always will, for Lasky's blindness in creating a band of noble owls fighting against a supremacist and rather racist cult, when they themselves behave in exactly the same way towards other birds (seagulls, puffins and vultures come to mind as especial victims). Not to mention the nestmaid snakes, who are practically enslaved by the owls, and who seem to revel in their servitude. Lasky makes no attempt to comment on this beyond actually praising this order of things, which I find quite despicable.I also dislike that Octavia seemed to naturally take on such a role in becoming Ezylryb's nestmaid snake after she had such a different life before she was blinded. As though that were all she were good for, and all she aspired to!The scale of the book was again off, and I, a long-time fan of the series, don't actually know how much time has passed since the series began. I thought it was a year, two at most. Apparently it was \"summers and summers ago\". And yet Soren and the rest of the band, whilst they have grown and changed over the previous books, are still very much adolescent and do not seem to rank any higher in the Tree than a fairly talented group of teenagers would in the real world.Meanwhile, the number of owls in the Tree is still unexplained, and when you're talking war and invasion, it gets confusing.This book would have gotten five stars had it not been for the severe moral flaws within--however, the rest of the writing and worldbuilding is good enough to overcome it--and it has to be good. The Guardians of Ga'Hoole is a series that somehow, against all odds, rises above its unsightly flaws to live up to the nostalgia it evokes in me. The nostalgia of a different and more naive time, in which I was a different and more naive young girl."}, {"userName": "Amara Tanith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5263888-amara-tanith", "userReview": "With The Burning comes the end of the series' focus on Soren, the Band, and the Chaw of Chaws. (At least so far as I've read at this time of writing, which is up to To Be a King. The focus changes again after that, but from where we seem to be going, it looks like it's going to be Coryn's story from The Golden Tree to the end.) It's a massive disappointment, of course, as the Chaw of Chaws was the single best aspect of the story. As a matter of fact, they're just about the only aspect that make any sense.Exhibit A: The Guardians of Ga'Hoole, an ancient order of owl-knights, act like they don't have any more experienced or trusted warriors than the adolescent protagonists. The King and Queen, the teachers, all the other Guardians--they all leave every important aspect of the story up to the main characters with zero in-universe justification.Exhibit B: Kludd's initiation into the Pure Ones inexplicably demands the murder of a family member, ignoring the fact that there couldn't be a more counterproductive method of proving one's worth; if the Pure Ones want to build a pure race/society of Tyto Albas, why would they purposefully kill off the potential breeders?Exhibit C: There's no sense of time flow to the series. The narrative skips over massive periods, giving off the impression that only a few weeks are passing. And then a single line will suddenly clarify that years have gone by without so much as a nod.Exhibit D: The protagonists are just as prejudiced and ruthless as the antagonists, and yet the narrative never once hints at the possibility that maybe the war isn't as morally black-and-white as the protagonists think. When the protagonists do something, it's good. When the antagonists do something, it's bad. No one questions this. Not the snakes that the protagonists have enslaved. Not the other birds that they spend so much time insulting. Not even the vultures that Twilight threatens to maim (in order to get them to join the Guardians in fighting the Pure Ones).So I'm hoping that with the shift of focus that's coming in the next book, things will start to improve again. Unfortunately I'm starting to suspect it's not the Ga'Hoole series that doesn't work for me so much as it is Lasky's writing in general. I'm honestly wondering if what this series needed was just a brutally honest editor. There's enough here that it could have been great: an awesome team of characters at the core of the story, a secret society of owls who can use their specialized training and intellect for both war and humanitarianism (well, the owl equivalent of the term) depending on which needs doing, two opposing Big Bads to give the story some hints of moral ambiguity and opportunities for awesome team-ups and war tactics, a Cain and Abel aspect to explore psychologically, etcetera, etcetera. Instead, everything was handled in a rather clumsy fashion, and what could have been a great plot has thus far been lost on me.Maybe I'll have better luck with \nWarriors\n."}, {"userName": "Joshua Turner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47408246-joshua-turner", "userReview": "\" This book was one of the greatest of a series I have ever read.

This is the view of Soren, one of the many main characters in Kathryn Lasky\u2019s The Burning. \tIn the prologue, the Chaw of Chaws (chaw can mean team or class, but in this case it means team) receives their Guardian Ceremony, which gives them full recognition as Guardians of Ga\u2019hoole after they swear to do certain things, such as to never seek out a crown. The chaw includes: Soren, a Barn Owl from the Forest of Tyto, is leader of the chaw and is trained as a collier (a gatherer of coals for the forge) and therefore had to learn weather interpretation, as fire and storms are connected to one another. He \u201cfell\u201d out of his nest at an early age and was captured by a St. Aggie\u2019s patrol and met Gylfie, who had been captured by the patrol earlier. Gylfie is an Elf Owl from the Desert of Kunneer, which neighbors the Forest of Tyto, flies navigator. She is Soren\u2019s best friend has known Soren almost all her life. Twilight, a huge Great Grey Owl, is trained doing search-and-rescue. He was orphaned by the St. Aggie\u2019s patrol as soon as soon as, or before, he hatched and is completely self-taught through what he calls the \u201cOrphan School of Tough Learning\u201d. His skills include fighting, righting one\u2019s self when hanging upside-down (which he used his knowledge of to help Gylfie after she and Soren escaped St. Aggie\u2019s) and many other things. Digger, a Burrowing Owl, is a tracker, but he is often philosophizing and can be very tolerant. Soren found him after mistaking Digger\u2019s heartbeat for that of a mouse. Martin, a plucky Northern Saw-whet Owl who is often emphasizing his lack of size, Otulissa, a prim and proper Spotted Owl of prim and proper heritage (who won\u2019t shut her beak), is the very owl who planned the invasion of the Pure Ones to avenge the death of her beloved Strix Struma (an old Spotted Owl whom Otulissa practically worshipped), and Ruby, a somewhat impatient Short-eared Owl who is a great flier, are all colliers who arrived at the Great Tree at the same time as the band ( Soren, Gylfie, Digger, and Twilight). Eglantine, Soren\u2019s sister, was captured by the Pure Ones, a group led by Kludd, Soren and Eglantine\u2019s older brother, that believes that only Barn Owls are \u201cpure\u201d, after St. Aggie\u2019s took Soren. She, like Twilight, is search-and-rescue, and she often ends up in trouble. The mission at hand: take Dewlap, an old, retired Burrowing Owl who was ryb (teacher), to the Glauxian Sisters\u2019 Retreat, then divide and recruit forces to fight alongside the Guardians in the upcoming invasion. Will the Chaw of Chaws recruit enough forces? Will the invasion succeed? Read the book to find out. \tMy favorite thing about this book is that it\u2019s easy for you to look at things from any character\u2019s point of view, or just make one up like I did. For me it was a peregrine falcon named Ghidarian who was caught up in owlish matters. That was one of the factors that kept me glued to the book, just the presence of the falcon I made up. \tI would recommend this book to people of either gender age 10 or older who likes fantasy, fiction, action, adventure, and/or owls and has read books 1-5. There is the occasional use of the H word, but technically that\u2019s a place, and owl cussing is prominent, but it means nothing in English."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13451442-sarah", "userReview": "I am more impressed with the series with each book.

The Guardians of Ga'hoole are noble owls, who respect each different type of owl and learn great things at the Great Tree of Hoole.

The Pure Ones are group of owls who have \"tyto\" in their scientific name and are grouped together to rid the other kinds of owls in the owl kingdoms. They are ruled usually by a High Tyto and have different ranks.My favorite part of the book is would be when the Guardians were outnumbered by the Pure Ones, but when the Pure Ones were about to go for the kill, reinforcements suddenly came for the Guardians from the north and then the Guardians suddenly began the counter attack so the Pure Ones retreated with heavy loses.In this book of Guardians of Ga'hoole, the Guardians haved learned that St. Aggies (a group of mean owls who take young chicks and control them using the moon) have fallen to the Pure Ones and are using the flecks that they have to rule the owls of every kind. Flecks are a type of metal that can disrupt a owl's sense of direction. The Guardians than go to the Northern Kingdoms to recruit the owls there and learn how to use their own weapons, so that they can do an invasion against the Pure Ones and stop their use of their flecks.I don't want to spoil the end of the story and I am sorry if I took to long.

The band heads out to the northern kingdom in search of support. While there they are also trained to fight with specialized equipment(ice scimitars and shards). However everything does not turn out as expected. They are unable to guarantee any assistance and are merely sent back home.In addition to this the band confronts kraals, Lasky's pirate owls. They succeed in thwarting them but Glyfie is taken prisoner. She tries to devise a plan to escape and after doing so she makes a difficult decision to ensure that support will come for her friends and stays in the northern kingdoms.Soren full of grief returns back to the gahoole tree with only news of failure. Kludd on the other hand has not been idle this whole time. He has invaded St. Aggies with his followers and is reinforcing its defense against a probable guardian invasion.Towards the end of the books Soren and Kludd confront in the much anticipated battle but it ends quickly due to an unexpected factor. I believe that their battle could have been much more intense. Lasky ruined something with much potential but did not necessarily ruin the book. The author also has a habit to incessantly repeat previously mentioned facts throughout this book and the series. I know this book was written for a young audience but this is very frustrating. Keep in mind young adults are reading this too! After this book I thought the series would end but it continues. Curious how the story will progress. If you exclude the final battle this book is worth your time."}, {"userName": "Shanna L Vaughan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60330251-shanna-l-vaughan", "userReview": "Guardians of Ga'Hoole #6: The Burning SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, BE WARNED!First of all, this is an amazing book. Character development is amazing, and there are some unexpected twists such as Gylfie being taken hostage and Twilight killing Kludd in the end. However, for a final battle this book is considerably less bloody than it could have been but that is probably for the best. UPDATE: I checked and it is actually as bloody as \"hagsmire.\" However, I think the victory of the Guardians was too complete. The fire could have burned down the tree of Ga'Hoole and Kludd could have at least wounded Soren before Twilight killed him. Kludd is supposed to be OP. Great book tho."}, {"userName": "Rivkah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4004110-rivkah", "userReview": "This book series just keeps getting better and better as the series progresses. I love the prologue of this book, guardians at last! And Otulissa is getting less snotty, or giving out a bit less information of everything she knows.The Chaw of Chaws, along with Martin and ruby and I think some other owls must go out to different locations, splitting of at the ice narrows to get information and rally glauxian brothers and sisters.Does this have anything to do with the owl Hoole? Because they thing the first owl was hoole, and something like the creator was glaux, then theres glaxian brothers and glaxian sisters. Why arn't they joined up with the guardians of Ga'hoole?But they return with the mission pending-the elders were holding a meeting about it as they left. And with out Gylfie. Kathryn Lasky put a bitter sweet line in there about soren never being appart from her since they were orphans at the evil academy, and how he's so sad.Here's one major spoiler quote.  \"twilight!\" Soren said softly. \"I didn't hear you coming.\"\" you mean I didn't chant him, taunt him?\" twilight said.\"Yeah.\"\"I killed your brother Soren. I didn't feel he needed to go out with a song.\" And despite the seriousness of the situation, I burst out laughing. Arch-nemesis, otherwise known as brother Kludd dead: no song.But twilight must have had enough sense to know a song wan't appropriate."}, {"userName": "Kaelyn ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28510605-kaelyn", "userReview": "This was yet another great book in this series. Although this series is for kids, it has a lot of great messages and I think really important ones that kids need to know, presented in a fun, exciting way. This book was just a continuation of that journey. I loved the split perspectives of the many owls on their many missions. I liked the idea that the other owls didn't have to be brave together, but could be brave and act noble on their own, especially Gylfie. I liked that we got to see different sides of the owls, especially Twilight and Soren. The new characters were always useful and I liked seeing more of Ruby and Martin, who we don't see enough of. In a nutshell, a wonderful book for kids that explores why \"purity of race\" is a REALLY BAD THING. I know that this is the end of the war against the Pure Ones, so I'm curious on how there's more books in the series? How can this go on longer? In any case, I'll probably start the next one tomorrow, or at the latest on Monday!"}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10320975-ashley", "userReview": "Guardians of Ga'Hoole: The Burning (The Guardians of Ga'Hoole Book 6) Summary: A great battle is on the horizon and drawing near.

Not one of the best books the author has written but not everything can be perfect. Soren and the band have to go to the Northern Regions to fetch comrades to fight the Pure Ones. I personally think Nyra would be a better antagonist since in my opinion she is much smarter than Kludd. The Pure Ones being a massive group of owls with the word tyto in their scientific name. (Tyto alba, tyto multipunctata, tyto almae, etc.). As the group wishes for a world with no owls other than tyto breeds, as they call it, \"pure\". I really think this book's story was kind of slow. Not much happened in the plot except for some minor occurrences, although this book is probably a connection from one to another big event explaining why its story was quite slow."}], "description": "A great battle is on the horizon and drawing near.
