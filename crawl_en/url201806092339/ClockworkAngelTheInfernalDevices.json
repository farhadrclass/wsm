Friends of mine, you know I adore you, so please don't take offense at this review. If you enjoyed this book then I\u2019m really glad you did. It makes me happy when people enjoy literature. So you probably shouldn't read this review if you love this book. It's nice to know that even though Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy ended years ago, I can pick up ANY SINGLE ONE of her books that she has published and see not only Draco\u2019s character, but all my old friends from the Harry Potter Fanon Universe with different names and physical descriptions but otherwise pretty much intact. Because seven really long books just wasn\u2019t enough for them apparently.It's nice to know that the snappy little one-liners and cheap hijinks are being recycled because they worked so well the first AND second time she used them.I don't think I've made it any great secret that I despise the writings of Cassandra Clare - so let me get the, few, good points out of the way so I can go back to imagining a world where authors like this are forcibly chained to their desks and made to read their own stories over and over again until they\u2019re sorry.-She stopped using so many damn similes. I no longer feel like gouging out my own eyes every single time she tries to describe something. -There is no creepy incest in this book so my husband was spared walking in on me trying to choke the life out of a paperback novel.And\u2026 that about it. I mean, let\u2019s face it, if the only good things I can say about this book are that she\u2019s made slight improvements so that I no longer feel the urge to commit seppuku by diving head first into a meat grinder, then it\u2019s not high praise.So what was wrong with this novel? Well, other than the fact that the characters were almost CARBON COPIES of ones that I\u2019d read in City of Bones, Draco Dormiens, Draco Sinister and Draco Veritas, there was just so much to hate. The character building that they actually DO have only exists because she did the work years ago (on top of another author's pre-existing characters) \u2013 otherwise they\u2019d be little more animated than the clockwork automatons that appear in this story.Don\u2019t get me started on how she wiki\u2019d \u201cVictorian Society\u201d, copy and pasted the information into word and then randomly injected it into the story via the characters parroting the cans and can\u2019ts of the time period. Not even going there. It\u2019ll take too long to complain about that. How about her inability to write a storyline that is in anyway surprising? Reading one of her novels is like watching a dumbed down version of Scooby Doo. I actually liked Scooby Doo (before Scrappy-Doo came along. Whoever made that character needed to be shot, hung, kheelhauled and quartered \u2013 the whole works) but you know how they\u2019d go somewhere and they\u2019d be like, \u201cHey guys, I think something\u2019s going to happen! Hey, look gang, a perfectly inconspicuous diving mask\u2026 I WONDER IF THIS COULD BE A CLUE *WINK**WINK**NUDGE**NUDGE* FOR ALL THE FIVE YEAR OLD KIDS PLAYING AT HOME!\u201dIn Clockwork Angel, Clare practically flags you down, makes you come look VERY hard at her clue that is painted bright, bright red and poorly hidden behind her back while she insists that it\u2019s not actually there and giggles every time she tries to make you not look at her ENORMOUS FLIPPIN' CLUE. She insists on this behaviour until finally you pat her on the head, tell her that she ALMOST managed to colour inside all the lines. The whole concept of this book wasn\u2019t original! It was her looking at the Internet culture going, \u201cHuh\u2026 so people are really getting into steampunk, eh? Hmmmm\u2026 how can I cash in on this with as little effort on my behalf as possible?\u201dShe is recycling characters that she built on from the Harry Potter universe years ago. She's recycling storylines, conversations, personalities, plot-points, ideas and concepts from all around her and she recycles her own stuff (what little there is of it) just as frequently. When she was accused of plagiarism for lifting entire paragraphs of text from other authors without referencing it, she made a comment that it didn't really matter because - hey, isn't fanfiction just pastiche anyway?Well, fine. It was just fanfiction, who really cares? But I'd think after all these years she would have moved on past her pastiche style of writing to something that she could actually claim as her own.But you know what? She can't. I feel no guilt in saying that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be published or to be earning the money that she is. I will proudly complain about her books until she actually starts to care about the fudge that she\u2019s packing."}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "THIS WAS SO GREAT.

I never know exactly what answer to offer. I very much enjoy reading L.J. Smith\u2019s books. But C.S. Pacat is my favorite M/M author! And let\u2019s not forget how amazing J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series is. Oh, and have you heard of Kiera Cass? She wrote such a swoon-worthy love story! And Eliza Crewe, Leigh Bardugo, Laini Taylor and Marissa Meyer are all new favorite authors of mine.Nonsense. No need to be torned ever again.Cassandra Clare...is, to me, an incredible and worth knowing author. She seems to be possessing such an overflowing with imagination and ideas and originality mind. And she simply knows how to create endearing and filled with chemistry relationships, romantic or not. Plus, you know how sometimes you read scenes in a book and you feel like they aren\u2019t clear or so poorly contextualized that the author\u2019s words are sadly hard to follow? Well that never happens with this author. And, hell! she switched from urban fantasy to historical fiction + fantasy + steampunk with perfection! It's crazy, so to speak, how interesting I find her characters to read about. They\u2019re not just fantastically created and developped beings. They\u2019re always more than that and, often, they will reach out to the deepest parts inside you...and make you realize some things you never have before and open your eyes on others. I don\u2019t know how she does it. What I do know though is that she has a great talent and that is something I very strongly believe and will not let someone convince me on thinking otherwhise. It's how it should always go, anyway. You appreciate, admire, love or even crave something? Don't let anyone destroy that feeling. Because it is true and powerful.I fervently and judiciously thought about it and...I did not quite prefer this impressive series to The Mortal Instruments one. You see, I simply think that they\u2019re both very different stories. This one, for instance, contains a variety of new original characters and elements that we do not see featured in the other series\u2026and that\u2019s great. I mean, I LOVED this book. But, I still am deeply smitten with Alec & Magnus as a couple and this beautiful couple in question is (unfortunately yet understandably) not present in Clockwork Angel. Magnus Bane is in fact my all-time favorite book character (which one is yours?) Certainly, this book gave me some background story on him and made me learn new things about his character, but he still is more present in The Mortal Instruments nonetheless which is something that I cannot forget. (Very awe moment from this book: Remember when Magnus says \n''Black hair and blue eyes are my favorite combination.''\n That...drives you right to Alec Lightwood. It earnestly made me sigh with love and contentment.)Oh Jem, Jem, Jem...isn't he a lovely, swoon-worthy character?All beautiful art works were taken here."}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "____________________________________________\u201cOne must always be careful of books,\" said Tessa, \"and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us.\u201d ____________________________________________\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26065 FULLY STARS!\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\nYou can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!I never thought this could be that good.I had started \"City of Bones\" (the first book of The Mortal Instruments by the same author) but it didn't work for me so I thought this could be the same but I was totally wrong.This was an art,a fine peace of art.I read it in one day.Literally couldn't put the book down for a second.Everything is perfect and matches , and I really dig the lifestyle of the time before two hundred years,the classy outfits and the funny teasing.____________________________________________\u201cOnly the very weak-minded refuse to be influenced by literature and poetry.\u201d ____________________________________________The plot is beyond goodness,and it has every paranormal creature.The book is written in third person and who knows me knows that I don't like books in third person but in this one I didn't mind at all.It was perfectly build and the story fits well with characters,their personality with their actions,the style of talking with the time book is written in.Everything is in the right place.____________________________________________\u201cRemember when you tried to convince me to feed a poultry pie to the mallards in the park to see if you could breed a race of cannibal ducks?\" \"They ate it too,\" Will reminisced. \"Bloodthirsty little beasts.

While I liked Mortal Instruments, I wasn't as rabid a fan as I know many people are, so I read Clockwork Angel out of curiosity more than anything else...and I'm so glad I did!This book is spectacular, with everything I'd wanted in the TMI series and more. The magic and mysteries are compelling and Victorian London is a fantastic backdrop to this steampunk tale about a girl who discovers she has incredible powers...and an incredible past. Tessa is a vibrant, fascinating heroine and all the secondary characters, including Will and Jem and Charlotte, are engaging and sympathetic. I thought this book was much more mature than the TMI series, so I'm very much looking forward to reading the next two Infernal Devices installments. I *loved* the clockwork army and the clever way Tessa learns to use her powers to overcome her enemies. Jem is really great, but I LOVE Will. I have theories about his deep, dark secret...and I think he's being cruel to Tessa for a very good reason.

If you love The Mortal Instruments, then you will surely love this book, maybe even more than the original series itself.

Everybody was so much more \nlikable and mature.\n I really thought for a second that Tessa Gray was older than sixteen years old because she carried herself more maturely than Clary. I always thought Clary was \nselfish and bratty,\n but Tessa is the complete opposite.And Will. Oh my William Herondale. I thought Jace was swoonworthy. \nPLEASE.\n Jace doesn't even come close to how Will swiftly steals the heart of all the ladies! And maybe even a few boys.

Cassandra Clare's writing has improved immensely since City of Bones! And thank goodness, Cassandra decided to cut down the length of the chapters because I can never find a good place to stop while in the middle of one since some of her chapters can even go up to 50-70 pages or something that feels like it. xD I can't wait to \ndevour and binge\n read The Infernal Devices because Cassandra Clare got me completely hooked!

This book was so so so good. I can easily say this is one of the best books I've read in a while. It's been a stressful couple of months, but this book was a place I went to where all the stress, the unhappiness, and depression of the past couple of months didn't reach me. It was such a welcome reprieve. I could babble about how great this book made me feel for hours on hours, but I think I've made my point. This book revolves around the prehistoric setting of the mortal instruments. The mortal instrument was my first experience with Cassandra Clare, and I remember I was in love with the first 3 books. I admit there was a large gap between the 5 and 6th book, so I didn't read the 6th installment. So I had a good background with Cassandra Clare's work. That being said, I honestly don't think the two series are comparable. While the mortal instruments was a enjoyable series, this book was an incredible work of art. Tessa, the books main character, while a soft hearted and innocent young women of old time New York upbringing, is of a literature loving and poetic nature. Tessa is so relatable, perhaps that's what attracted me to her most. At some point in the book I realized she may be my favorite character in fictional novels yet. Then there's Will, the perfect love hate pretty boy who would steal your heart no matter how badly he behaves. Cassandra creates characters that are witty, lovable, and have quite the perfect dynamic. When Will says 'enterprising', he means 'morally deficient.'\" \"No, I mean enterprising,\" said Will. \"When I mean morally deficient, I say, 'Now, that's something I would have done.\"And that ladies and gentleman is will hero fake for you! The world and settings are relatively similar to the mortal instruments with the difference of the timeline. Needless to say there is something quite alluring about a secret world right under the noses of the 'mundane'. While I read the mortal instruments first, I recommend reading the infernal devices prior to picking up TMI, it acts as a prologue. A very entertaining, well written, heart wrenching prologue. While I could rant on and on, since I had read the mortal instruments, the world of shadow hunters was familiar to me. So it was like a sense of de javu, the good kind!"}, {"userName": "Janina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3455554-janina", "userReview": "To be honest, I\u2019m not quite sure how to rate this book. It wasn\u2019t all bad, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was good either. It was rather boring at times and the story dragged heavily, especially in the middle and towards the end. None of the characters has become particularly dear to me. I didn\u2019t buy the love story. However, I think I would have liked it much better if I hadn\u2019t read the Mortal Instruments series before. But the books are so similar (which was to be expected, I know, as they are set in the same world) that I couldn\u2019t help compare them to each other, and Clockwork Angel pales in comparison. The character constellation is almost the same: We have the girl who has never heard of the Shadow World before, but plays a bigger role in it than she believes. We have the boy with the dark past who refuses to let anyone come close to him. We have his best friend, seemingly the only one he cares about, who hides a secret of his own. We have the slightly bitchy girl who acts like she doesn\u2019t care about anything at all but who can fight extremely well if she has to. But Tessa doesn\u2019t have Clary\u2019s wit and strength, and her obsession with what is proper and right might be realistic for the girl of the 19th century, but it annoyed me a lot. Will doesn\u2019t hold Jace\u2019s attraction, and whereas his lines sometimes caused me to smile a little, they never made me laugh out loud. Jem is nice, but almost too nice sometimes. It seems like besides his mysterious disease, he doesn\u2019t have any faults. Still, he is my favourite character of those four. Jessamine has it in her, but I didn\u2019t particularly like her and she didn\u2019t show any signs of love for her fellow Shadowhunters as Isabelle did despite her attitude.The love story revolving around Tessa and Will didn\u2019t really capture me. Will might be snarky and mysterious, but he can also be very mean without a real reason. I\u2019m sure the motives behind his attitude are going to be revealed in future books, though. All in all, I didn\u2019t find him particularly appealing. The plot itself is fortunately different from the Mortal instruments series, but rather slow at times. Despite the 400 something pages this book has, not much happens. And what does happen is also somehow boring because, if possible, Tessa is mostly kept out of the fighting scenes or doesn't participate much in them. Deaths occur, but I didn\u2019t really feel shocked or sad about them. All things considered, the only people I really liked were a) Jem, b) Magnus Bane, who is from the TMI series and unfortunately only made a very short appearance and c) the cat (I know that is not a person, but I\u2019m a huge cat fan) they found towards the end and decided to keep. I didn\u2019t really have that high expectations for this book, but was a little disappointed nevertheless. I wish Cassandra Clare would have had the guts to write something completely new instead of hanging onto the success of her first three books. In the end, the only thing this book did for me was make me look forward to meeting the characters from TMI again, and I really hope that wasn\u2019t the author\u2019s intention. 2 stars after all, because I can\u2019t really say I liked it and struggled quite a bit to finish it.

So, granted it's not an entire book but I really needed to catch up. For those of you that didn't know about it here is the link. It's the attic scene from the Will's perspective. This just made me more excited for Clockwork Prince to come out. Goodness I am not patient these days!Merged review:Seriously  blown away  doesn't even cover it. I have to admit I had my doubts and reservations about how this book was going to turn out. We have the ever present love triangle, a girl that doesn't know her powers, and some other similar plot lines. I was thinking \"Oh no not a rehash of The Mortal Instruments!\" My worries were stupid really. I should have trusted Clare's remarkable way of telling a story. To be sure I won't make the same mistake twice and never doubt again.Tessa is an American girl coming from New York to London in search of her brother. Things apparently go wrong from the onset. Her brother, Nathaniel, isn't there and she is taken by the Dark sisters. She learns fairly quickly that there is a whole new world she didn't know about. Where terms like Downworlders, Nephilim and Shadowhunters are commonly used. Her path will cross with that of the Shadowhunters and with them she will figure what happened to her brother, but like always there is something lurking behind the scenes. Something that will change the foundation of both the mundane and magical world. When I first read the City of Bones I had thought the author could have set this in the past, and wondered why she didn't try that. Obviously she was just holding out on us! The cast of characters like always are utterly compelling and you get attached to them almost right away. I want to refrain from making too many comparisons with this series to TMI, but I'd like to point out that I admired Tessa more readily than Clary. They both are strong female characters but I just clicked with Tessa better. The action certainly did not disappoint, and is one of the reasons why I just can't get enough of these books. I'm so ready for more guts to spill. There is of course the question of love interests: the unpredictable Will and the caring Jem. Both equally gripping characters and at the moment I'm just Team Tessa cause I want things to work out well for her. The wait will be most agonizing for Clockwork Prince. Actually the word agonizing doesn't quite show the gravity how much I want to read the next book right now."}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "Some of you might know me for, well, this review. You know, my most popular, most liked one-star review of City of Bones? That one? So I guess the thesis of this review could be people change. Oh, no, not me - I still think that book was a piece of shit, because it really was. I mean Cassandra Clare. As in she got better at writing.The BIG thing that shocked me here was how incredibly addicting this was. Like, I tore apart City of Bones, but kind of the main thing about that book was that it was really boring. I took over six months to read that book. This book, on the other hand was better than entertaining - it was super compelling. I think it\u2019s chiefly because - if you have ever read a single one of my reviews you know this is coming - the character work and development, which is just so so so much better than anything in the Mortal Instruments. Tessa\u2019s conflict is about whether or not she is human, and what that should mean, and it is so quality. And speaking of the idea of monsters vs. humans, the portrayal of downworlders suddenly doesn\u2019t suck. While Rafael and Magnus are both sympathetic characters in the Mortal Instruments, I think the portrayal of Camille - I love her, by the way - goes further than subverting: it subtly but clearly critiques the Shadowhunter idea that Downworlders are lesser. While the ending of this book is fucking heartbreaking and made me want to punch a certain someone in the face, it also does something I did not expect - it sees Will\u2019s bigotry and it criticizes him for it by putting us into Tessa\u2019s head as she experiences t. There is also a very compelling cast of side characters, including:\u27bdCharlotte - the badass lady mentor Tessa needed.\u27bdHenry - a mess who has never done anything wrong in his life.\u27bdJessamine - girl hate but like, compelling and subversive. \u27bdSophie - my girlfriend, my wife, I would die for her, an iconI kind of intoned girl hate in this, so let\u2019s talk about the narrative implications of girl hate and why this book actually did really well. Jessamine comes close to being a very stereotypical character, but she\u2019s far beyond that - she\u2019s a character who has very clearly been socialized into believing in her own superiority for not fighting, and now firmly believes it. The reason this character works is because she is highly motivated. The reason this plotline works is because there are two seperate really badass women in here, both of whom express femininity in really different ways. There\u2019s also the fact that Tessa is dealing with her own internalized misogyny, but the narrative still clearly decries what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s a super hard dynamic to pull off but yes. Also, let\u2019s talk about this love triangle. I literally don\u2019t think I have ever been this invested in a love triangle just ending up with them all dating each other. I also am somewhat convinced that is exactly the dynamic Cassandra Clare was going for, because like\u2026 it is really really there. I was rooting for The Three Love Triangle People All Dating Each Other Endgame up until the ending and then Will... u Trash Man.... #justiceforTessa2k18And because someone will someday ask on my review, if I actually had to pick a team - and I am still very opposed to picking a team - Jem is a better person than Will will ever be. I highly empathize with Will - even though I am currently so mad at him - but Jem has never done a thing wrong in his life and is good. In summary:\u27bdJem - Kind Musician Man, an overall good\u27bdWill - trash man, basically only likes the two people he\u2019s simultaneously datingBut simultaneously\u2026 they\u2019re both super interesting characters. I love the direction this series is going.Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were still cheesy moments. But overall, this was so compelling and fun. A Quality Read. Thank you to The Girlfriend for forcing me to read it.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "What a load of bloody melodrama. This book ought to be sung in operatic fashion by a cast of three in a slightly seedy theatre in Brooklyn. It's the sort of book that's dreadfully self-important but really, when you think about it, nothing happens: a few people appear, some technology gets destroyed, two things kiss and stuff, and between all that is a metric ton of filler. Listen, I'm not going to lie and say I didn't kind of enjoy it. This was my third attempt at reading this, and I guess third time's a charm. I got through it in two and a half days, and two of those days were spent mostly at work and doing other things. It's not something you need to funnel a lot of time into and it's not something that requires a great deal of thought. All of the deep talk about humanity and love and family and quoting from books I never intend to read is just a smokescreen to disguise that this book is thin, its characters are thin, its mythology is particularly thin, and even some obvious fanservice in the form of Magnus Bane couldn't spice it up.It's not a bad book; it's not a good book, either. The problem with Cassandra Clare is that she creates great side characters and shite main characters. Tessa and Will are straight-up shite. They're bad people and absolutely tone deaf to what's going on around them, even when it's endangering the lives of the people they \"care about\". Those air quotes are for real. Neither of them are particularly interested anything other than each other's smell. They're like dogs at the park; the leaves and the trees and the brisk wind is cool and everything but when there's another dog in a ten-foot radius, oh-ho. Forget comfortable lead walking. Actually, just say goodbye to that dog. Nothing else matters.I love Jem, but that's the problem, isn't it? He's a side character and yet he's so much more more worthy of being a protagonist than Tessa. I want to follow Jem. I want to know Jem. But instead we're trailing along on Tessa's skirts, watching her waffle from room to room of this unnecessarily massive Institute, ruin plans, beg for Will's attention, and generally oscillate around the library while everyone else does the work. I don't expect Tessa to be Xena, because she's not been trained in combat, but if she isn't trained, don't take her on a mission into a vampire nest. Jesus Christ, how have these Shadowhunters survived so long if they're so dense? There's something almost creepy about this fad of asshole love interests; I know it started long ago, with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, experiencing a Renaissance with Bedward, and soaring to unprecedented heights in anything written by Cassandra Clare. I mean it - anything. There's probably an asshole love interest on her shopping list. There's probably one written into the alphabet magnets on her fridge. Will is a nasty piece of shit, and he's rewarded for that by having so many people around him who love him. Someone like Will, who victim-blames, who taunts women, who throws Tessa's confidence and her affection back in her face, doesn't deserve to be surrounded by people who are constantly forgiving him. I know Clare well enough to be certain that there's some sort of \"I push people away to protect them\" backstory buried under all of this, but that's not enough. Will is simply a nasty bastard with a piss-poor attitude.I think my biggest problem with this book is that it's just sort of limp. The setting felt sort of half-hearted, a kind of par-boiled vision of stereotyped London. At one point Jem says to Tessa, \"You're thinking, If they call this damp nastiness summer, what must winter be like? You'd be surprised. Winter's actually much the same.\" I live on the east coast of Scotland. This summer I got sunburnt three times and lay out in a tank top in the park, sunbathing with the dogs. I am much farther north than London, which is in the south of England, and experiences a warm temperate summer and mild springs and autumns. The rainiest months in the UK are the winter months, and April and July. Every few years the dryness in southern England causes a hosepipe ban. So fine, set your book outside of America. That's cool. I'm sick of books about New York. But for god's sake, ask. Read a few blogs. Ask the people who live there what's it's like. \"It rains in Britain\". Yeah, it rains in the desert too. Your setting is a sad shoehorn for mean boys and bland girls. This whole Shadowhunter thread just rubs me up the wrong way. I don't like Shadowhunter culture, politics, or mythology. I don't like the way the Shadowhunters mock the Silent Brothers, who are also Shadowhunters but apparently undeserving of respect because they're ugly; I don't like the way the Shadowhunters profess to protect humans but treat them like animals and slap them with a label as demeaning as \"mundanes\"; I don't like the way they use Downworlders, but how this is excused by the narrative, which tells us that the relationship is edgy between the Clave and Downworlders, but it's fine because the Shadowhunters only hunt the Downworlders whom the narrative dubs \"evil\" and stroke the ego of those it proclaims \"good\". No grey area there, then! As long as we only kill the \"bad guys\" and have sex with the \"good guys\" (in secret), then it's not about power and control and it's not a privileged few creating a dichotomy out of those they deem less worthy than them. Right? RIGHT?I'm assuming that this is to swiftly avoid the Shadowhunters being labelled problematic, but it's not the way they use Downworlders that makes them so fucked up. It's the small things, like Jessamine being demonized for not wanting to hunt monsters, the othering of the Silent Brothers, the amount of money that is poured into maintaining the absolutely massive Institutes that house about five Shadowhunters each. The Shadowhunters wonder why demons and warlocks and vampires hate them, and maybe it's not because they hunt them, but because they're so corrupt. Even things we're supposed to think of as charitable, like Sophie and Thomas and Agatha being employed at the Institute, is fucked up. The Shadowhunters employing those people is as good as signing their death warrants. How can they possibly justify swanning around and calling humans \"mundanes\", then inviting them into their home to work for them, then leaving them to die in the name of an exclusive creed that they're not allowed membership of. How dare the Shadowhunters drag human Sophie, Agatha and Thomas into their war? And of course, after the clockwork (fucking steampunk. Ugh) creatures attack the Institute, all of our precious Shadowhunters are alive without a scratch, and only the humans who they looked down upon died. The Shadowhunters have no connection to the outside world - they exist inside a glass case of superiority, supposedly protecting humans that they attack with slurs and have no interactions with. Even in the Mortal Instruments, it was said that Jace, Alec and Isabelle had only met a handful of people their own age, and they never ever mixed with humans. What sort of protectors are they, if the thing they're protecting is looked at with such disgust? Why are the Shadowhunters even doing this job? For their own satisfaction? It's got nothing to do with protecting the world. It's about bloodlust, because they don't care a whit about the everyday \"mundane\" on the street, unless it's to laugh about their deaths or have sex with them. God, fuck the Shadowhunters. What dicks."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51318038-maggie", "userReview": "It's not a long life, killing demons; one tends to die young, and then they burn your body\u2014dust to dust, in the literal sense. And then we vanish into the shadows of history, nary a mark on the page of a mundane book to remind the world that once we existed at all.\n\nIt's really hard for me to review a book everyone loved and have high expectations but then end up not even liking it because maybe your expectations were too high, not met, or you were just bored. In my case, it was all. Expectations were too high and not met and I was bored throughout the whole novel. I have heard so much of this series, Cassandra Clare herself, and about her Mortal Instruments series. Like, I have a friend who is literally Malec trash and always brings up the show and the new season and everything TMI and I can't relate. I'm quite worried because this is the first book and most people love it from here and continue on loving it only to be torn apart because the third book is an emotional and tear jerker one? Well, if the 2nd book is better and the 3rd even better and is really emotional, I sure hope I at least shed one tear because if I don't I will feel like an emotionless bitch for the rest of my life.There's not much to say about this that hasn't been said. Do I really have to explain what this is about? I mean, I always do so why not... Clockwork Angel, book number one in Cassandra Clare's trilogy that is supposed to make girls fangirl over the male protagonist and love him and this girl because they're pretty together. Also, a book that involves demon killers and supernatural creatures like vampires and warlocks. I hate myself too don't worry.Clockwork Angel is the prequel to Cassie's The Mortal Instruments series but I have heard it doesn't matter what order you read them in. I hear this one is much more enjoyable in many ways and the characters are a lot better, and I also am aware that this book was published after 3?4? books of the TMI series so it shouldn't matter. We have our female protagonist but there's also a male protagonist, shifting perspectives in the same page. Tessa Gray is descended into London's dark supernatural world which she is not familiar with, especially because she is an American lost in London looking for her missing brother that was supposed to meet up with her. Tessa didn't get lost, but instead, she was captured and told she was gonna be married to someone she doesn't even know. Then she meets a mysterious and oh so good looking Will Herondale who ends up saving her and taking her to the Institute, where she meets others like Will and end up helping her. Tessa later learns a little more about her allies, Shadowhunters, who basically hunt and kill demons because of the special abilities they carry with them. Not only does Tessa meet Will but she also meets people that she grows close to, including Will's best friend who is almost like a brother, Jem, who ends up being another attraction for Tessa. As they all learn about each other and Tessa learns more about the Underworld she is in, she finds out that she herself is similar to them but different in a way. Up against the Pandemonium Club, Tessa and her friends can do nothing but work together to stop the plan of the Club.First thing's first: I was bored reading this. I also didn't even know what the hell the book really was about until 200 pages or something which is pretty sad because normally a reader knows what she or he is reading when they're stating the book up until page 50 or something. No, but really, even when the description isn't read. Being one of those people that ended up not even liking the first book in a trilogy that is much much better than the spin-off series, I can already tell I will not be the biggest fan of Cassie and the rest of her books. I really want to read her series even if I don't like them, I just want to get them over with the move on to Lady Midnight and her other upcoming books. Also, when is Cassandra gonna write a book that does not involve the Shadowhunters world? I know she wrote a middle-grade book (actually she co-wrote is) like I promise I'm not hating on her. I actually don't hate on any authors and don't hate on their writing or anything, but I was just wondering. If someone knows please let me know, I would be very interested. I'm not even the biggest fan of Paranormal books, even if it's paranormal and fantasy together.I was really hoping I was gonna enjoy this. I literally expected to love it and dive into the next book but I really am not. I own the trilogy which was dumb of me to do because now I gotta find something else to read (which is hard for me for some stupid reason) or read book 2 and then 3. I really want to get something out of the way. I ship Jem and Tessa and I just wanna cry because I already know what happens in the end. Let me clarify that: I don't know what happens actually, I didn't spoil myself, but I did spoil myself (thanks to those people who added them in their updates and reviews without marking spoilers or warnings :) I appreciate you) with who Tessa ends up with and what happens to Will and Jem and I just wanna cry. I still think Jem will own my heart a little more than Will because currently, I don't hate Will, but I don't like him, at all. I didn't find him swoon-worthy or attractive in any way and he didn't steal my heart like he has stolen others. I don't ship him and Tessa like I said and even though I know there will be some character development in all characters in the next book, I can't help but have hope in Jem. Not Jessa, but just Jem. Please do not spoil it for me. This book got an extra star just because of Jem and some other characters like Charlotte, Henry, Magnus, and Sophie. They were all understanding characters and their personalities were acceptable, unlike the others. The reason for the low rating is because I was bored and got tired of the whole plot and point of the book. I didn't even understand it until I got to the second half and again, like I said, I was just so fucking bored. I have a friend named Amber and this one time we started talking and she told me she loves TMI series and I was happy for her because she loves it while others didn't like it as much but she didn't care and she ended up loving this one as well so I thought I was gonna love it as well (especially because Amber and I don't share many similar opinions about books but that's okay because we're all a community and think differently) and if she loved it, I figured I would love it. I was obviously wrong, sorry Amber. I didn't feel any emotion towards any characters and I just wanted to punch all the characters I found annoying which included Tessa, Will, Jessie (wtf is her name I forgot already), Mrs. Black and Mrs. Dark, Nathaniel, and the dude at the end who was killed by Will (I forgot his name sorry).So, there was nothing I liked about this expect for like 4 characters and that's why this is getting 2 stars. 4 characters I loved. That's all. There was nothing else. I haven't read TMI, but I know that Clary tries finding out stuff about the Shadowhunters and I know she is annoying but hear me out: She tries. Tessa, on the other hand, didn't try anything. I felt like she was an interruption and distraction to everyone, including Will, who I found confused and rude, and I just didn't care about Tessa and what she did. I was quite glad about the ending but then I wasn't. The book does end on a cliffhanger and I want to know what happens next, but I'm not so eager to find out. I don't want to go into the book and expect many things again and just, try to care about Tessa and feel something for Will.Another complaint I have is how Cassie wrote this. It's in 3rd person and although I'm not the biggest fan of it, I don't mind it. It usually depends on how the author writes it and how the reader reads it, but I didn't enjoy reading it and I didn't enjoy her writing either. We start off with Will and Jem and then we have Tessa and then Will again and then Charlotte and Henry and then Will and Jem and it just changed over and over again. Not to mention how long the chapters were, or they felt so long, was also another thing that bugged me. What I wish she did instead make the perspectives longer and when it was time to switch, it would be another chapter. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the book had 50+ chapters because there are many books out there that are fantasy, paranormal, and even contemporary that have more than 50 chapters and are shorter than this book. No one's chapters were interesting except for Charlotte's. Her chapters were the most enjoyable out of all because she knew some things no one else knew and I enjoyed finding those things out only to later find out the ones who didn't know found out. Wow I make so much sense.I know this series has some similarities to TMI. An example is Clary and Tessa: there the special snowflakes who know nothing about the Underworld and Shadowhunters and don't know about their special abilities until later and fall the boy they meet and blah blah blah. Will and Jace are both assholes to the girls in the beginning (Will was sarcastic and an asshole to Tessa at times when the next thing you know he's kissing her lol what) and I've read some of City of Bones and, forgive me, but I watched the movie and he was an asshole to her at first and was like \"who do you think you are\" and then was \"I love you\" and I'm like \"tf you doing?\" and I don't know man I hate those couples/guys. They're assholes to the girl and then they're over here thinking about them because they're the one good thing in their life and tend to change their lives in the best and worst way and I'm just left pissed because they had such a shitty attitude in the beginning. UNLIKE WILL, Jem was sweet and nice to Tessa right when he saw her and even offered to answer any questions she had because as we learn a little about Tessa, she's curious about a lot of things and asks a lot of questions and Will does not have the time or patience to answer them because he's the mysterious and bad English boy.I'm gonna TRY and finish this trilogy soon, as soon as I can, and start TMI and see how different and similar they are because I really want to read this and even if I don't enjoy it, I want to find out a little more about the Shadowhunter world and all the creatures like the vampires, werewolves, warlocks, mundane, and even the humans in this world. I skimmed a lot reading this because the story was still boring and nothing cool or interesting or amazing or shocking was happening or even happened, and it got the point where I wanted to give up on it but didn't. It was dragging a lot and giving a lot of info dumps and the history of it was got to the point where I was tired of holding this big book in my small hands and I just turned a lot of pages, looking for quotes and names of people I actually liked just to read about them."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42163117-emma", "userReview": "I think y\u2019all know at this point that I am absolute trash for all of the shadowhunters books so if you missed my livetweet reread here are the collected highlights and my definitive list of Opinions:\u25aa\ufe0fthe automatons are creepy as FUCK and I\u2019m honestly surprised I didn\u2019t have nightmares about them\u25aa\ufe0fWill is overdramatic as HELL but I relate\u25aa\ufe0f\u201cdo you often sleep tied to the bed?\u201d this is some serious kink exposure Will\u25aa\ufe0fTessa and Will nerd out over books together sdfjdsaldfj\u25aa\ufe0fCHARLOTTE BRANWELL IS MY NEW FAVORITE CHARACTER AND I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I DIDN\u2019T STAN HER THIS MUCH\u25aa\ufe0f\u201cone must always be careful of books and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us\u201d I know this quote is cheesy but it\u2019s some good fucking cheese\u25aa\ufe0fme thinking about Jem fucking Carstairs serenading me on his violin:\u25aa\ufe0f\u201cthere\u2019s always demon pox\u201d\u25aa\ufe0fI am the first to admit that I am the most uncoordinated person I know and I would never have the skills to fight anyone BUT if I had to kill a demon I would absolutely want to do it using Jessamine\u2019s parasol\u25aa\ufe0f\u201cYou are as terrifying as you are wonderful, my dear.\u201d HENRY AND CHARLOTTE ARE THE PUREST SHIP\u25aa\ufe0fMAGNUS BANE WAS THE FIRST BISEXUAL CHARACTER I EVER READ ABOUT AND I LOVE HIM\u25aa\ufe0fI will forever be bitter that CC didn\u2019t resolve the love triangle by making herongraystairs canonthat is all.---------------edit: I am utter trash for this series so I'm tweeting updates on my reread here if y'all are interestedtime to find out if will herondale is still as hot as I remember him being"}, {"userName": "Reader-ramble", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9590328-reader-ramble", "userReview": "Cassie Clare. We meet again.I apparently have gained a following because of these reviews, and they have convinced me to use my analytical powers on The Infernal Devices series. You could say I'm easily swayed because I lack dignity. But this is really just too much fun. It's so much fun, I need to be stroking a cat.First, the usual disclaimer. This review contains spoilers, griping, whining, over thinking, and general ranting. Trolls need not apply.Let's get started.Ladies and gents. Gather 'round. I'm about to tear into Cassandra Clare's 19th century version of The Mortal Instruments. I present to you:The Mary Sue, Tessa Gray! (Rhymes with Clary Fray.) Tessa is a magical orphan girl from across the sea. She can shape shift you see, which isn't really a stretch for a character with almost no personality. Sure, Tessa is a really watered down version of Clary. She's just self-absorbed and judgmental enough to allow me to draw the comparison, but otherwise I could insert just about anyone in her position. She doesn't think she's pretty. Check. She likes books. Check. All the boys fall in wuve with her. Check. She's supposed to be smart, but really isn't. Check.How hard was it for Clare to round out this girl. I mean, it's only the fourth book she's written. Tessa couldn't be a Georgia peach who's family lost everything during the Civil War when she was just a babe? She couldn't be a textiles factory worker who used to prop her book up on the loom while she worked? (This was actually pretty common at the time.) She couldn't be the daughter of an insightful inventor who used to dream of flying? Come on! If you're going for Steampunk, Clare, go for it! Tessa should have been a goggle clad shape shifting, grease monkey. Her and Henry could have gotten their nerd on. But no. Her writer lacks the creativity to make anything remotely cool and fun.Speaking of shape shifting. Tessa's special shape shifting ability allows her to change into anyone she wants as long as she has an object they owned. She gains their memories and thoughts, and if they died, she sees how and feels it. If the person is a Down-worlder, she gains their abilities and attributes. At one point, she turns into Camille - a vampire - at one point, and her heart stops beating. Sounds pretty cool and useful, right? Well, here is the thing with Clare's books if you aren't already familiar. If it makes sense, she doesn't use it. Nope. To easy and not romantic enough. Tessa's ability would be really useful in combat, but instead it's a deus ex machina. Clare only has Tessa use her shape shifting to move the story forward. The rest of the time it sits on the side.Oh, now the fun part. Do you remember the whole Boadicea thing? How Tessa thought she couldn't be a fighter because she was a woman, but she could fight back because it's in her heart? I know, right! I'm laughing to keep from crying. Will tells Tessa there was this badass warrior chick who gave the Romans hell named Boadicea. (Usually spelled Boudica. I know about her because I saw a documentary on her. She was badass. And so were her daughters.) So, Tessa tries to emulate Boadicea by \"killing\" herself so the baddie can't have her. She fakes it using her shape shifting because apparently, when someone dies nice and bloody, she gets covered in it. Whatever. There was lots of blood, but the bad guy didn't check for a wound. The baddie invents robots and he falls for a trick from a girl who was stupid enough to scream in a room full of vampires. Yes, this girl, who trusted her philandering older brother. Oy vey.Next up, William \"the Scoundrel\" Herondale! Will, as everyone calls him, is really just Jackass Jace with the dial cranked to 11. He's the kind of guy who will be dead in a ditch at 19. You know, reckless, rude, and utterly inappropriate. It's supposed to be the Victorian era, and he's making open sexual advances toward Tessa. These are the kind of advances that even a modern woman would have kneed him in the balls over. He doesn't wear a hat or waistcoat or cravat, so he's basically running around half naked. He treats everyone like crap. Do I really need to go on?Oh, and all the fan girls get hot and horny over him. He's an insensitive, self centered asshole and girls think that's hot. Let me guess, that means he's damaged and only needs love to make him a better person. If that wasn't one of the most popular myths these books portray. Feh. He needs thumped, plain and simple. I can't believe Tessa is even thinking about hooking up with the guy.Now for James/Jian/Jem Carstairs. This half-Chinese sweetie is just a gentleman. I'm seriously shocked that Clare can even write a character like him. He's so nice. He even saves a cat. Literally. When Tessa is feeling down, he just talks to her. He's the kind of boy you bring home to your mom.And then there's the venom addiction. Yeah, Clare totally ruined Jem. She couldn't have him be some nice kid. It's like that Simon/Vampire thing all over again. In a nutshell, Jem was tortured by a demon and his parents were forced to watch. By the time he was saved, his body was addicted to the venom. If they try to wean him off it, the withdrawal is bad enough to kill him. So he has to continue to take it or he dies. Flip side, the stuff is killing him. It also keeps his hair and eyes silver. Even then, he's still a way better person than Will. Hands down. There isn't even a contest.But there is something that Clare uses Jem for that I don't like; to make excuses for Will. Jem is Will's battle buddy. They're buds and watch each other's back. Jem tries to explain Will's appalling behavior to Tessa, saying that there is more to him than she thinks. The problem with this is that it ends up being hot air to make Will look deeper than he is. When Will enters a scene, all this \"oh, but he's damaged\" talk flies out the window on a fart. Jem was tortured and he's dying, and he's an absolute doll. Will has no excuses.Now it's time for the parasol twirlin' Jassamine Lovelace. She's the biggest waste of a strong female character. She had the potential to go from opinionated Lady full of spunk, to Tessa's awesome-sauce gal pal. But that isn't how Clare works. Once she thought that Jess would turn out to be \"better\" than Tessa, she turned her into someone so selfish she would leave a comrade behind. I was shocked because it didn't fit with the characterization that Clare had set up for her.There's this dollhouse scene where Jess shows Tessa her dollhouse replica of the house she grew up in. She even had dolls of her mother, father, little brother, and her. She tells Tessa that her house burned down with them in it, and it's the only thing left of them and her old life. She tells Tessa that sometimes she imagines that they wake up, go about their day, and then go to bed all safe. Nothing bad ever happens to them. No Shadow-hunter business and no fire. They're perfectly normal. I imagined this very sad teenage girl running her fingers over everything in that house as she tried to explain why she didn't want to be a Shadow-hunter. Why she didn't want a life of fear that you or the ones you love won't come back. Why she didn't want to deal with death and blood.But here is why I hate Clare's writing. She turned Jessamine into such a bitch that her desire to be married and a mother without being a \"warrior\" is unacceptable in her world. I mean, Jess is part angel. Why should she want anything else? Why would she want to be mundane? They're worse than Down-worlders. Clare writes her Nephilim like they're perfect, but I can't blame Jess for wanting out. It would be a horrible life to live.There's more characters: Charlotte, who is 23 and not a very good leader; Henry, who can't get any of his inventions to work right; Sophie, the poor maid who can't catch a break; Agatha, the cook; Thomas, Will's cast-aside childhood pal; but they aren't really worth speaking about. And the villain, I'll get to him when I get into world-building.Which I'm starting, now.There is nothing like trying to make sense of Cassandra Clare's world. There are so many gaping holes, that I've mostly given up. Mostly.First, I'm going to start with the gun thing. Yes. Shadow-hunters don't use guns because supposedly the runes they tried to scratch into the weapon and bullets keeps it from firing, and no one knows why.I would believe it if she wasn't the queen of convenient. From what I know, not all the weapons are inscribed with runes. I mean, she'll describe the curve of Will's neck, but not every weapon. We know some of them are made of electrum. Why not electrum bullets?Now, I'd understand if they didn't like using them because guns are loud and they would be afraid to hit an innocent bystander. When they strive for secrecy, there's no glamour in the world that would cover up an accidental bullet wound to the head. But wouldn't they want to keep a couple around. Maybe a Colt Peacemaker and a lever action Springfield. I mean, those would come in pretty handy when they bad guy is a \nmundane\n. And he's packing his own heat.Oh, and what about the automatons? Those wanna-be Steampunk cyborgs. I would have at least tried a shotgun loaded with a slug on one. From some of the appendages those things were given, why would anyone want to get close? But Clare has to have all her Shadow-hunters carry weapons on the archaic side of the scale. And she doesn't even describe them right. She says Will has straps crossing his chest. That is called a bandolier. Clare will describe the parts of a dress (and not even accurately), but she doesn't get into the finer points of melee weapons even though all her characters are warriors. Look at Jem's cane-sword-thing. She describes it like a blade shoots out of the end, but cane swords were really popular in the 19th century, so that seems more likely. He could use the cane part to block and then attack with the blade.Damn it. I started thinking with logic again. Give me a moment.Then there is her version of Victorian London.First, let's start with the fact that the fog was so thick and toxic that you could chew it and it killed hundreds. New York was no picnic at at time, but Tessa probably would have choked on it. Clare describes it like it's some coal dust and mist.Second, the characters act like it's the 21st century and not the 19th. They were way too informal and ran around without hats all the time.In fact, most of what Clare puts about \"her\" London is like she was writing a book report. It doesn't flow well at all. She lacks in the social politics of the time. Tessa is American in 19th century Britain, and a Down-worlder no less. She would constantly be regarded as a sub-human by British Shadow-hunters. They acknowledge she's a Down-worlder, but not the fact that she's a barbaric American.And I'm not even going to get started on Will kissing Tessa and implying that she should give him her virtue because she probably can't have kids since she's a warlock. (I mean, seriously. How do girls think that's hot?)Then there's Clare's writing. It never fails in giving me entertainment. She's laid off the similes a bit, but not enough to matter. There are still zingers, but this time I wrote down all the ones I cared to involving glass. Yes, glass. I swear she has a fetish for it.\n\"... eyes like glass.\" (p.37)\"... a noise like cracking glass.\" (p. 39)\"... a gaze as sharp as glass.\" (p. 72)\"... like snow sticking to a dark glass pane of a window.\" (p. 172)\"... as if through a pane of glass.\" (p. 212)\"... it sounded like shattering glass.\" (p. 248)\"Will's eyes were slivers of blue glass.\" (p. 304)\"... like thin stems of glass against her skin.\" (p. 359)Remember, those are the ones I wrote down. There are a lot more.Clare's similes really are the one of the true weaknesses in her writing. Even when she uses a strong active verb, she tacks on a simile at the end like no one will understand what she's talking about. But that's when she uses a strong active verb that she hasn't abused. Everything still \"gleams, \"glints,\" \"glimmers,\" \"shines,\" and \"shimmers\" when it isn't \"blue,\" \"silver,\" \"white,\" \"black,\" \"pale,\" \"icy,\" or \"gold.\"All these weaknesses are apparent in Clare's obsession with appearance. In scenes where emotional description should take precedence, Tessa physically looks at people instead of trying to understand the conversation on an emotional level. Take these lines from when she's talking with Jem on Blackfriar Bridge:\n\"Tessa let herself stare at him, marveling a little at his strange beauty in the moonlight. He was all silver and ashes, not like Will's strong colors of blue and black and gold.\" (p.315)Jem is trying to have an intimate moment with her, and all Tessa can think about is his coloring in the moonlight versus Will's. Not about how much of nice person he is because he was willing to share his favorite place with her. Yeah, I really wanted to smack Tessa.Clare's heroines are so superficial I don't know how these girls could be considered strong female characters. Whenever she gets remotely close to writing a female character that is worth something (Izzy, Jess), she ruins them. She pushes their heroic actions to the background or covers it up with abhorrent and stereotypical behavior so that her intended \"strong\" female character can remain the Mary Sue. She doesn't treat her characters like people. She manipulates them to fit her needs first.Well, my word count is almost up. I can't go into a tireless rant about how this book is unintentionally ironic most of the time with all these profound things Jem or another character floating in the background says that Clare can't apply or covers up. But what I can do is leave you with my favorite one. This is from when the Shadow-hunters surrounded the vampire Axel DeQuincy and the rest of his ilk that survived. I now give you his tirade in response to the Shadow-hunters bringing up the Accords:\n\"Equal? You don't know what the word means. You cannot let go of your own conviction, let go of your belief in your inherent superiority, for long enough to even consider what it would mean. (p. 254)So true, and he was a bad guy.Till next time!Liked this and want more?\nThe Original Mortal Instruments Trilogy\nCity of BonesCity of AshesCity of Glass\nThe Infernal Devices\nClockwork Prince"}, {"userName": "Ashley Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3764614-ashley-brooks", "userReview": "I now understand the Will Herondale hype."}, {"userName": "\u2728    jamieson   \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706640-jamieson", "userReview": "[curse (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44125660-beth", "userReview": "I literally cannot give anything less than 5 stars for this book, this is my all time favourite series and I'm SO happy to be re-reading it.\"It is as great a thing to love as it is to be loved. Love is not something that can be wasted.So, as we all know this was a re-read for me. I've never wrote a review for this, so this is all fresh and new. I'm so excited to write this and have been wanting to do so for a long long time! I can finally do so now. I was so scared to re-read this, I thought maybe I'd hyped this up and it was all an illusion. It wasn't! It was even better than what I remembered. It was also so good, because I had forgot SO much about this series. In particular the characters I had previously become attached to previously.Tessa will always remain one of my favourite female role characters. I love her references and that she wants to do something to help. I love her references and that she is forever quoting books. Her relationships with the whole \"family\" and how she just becomes so brave and isn't afraid to say how she feels. At the beginning she was so timid and couldn't believe that women were capable to do things men are able to do. That she was so offended that Camille spoke of her relationship with Magnus so casually had me howling! Over time she began to understand and wanted to become a strong and powerful woman like Boudicca. I fell in love all over again with Will, I swooned far too much once again! His sarcasm was on point! \"Did you? I must of forgotten, how dreadful.\" I just can't cope with everything that he does, I know why he does it, but still it really does break my heart. It feels as though he doesn't seem worthy of Tessa and to be loved. I WILL LOVE YOU! I love how dedicated he is to his Shadowhunting world, and that he will do anything for Jem. His moment with Thomas in the end chapters really struck a nerve and it was so upsetting! I can't wait to see him progress in the next books!Now I can freely admit that when I first read Clockwork Angel I just cast Jem aside, when I re-read this, I honestly fell so hard for him. He was so loving, and always knew what to do and how to act in certain situations. I never thought I'd swoon over Jem, but here I am. \"This is your true self, Tessa. This power is who you are. Whoever loves you now - and you must love yourself - will love the truth of you.\" I feel like in this book Jem is the goodness that Tessa needs, he is so gentle and so kind.I hate to say this, but I admit how much I forgot about Sophie. I know I know! I can't believe it! I adored her in this book. I think that Sophie is someone you would love to have as a friend, she may only be a \"mundane\" but she will do anything for anyone, I enjoyed her relationship with Tessa. She takes no nonsense from Will, however when Gabriel tries to do so, she has none of it! So sassy! I love her!Jessamine is honestly such a bitch. I like her don't get me wrong... but I do feel sorry for her! I love how she just doesn't give a shit, however sometimes I felt a bit angry towards her and how she spoke to others.Oh my god. Charlotte and Henry I cannot cope. How adorable are they?! I love how mothering Charlotte is and how awkward Henry is. They're both so lovely! I can't wait to see more of them!I'm going to clutter all of these together: Nate, Mortmain and De Quincy the people you love to hate. When I say hate, I honestly hated Nate so much. Just everything about him makes my skin crawl, this is what I want in a book. I love it when a book can make me feel so much emotion to characters. So what did I love?EVERYTHING But in particular...- Will of course...- Sophies sass- Jems quotes- Wills Sarcasm- All of the action- How clever things came together!What I didn't like?- The only thing I wanted was more Magnus, buuuuuuuuuuuut I can wait!If you can't already tell, I'm so happy I re-read the first book! I love this series and I'm so excited to move onto Clockwork Prince. Until then, I will just swoon away!All Reviews:Clockwork Angel - 5 StarsClockwork Prince - 5 Stars!Clockwork Princess  - 5 Stars!The Infernal Devices (Manga) Reviews:Clockwork Angel - 5 StarsClockwork Prince - 5 StarsClockwork Princess - 5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26402455-sana", "userReview": "Please read Maggie's amazing review. She sums up whatever I have to say about this book, perfectly. Listen guys, I tried. I seriously tried!!!! But this was so slow and boring for me, I just couldn't get into it no matter how hard I tried to make myself like it. I was originally going to give this one star, but at times it was a little fast paced and action packed. Since I already read TMI before this series, the whole info. about Shadowhunters and stuff bored me and I really couldn't find myself caring about any of it. P.S I really hate Will *runs away before y'all come after me with dem pitchforks and knives*---guys please pray i hate this bc i want to make this hoe crybut seriously tho, i hope i love this"}, {"userName": "Sandra ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9752625-sandra", "userReview": "[And you know when the angel suddenly came to life to protect her?

It played out exactly how I expected it to after having read The Mortal Instruments series and understanding how Cassandra Clare plots her stories and writes her characters. At times it was a bit predictable and the characters fit into their tropes. I liked Jem because he felt a bit more fresh; I don't understand the love for Will at all. He and Jessamine are basically 1800's versions of Jace & Isabelle from TMI, which was a bit annoying. I'm intrigued to find out Tessa's deal, but I don't have an urgency to read the rest of the series immediately. At the end of the day, it's a fun read that introduces you to a new time & place in the Shadowhunter world. 3 stars"}], "description": "In a time when Shadowhunters are barely winning the fight against the forces of darkness, one battle will change the course of history forever.
