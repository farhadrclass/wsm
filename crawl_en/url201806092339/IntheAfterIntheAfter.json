Looks like it must be a negative review, right? In this case, though, this isn't that much of a negative review. Rather, these are the reasons why I didn't love this book and the reasons why I think a whole bunch of other people probably will. So...There's this book you might have heard about lately. It's called The 5th Wave. I know, I know, they've been so quiet about it, really toned down the promotion to about a thousand rotating banner ads on goodreads. So, maybe you haven't heard of it. Well, I LOVED this book. For a whole bunch of reasons that you can find elsewhere if you so wish. However, as more and more people find their way towards it after the book's release date in early May, it's becoming apparent that some people really didn't like it.Just kidding. You know me, I never waste an opportunity to drop a couple of gifs.But because I like to ponder and philosophise on other people's reading habits and tastes and the big questions like \"what is it about this book that made us view it so differently?\", \"If a book falls off my shelf while I'm not in the room - does it make a sound? And, more importantly, is it weird to kiss it better when I get home?\", \"Is there life after series completion?\", \"Are we human or are we reader?\" and \"To read or to read longer?\" Perhaps I shall never know the answers. But, after reading this book, I think there's a good chance that the less you liked The 5th Wave, the more you will like In the After.\u201cI found Baby shortly after the world failed, when I still believed things would return to normal. I no longer hold that hope. Nothing this broken can ever be fixed.\u201dThe reason I liked The 5th Wave and this one not so much is because I'm not the biggest fan of traditional science fiction. I feel a lack of connection with the characters and a lack of sympathy for their situation. Yancey's tale is not about aliens, but humanity. A lot of it is made up of flashbacks of the characters' lives, building up a gradual picture of who they are, why they continue to fight in a world where hope is almost non-existent, and what makes them survive against the odds. In the After, on the other hand, is an action-packed story that drops us right into the center of the action straight away. No time is wasted on pretty words, build-up and lengthy flashbacks (though we do get a few, obviously, to explain some of what happened). The aliens are not cleverly-disguised as humans, using distrust as a weapon, these creatures are the old kind. Monstrous, rabid, driven by a crazed desire for human flesh... perfect for fans of what I keep calling traditional sci-fi because I don't know how else to explain it. However, this is part of where the book starts to lose me and why Yancey's approach will always appeal to me more. Because: what is it that separates these creatures from zombies or vampires or \"insert other evil supernatural creature here\"? Nothing that I can see. But if you like your villains full-stop-totally-nasty, then step this way.Much of the basic story is similar to the one in The 5th Wave. Aliens attack, female protagonist must fend for herself, strong sibling-like relationship, parents personalities behind the reasons for certain survival skills, main characters searching for a safe place where obviously some shit is going to go down and everything is not as it first appears. Yada, yada. I saw the twists coming in both books but I think it took more away from In the After, which relied on the action and plot to drive it. But, that being said, I've read several reviews on GR by readers who were surprised.I also know some had a problem with the writing in The 5th Wave but I loved that soft, melancholy, end-of-the-world tone which it had. I found the writing here to more simplistic - though, not necessarily in a bad way - and more focused on the action, rather than the thoughts and feelings of the characters. There were some fantastic scenes that I'm sure will get other readers' pulses racing, like the supermarket scene that reminded me so much of the kitchen scene with the velociraptors(I think) from Jurassic Park - and if you don't know what scene I'm talking about, then you clearly haven't watched it enough. That scene gave me nightmares for years.So, to conclude, I would say that if you were disappointed by The 5th Wave and the loud hype-parade following it around, do not worry! 2013 may yet bring you the exciting, fast-paced, alien invasion read you were hoping for. Yes, this very well could be it."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "A stronger first half than the second, but overall this is a highly entertaining post apocalyptic book! I mean: zombie aliens!The world in In the After has just been attacked by an alien species who are terrifyingly similar to zombies. These creatures eat humans, they're dumb, and they're relentless (they keep trying to get at you no matter how painful it may be to them). It is a tad reminiscent of The 5th Wave, although that book philosophizes more on what it means to be human and the consequences of such an event on humanity as a whole, whereas In the After concentrates on the main characters' direct survival story. It's fascinating to see the adaptive capacity of human beings. This book is Amy and Baby's story, and a great example of why love this genre. Amy was just a little girl when the aliens came. We're initially introduced to her 3 years after, so her complete story is told with the help of flashbacks during her early days when she was clueless - she finds it a miracle she even survived. What I found the most interesting in those sequences were her discoveries regarding the aliens - their ways and habits. They're quite the fascinating creatures. Amy's past is also where we meet Baby, the other main character of the story. Baby, a fantastic addition to the story, was only a toddler when Amy found her. This child stole my heart from the first time we saw her stuffing her face with fruit, somehow still alive. Surviving in this world depends on stealth. If you can be quiet and blend in your surroundings, you've got a chance, and baby astounded me by how intelligent she was. This could easily have been unrealistic - being the mother of a hyper toddler and all - but I grew to believe in her instincts, and you also get an inkling that she's not just an ordinary child. These two quickly form a bond like no other, a bond that I could feel in the deepest pits of my heart. There is nothing like the relationship between two people living a catastrophe, I think Lunetta did a fabulous job at making this the essence of the story. While this bond grows, so do Amy and Baby. We see them develop their own language, learn how to get by with bare essentials, and mature - especially Amy - into strong, capable, and intelligent survivors.Halfway through, this book turns from apocalyptic to a dystopia when they're brought to a survivor camp that soon has Amy unsettled with the controlling way it's governed - forced gestation for one. This is when the book becomes a little less\u2026 everything; less exciting, less chilling (though we still have our moments), less characterization, and we lose the intimate relationship we had with two lone characters that has now grown to include a full blown cast. Fortunately the main characters were already well developed and my connection with them formed; it's the characters we meet in the compound that don't particularly stand out. I was reluctant to let them in my Amy/Baby niche. I also wasn't a fan of the boring romance that blooms. I mostly found it distracting, as if it was maybe added to the book due to the annoying belief that every book needs romance. We do learn some interesting details, however, about the creatures and the current world situation. So while this second half didn't take away what I liked about the book as a whole, it prevented it from a possible 5-star.Perfect for fans of zombie and apocalyptic novels, In the After is an engaging read that surrounds with the fear of the unknown, leads us to the beginnings of a dystopia, and ends with the promise of a thrilling sequel.--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "I liked the first half of this book so much--it was pretty much a survivalist I Am Legend type story, with zombie-like aliens as the creatures in a post-apocalyptic setting. I also liked the choice to make the creatures day-dwellers, instead of the usual nocturnal animals. Once Amy and Baby are taken to the compound, however, the array of unmemorable secondary characters, somewhat limp romance, and over-prolonged mystery (there's a twist that's fairly easy to guess) weren't nearly as engaging as they could have been. As a result, the somewhat underdeveloped world-building became more apparent--and unfortunately for the book, the lab/testing/experimentation scenes will feel very familiar to anyone who has read a lot of YA science fiction. Still, the twist is interesting, and I liked some of the descriptive action scenes and the beginning of the book enough to try another book by this author. I don't know if it will be the inevitable sequel to this one, though.

It was an enjoyable read, the sci-fi and dystopian part were considerably more well-executed than so many other YA books out there, but I just didn't like it very much overall. Even if the world is well-fleshed out, and the idea of Them is certainly a different spin, there were still holes and contradictions concerning the characters, their behavior, and the lack of dimensionality.The concept: Them. Florae-sapiens. Well, that's something I haven't heard of before. A zombie apocalypse? Vampire apocalypse? All done before. The concept of these new creatures are certainly interesting, and I really enjoyed reading about them and their behavior. Flesh-eating aliens. Whoo! Their behavior was well-described, their scent, their actions, their methods of attack. Certainly not zombies in the traditional sense, but considerably more intriguing as a species in their biology and origin. And bloody. Oh so bloody!\"They were faster than I\u2019d thought possible, a blur of green, the color of pea soup. Glowing yellow eyes sometimes caught the light and flashed gold. The creatures pounced, not bothering to kill their prey before feeding. They ripped skin and flesh from their victims, who screeched in agony. The cries always brought more of Them, eager for their next meal.\"Amy: I am torn on my opinion of Amy. I feel like she should be a much more likeable, sympathetic character given what she's gone through, given the strength she's had to have to survive almost on her own all this long, but no...I feel...nothing towards her. I think she is too contradictory of a character to be real. I give a certain wiggle room for character development when reading YA fiction. Teenagers, actually, humans in general, are not predictable creatures. Throw them into a panic-filled, post-apocalyptic scenario and behavior becomes more unpredictable still. With that in mind, I do give my YA dystopian MCs some flexibility regarding their actions, and the character of Amy certainly stretches all my boundaries of what I consider acceptable with the character as she is written. Amy is supposed to be tough, skilled, adaptable. She is that. However, at times, she also exhibits certain behaviors that can only be described as TSTL. During the initial attacks, at night, what does she do?\"The fourth night, I turned on all the lights in the house. My block was dark, except for our home, my home. No one else had electricity, but I still did...I didn\u2019t know then that They were drawn to the lights, like moths to a flame.\"No shit, Sherlock. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that light draws attention. Not just from aliens, in general. Keep your head down, don't draw attention to yourself. Turning on the lights was a supremely stupid move, one of many Amy makes. For someone who claims to be battle-toughened and steeled for survival, and not soft-hearted in any way, Amy sure doesn't act like it. She follows a man home alone, and thankfully lives to regret it, adopts a toddler, who is another mouth to feed, another life to care for, then later on, adopts yet another stray who is a moron of the very highest order.\"Suddenly Amber shrieks.I turn to the closet, my heart pounding. Is one of Them in there with her?Something moves in the closet and I brace myself for a disgusting green head and glowing yellow eyes. Instead, Amber appears in the doorway, her face jubilant. She holds up a bag.\u201cPrada,\u201d she says with a grin, not bothering to whisper.\"I'm amazed Amy manages to live so long, given her choices. Although, admittedly she does learn from her mistakes, but it stretches the imagination that Amy could have survived for as long as she did. Things are also made easy for her, too easy. She's got running water, her dad was into solar power so her house has electricity. Her mom was paranoid so they had a pre-installed electric fence. All these help in her survival, but they don't make for a very believable story given the many happy coincidences that just so happen to help with her survival in the After.I also found her relationship with Baby, and the character of Baby to be unbelievable. Amy starts off barely knowing sign language, Baby starts off as a 3 or 4 year old toddler, and Amy manages to somehow teach them both to communicate in fluent ASL as well as nonverbal hand signals \u00e0 la Helen Keller? No. Not believable. Baby also speaks and communicates far too succinctly and too intelligently for a 6/7 years old character. Given her lack of education, given their constant battle for survival, Baby's nonverbal speech and intelligence as characterized in the book is a far stretch.The book is in three parts. The first is simple enough, a description and retelling of their survival in Chicago in the After world. The second part was where things got truly annoying. Amy's character turns from practical, survival-minded into a petulant teenager determined to believe all authority figures are evil, sinister, phony. The bad guys walk around with an evil glint in their eyes, pretty much. She rebels against the system set up to ensure the survival and profligation of mankind. Fine, some ideas are pretty stupid, I wouldn't want a genetically-selected pre-planned pregnancy either, but she was rebelling waaaaaaaaaaay before she found out the batshit craziness of New Hope.The second is where things got messy. The flashbacks (flash-forwards?) drove me nuts. The narrative style was messy, things jumped all over the place. The pacing was too fast, things were thrown at us too quickly, and it got very confusing. The New Hope colony is an interesting premise, although I felt that was a bit of a stretch. It felt too organized to be established in such a short time. The systems set in place, the high level of organization, the rules...it feels more like an established system that's been in place rather than something thrown together haphazardly after a post-apocalyptic event.Although I'm happy that there was no insta-love, the romance feels kind of forced. I am glad that Amy recognizes Rice's faults and blindness, and didn't fall for him right away. She's even horrified by his beliefs.\"'He's a brilliant man. It's like he can see into the core of people, determine what we\u2019re made of. He did it to me. He saw a lost, young orphan in me and decided I had the potential to be more,' Rice told me passionately. 'He's the one who recommended that Hutsen-Prime take me under their wing. He's the one who has checked on me over the years, made sure I had the best education, the best chance to succeed. And now he's molding New Hope. We have the ability to rebuild the world and make it better.'I looked at Rice, horrified. After the propaganda speech, I didn\u2019t think I could stand to hear any more of the party line, even from someone I trusted.\"Ok...got it. So why fall for him at all? It feels like a forced romance just for the sake of having a romance plotline in the story. The two of them together do not ring true to me at all.Overall good read, didn't give me too much of a headache, and a lot better than some of the recent attempts at YA dystopia, even if it was by no means a great attempt. I'm still interested enough to read the next book when it is released."}, {"userName": "Trina (Between Chapters)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9323164-trina-between-chapters", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this!

I tend to do that a lot to books with awesome blurbs and covers, because as they say, first impression lasts, right? Unfortunately, this book was a case of, \"It was good\" and \"it was meh\" at the same time and right now my feelings are a bit messy and mixed up. But I'll try my best as usual to explain what I liked and what I absolutely detested, so buckle up! Here we go!For the \"zombie\" aspect, I think it was pretty cool. Sure, they're not exactly traditional zombies in a sense that they're not slow at all... the flesh-eating abominations in this book can run fast as hell. They're also not nocturnals, so they hide by night and roam by day, which is a pretty interesting change. I do think the \"twist\" revealed near the end regarding their origins was predictable... I was actually already considering it at the beginning, but even if I didn't foresee it early on, it wasn't really that shocking. Not the book's fault, though... I've just read too many zombie novels and other related themes that the twist was already old news to me. Needless to say, I did feel it could've used a little more originality.I liked Part 1 a lot. I loved how short the chapters were, how intense they felt, how they gave us an overview of how Amy was doing and coping and enduring not only the dangers of the zombies, but also of the surviving humans. I loved how it focused on survival with very little unnecessary drama. It reminded me of a lot of the zombie books that I loved reading early last year, giving me waves and waves of nostalgia. Her relationship with Baby was so real and genuine, too. It was very refreshing to see two characters understand each other in such a level that you don't need words to get messages across, how they can simply know what the other's talking about in a simple glance or gesture. I admit, though, that there were times I got annoyed by Amy's giving in to Baby's tantrums just to please her, but in the end, I kind of understand why she has done what she did. THEN they get rescued by some humans who've made a sort of sanctuary led by scientists and everything pretty much went downhill after that...Part 2... was weird. It felt like I was reading a different book altogether. At this point, it started feeling like any other YA science fiction post-apocalyptic story, but in the usual unappealing way. A lot of side characters were introduced but they didn't really feel well-rounded to me. Bad guys were shown here who were bad because they take advantage of anarchy and they want to wreck havoc for the heck of it, and crazy mad scientists who do what they do because they want to make the \"perfect\" world according to their own ideas... This part, unfortunately, felt very dragging to me. It also started telling the story in two POVs... one in the present, and one that happened in the past (or present and future, however angle you want to see it). It felt very weird to me at first, and I don't deny it made me feel very uncomfortable and confused, but when it did merge together as one near the end of Part 3, everything finally made sense. I do wish it was more subtle, though, because gah! The migraines!Also, I have a problem with the romance. I hate how forced it was. Her sudden relationship (who she instantly felt a connection to when they first met... lots of blushing and faces becoming beet red here, folks!) with Rice felt absolutely random and contrived, like it was very out of place. I didn't think the romance was even necessary here... There were a lot of girls around his age in New Hope and then Amy came and he's suddenly all over her? Huh. I do think it could have worked better if they were simply friends here first. I guess it's inevitable in YA. I do appreciate though that the romance was not central in this book. It was more of a side dish than anything, but still. Cringe-worthy is cringe-worthy.I did enjoy this far more than The 5th Wave, although their only similarity that I can see is their being post-apocalyptic. I just think this one showcased the genre much more, and I think it gave us a better understanding of what society would become if social order collapses.All in all, it was a decent read. It wasn't exactly a phenomenal experience, but it has kept me interested enough to want to know what happens next. I have this grand feeling that the second book is where the epic-ness will finally start. I am definitely looking forward to that.Final Verdict: 3.5 STARS"}, {"userName": "Blythe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5206717-blythe", "userReview": "What is it that generally seals the deal for you when you're reading a post-apocalyptic or dystopian read? Do you strive to find that eerie feeling of inevitability that comes with the concept that the post-apocalyptic world you're experiencing through pages is one that you could possibly experience in real life? Or do you not care about the authenticity of the world and whether or not it is reasonable for our world today to reach the havoc to the point of the world in the novel? Where all you're really looking for is a quick and chilling read to pass some time, perhaps with a little, \"What if?\" lingering in the back of your mind? I am the former type of post-apocalyptic/dystopian reader. As odd as it may sound, I love feeling so horrified that the complete and utter cataclysm presented to me in a fiction post-apocalyptic could possibly be a reality at some point in the future. That thrill of, \"What if this actually happens?\" adds such an inexpressible and thrilling ambience that immerses me into the novel more than anything else could be able to, and from then on I imagine that it's not only the characters in the novel fighting for their life in the post-apocalyptic, dystopian barren wasteland, but also me.And that is why In the After is such a remarkable read for me. Although I may not have found the particular alien scenario to be one I see happening, Lunetta crafted her world in such a way that I couldn't help but picture myself in the world and have myself experiencing the apocalypse along with the characters. The novel itself does undeniably have some issues concerning pacing and the dystopian world represented in the latter half of the novel, which left me feeling rather detached at select times, but for the vast majority of the novel, In the After was nothing short of a thrill-ride for me, wherein I was experiencing every single occurrence in the novel along with the characters themselves. The first quarter of In the After firmly establishes the of electrifying and wild world that is the After. Throughout some of the beginning of In the After we follow Amy as she finds herself one day dealing with the trivial things of everyday life in the Before, whether those actions are looked upon by Amy in flashbacks or dealt by her in the present, to her scavenging for food and struggling to survive in the harsh world overrun by the monsters--Florae--that have ravaged practically everything she once knew and loved from the Before. The juxtaposition of these two vastly different perspectives from the Before and the After made a huge impact on me and my reading experience as I started the novel, and I soon found myself thrust into the dangerous world of In the After along with Amy. As well as that, character and relationship development takes center stage in In the After alongside the horror and suspense that accompanies the Florae. Similarly to T. Michael Martin's The End Games, In the After features a strong central, family relationship between Amy and Baby. However, I have to say I like the relationship between Amy and Baby in In the After more than the one between Michael and Patrick in The End Games for a few reasons, one being that Amy and Baby aren't directly related, but look to each other as sisters, and another reason being that I feel the relationship between Amy and Baby is met with much more depth and poignancy than Michael and Patrick's. Lunetta's use of silence and its key role throughout most of the former half of the novel, as well as how Lunetta used silence to depict her world is both effective and downright chilling, and the placement of a touching relationship in a crude world brought out a brilliant and breathtaking contrast throughout the novel. Although there were quite a few parts that dragged as the somewhat dystopian society of the novel was introduced, In the After redeemed itself with surprising twists and thus I am able to say that, shocking, thrilling, suspenseful, and smart, In the After is an exceptionally impressive debut from Demitria Lunetta, and I have trouble thinking of a better and more exciting read to start off the summer."}, {"userName": "Neil (or bleed)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14057379-neil-or-bleed", "userReview": "In the After is divided into 3 parts. If I could rank them out, The Part I was the best; Part II was the good; and Part III was the better. But as a whole, I loved this book since it was a page-turner, compelling and it made me think and gave me the creeps. Even the world is fleshed-out and the characters aren't annoying. And there's no insta-love.Part I was pure survival. I liked it best because well, survivals give me heart attacks (not the fatal one) and take me to the edge of my seat. Which is a good thing because it is an indication that I'm enjoying reading the book. It is also admiring to read how the characters grow and learn as an individual and be wiser along the way just to survive. Part II was a sort of a letdown because I'm expecting something else but I was dragged to a generic setup after an apocalypse. In this book, it comes to a name as New Hope. A community that is trying to save and restore humanity and have set of rules (rules are important, of course) that didn't abide by the main character because she wanted answers. (And because she is the main character and she needs to step-up and oppose the leader or the ruling people for the conflict. Lol. Just kidding. Of course, if you're smelling something fishy, you started asking questions and eager to know everything.) Nevertheless, this part was still intriguing. Amy was experiencing trauma and panic after she settled in New Hope. She became jumpy and paranoid and always in attack mode. And as I've said above, she smelled something fishy, something dark in this controlled environment. So am I. This part also has two narratives of Amy. It's kinda confusing yet it was also fascinating.Part III is where I proved that there is something fishy going on. Ha! (Thank the gods, if not, I will be pissed) I felt a pang of disappointment however, because these are not the answers and explanations I'm expecting. Anyway, I already moved on about that and accepted what I've got. At least, I got answers.The best-est for me about In the After is the sisterly love between Amy and Baby. I loved these two.

I just knew this was going to be a good book when I first saw it, but it turned out to be way better than good.All I knew about the book when I read it was the blurb (there\u2019s more to it now than when I first read it), so the experience was all my own. I can\u2019t even tell you how glad I am for that, because there were a few things that completely surprised me in a very good way. That\u2019s why a big part of me wants to tell you not to read any reviews and just experience it for yourself. So either turn back now or continue \u2026In the first part of the book the story picks up three years after the world has been decimated by horrible, unforgiving killer creatures. It\u2019s told through Amy\u2019s POV, with occasional flashbacks of when the creatures arrived and how she survived all those years. She also describes how she found and bonded with Baby, a toddler who was abandoned. I loved their relationship and how well they worked together. I was glad to see that they both had great instincts and would act quickly. They weren\u2019t airheads that made it unbelievable that they would survive the dangerous new world.The creatures in In the After is one reason I\u2019m glad I went into it knowing very little. I was expecting zombie-ish creatures, but I was surprised twice during the duration of the book regarding them. Well, the second time wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise, but it was a nice twist. They are fast, and not to be messed with. These creatures aren\u2019t the only things to fear, though. Not everyone in the post-apocalyptic world can be trusted.The second part of the book is another reason I\u2019m glad I had no preconceived notions going in. I wasn\u2019t fully expecting it. The creatures are a lot less present here, but it doesn\u2019t mean the girls are out of danger. New Hope was an interesting place that had that too perfect feel that made it a little sinister. I really liked this part of the book and how it brought in a whole new element of danger and mystery.I found Amy and Baby\u2019s dynamic especially interesting once they were thrust into this civilization after years of only each other. My heart broke for Amy, but she also grew into a total badass. I also enjoyed the whole slew of new characters, even those I detested. There isn\u2019t really a full romance, but there is some chemistry. That\u2019s perfectly fine with me, though. It just wasn\u2019t needed yet. Or ever.In the After was a wonderful debut novel that brought back some excitement to a genre I was starting to get bored of. The characters, setting, and plot were all done very well.

Amy was an awesome main character, so smart, bad ass, and resilient, and her relationship with Baby was what kept me reaching for my iPod, eager to listen to my library book every chance I got. The narrator did a great job and I recommend audiobook format.In many of the reviews I read prior to starting the book I saw a lot of people who were unhappy about how the tone of the book changed so much after Part 1. The story starts out as a survival horror story, then turns more standard dystopian as Amy and Baby arrive at New Hope. I did find the beginning more intriguing, but I still really enjoyed the rest of the book and discovering the truth about New Hope alongside Amy. I loved the flash forwards too, knowing that something fishy was going on and anticipating when the timelines will connect and everything will be revealed. I was more than pleased with the reality behind the aliens and I am so excited to dive into book two after that ending!"}, {"userName": "Tammie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3506989-tammie", "userReview": "[ Even in leaving at the end she is making a stupid mistake, because she doesn't take Baby with her, and the doctor had already pretty much told her he knows baby is the one thing she cares about.

Little did I know that it was about aliens. I have never read a book with aliens because it isn't a topic that I usually like to come across. So reading this kind of book is a first for me. My first thoughts when reading this book was a little conflicting because I'm not into alien books or anything alien really. I would've put the book down if it wasn't for the action and the suspense of what going to happen next. So I had to put aside my negativeness against aliens and get through. I loved the writing and how everything went smoothly. It was descriptive enough for me to get a picture of how things may have been and it wasn't over the top. (Meaning that some authors like to describe every single detail straying away from the story stretching it out unnecessarily making it dull, this book wasn't the case.) The readers get to see from day one what happened to Amy and how everything progressed with her survival meanwhile everyone in the area was nearly gone. Amy is a smart girl who quickly learns to grow up and adapt to everything that happens in order to survive. At the ending of the part one I nearly fell over in shock and thought to myself thank goodness that wasn't the end or I would go crazy. Amy is not the type of person who can easily be fooled and questions everything and anything, even when she was in a place that was considered safe. She trusted her gut feeling and did something about it. I loved this book.This book was unpredictable, normally I find a trend in most YA novels and there is no way I could pin this book to it.You ever get those moment where you finally figure out what is going on a little before the big reveal? Yea I got one of those moments with this book. I couldn't even believe I guessed right.This book had captured me and wouldn't let go until the very end. Highly Recommend to anyone. If you love post-apoplectic, zombies, aliens books your gonna want to get this book. Soon as the book comes out in store you must get it, your not going to want to pass up this great book.

In this world the human race is almost extinguished, because of extraterrestrial creatures. I loved the take on aliens in this book. They are not ''more intelligent'' than humans and have the intention to take over the world. They are simply hungry beasts and humans are their snack.Creepy. Suspenseful. Thrilling.

Based on reviews, you either love it or you don't and I happen to love it. I will not go into any more details about what happened in the book as there have already been quite a number of reviews out there that will clue you in. I will however base this short review on other reviews, a comparison of sorts of what I think to what other people say about this book. So, here goes.1. The first half is better than the second.I didn't think so. For me, the last half is just as engrossing as the first, if not even more so. Here, you find answers to questions, you get a glimpse of what happens next. How can it be any less gripping?2. Some parts are dragging.Well, yes, there might have been some parts where my heart didn't skip a beat. But overall, I think the story is nicely paced and plot-driven.3. Second half is confusing.I didn't think it was hard to follow but I do get why some people find the flashbacks and flash-forwards a little disorienting.4. Predictable.I don't know, it might just be me, but I honestly didn't see the twist coming.5. Similar to Rick Yancey's The 5th Wave.I wasn't too crazy about The 5th Wave. It was way over-hyped but in my opinion, failed to deliver. Aliens, kick-ass heroine, and survivalist theme, those are about as far as the similarities go I think.All in all, for a debut novel, I think it's great.Seen on Eat Read Shop."}, {"userName": "K.A.

They are super fast, like unnaturally fast, and they have amazing hearing. But at night Their senses aren't that good. While Amy is scavenging one day in a local store, she finds a little toddler and takes her in. Amy called her Baby. Amy and Baby have survived years, only living on the things they get at night. Baby is unnaturally quiet, even when Amy found her. They develope a sign language, a tweak in the ASL. One day they find a girl in the local store, but she is really loud. How did she last this long in the After? But Baby likes her, so they take her with them. One day they are scavenging through an old house, where Amber makes a lot of noise and Amy gets mad at her to find the next morning she is gone. Baby is devistated. They see people with guns at their fence one day, and Amy gets scared that they will hurt them. So Amy and Baby go out in the wild, and stop by the ocean. They get captured by this \"space ship\" and think they are going to die. But they come to this community of survivors that are trying to rebuild the human population.

I can't, in good conscience, give this book more than three stars but then, I think of all the books worse than this one that I've given better ratings to.Yeah, but that's the thing: I read them before this one. Anyways, this 3-star review is actually a positive one. If you have been around the YA post apocalyptic corner, you gotta know there's a certain formula they follow:World ends, Girl* survives. [Sometime later] Girl runs away(from rehab camps, isolation, facility, society blah di dah). Girl manages to encounter another flesh of civilization, Girl integrates into society, Girl finds the government controlling society evil. Evil people find their evilness discovered and about to be unleashed, Shit hits the fan, Girl plans to burn 'em all.*'Cause they're all mostly girls, yeah?If you haven't been around, well, whoops! minorly spoilerly. My bad.And of course, there are a few personality traits, the most important being the utmost devotion to a little kid/sibling. That will make your MC automatically popular. Not that there's anything wrong with that; I used to be a fan of those characters myself until recent times. No relationship that I've encountered is as smooth as these people portray, especially sibling-hood. I think it's okay to say that I'm SICK TO DEATH of these; I just want a sisterhood akin to \nSaba and Emmi's\n from Blood Red Road. Why can't we have more of that? Moving on, Cheeses, I have read so many of these books and yet I love, and love to follow, these books to the end. There's something about people overthrowing governments that appeals to my very sensibilities. Nothing ever really stands out in In The After. It's partly about survival in the mad, mad world with the big, bad wolves out there and then the bigger wolves, aka fellow humans, come into play and it's all human depravity and iniquity.It's a question that's been bugging me a lot lately. Why do humans always turn out to be the biggest monster? It's as if we have to assert our supremacy in everything, even evilness: WE ARE THE WORST FUCKERS AROUND, THE GREATEST EVIL CREATED! BEWARE OF US! But at the end of the day, it's a survivalist novel and who doesn't love those, even if they have nothing new to offer?The whole plot of In the After comes down to a major reveal at the end, albeit it's a bit obvious before that. I especially liked the missing pieces that Lunetta sets in the beginning and ties it all very nicely towards the end. Most of it reeks of generic conformity, with the inclusion and set-up of ignorant and beaten-up society, and nothing here truly sets apart this book from many others. Except the technique and full realization of something called 'shock factors', for which, kudos to Lunetta! The story isn't actually predictable, even while it follows the aforementioned outline.My favorite part of the book cannot be mentioned for fear of spoilers. Suffice it to say, that I absolutely got Amy's desolation in the latter half of the book. I truly hurt for her as stuff kept happening, and everything she lost. After that I loved how instantly indignant and wary of the society Amy becomes, somewhat like how I would have reacted. Most MC's take such long periods of time before coming to such conclusions. This is what sets apart In the After for me. And the romance.It's probably very hard to create a realistic romance in an end-of-the-world setting, is what I've gathered over the years of books. The romance mainly becomes the downfall of novels, case in point: The 5th Wave. It can make or break you characters as well as the whole book. But Demitria Lunetta's book doesn't converge on romance and it's very light. The romantic interest is different and he actually is a believer and follower of the evil society that the MC will have to overthrow. He's constantly getting irritated with her for not seeing things his way. There isn't much build-up, nor is there any mushiness. I don't necessarily like him, but I don't like any of them these days. What the fuck is happening to me, is a good question to ask. May be this Or mayhap WhatevsFor comparisonists, far as I'm concerned, this is better than The 5th Wave, although I gave that one a higher rating. The characters are much more realistic and likable, the pacing is significantly better and the sci-fi aspect is handled with more precision. There are a lot of similarities between the two, but one's gotta trump the other, no?So no, this is not a Guilty Crown fiasco, capitalizing on the fame of the mecha genre, awesomely as it started. But that is another quarrel for another time. In the After doesn't have any new contributions but that's not always why we read or love a book, is it? Sometimes, it's because no matter how rote, it's still SO DAMN FUN! Case in point: Supernatural TV show. And now I'm adding this gif because it's FUN!Cross-posted on Books behind Dam{n}s"}, {"userName": "Mitch", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170554-mitch", "userReview": "[while Amy has been committed to a psych ward (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "I'd been eyeing In the After ever since I saw it in the HarperTeen catalogue. Even the blurb had an air of mystery about it - who are They? And considering They are the catalyst for an apocalypse, I was all over it like a cheap suit (I've always wanted to say that).In the After jumps straight into the action as Amy finds herself in a world that has been brutally invaded by creatures that no one seems to have any knowledge about. She does get lucky in that her house is heavily protected due to her mother's job, and her hippy father has had a hand in making it almost completely self-sufficient, but otherwise she is pretty much on her own.I liked Amy quite a bit - from a girl who seemingly should have been alien food from the beginning, she develops into a tough, dedicated girl who will do anything to keep Baby safe and adapts quickly to her changed environment. I loved the relationship she developed with Baby, the way that they depended on each other for survival whilst still providing a close companionship that kept them both safe and sane during the years after the invasion.It was only when Amy and Baby ended up in the colony of New Hope that things went a little off the rails for me. The remainder of the story is told in flashbacks, which I can normally deal with, but the flashes were so short that I started to feel like I was being yanked back and forth rather than gliding in and out of them. It seems like it was written this way to keep the pacing at the same level, which it does, but for me it could have worked just as well with a bit of a slow-down in the middle.There are action scenes, relationship-building, a bit of a flirtation and mystery all of which I really enjoyed, and I feel that Ms. Lunetta has put a quite unique spin on the YA apocalyptic genre. The ending is left open for the possibility of another book, and if that book does happen I'd more than happily grab a copy as it feels there is still a lot left to explore.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}], "description": "In debut author Demitria Lunetta's heart-pounding thriller, one girl must fight for her survival in a world overrun by violent, deadly creatures.
