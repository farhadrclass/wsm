When I asked her if it was good, she rapidly shook her head no.A novel that is terrible yet irresistible. Color me intrigued.It was only after I read this that I could truly understand.It was a massacre.I lost so many good brain cells.God bless the fallen.How to explain.This is (essentially) what I read:Snow white runs away from her wicked stepmother trips and lands in the very welcoming arms of her dwarf friends. they want to keep her because she cooks rather nice, and, well, they are all really enjoying those hard ons she supplies with her coy looks. Does she pick one? Oh no, snow white has a voracious emotional appetite, and the cunning to secure all seven dwarfs. They promptly kiss her feet, suck her fingers, and feel up her young, tender body under the guise of checking out her injuries from all the abuse klutzilla endures. The only thing missing in this book was snow whites orgy by the pool side.Jokes jokes. That's not it.. well not entirely. How about this version?Young beautiful, naive, clueless, innocent, helpless, loyal (blah blah you get it) Sang Sorenson is the nicest girl on the block. Somehow she has a sweet disposition in spite of the years of abuse and neglect from her parents, and it invites seven male gods to knock down the walls around her guarded heart. No, no, these gods are not actually dwarfs, but rather dogs- Sang's made them her bitch, and not in a good way. They enjoy giving her shit and taking care of her, yet the way they treat her... Sang doesn't exist, just Soccer Ball. Everone like's Soccer Ball, cause everyone gets a turn kicking her around! And the letdownsJust when I thought there would be a bona fide threesome, what do i get? nothing!Lets not forget the nicknames. It might just be me, but i felt every nickname like a bullet to my fucking brain.I get it. You want them to all have cute nicknames for her, so we can't elevate one of these testosterone filled fucks above another. Well that would never happen, cause guess what? THEY ALL LIKE HER The. same. exact. way. literally. no difference. Yes, Yes,I understand north has the brooding thing, Luke has the sexy face, and Gabrielle- uh i mean Gabriel- has the metro-sexual thing going on... etc. I get it. I do. But they all blush the same way, react to her giggles the same way, have the same inability to say no to her Mary Sue facial pout. Yeah, apparently Sangs pout has the ability to decimate Gabriel like a fucking avada kedavra.When you can fit seven personalities in 3 dwarfs, the seven is just overkill. Diversity? I think not. I'm not even gonna touch on the secret of the academy, cause to be honest, I'm not sure anyone gave a flying fuck. Everyone is entranced by the budding romance between the emotionally blind, socially inept wreck, and her seven horny, rich, stalkers/bodyguards. I'm just trying to muse on how this would work out when the boys balls descend and they realize they actually want to fuck her. She has the perfect setup- seven dwarfs- one dwarf for every day of the week!I'm gonna amuse myself by guessing who she'll put out to first. Since the Soccer Ball is the antichrist of feminism, I'm guessing Kota with his alphaness, will win first. Hmm, lets not put Victor out of the count yet, he does buy her tons of shit. Loose riches, loose bitches. But don't worry, eager readers who are warned this book is like black tar heroin, Sang WILL get with all of the guys; that's how you play soccer after all, the ball gets passed around.I mean its not Sangs fault almost every man with a pulse believes she'll hand out her vagina on a golden platter... And its not her fault that all the nice characters resemble abercrombie and fitch models and all the evil characters have the ugly gene... And that ALL seven boys LIKE and WANT her in their exclusive group that nobody has joined since the fourth grade. I mean really where's Grumpy? North is a piss poor replacement. Was Grumpy exiled cause he didn't agree that Sang was the equivalent of the messiah?It's really not her fault. It's just not believable.I think whats most embarrassing about the whole thing is that I'm almost finished with the series.Make of that what you will."}, {"userName": "Helen 2.0", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39575951-helen-2-0", "userReview": "A book version of Japanese reverse harem animes, except everyone is suburban white. And constantly blushing.Is the cover guy supposed to be Kota? That is SO not how I pictured him.The Academy series revolves around Sang, your typical straight white virgin with a psychotic family, zero personality, and 9 (as in NINE) guys chasing her ass like it's God's gift to man. I would be less annoyed about this situation if any of the characters could deviate even slightly from the cliched, but nope. Sang is so dull she might as well be a mannequin - but if I hear ONE MORE BOY talking about how \"you're not like other girls, Sang\" I swear I will slap the offending party right out of the book. She just sits around, silently blushing and wallowing about her self esteem issues. How is this \"different\" or \"special\"??? At one point, she mentions Vivaldi's Four Seasons and everyone acts all impressed that Sang is cultured (when that piece is about as famous as you can get in terms of classical music. Come on, EVERYONE has heard of Vivaldi before.) Basically, Sang is an average girl with an average harem.The title, \"Introductions\", pretty much says it all. We have a couple of chapters and Sang meets a new guy in each chapter. That's it. Nothing else happens.I've seen many other people mention this series' frightening ability to fail as a literary work and yet still be completely addictive. I have to concur. I finished this book, thought, \"Thank God that's over,\" then promptly reached for the next book. What is going on here?"}, {"userName": "Lynanne Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8159686-lynanne-carroll", "userReview": "I started reading this book because the synopsis sounded fairly interesting, and because it was free. Mostly because it was free. I kept reading because I honestly *could not believe* it was so awful. I just kept waiting for it to get better (it never happened). I've reviewed quite a few YA books on Goodreads, Amazon, and my blog...and not one of them has been THIS BAD. This is what happens--no spoilers, because there ISN'T ANYTHING TO SPOIL:Sang meets each guy from this enigmatic, cliquish group, is fawned over by pretty much all of them, and blushes repeatedly because of their unexpected sympathy and friendliness. Literally. Except...no, even that makes it sound better than it is.You may be reading this and thinking to yourself, c'mon, that's ridiculous. No book is THAT bad. Well, dear reader, this one is. What I describe is all that happens. Worse, it happens like 12 times because she meets a different guy in each chapter...and they all respond in the exact same way. Of course, in the beginning, it doesn't seem all that bad; you meet a nice guy who treats Sang well (unlike her psychopath of a mother), and it seems sweet. Blossoming love, perhaps? Or at least the start of a good friendship for her to finally start living. But then you realize that you're reading the same story over and over again with each new guy she's introduced to...and then you wonder, is there any point to this? Nothing about these characters is \"complex\" (as another reviewer claimed); they are all practically identical to one another in personality, and all happen to fall for Sang just because. (Again, I mean that in the most literal sense imaginable.)I am *astonished* that this book has a rating of 4 stars. I mean, seriously, I would've burned this book if it hadn't been electronic. You might think I'm being harsh. Tactless. Heartless. Maybe I could've been more tactful. But this book deserves every single 1 star rating it receives, and I don't anyone to misunderstand my meaning when I say that this book is not worth reading, much less *buying* and reading. If I could, I'd give this book 0 stars. If you are contemplating reading this book, you should first contemplate whether or not you want to pluck your own eyes out with a fork. My guess is the answer will be no, and you can take that as your cue to move on."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18650879-jessica", "userReview": "I \nlove\n this series so much!

I can find SO MANY faults with this book but I'm still dying to read the sequel. I guess I would put this under my guilty pleasure books tab in goodreads because I just couldn't stop reading this book and I have no idea why! Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it has seven hot guys in it. You heard me ... SEVEN guys.The plus point of this book is that there isn't a love triangle/heptagon yet and the male characters are different and draw you to the story.Each of the male characters is intriguing.The characters are just introduced in this book but I can't wait to find out more about them.My main problem with this story so far has to be the main character.I have mixed feelings towards Sang. She's too naive,trusting and pretty much a walking cliche but I still pity her and can't seem to hate her.I think I might have liked this story much more if it was told in dual POV or from somebody else's point of view.Also, I don't like how some \"issues\" are being handled in this book.The plot is interesting yet confusing at the same time.I noticed that not much happens in this book. The book's title isn't misleading at all it just introduces us to the characters and hints at some mysterious secret.I'm pretty sure the main story hasn't started yet.Overall, I have no idea how to rate this because I couldn't put this book down no matter how much it frustrated me.I think the next book will help me decide whether this series is any good or not."}, {"userName": "Elise \u2718 a.k.a Ryder's Pet \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13567836-elise-a-k-a-ryder-s-pet", "userReview": "\u201cWill you stop being cute?

This is one of those series that has the addiction level of crystal meth for any book loving individual. I have to say what I expected of this book, what NOTHING that I actually got. What I got was a pretty heavy dose of mystery, angst, underlying tones of romance, and seven--erm no--nine hot high school age boys (I kind of feel terrible calling them boys because they act way to much like men only they have all the bent up aggression that teenage boys have that is the ONLY reason this works.)Ok. So the lead character and narrator of our story is Sang (yeah that bothers me too. What is up with these young adult names? Is Emily or Stacey just too much to ask for? They worked well enough in Baby-Sitters Club and that was my all time fav series as a child!) its opens with what appears to be her running away from home. Then she stumbles upon Kota--aka hottie number one. Through the course of the book Sang mets the six other boys in this odd group along with two teachers. She learns they are part of the academy and that is about all I can tell you without blowing up the whole plot. The writing isn't totally strong. It is written for a lower age group than me and yet I was still going WTF at the end and went and bought the other two books because apparently sleep and getting actual work done wasn't an option while reading these books. What we do know is that Sang is living in a very abusive and dysfunctional household. Her father neglects her and her mother doles out punishments that could possibly ride glaringly close to the mother in Sybil. It is a big intense and heart wrenching, and I totally believe a few, if not ALL the boys in the group are falling in love with Sang. *I recieved a copy of this book from Aracto Publishing via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10621002-meredith", "userReview": "I received this book via Net Galley for an honest review.When I finished this book I had to stop and think for a minute. Technically, nothing really exciting happens. It\u2019s called Introductions, and it\u2019s just that. Each character in the series is introduced. There are eight main characters: Sang, Kota, Nathan, Victor, Silas, Gabriel, Luke, and North. Each boy is introduced through their first meeting with Sang. We meet a few other minor characters including Sang\u2019s deranged mother (think Mommy Dearest), her sister Marie, and two professors at the high school Mr. Blackbourne (bad cop) and Dr. Green (good cop).Sang is extremely na\u00efve, almost a bit overboard for me. But then again her mother is crazy and administers cruel forms of punishment on her daughters for simply talking to someone. So I guess her inexperience and social awkwardness are understandable. She is definitely a sheltered child because when she first meets Kota she follows him back to his house (in her defense she was injured when Kota\u2019s dog pounced on her). It\u2019s late at night, a stranger offers to help clean up a few scratches for her (even though her own house is only feet away) and she even spends the night. Basically she does every thing a girl should NOT do when meeting a total stranger.Of course Kota is harmless and instantly needs to take care of the helpless Sang. He introduces her to his group of friends and they all immediately become protective of Sang. For her part she is just thrilled to have friends. It\u2019s all a bit strange, which is really the entire tone of the book. Something is off or hidden from the reader and you just can\u2019t put your finger on what it is. I know I\u2019ve seen movies like this before. The ones where it ends and you\u2019re left scratching your head trying to figure out what it was all about. Sang shares several sweet moments with each of the boys making the friendships feel real. She takes an unexpected swim with Nathan after he shoves her in the pool, Silas worries about her and calls her house to make sure she's all right after a creepy run in at the mall (which leads to some crazy punishment from wacko-mom), Luke shares his dreams about opening a diner with her and there are more. Honestly the guys are too sweet, too caring, and overall just too perfect. Other than a few run-ins with her mother and a sleezeball at the mall, not much else happens. So when I finished the book I was surprised I wanted more. I want to know what on earth the Academy is. I want to know more about the odd group of seven boys that seem too good to be true (every girl would love to be the lone female in the group). I want to know how Sang plays into everything. Why are the boys so concerned for Sang's safety at school? Who on earth are Dr. Green and Mr. Blackbourne? And what is up with Sang's deranged mother?Overall I would place this book in the bizarre yet completely addictive category. This book is full of BOYS! I can\u2019t understand how a book that really isn\u2019t about anything other than character introductions left me wanting more.

It is, just as the title implies, an introduction- not only to all the various complex characters, but also the the unique situation they're all in, and the mysterious and exclusive \"Academy.\" The depth of Sang's situation is heart-wrenching, and even more-so with the thought that there are really people who deal with the things she's dealing with. A look into her world, and her thoughts- doubts about her worth and self, especially- is only a small part of what makes this book so dynamic and intriguing.All seven of \"the guys\" Sang meets and befriends are just perfect- they each have unique personalities, and are a perfect personification of the 7 typical stereotypical young guys. The nerd/leader, the serious grump/bad boy, the muscle/sweet-heart, the questionable musician, the always chipper passionate, the cocky ladies man, and the fun sporty jock. Each is a perfect depiction of a woman's image of that stereotype (and probably what every guy hopes to be, in one form or another). I found myself making comparisons to the 7 dwarfs from Snow White, and found the similarities to that story amusing. I loved each guy, and their combined concern and protectiveness for Sang makes them all that much more desirable. The writing is very appealing- easy to read, flows smoothly and naturally. The descriptions are very well written, easily imagined, and depicted beautifully. Not overly wordy, but not something that makes you feel stupid for reading- perfect mix. Being book one of a four book series, the ground work for the rest of the books was laid out, and very well. It's left me excited to read the rest of the series, and find out what will happen with the Academy, and Sang. I think it has the ability to be one of the next big hit series- certainly something to keep an eye on.

Got caught up with a bunch of other books so sorry it took me awhile.When I saw the title I just though, \"Okay, it's the character's first day at a school.\" Not completely it, Almost the entire book was dedicated to introducing the guys. Should have been obvious by the title, though. I didn't like the main character. She seemed too fragile to me. I was confused by her actions with the guys. It seemed she had a crush on all of them. There were some grammar issues here and there. The whole book was a cliche to me.

This one was one heck of a page-turner! It's so difficult to find books worthy of 3+ stars so I wasn't expecting much from this. But damn, this was amazing. The characters were all very likeable and I enjoyed every minute of getting to know them. The ending was such a dramatic cliffhanger -- I absolutely cannot wait to get my hands on book two! There were some grammatical errors in some parts of the book but overall it was a really great read and I never once got bored while reading it.Sang's strict and overbearing parents has kept her sheltered almost her entire life. She's not allowed to make friends, she doesn't own a cellphone or a laptop and her mother mistreats her at home if she doesn't act the way she's supposed to. When she meets Kota and the other boys she's thrilled and thinks that she finally has a chance at normalcy. But the smart, chivalrous and nearly-perfect guys she met aren't what they seem. They keep secrets of their own. And they have this secret language that Sang doesn't understand. Who are they really? And what is their friendship all about?Favorite characters: Kota and Nathan. (If Sang ever gets to date one of them, I want it to be either Kota or Nathan. Sang seems to have a crush on all of them but I hope in book two she gets to uncover all of their secrets and will eventually fall for Kota. Heh.) Victor is oh-so-sophisticated in my eyes but super-friendly. I'm not sure about Gabriel... his character still confuses me. (He wasn't shown much in the book, too.) Luke was adorable! I could easily picture him in my mind. He's 'guy bestfriend' material. And North and Silas? Well, they still scare me. I have a feeling though that lurking beneath both of their huge, muscled frames is a soft side. After getting introduced to every single one of them I was feeling jealous of Sang. She's so lucky she got to befriend seven fantastic guys!A million thanks to the author for providing me a free copy of this book. I am absolutely grateful for the opportunity to read and review your work.

Was there action? I'm so confused. And yet...... I HAVE TO READ THE NEXT ONE This was honestly exactly like the title says. It is all introductions. But pleasant ones with hunky boys. I can't really fault Sang for being extremely confused and still somehow completely ok with it. I know I would have in high school. Hey-oooMoving past Sang, let's talk about \"All Those Boys!\" as my great-grandmother would have said. (She and her husband ran an all boys camp and she was a flapper in the 20's. She would have loved this book) A friend said it was like a harem and it really is. I love that Sang isn't taking advantage of it though. She isn't saying \"Jump!\" and they all attach themselves to the beams in the ceiling. Kota is clearly the ringleader of the whole thing but they are all so cute and caring. I just want to put them in my pocket and take them to concerts with me to keep the creepers away. One bone to pick though with one boy. Of all the things in God's great universe, why in the world is one of the boys a  hairdresser . When I read that, I immediately pictured my hairdresser who has a thing for sparkly jewel encrusted cowboy boots and lecturing me if I am ever late to one of his appointments. That's what I see when I envision Gabriel.I feel like this book was set in the South just because it is supposed to be the desert of the beaux arts but it didn't really talk about that besides using our copious forests down here as an escape.I don't want to read the next one or spend money on it...but I know I will."}, {"userName": "Pao", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12593547-pao", "userReview": "One of the best books a I've read so far this year. The Academy- Introductions is a very intriguing and misterious book that, as its title says, is an introduction to meet the characters part of these series. The best part: not only one guy to drool over, but SEVEN BOYS (yes...SEVEN DREAMY BOYS) and all of them are so nice and sweet (not in a boring fairy tale way)to our female character Sang, who is an isolated and insecure girl as a result of a having a paranoid mother, an absent father and a weird sister. Sang's way of being is understandable knowing the situation she lives in, and this group of guys comes right in to give her their friendship and acceptance.I loved a lot of things about this book, mainly: 1)The mistery, the book ends and leaves you with a lot of questions about the guys, The Academy, the professors, etc. 2)Sang's awful family situation (not the family itself), I honestly get bored to read about leading characters with a perfect life and family, the wonderful cheery bff and the handsome irresistible bad boy. It probably sounds weird but I like better books with sad and hard plots not due to just a heartbreak or something like that.I completely enjoyed reading this first part of the series (I checked and there is going to be The Academy #3, 4 and 5 *_*), and I'm at the same time suffering and looking forward for book #2, suffering because it is already published and I can't have it (excuse me for my whining), also read the excerpt and I want more.

But tooooooo short!Only 163 pages, are you kidding me????This first introduction to the series which happens to be called \"Introductions\" is free on Amazon Kindle, so go get it, and I dare you to deny being even a tiny bit attracted enough to keep going! Guys there are literally 20 books in this series, although not all of them are out yet!!!! I'm so excited! However, I was just scrolling through all the book titles and \"First Kiss\" is book #10. Guys, I can't wait that long!! Also how on earth am I supposed to pick only one of these seven extremely amazing males?! Literally they are so perfect you know you're reading a book.....sadly.So Sang kind of has a crush on these seven dudes, who are her friends, all at once. I don't blame her for it. She's innocent and naive and has an abusive mother who breathes fire at the idea of \"boy.\" It's a new experience for her! Not only is it a new experience, but DAMN did you observe those fine specimens?Seven guys that are all physically well-built in different ways, each unbearable attractive in a different way, all of them so kind, so gentlemanly, so supportive, so tender, and so trustworthy!?SIGN ME UUUUP!Buuut only if they were sophomores in college, not high school, lol ^_^ I don't yet have a favorite boy. They're all so awesome!Sang's mother....I hate that b*tch! I don't even know what her father is up to. Nor her sister for that matter.

If that doesn't bother you, it is an enjoyable yet endless read/soap opera...Sang/snow white and the seven hot 16 year olds/dwarves. This was a freebe and I was just checking it out to see if it was worth reading.... and I couldn't put it down. Still not sure why. Nothing really happens. Weird. Yet I liked the characters, and despite high school being a distant memory for me now ( I turn 48 next week), rather enjoyed revisiting those days through Sang. But these 7 boys are more than they seem and have a hidden agenda. It's a totally PG book, not even kissing, but there's that awakening sexual awareness I remember from those days. Confusing and distracting and sometimes embarrassing. The author does a great job of putting you in that teenage mindset. Sang herself is the quintessential heroine in distress. Her parents are apathetic parents at best, abusive at worst. Her sister is untrustworthy. There is no one for her to turn to. Until she bumps into Kota. He becomes her first true friend and introduces her to his other 6 friends. So the story has a fairy tale feel and I gotta admit there is something alluring to have a heroine who ALL the boys (good and bad) find themselves drawn to. Yet she isn't annoyingly perfect. Not sure if I can make it through all 9 books, but I am reading the second one... I can't call this a romance, because she seems equally attracted to all the boys and visa versa, and even a couple teachers. But I figure sooner or later she'll gravitate to one of them over the 6 others."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997908-laura", "userReview": "3.5 starsIntroductions is a reasonable start to what seems like an interesting series.The only problem with this book is the plotline, there isn\u2019t one. This book introduces us to Sang, her interesting family life and the boys who become her friends. To me reading Introductions didn\u2019t feel like I was reading a full book and instead felt more like reading just the (admittedly detailed and well written) opening to a book. This style of writing, though unsatisfying, allows the characters to be well developed.Each chapter introduces us to a new character and by the end of the book each and every one feels like a friend you have known for years. Sang\u2019s perspective on the world is refreshing due to the somewhat unique way she has been raised by her mother. Her life is interesting and I want to know more about it and the boys also add their own element of mystery.This series has so much potential.
