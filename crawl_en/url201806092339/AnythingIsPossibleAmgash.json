MELTING!!! WISH IT DIDN'T HAVE TO END!!!Elizabeth Strout begins with Tommy Guptill who once owned a dairy farm in Amgash, Illinois. The house had burned down. His family had to move to a more run-down town. Their family went from having their home be a place that class trips came to-- --to having to see their father push a broom as a janitor at their school. The kids were now grown, his wife 82 years old.....and as Tommy said...\"Well, they had all lived through it\". Elizabeth Strout weaves together distinctive stories where we are left to marvel at the difficulties - history -and life changing experiences of the many characters. One of the characters that stands out for me was Patty Nicely. Patty understood that most people were only interested in themselves. Except, Sebastian, ( her Sibby, husband; no longer alive), he had been interested in her, and she had been terribly interested in him.  \"This was the skin that protected you from the world \u2013 \u2013 this loving of another person you shared your life with\". Knowing about Sibby's painful childhood - and teen years deepen her own compassion and commitment to the work she did working with adolescents as a school counselor. After a student calls her 'Fatty Patty', the shifting dynamics and tensions are significant. The conclusion to this story left a deep 'thankful' lasting impression on me. A little funny: Angelina visits her 78 year old mother, Mary. The 'entire' story emphasizes the bonds between mother and daughter....which goes deeper than the swim - funny - they are about to take: Angelina says, \"Mom, you're wearing a bikini\"  \"A two-piece, honey. Look around. Do you see one person wearing a one-piece? Except for you? Mary put her goggles on and walked into the water\". Wonderful imagery of windmills, cornfields, and bright soybeans in summertime, Lovely feelings of an old fashion town with red houses, black shutters, with a swing porch, deeply moving intimate prose, psychological awakenings of characters, and we come away with ....anything is possible for anyone.

It is a beautifully written collection of 9 short stories set in Amgash, Illinois. We encounter Lucy Barton through the perspectives of others, where she comes across as a wonderful woman, she has survived difficult circumstances, to become a renowned writer of a well received memoir. I get to finally meet her in Sister, where she finally returns to Amgash only to find it is more than she can bear. Strout's talent in creating and developing diverse characters with such complexity, depth and ordinariness is extraordinary. You meet and learn more about the history and fate of the characters as they criss cross across the stories. The kind and humble Tommy Guptill lost his farm and livelihood when it burned down. His family had to relocate to a poorer part of town and he becomes a janitor at Lucy's school. He received a sign which he has never told anyone else about until he has an uncomfortable encounter with Pete, Lucy's brother. Patty comes to understand that we love imperfectly. Linda's marriage into wealth is of scarce recompense when it comes to the price paid for having Jay as a husband. Charlie's need and relationship with Tracy leads to his marriage crumbling. A mother and daughter relationship gains perspective and depth in Italy. Dottie handles with aplomb the atrocious behaviour of a couple who come to stay at her bed and breakfast. Annie comes to understand why her father forbids her to go into the woods and just how judgmental the local community can be. Abel Blaine, a good man, carries the guilt of being well off, having grown up with extreme poverty. Upon trying to retrieve Sophia's pony, he meets and is forced to converse with Scrooge. His thankfulness in receiving a precious gift leads him to the perfect knowledge that anything is possible for anyone. This almost has me weeping.I am finding it hard to put into words just how much I loved these short stories. The characters have so much grace, humour and love amidst the loss, hardships and travails that life brings. Of course, there are troubled, unkind, difficult, and judgmental characters, but this is what people comprise of. Strout finds the emotional heart and humanity of the Amgash community, and leaves the reader wanting more. Simply brilliant. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Linked stories from Lucy Barton's home town and the people that made up the town. First story features Charlie, former maintenance man at the school the Barton children attended, an elderly man who remembers Lucy and tried to be kind to her, though many didn't. The Barton's too poor and in fact Lucy's brother Pete still lives alone, in the dilapidated house of his youth. Charlie makes a point to visit this lonesome and strange man though he has good reason to write the whole family off as you will see when you read this wonderfully thought out novel.All have stories to tell, of past and present, and they are startling in some of their admissions. Stout has a fantastic understanding of the sorrows, fears, secrets and the many ambiguities that make up the human condition. Not only does she understand but that she is able to put them down so succinctly is admirable. Her deft hand with dialogue is also a big plus. All these stories are interesting, some appalling but taken as a whole we garner a pretty good understanding of where Lucy came from and what and who has changed since she left.Lucy herself puts in an appearance to visit her brother and sister, a visit that has a startling finish. Sometimes you can physically leave a place but the scars still linger. A short novel, but one that contains much.

It's really amusing to watch the dynamics of families and groups of friends, but what's even more fun is making up stories about those we see, developing a narrative about their relationships, challenges, and victories. (It would be great to find out how far from the truth these stories are, wouldn't it?)Reading Elizabeth Strout's new collection of linked stories, \nAnything is Possible\n, feels like a cross between people-watching and eavesdropping, because the stories give you glimpses into people's lives you might not ordinarily get, without facing the embarrassing risk of getting caught. These stories are beautifully written, at times utterly moving, and, like people-watching, often truly fascinating and compelling.I haven't read Strout's \nMy Name is Lucy Barton\n, but the stories in this collection feature Lucy's small Midwestern hometown of Amgash, Illinois, and Lucy has a presence in many of the stories, and an adult Lucy is a character in one. These are stories of people struggling with challenges\u2014emotional, romantic, familial, professional, even philosophical. As Strout says of a character in one of her stories, but this applies to most of them, \"Life had simply not been what she thought it would be.\"My favorites in this collection included: \"The Sign,\" in which an elderly man finds his faith tested after a conversation he has with a troubled man he occasionally looks after; \"Sister,\" where an adult Lucy Barton returns to her hometown and her siblings after being away for nearly 20 years; \"The Hit-Thumb Theory,\" about a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD who has a dilemma that could radically change the course of his life, and he finds a moment's solace in a small bed-and-breakfast; \"Windmills,\" in which a lonely widow changes her life after reading a book written by someone from her hometown; and \"Snow-Blind,\" about a shocking discovery a young actress makes after she has left her family behind.These are not happy, well-adjusted people in many cases. A few of the stories deal with odd sexual situations, and at times the characters are quite mean to each other. But Strout's talent as a storyteller makes even the somewhat bizarre stories, and those with unappealing characters interesting, and you want to keep reading them.Interestingly enough, I've only read one of Strout's earlier books, \nThe Burgess Boys\n, and I didn't like it that much. But now I'll definitely need to read more of her work, because I really found these stories moving and so well-written. If I had any criticism, it's that she uses subsequent stories to advance the plot of previous ones, referring to a character and saying, \"Did you hear that so-and-so did...?\" But that was a minor irritation for me.I know short stories, even linked ones, don't appeal to everyone. But \nAnything is Possible\n feels a little like hanging out a party\u2014you spend some time with lots of different people and get the opportunity to hear something about their lives and what makes them tick, then you move on. But the good news is, you don't have to bring an appetizer, help clean up, or worry how you're going to get home afterward.

I was especially excited to read it because this book is a continuation of My Name Is Lucy Barton, which was moving in so many ways. I was definitely not disappointed. This is a collection of connected stories and probably could be read as a stand alone, but I have to admit that my enjoyment and appreciation of it was enhanced by having met Lucy previously.Some of the unspoken things we surmised about Lucy's childhood from Strout's previous book, are confirmed in the first story, \"The Sign\". Tommy, the school maintenance man tells some sad and lovely anecdotes about Lucy. This was my favorite story. Of course it's ultimately Tommy's story. Not only was he kind to Lucy as a young girl but his kindness continues with looking in on Lucy's recluse brother Pete. Even though these stories are about some of the people in Lucy's past,she is ever present in these character's memories. In \"Windmills\" Patty, a guidance counselor, remembers the tough life Lucy and her siblings had as children and is inspired by Lucy's new book, a memoir, inspired enough to help Lucy's niece get into college. She does this in spite of the rudeness shown to her by the girl. It isn't just the memories that people have of Lucy and their past connection to her, but Lucy herself appears front and center in the story, \"Sister\". Here in a visit with her brother and sister, they confront some of the terrible things they endured at the hands of poor and unfit parents. Yet what is so a amazing to me is that in spite of everything, in spite of Vicky's resentment that Lucy left, there is love between these siblings. \"The Gift\" about one of Lucy's cousins is one that impressed me as well. This one too has memories which ultimately make Abel believe that anything is possible as do many of the other characters. This is structured in a similar way to Olive Kitteridge, with stories that connect so intimately that it had for me the feel of a novel. The writing flows, not an extra word, and the picture she gives of these characters is as clear as if we knew them ourselves. Strout always gives us the realty of living, of the human condition with the sometimes gritty, tough and sad parts along with the beautiful things that give hope and possibility. She remains one of my favorite writers. I received an advanced copy of this from Random House Publishing Group - Random House through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "!! NOW AVAILABLE !!Once again, Elizabeth Strout has exquisitely examined and shared the life of a small group of people in a small town in this lovely compilation of intermingled stories that form this novel. If you\u2019ve already read My Name is Lucy Barton, you\u2019ll be familiar with many of them, and with Lucy. In  \u201cAnything is Possible\u201d, the focus is again on the relationships, in this case most are relatives of one degree or another of Lucy. Siblings. Cousins. Parents. Strained relationships in one way or another, all. Some have shared stories, shameful secrets that they hold close, they can\u2019t share them, can\u2019t lose them, so they continue to hold onto them to hide them from the prying eyes of others. Amgash, Illinois isn\u2019t so much the town that Lucy grew up in; it\u2019s more the small town that Lucy\u2019s family lived on the outskirts of, out where the beyond poor lived. And all through these days in this place, these places, these people, Strout weaves magical links through each of their stories, binding them together in secrets, shame, humility, compassionate service, laughter, pain, fear. All the sorrows, all in the loveliest of simple prose, never using a single unnecessary word, yet leaving nothing unsaid. Each story serves a purpose, conveys a message. This is about Life. These particular lives, yes, but it\u2019s really about every life, all lives. How we hold onto those moments as long as we hold onto life, carrying things we should set down, left behind long ago, but we carry these with us. Never setting them down. Never without them. And yet, we somehow carry on.Highly recommended.Pub Date: 25 April 2017 Many thanks for the ARC provided by Random House"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Once again, here is another book I read for a Goodreads challenge on audio.

I really enjoyed the writing style, I actually felt the difference between chapters when the point of view shifted to that of another character which is amazing in my opinion because everyone has a certain writing style and because of that a lot of the characters end up being written similar enough that you don't really feel the shift as much from one point of view to the next. I don't really like short stories that much but I enjoyed this because all the stories seemed to be threaded around the common theme of Lucy and happening in the same story line enough so that I didn't feel like they were short stories but a sort of continuing narrative. I also loved how complex the characters were, so many of them had faults but I really could empathize with them and how they ended up in the situation and so many times I felt really emotional about the character's problems even though they're supposed to be fictional and all, it just really upset me especially the ending with Abel and the whole time Lucy was visiting her brother Pete and the whole beginning of the story with Tommy.

Those who knew of her as she was able to flee the stifling small town and successfully move on from her own sadness and despair.

Anything is Possible is a collection of nine interrelated stories set around Lucy Barton, a celebrated writer who grew up in extreme poverty in an ostracized family, and her hometown farming community of Amgash, Illinois. While the tales cover many of the folks making brief appearances in My Name is Lucy Barton, reading that short novel is no prerequisite to this set. If you liked the novel, you must read this collection of stellar shorts because it so illuminates the novel's cast of characters who came up in Lucy's recollections from her youth or in conversations with her mom while she was in her hospital room. Strout commandingly evokes gorgeous revealing imagery, but her singular skill lies in creating dialogue so loaded with what is not said, in stories brimming with genuine moral and family dilemmas.In the first story, \"The Sign,\" a retired school janitor visits Lucy's lonely, isolated brother Pete just to check on him. The encounter palpates with a tension arising from long circulating whispers that Lucy's long-deceased dad burned down the man's barn after he was fired for polishing his sausage behind it. The destruction of the barn resulted in the janitor's loss of his farm and forced him into the custodial job. The conversation resulted in Pete's contemplation of years of his mother's emotional neglect and his destruction of a sign after the janitor shared a spiritual moment experienced as he watched his \"burning barn.\"The second and third stories cannily contrast the life paths taken by the two Nicely sisters. In \"Windmills,\" Patty contemplates a life racked by insecurities arising from a weight problems and an unhealthy modesty, even prudishness, wrought by the shock of walking in on her mom having extramarital sex with one of Patty's teachers, vexed by an indelible image of her mother's \"braless ... breasts swaying as that man grabbed one in his mouth.\" \"Cracked\" peeks into the home of the amoral and vacuous Linda and her husband, a violent sexual pervert.In \"The Hit-Thumb Theory,\" a Vietnam vet, trapped in a loveless, sexless marriage, seeks solace and sexual healing from a prostitute who no longer charges for her services because, she says, she's in love with him. He discovers that sex in \"love\" can be much more expensive.Other stories involve everything from the relationship between a daughter and her mother, nicknamed Mississippi Mary, who fell in love on a trip to Italy then left her husband ten years later to move to Italy and marry her lover; Lucy making a brief return trip to her childhood home with unexpected consequences; a widowed cousin, running her own bed and breakfast, exacts a small act of vengeance on snobbish married guests who make it a point to offend her; and, another cousin returns to the local theatre after a performance of The Christmas Carol to retrieve his granddaughter's teddy bear only to be confronted by the down-on-his-luck, suicidal actor who played Scrooge.In the most revealing story ,\"Snow Blind,\" an actress's elderly, demented father has been committed for psychiatric treatment and begins repeatedly spilling the beans on his secret life in graphic ways. \"Annie ... thought how for years onstage she had used the image of walking up the dirt road holding her father's hand, the snow-covered fields spread around them, the woods in the distance, joy spilling through her--how she had used this scene to have tears immediately come to her eyes, for the happiness of it, and the loss of it. And now she wondered if it had even happened, if the road had ever been narrow and dirt, if her father had ever held her hand and said that his family was the most important thing to him.\"More than simply examining the question of how sincerely good, virtuous people endure pettiness and ruthlessness, Strout delves deeper: into the human condition of the people who harm, in a way that wisely, subtly and mercifully looks at the root causes so that we might understand these scoundrels as spiritually sick people.Each of the stories in Anything is Possible is poignant, hopeful and tends to haunt the heart. Collectively, they represent art that refreshingly reveals how anything is possible when one human makes an honest, authentic connection with another.Thank you, Random House and NetGalley, for providing an ARC of this outstanding book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "Firecrackers in my soul!!!Socks knocked off AGAIN! My feet are cold, but my soul is on fire. This collection of stories goes directly to my all-time-favorites shelf. Brilliant, just brilliant. I can barely sit still just thinking about it.I wasn\u2019t super hot to try this collection, because even though I gave My Name Is Lucy Barton 4 stars, I wasn\u2019t all a-gush. I had loved its subtle tension and its introspection, but I had had sort of a hefty Complaint Board. My biggest gripes were that Lucy and her mom were too passive, and everything seemed a little too vague, like it was coated in Valium. So when I heard that this book had to do with Lucy and the small town where she grew up, I was skeptical. What if passivity, vagueness, and boring country folks were the scene? What if my need for jazz and pizazz was again a \u201ctough luck, kiddo\u201d? But I was curious after reading umpteen-million gushing reviews.When I started reading, though, a big \u201cuh oh\u201d slipped from my lips. The first story, BAM, there\u2019s a barn and the God word. I don\u2019t want any \u201coh, gosh\u201d tractor talk and canned-peaches speak, please! I figured I was doomed. But despite my fears, I got totally drawn into the story and ended up loving it. Loneliness, secrets, guilt, memories, reaching out to strangers\u2014these are things I remember when I think about this story. The dialogue is intense and brilliant, and the atmosphere is stark, and if you put the talk inside the stark you get high drama, even though there isn\u2019t some big event making it happen. I fully expected to remain on a farm throughout the rest of the stories, but I was okay with it since story number 1 had been so powerful. When I got to story number 2, though, it was a totally different vibe. It was about a guidance counselor. She was in a small town but there wasn\u2019t any God or peaches. The small town was not the point. This story, too, was insightful, and I loved it.Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t list stories number 3 through 9 and tell you the same thing, that it was oh so insightful and I loved it to death, yada yada, though both are true. One of the things that impressed me was how different each story is. The setting, the personalities, the theme, the vibe\u2014all varied. How did Strout do this? The only word I come up with is genius. As I began each story, I wiggled with glee, oh who are we going to visit today? I couldn\u2019t wait to get there. And I was never disappointed. Not only did I get to sit down in their living rooms, but I also got to sit down inside their heads\u2014oh is that the beauty of literature or what?!Strout has a way of making you feel like you really know these people she creates. Truly, she has amazing psychological insight, and as I implied, she is a master at letting you wander inside her characters\u2019 heads. Her characters repress, express, ponder, hesitate, spill the beans, withhold, confess, get anxious or sad, and very occasionally find peace. Her stories all zero in on intense interactions\u2014between a guidance counselor and a troubled student, a PTSD veteran and a desperate hooker, a grandfather and a crazed actor. These interactions are all buzzy and quiet at the same time. Each story is self-contained and has closure (oh how I love closure), and yet they are interconnected in this cool way. I felt like I was looking at a high school yearbook, with a journalist (ha, or a gossip) sitting beside me, telling me in detail how each person turned out\u2014or actually, taking me over to their house so I can see them in action. I must reread Lucy Barton because I\u2019m dying to hear the gossip that I didn\u2019t care about before. I\u2019m all ears now. Another miraculous thing is that each story has the depth of a novel. Strout serves up robust characters in a well-developed plot, and tops it off with a believable, satisfying, and often profound ending\u2014and she does all this in the cramped span of a short story. Rich rich rich is all I can say.I had my favorites, of course, though I can honestly say I loved every one of the stories. Okay, okay, if I had to say which one I liked least, it would be \u201cMississippi Mary,\u201d which was about a daughter who goes to visit her mother in Italy. I figured out that it was my least favorite because it was about a mother-daughter relationship, and I had an epiphany: I didn\u2019t have a good relationship with my mother, so I don\u2019t want to hear about mother-daughter stuff\u2014good or bad. So, ta-da! I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t completely love My Name is Lucy Barton. My absolute favorite story was \u201cSister,\u201d which was about Lucy coming home to visit her brother and sister. (This was the only story about Lucy, even though she is mentioned in several stories.) There\u2019s an odd story about a perverted husband, which is also high on my list, and a funny story about a pissed-off B&B owner. Another favorite was the last story, \u201cGift,\u201d about a grandfather stuck in a room with a crazed actor. Oh my god was it great.Time for a list of favorites (pulled from various stories):Favorite scene: a woman having a panic attackFavorite line: \"No one should be in a room with a man who's at the end of his rope.\"Second favorite line:\u201cDon\u2019t you go pissing down my back and then tell me it\u2019s raining outside.\u201dThis line is pretty cool, too:\u201cTo listen to a person is not passive. To really listen is active, and Dottie had really listened.\u201dCan you tell this character is a little depressed?--\"You could buy a snow blower or a nice wool dress for your wife, but beneath it all people were rats scurrying off to find garbage to eat, another rat to hump, making a nest in broken bricks, and soiling it so sourly that one\u2019s contribution to the world was only more excrement.\"Here is one of my favorite dialogues. The funny thing is, the woman talking isn\u2019t in the least crazy\u2014she\u2019s just pissed. And her comments totally make sense, though Dr. Small doesn\u2019t know it:\u201c'Precisely what I said is what I mean. I offer guests a bed, and I offer them breakfast. I do not offer them counsel from lives they find unendurable.\u2019 She closed her eyes briefly, then continued, \u2018Or from marriages that are living deaths, from disappointments suffered at the hands of poor friends who regard their houses as a penis. This is not what I do.\u2019\u201d\u201c'Jesus,\u201d said Dr. Small, who was backing away from her. \u201cYou\u2019re a whackjob.'\u201dI could keep adding quotes but I don\u2019t want my review to be any more gargantuan than it already is. I did get my jazz and pizazz, oh yes. And as far as I'm concerned, these stories are perfection. I don\u2019t have even one item to put on my Complaint Board; it\u2019s in the shed, collecting cobwebs. I hope that this wasn\u2019t Strout\u2019s sole trip into short-story land; I want her to stay there. O\u2019Henry, Cheever, Carver\u2014move over. Her stories are as deep and wavy as the ocean.

I am absolutely certain that Stout could write a book about watching pain peel off a wall and I would read it. I love her writing. I read books and think that they are good and then I read Stout and think \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" I can't quite put my finger on exactly what it is that draws me to her writing. She has a gift. She is a brilliant Author who can take people and their lives and add a certain type of brilliance to their story. This book was written in tandem to \"My name is Lucy Barton\" and showcases the people who grew up with Lucy and continue to live in their small town. Each had some type of connection to either Lucy Barton herself or her family. Their stories are told in the form of short stories. I am not a short story fan but I loved these beautifully written short stories. These short stories are about people and their relationships. The people struggle with love, greed, jealousy, abandonment, loneliness, ptsd, and guilt to name a few. Her characters are well developed, interesting, likable (some not likable), and compelling. Some characters are full of compassion, understanding, humor, and are able to take things as they come. They do not let hardship get in their way of living a full life, while other characters are uncaring, sick, and have their own personal demons.I am not going to give a synopsis of this book. Please seek out a copy and read this for yourself. If you have not read stout before, start with \"Olive Kitteridge\" and go from there. Stout does not disappoint. Her words are her gift. There is something so lovely and graceful about her writing. I love opening up, and falling into her books.I received a copy of this book from Random House and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41464918-linda", "userReview": "I read \"My Name Is Lucy Barton\" last year, which was my introduction to Elizabeth Strout's writing style. All I remember about that book were the feelings it provoked in me--unresolved feelings that were all too familiar with my own mother. I became so caught up in the strained relationship between Lucy and her mother and the hurt that had been festering all those years that I don't remember any of the people from Lucy's hometown who were mentioned. I only remember the small talk, taking the place of what so desperately needed to be said. I just wanted the two of them to heal all that pain. \"Anything Is Possible,\" is a journey back to Lucy's hometown and is a compilation of short stories pertaining to her family and neighbors. Strout has an amazing way of bringing every character alive. I was immediately involved with each one of them in such an intimate way. I wanted to know more and read more. I want to pick up that book right now and continue reading. Trying to describe this talented author's beautiful writing is impossible. It has to be experienced.When I wonder how this book that is so simply constructed and easily read has left such an enormous impact on me, I'm reminded of my years studying dance. My instructor once told me that the easier you make your performance look, the more difficult it is to achieve.Elizabeth Strout, you have become one of my top-five favorite authors, and \"Anything Is Possible\" deserves nothing less than five stars.Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "This book is a series of related short stories, linked to each other, but also linked through connections to Lucy Barton. Raised in extreme poverty, Lucy Barton manages to escape the confinement of her class through education, hard work, and most of all by leaving the environment of her origins. Whether the connection is direct or peripheral, the people in this book know Lucy Barton, or know of her, or know people who know people who knew Lucy Barton.Through sadness, contentment, pain, joy, sorrow, serenity, tragedy, triumph, spitefulness, sincerity \u2013 through a kaleidoscope of human emotion, these are their stories.At one point, a young girl in this book asks her brother to do something with her and he replies that he doesn\u2019t have an appetite for it. I did have an appetite for this amazing nine-course meal, and voraciously consumed it all. Each course is a delicacy and savouring it made me want to eat only that. Yet when the plate was whisked away and the next course served, my appetite was focused entirely on that course. In the end, I felt I had been treated to one of the finest literary banquets I have been privileged to attend.I recommend this book to anyone who has read \u201cMy Name is Lucy Barton\u201d and/or to anyone who enjoys exceptionally well written stories about very real people living very real lives."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie", "userReview": "I feel so compelled to have your attention right now. Have your attention, but not have it for me, or my words or my ego. . . but for you and your soul and for this book of Ms. Strout's.Wow. Damn it. It's been a long time since a book has caused me to feel this agitated, this moved, this conflicted.I had to force myself to walk outside, at a brisk pace, circling my yard several times, before I could commit to sitting down and writing this. Even so, I still feel edgy, irritated, worried that I will lack the skills to communicate what I want to about this collection.This started out as a perfectly pleasant read for me; I love interconnected short stories, have preferred them as a literary device since my early days of being a Salinger stalker, a lover of all members of the family named Glass, and I felt overjoyed at this discovery and perfectly at home with this writing.But, three stories in, I felt thwarted, felt my passion wane. Stories number 3 & 4 (out of 9) are. . . well, they're icky. You've got your early sex abuse (sodomy, no less) mentioned in story #2, but it's mentioned in passing, giving us background as to why a man's life was ruined, but in stories #3 and 4. . . Strout takes us to some very dark places with a rapist and then a Vietnam vet struggling with PTSD.To be honest, I became turned off enough with these stories, I had to take a break from them, to clear my head and debate whether I wanted to continue. I am so very grateful I did.Short Story #5, Mississippi Mary, is one of the most understated, most brilliant short works of fiction I have ever read in my life, and I am one well-read lady, y'all.This story made me throw the book away from me, onto a coffee table as I shouted \u201cFuck!\u201d It also made me run for the post-it notes and start scribbling, then caused me to crack open my journal, writing very hard and very quickly on its pages. Last, it provoked me to take a turn (as Ms. Austen would say) around the garden. Several times.It's a simple story (in the same way you could say Steinbeck's stories are simple\u2014ha!) in that the entire story takes place in one apartment with two women who are basically. . . talking and thinking. One woman is a 78-year-old mother named Mary, who, after 51 years of marriage, has left her husband for a man named Paolo and his country of Italy. The other is the wounded, forty-something daughter named Angela who is on a hiatus from her marriage, and is still angry at her mother for leaving their father.Strout is so adept, so brilliant as a writer, she helps you sympathize temporarily with the upset daughter, then flips you over to see Mom's side just as clearly.Daughter sees mom as simple and a bit ditzy, as a woman who made an impulsive decision to leave a marriage after five decades, and Mother sees daughter as lovely but uninformed and not quite seasoned enough yet to truly comprehend the affairs of the heart or regret or suffering.I feel stunned by this collection, enough to order my own copy immediately and re-read it all again. I feel compelled to recommend it to you with every cell of my being, and I leave you with one particularly pensive paragraph from Mississippi Mary:Lying on her bed\u2014where she spent much of her days\u2014Mary looked at the high ceiling and thought that what her daughter could not understand was what it had been like to be so famished. Almost fifty years of being parched. At her husband's forty-first birthday surprise party\u2014and Mary had been so proud to make it for his forty-first so he'd be really surprised, and boy he was really surprised\u2014she had noticed how he did not dance with her, not once. Later she realized he was just not in love with her. And at the fiftieth wedding anniversary party the girls threw them, he did not ask her to dance either. You never knew anything, and anyone who thought they knew anything\u2014well, they were in for a great big surprise."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "Anything Is Possible\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 5 Convincing Stars!\n\u201cSarah Payne, the day she told us to go to the page without judgment, reminded us that we never knew, and never would know, what it would be like to understand another person fully.\"\n\u2015 Elizabeth Strout, My Name is Lucy Barton***********************************************I received a free advance e-copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, thank you!In My Name Is Lucy Barton, the critically acclaimed 2016 novel that is the prequel to this book, there's a scene where someone asks Lucy's mentor, Sarah Payne, what she thought of her role as a fiction writer. Her response was at once surprisingly simple and illuminating:\"Her job as a writer of fiction was to report on the human condition, she said, \" to tell us who we are and what we think and what we do.\"Elizabeth Strout has the rare gift of writing about the darkest of human emotions with empathy but also in a matter of factly, sobering kind of way. She leaves enough space to find a sense of hope and wonder at what we humans are able to overcome, but it is mostly up to the reader to arrive there. The nine, loosely connected stories included in Anything Is Possible, can be perfectly appreciated on their own but I do believe reading My Name Is Lucy Barton first would add symmetry and provide a better context. In any case, perhaps because of the long-lasting impression the character Lucy Barton had on me, in my mind both these books are inevitably intertwined.My Name Is Lucy Barton focuses on a writer raised in extreme poverty as part of a very dysfunctional family. Her mother, whom she hasn't seen in years, comes to visit as she recovers from complications after a simple surgery. They exchanged gossip and reminisce about Lucy's childhood and the people she grew up with in the rural town of Amgash, Illinois. Anything Is Possible offers a peek into the life of some of those characters and, for those of us who felt in love with Lucy, Strout provides additional pieces of the puzzle allowing us to get a much complete picture of who she is, of the other members of her family and the community and the people that, for good or bad, played a role in her upbringing.I enjoyed most of the stories but here are a few favorites: In \nWindmills\n, Patty Nicely is working as a high school guidance counselor. She finds herself trying to encourage Lila (Lucy's niece) to pursue a higher education. After Lila viciously insults Patty by telling her that she's known as \"Fatty Patty\" among her peers, things get a little complicated.\nCracked\n features Patty's sister Linda. Linda's husband is a rapist whose latest victim might prove to be his last. Even with a creepy character and a disturbing storyline, this story was compulsive reading for me. Sister, features Lucy, now an established author, as she decides to go back home to visit her estranged siblings Peter and Kathy, which she hasn't seen in more than 17 years. This story is complex and wonderfully captures the intricate dynamics of siblinghood. Sometimes your siblings can at once be your harshest critics and your most loyal allies.\nGift\n, the last story, opens as Abel Blaine an older, successful businessman, gets delayed at a company meeting as he's scheduled to attend a performance of A Christmas Carol with his family. After his granddaughter forgets her favorite toy, he goes back to the theater to try to find it. A chance encounter with a disturbed actor will change his life forever.There are recurrent themes, including the struggles of the white working class and the long-lasting effects of experiencing physical and emotional neglect. We also witness how envy and resentment can throw people's lives into a spiral of misery and hopelessness. Perhaps you would be hard-pressed to find grandstanding epiphanies or memorable quotes here, but by pulling the curtain and giving us a glimpse into the lives of these deeply flawed characters, Strout shows how sometimes we are so wrapped up in our own lives that we failed to see how others might have endured more hardships and adversity than we ever have. And so, if the ultimate goal of a fictional writer is to chronicle the human condition, Strout is, in the view of many, a master at accomplishing this. And I love that she seems to go out of her way to avoid passing judgment or conversely, to vouch for the character of her characters. At the end, she trusts her readers to figure out what the moral of the story is.A very rewarding reading experience, highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "A masterful collection of nine connected stories. They all feature people with origins from a fictional rural northern Illinois community, Amgash, and triangulate with Lucy Barton, who moved away and became a successful writer. They were all affected one way or another by one in their midst who survived such abject poverty that she and her two cousins resorted to eating out of dumpsters. Now seventeen years later, her friends, family, and former enemies have all moved on in their lives, some changed for the better, others fulfilling their meanness or weakness evident in their younger selves. Some find Lucy\u2019s success as a shining example of hope while others are jealous or envious over the fate of someone who seemed the epitome of \u201ctrash.\u201d As one example, here is the reaction of a former enemy of Lucy to her book:Now , as Patty drove into her driveway, saw the lights she\u2019d left on, she realized that Lucy Barton\u2019s book had understood her. That was it\u2014the book had understood her. \u2026Lucy Barton had her own shame; oh boy did she have her own shame. And she had risen right straight out of it. Each character featured in a story experiences a sort of epiphany which comes from a sudden breaking down of barriers with another person or a surprising revelation about someone they know closely. A school janitor, Tommy, who befriended Lucy during all her years of staying alone in the after school period, now seeks to build a bridge with her reclusive older brother Peter. He learns that Peter always assumed that he and Lucy\u2019s father was guilty of burning down his farm whereas Tommy for his part had long come to see the disaster as an act of God which ultimately benefitted his children with the humbling outcome. In another story, a school guidance counselor, Patty, is attacked by one of Lucy\u2019s nieces as \u201cFatty Patty\u201d and a likely virgin, but somehow she breaks though to forgiveness and compassion for her to offer a pathway to hope in her life. In a third story, Lucy\u2019s cousin Dottie lets one guest at her bed and breakfast unload a lot of twisted detail in her unhappy life with a doctor. When it turns out she has been used, she finds a way to seek a bit of revenge while at the same time finds grace in letting another more deserving guest unburden himself in wordless grief over some unspeakable pain. Another kind of sudden window between souls is experienced by Dottie\u2019s brother Abel when he returns to a theater to retrieve his granddaughter\u2019s toy pony and gets waylaid by the confessions of a depressed homosexual actor who portrayed Scrooge. In my favorite story in the collection, Angelina, a school teacher friend of Patty\u2019s, visits her mother in Italy, where in her 70s she has taken up a new life with a much younger man after 50 years of unhappy marriage to her father. The balm of her mother\u2019s love is still there for her as Angelina comes to reveal the failure of her own marriage. Three stories stand out as a particular twist away from the parallel themes of the book. In two cases, a sudden breach between people is the focus instead of a surprising bridge. In one, a Vietnam veteran with PTSD is breaking up with his mistress and shows some surprising kindness that damages the marriage he is trying to protect. In another case, one of the hauty, superior \u201cNicely girls\u201d who were so cruel and bullying to Lucy in her childhood undergoes a form of karma when her wealthy husband reveals his true colors as a lecher and abuser of a woman photographer who stays in their home as an artist-in-residence at the local college. The third story to stretch the mold is the one that features Lucy herself visiting her brother Peter and sister Vicky for the first time since leaving. Just as progress is being made toward relief of the jealousies and misunderstanding between them, the step to epiphany is interrupted by a panic attack that overwhelms Lucy and forces her to leave. The strategy on Strout\u2019s part seems to be to leave it up to the reader to complete the bridging more explicit in the other stories. I was very moved by the forms of human connection on display in this book. Strout has quickly become one of my favorite authors. She is so competent at spinning tales with potent truths embedded or resonating out of them, with no hint of pretentious self-indulgence. I thought it was brilliant how the hope of a surprising transformation of understanding between people, as expressed in the book\u2019s title, \u201cAnything is Possible,\u201d turns out to conform to the very last line of the book. The best \"take home\" message for me comes from Patty's urge to comfort Angelina over her disconnection with her mother:But she wanted to say right now: Listen to this! Lucy Barton\u2019s mother was awful to her, and her father\u2014oh dear God, her father \u2026 But Lucy loved them, she loved her mother, and her mother loved her! We\u2019re all just a mess, Angelina, trying hard as we can, we love imperfectly, Angelina, but it\u2019s okay.This book was provided by the publisher for review through the Netgalley program."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "I loved Elizabeth Strout's My Name Is Lucy Barton. It was a short tight novel about an author reflecting on her harsh childhood and adult life while lying in a hospital bed with her mother at her side. There was something about Lucy that really touched me. My expectations were therefore high for Everything Is Possible. It's a collection of connected stories that are also linked to My Name Is Lucy Barton -- stories about people from Lucy's childhood town, bringing a different perspective to Lucy's childhood and background. Stroud is an incredibly skilled writer. With few words, she creates nuanced characters, and gives them individuated personalities and vivid backstories. And she has a special talent for creating atmosphere -- skilfully moving through different moods and resonances. But with the exception of one story, I didn't love Everything Is Possible in the same way I loved My Name Is Lucy Barton. Don't get me wrong. I really liked many of the stories, but they didn't touch me in the same way as Lucy Barton. So not surprisingly the story I liked the most is the one featuring Lucy and her two siblings -- titled \"Sister\" -- in which Lucy comes to her home town for a visit. The collection as a whole is well worth reading, but if you love Lucy Barton as much as I did I suggest going in with tempered expectations so that the stories can be appreciated for what they are.

Poi, Lucy guarisce, divorzia, scrive un altro libro: ed eccola qui, in tour per gli Stati Uniti a promuoverlo, firmando copie e dediche.Nel suo giro promozionale torna anche a casa sua, ad Amgash, dalle parti di Chicago (geograficamente, nulla a che vedere con la Falls del Maine dove sono ambientati i primi romanzi della Strout, in realt\u00e0 son tante le similitudini), e rivede fratello e sorella, l\u2019<> Vickie e Pete.Main street.In queste pagine Strout spinge i suoi personaggi su sentieri diversi dal solito, li porta sull\u2019orlo di fatti ed emozioni pi\u00f9 rischiosi del solito: \u00e8 un\u2019umanit\u00e0 in parte diversa dalla Strout che conosco, pi\u00f9 contemporanea, meno racchiusa in quello stereotipo letterario alla Haruf, un po\u2019 fuori dal tempo e a volte un po\u2019 troppo dolciastro, che acchiappa ma a distanza convince sempre meno. Qui, invece, mi pare di incontrare gente pi\u00f9 contemporanea e pi\u00f9 verosimile, si parla di cose e succedono cose che sembrano pi\u00f9 credibili e attuali: inclusa (perfino!) una ricca coppia che nella loro villa da archi star (alle pareti Picasso e Hopper) ospitano nella dependance donne artiste in visita, di modo che lui, il marito padrone di casa, possa spiarle mentre fanno la doccia e si infilano il pigiama con le telecamere nascoste nei muri collegate al suo portatile, e magari anche tentare di stuprarle, o farlo davvero, chiss\u00e0, Strout viene dalla scuola buona e lascia il finale incerto.Questa volta Strout mi regala una sensazione che mi piace pi\u00f9 del solito, mi porta un po\u2019 pi\u00f9 in l\u00e0: la sensazione di parlare di sentimenti che si spingono oltre i canoni, quella di esplorare territori pi\u00f9 rischiosi, dove, per esempio, abitano perversione, crudelt\u00e0, deviazione, dove la gente ha voglia, e bisogno, di lavarsi l\u2019anima, dove il pi\u00f9 affascinante di tutti \u00e8 l\u2019Uomo dal Dolore Indicibile (altro personaggio che spunta in vari racconti).La provincia, Midwest o East Coast, \u00e8 sempre quella dove si vive nell\u2019illusione di conoscersi tutti, la gente si incrocia ogni giorno, per cinquant\u2019anni, e crede di conoscere chi vede e saluta, ma non sanno davvero nulla l\u2019uno dell\u2019altro, solo l\u2019apparenza, solo il vestito, il paesaggio interiore rimane sconosciuto, si afferra qualcosa solo di quello esteriore.La casa nella prateria.La gente in queste pagine, i reduci di guerra, le obese, quelli con problemi sessuali o del tutto senza vita sessuale, sembrano tutti sempre comunicare di pi\u00f9 nel silenzio, anche se il desiderio di essere compresi, la paura di non esserlo, spingono alla parola. In quei rari momenti in cui si concretizza l\u2019urgenza d\u2019essere accolti, e in genere si tratta di un momento di grazia, s\u2019istaura connessione, che forse \u00e8 anche comprensione. Ma non necessariamente. Pu\u00f2 succedere.Tutto pu\u00f2 succedere \u00e8, in fondo, questo: pu\u00f2 succedere che a settant\u2019anni s\u2019incontri l\u2019amore su un lungomare d\u2019Italia - ma anche no, quell\u2019amore pu\u00f2 finire, ma anche no. Pu\u00f2 succedere che una pena indicibile possa essere consolata per una sera davanti alla tv di un b&b - ma anche no, oppure il dolore si ripresenta altrettanto indicibile la mattina dopo, ma anche no, e comunque rimane quell\u2019attimo di gentilezza, di grazia, cui voltarsi, cui aggrapparsi. Pu\u00f2 succedere che il padre che ti ha tenuto per mano da bambina camminando verso casa, donandoti il momento di gioia pi\u00f9 intenso della tua vita, da vecchio diventi demente e si scopra che ha nascosto alla famiglia la sua omosessualit\u00e0 per tutta la vita, nonostante abbia avuto una lunghissima relazione con un uomo. Sprazzi imprevedibili in grado di toccare e connettere l\u2019uno l\u2019altro, respiri, senso.L\u2019illustrazione di copertina di Giordano Poloni.Col tempo Strout ha imparato a risparmiare parole, i suoi ultimi due libri sono pi\u00f9 snelli dei quattro che hanno preceduto: eppure sembrano pi\u00f9 ricchi, pi\u00f9 polposi.Come al solito con i suoi libri il finale \u00e8 il punto dolente: questa volta il vaso della melassa rimane in dispensa, ma \u00e8 comunque la zona pi\u00f9 zoppicante del romanzo, la pi\u00f9 palesemente costruita, un po\u2019 artificiosa, un po\u2019 zoppicante.Elizabeth Strout nel film documentario \"La prodigieuse Elena Ferrante\", andato in onda sul canale franco-tedesco Arte nel marzo del 2018."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "4.5 StarsOh.

This book, written simultaneously with Lucy Barton, explores the folks still living in Lucy\u2019s hometown. Like Olive Kitteridge, it is a series of short stories all interwoven around folks that know each other. Strout totally gets that small town mentality, how everyone knows each other and not just each other but their entire families. And how what someone was like growing up or what their parents did colors how they are thought of for years to come. While Lucy has escaped to New York City, these are the folks that have stayed behind. I will be the first to admit I'm not usually a fan of short stories. But these stories are something different and they pulled me in. It helps that they are connected, that each one builds on its predecessor. And therefore, there is forward motion. Because at heart it's the lack of movement that bothers me the most about short stories. It is not necessary to have read Lucy Barton first. But this book definitely makes me want to go back and read that book. For those that have read it, I think a lot of the characters will feel like coming home. Stout's writing isn't what I would call lush.

Elizabeth Strout is one of my favourite writers and I loved My Name Is Lucy Barton, so I was predisposed to enjoy this. And I did. She catches people when they are most vulnerable.Lucy, her family and other townsfolk she and her mother reminisced about in the previous book feature in separate stories and occasionally appear in each other\u2019s. Whether you connect all the dots or not doesn't really matter, but of course when you do make the connections, it multiplies the enjoyment.

You don\u2019t need to know them to get the gist of who they are and enjoy the gossip about them. Strout\u2019s people are captured almost like deer in the headlights. They aren\u2019t expecting anyone to look at them too closely and they don\u2019t welcome it. They turn away, fearful of letting you get too close, but Strout manages to snap the picture before they escape. And she stops a few in their tracks until they blurt out something they\u2019d managed to keep private until now.Most of the people have their guard up and converse side-by-side, but now and then, without warning, something triggers and \u201cShe looked straight into his eyes, and he saw it was her; he saw his sister.\u201dI\u2019ve been startled like that myself with my family \u2013 that sudden feeling of deep familiarity instead of the usual everyday relationship.Many of these people are outcasts who have felt unloved or unworthy of being loved. But sometimes, they find someone.\u201cEveryone, she understood, was mainly and mostly interested in themselves. Except Sibby had been interested in her, and she had been terribly interested in him. This was the skin that protected you from the world\u2014this loving of another person you shared your life with.\u201dAnd then, of course, there are others, like this woman who\u201c. . . would have liked her own husband, whose intelligence had once impressed her so, to simply disappear.\u201dThere are people affected by poverty, isolation, and war, particularly Vietnam.\u201cMany young people did not know the name of the war he had served in. Was it because it was a conflict instead of a war? Was it because the country in its shame had pushed this war behind it like a child who in public was still being obstreperous, embarrassing? Or was it just the way that history went? He did not know. . . . \u2018Sorry, uhm, was that in the first Iraq?\u2019 Then Charlie wanted to cry, he wanted to bawl, he wanted to bellow: \u2018We did that and for what, for what, for what?\u2019\u201dFor what, for what, for what, indeed? But with all the questions about war and life, Strout's people still find comfort in each other.Wonderful stories and people.

While I see glowing accolates and many 4.5 and 5 star reviews, I just had a hard time connecting with it. I cannot put my finger on the exact reason. Strout's My Name Is Lucy Barton was extraordinary, and this book is written in a similar vein. Strout takes us to Lucy's hometown where we meet people from her past as well as her siblings. Every person is so completely *human* -- flawed, imperfect, and in this book, profoundly sad (perhaps that was my issue. Right book, wrong time. Perhaps I just couldn't handle the deep melancholy that pervades the book right now). Strout is one of America's best living writers, but I found myself avoiding this book rather than savoring it.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House for a galley of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "Connected short stories are a particular favourite of mine - so I only have myself to blame for not having started reading Elizabeth Strout's books earlier. And after this absolutely brilliant book I feel a bit stupid. Because I totally, 100 % adored this - and I think I would have liked it even more, had I read her other books first. There are connections there that I would have enjoyed more and scenes that I am sure would have been even more poignant. This is the only reason why I rated the book with four instead of five stars - because it could have been better if I had known some characters differently. I will remedy this as soon as possible though and buy the rest of her books.Elizabeth Strout has a way of creating brilliance out of ordinary situations and and she tells the stories' of ordinary, real, believable characters. The stories that worked best for me were mostly the ones where nothing drastic happens and you still leave the characters feeling like you know them, know their souls, and - because there is an underlying sadness in every single story - know their pain. But even though the stories told are sad there is a hopefulness here, an inkling of a chance of everything turning out fine in the end. Human connection is at the core of this novel and I absolutely loved it for this. Elizabeth Strout excels in depicting families - in all their glory and dysfunction and it feels immensely real and relatable. Short stories are a difficult medium to pull this off with, and she does it with an incredible talent.....I think I have just talked myself into giving this book five stars after all. Bloody brilliant.____I received an arc of this book curtesy of NetGalley and Penguin Books in exchange for an honest review.

Elizabeth Strout, how I love thee!This amazing collection of 9 short stories revolves around the community of Amgash, Illinois, the hometown of Lucy Barton, the leading lady of Strout's previous novel (\"My Name is Lucy Barton\"). You don't necessarily need to read \"Lucy Barton\" first to tackle and enjoy this collection, but I highly recommend it. Lucy's backstory does illuminate several of these narratives.Strout's characters are all loosely connected in some way across these nine stories and Lucy Barton makes a welcome appearance in one of them. Strout's writing is perfection as always, but where these stories really shine is in her incredibly perceptive eye for humanity; our flaws, cruelties, kindnesses, loneliness, redemptions and all of the messes we make living our lives. Life is often not what we expected or planned for in our youth, but we find ways to adapt, survive and carry on.This reminded me a lot of Kent Haruf's books, so if you are a fan, you will probably enjoy these stories - although \"enjoy\" might not be the right word. Some of the stories are pretty dark, but there is always a glimmer of salvation - because, after all, \"Anything is Possible.\"I read this twice because I loved it so, but it also helped me make connections between the many characters that I missed the first time through. A real gem; I highly recommend this or any of Strout's works.Thanks to Netgalley and Random House Publishing for an ARC of this lovely collection. My review is based on the hardcover version, however."}, {"userName": "JanB ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb", "userReview": "In this book of short stories, Strout delves into the lives of the people from Amgash, IL. We first met them through the stories Lucy's mother told as she sat at Lucy's bedside in My Name Is Lucy Barton.Strout examines these character's rich inner lives...the emotions, sadness, and pain underlying the face they present to the world. Can anyone really truly know another person? In this book we are given a peek into what make them who they are. The traumas in their past follows them into adulthood, and there are stories that will break your heart.If this sounds unrelentingly depressing, know that amid the sadness there are moments of hope, grace, kindness, compassion, and human connection. Anything is possible. Lucy makes only a brief appearance in \"Sisters\", one of my favorite stories. But all of the stories are linked in some way. One of the creepiest is \"Cracked\", about Linda and Jay. Linda's mother abandoned the family when she was a young child and through her sister Patty's chapter, the reader is privy to information that even Linda doesn't know. I love that Strout assumes her readers are intelligent enough to draw conclusions, fill in the blanks, and find meaning in what she doesn't say, as well in what she does say. It's difficult not to race through this book but I suggest slowing down if you can and savoring each thought-provoking story. It's not necessary to read My Name is Lucy Barton before this one, but you will surely want to read it afterward.** I received a copy of the book for review from Netgalley/Random House"}, {"userName": "Anne Bogel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7494963-anne-bogel", "userReview": "I loved this.
