This book was fantastic!Why does King start the book with an apology/warning? This book is now definitely in my top 10 favorite King books (if not the top 5)Seems like this one is even frequently skipped by King fans - please, stop skipping and read!This book has a great story and great characters. It is quick and easy to read and kept me interested every page. Blaze is a flawed but easy to sympathize tragic hero who doesn't really know what he is doing, but thinks he is doing it for the best. The course of his life is driven by unfortunate events and I am left wondering how much different it would have been if the cards hadn't been stacked against him.This book has so much going for it - and I think almost anyone would enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "OMG........I cannot believe how good this book is.......well, there were a couple things that bothered me in the narration sequence, particularly the final flash from the past, but I'm still surprised at the overall low ratings.This is not your typical Stephen King (Richard Bachman) read, as a matter of fact, King did not originally think it worthy of being published, but be prepared, there are scary times, a kind of horror of a different sort you might say, that caused me multiple OH NO! and OMG! moments.It's not easy to entice a reader to like a character that kidnaps a baby (no spoiler here) but Mr. King accomplished just that for me with BLAZE.....his GREAT BIG 6' 7\" doofus of a man who begins his early life with a busted head and slow brain through no fault of his own, and takes the reader on an intense, worrisome and exasperating adventure that results in a non-stop action filled conclusion.\nUpdate: November 24, 2016 - Turkey Day\nMEMORY is a short bonus read that follows BLAZE about two horrible accidents one of which is a lead-in to KING'S novel DUMA KEY that was published back in 2008. Sounds pretty darn good too!"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Aided by the voice of his dead friend George in his head, a slow goliath named Blaze kidnaps an infant and holds him for ransom. Can Blaze hold things together long enough to collect the ransom?Blaze is a straight up crime book from Stephen King, aside from the voice of George in Blaze's head, which might not even be supernatural in origin. I have to wonder why this wasn't the book Stephen King offered up to Hard Case instead of The Colorado Kid.The story of Blaze unfolds in two parallel stories, one of the present day kidnapping and the other of Blaze's past, how a beating at the hands of his father rendered him a simpleton and landed him in the state home. I found Blaze's past way more interesting than his kidnapping scheme, which had some ludicrous moments due to Blaze not really knowing what he was doing. When the wheels predictably come off, things quickly go to hell in a handbasket.For the most part, this book was just kind of there for me. Blaze was the only really memorable character for me. I thought that for a book that was less than 400 pages, there was a bit of the King bloat in effect. While I liked it, it almost fell back into the \"it's okay\" realm. Maybe it was a wrong book, wrong time scenario.Apparently Stephen King wrote the original draft of Blaze around the same time he was writing Carrie. Carrie got picked up and Blaze fell by the wayside until King decided to revive it while on the Lisey's Story tour. Why he stuck the Bachman name on it, I don't know. It feels more King than Bachman to me.Three out of five stars but it's a weak three."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "This was a bit of a return to the old classic King, sans monsters and gore. It's a novel King wrote 30-odd years ago, then rediscovered and polished up and released as the last of his Bachman books. Ironically, I found it to be one of the better stories of his I've read recently, but I always have had a bit of a preference for his older stories - his newer stuff often just doesn't quite strike the right chord with me.King has always been good with stories that pull up the carpets on small town America and look at what's crawling around between the planks of the floorboards. Blaze is about a huge galoot of a man, Clayton Blaisdell, Jr., who's as slow-witted as he is strong-bodied. Basically a genial soul who doesn't want to hurt anyone and whose only sin was being born into a crapsack world where he never got a break, the book alternates between Blaze's childhood, growing up in an (of course) abusive orphanage and his adulthood, where he has become the sort of small-time criminal everyone predicted he'd become. His partner of many years, George, who was the brains of their two-man outfit, has died, leaving Blaze to fend for himself. Blaze is trying to pull off George's last scheme, a kidnapping and ransom plot. Unfortunately, without George's brains to think through the plotting, Blaze's plan can't possibly end well.The climax is fairly predictable - we know from the beginning that this poor sap never had a chance, so there isn't much suspense about how it's all going to turn out. But King, in his marvelous way when he's focusing on characterization and writing relatively economically, sketches out the life and personality of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr. for us, until we see him as a human being, a good guy in a bad place who made bad choices through little fault of his own, but mostly was just kicked around by a harsh, unfeeling world. And then we see the things he does, things which would make any reasonable person looking at his history but without the reader's knowledge of everything that happened alongside it, the context that framed the events and his actions, believe that he is just a two-bit thug and little more than a monster. To the rest of the world, that's all he is, but by the end you, the reader, just want to give this guy a hug.Stephen King can be very sentimental when he wants to be, though he never goes for schmaltz. Blaze is about as close to a tearjerker as I've ever read from him. It's not all sparkling prose and the plot is perhaps a bit too predictable - even after King's very belated editing, this is obviously an earlier work. But it demonstrates that King has always been able to write fine suspense novels and fine human dramas, and his writing deserves to be taken seriously."}, {"userName": "Medhat The Book Fanatic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17165680-medhat-the-book-fanatic", "userReview": "DNFed on page 76I hated this book from the very first page. I didn't like the atmosphere of it. I didn't like the writing, which, to me at least, felt very dry. And I didn't like the two main characters; not even Blaze, who is soft in the head (I am sorry if that sounds inhuman to say, but it is how I felt), and I thought that he isn't an interesting character, as far as I've read. I just didn't care about anyone and anything.Also, I need to say that I was very excited to read Blaze, especially since I was buddy-reading it with Mrs. Janie, from Bookworms Buddy, who is a fantastic Booktuber . . . But the book didn't work out to me.Of course, I wouldn't say DON'T READ THIS BOOK, because I haven't read the whole thing (Because I was impatient), and I can't judge it as a whole (because it might indeed turn out to be worth the read, but like I said 'I was impatient'), only from what I so far read . . .I hope this review does not irritate you from reading this book, but every one of us is entitled to our opinions, and this is mine. Anyway, I need to say that this is my first Stephen King book that I am not putting hold for a future reading (just because I couldn't get into it at this reading) ...

This story is a mixture of a thriller, a mystery, a police procedural, and a personal struggle to figure out who you are. Blaze, aka Clayton Blaisdell, Jr., is a dummy, and he knows it. Ever since his father threw him down a flight of stairs (and then hauled him back up and did it a couple of more times), Blaze hasn't had the brains for learning. The dent in his forehead might make him look scary, but we soon learn that Blaze isn't much of a threat -- except when he's really angry. He might look like a giant at 6'7\" and nearly 300 pounds, but this man's heart is as soft as his mind. Blaze has pretty much drifted through life by skirting the law and mostly (with exceptions) avoiding trouble. When he meets George Rackley, Blaze learns the art of the con. The two of them (or, rather, George) have been planning one big job for awhile now. That big job would be kidnapping the baby of a rich couple, collecting the ransom, and living the high-life somewhere with white sandy beaches and lots of sun. But we soon learn that things aren't going quite the way either man had expected. For one, George is dead, even though he's still helping with the kidnapping plot. For another, Blaze, as we've already learned, isn't the smartest guy around. What follows is a mixture of present day mystery/thriller as Blaze carries out the kidnapping of little Joey, mixed with the flashbacks of his life that show how Blaze ends up where he's at. King (aka Bachman..does it really matter the name?) shows great control in the pacing of BLAZE, and expertly weaves the present with the past. You'll also be surprised (and entertained) by the joy that is Blaze, who is a wonderful, fully-developed character."}, {"userName": "Mindi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6157592-mindi", "userReview": "Considering that this is one of King's earliest works, (even under the Bachman Pseudonym), I think it's rather good. It's certainly not in the same league with his best fiction, but I was drawn in from the very beginning, and the story continued at a good pace up until the tense, nerve-wracking ending.I like the way King introduced his main character in the beginning with a sparse amount of information, and then interchanged chapters the character's past with the present. We know that Blaze has done some bad things throughout his life, and that he's about to do something even worse, but King makes him a sympathetic character from the very start, and then increases the reader's sympathy with each subsequent flashback chapter. In the end you want Blaze to come to justice, but it's painful, because his entire life has led him to a harsh sentence that he ultimately doesn't really deserve.I also liked that King published this novel and then donated all of the royalties to The Haven Foundation. King wrote Blaze when he was just starting out, and it never would have been published if he hadn't continued to revisit it and decide to share it with his Constant Readers. He has a tremendous amount of clout now, but King knows what it's like to be a struggling writer."}, {"userName": "Thomas Str\u00f6mquist", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist", "userReview": "I thought this \"Mice and men\"-inspired little trifle was a more enjoyable read than I was afraid of, but it surely did not feel like an important one. What really made it was the flashbacks showing what shaped the brain injured baby-napper to what he is. The story itself unfolds and ends following the only logical pattern (except for the very ending which is probably not too realistic, but still very predictable). I'm not sure why King felt compelled to publish this after so many years and certainly not why he contributed it to Bachman - a pseudonym that wasn't even born when the original draft was written (at least I think, please correct me if I'm wrong). Re-written and heavily expanded by King now but still a Bachman? Also - wasn't one purpose of the pseudonym to find out if the writer's success could be accounted for by any other means than his making himself a name?, i.e. would he still sell books under another name? Serving up this re-luke-warmed up lesser tale seems like the absolute opposite - using both famous names to sell something that maybe should have been left in that cardboard box..."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "Am I the only person on the map to not know Stephen King's early pseudonym was Richard Bauchman? Huh. This was the last book written under that pen name, and it is not of the horror genre but a bit like Of Mice and Men with a crime story thrown in. A kind but slow fellow named Blaisedell is befriended by a small time con called George who uses him in his cons, but genuinely cares for the big lug. Blaze continuously talks with George throughout the snatching of a six month old baby, but the twist you learn early on is that George is actually dead and only speaking to him in his head.Oooo, human psychology..I was only drawn to the story because of a group reading challenge which asked that we each do a book that surrounded a kidnapping. Having already finished several great reads touching on the topic, I fluttered about and found this.Not great, not bad.

I don't simply spend my time reading one author or genre, and I am a fairly discrimiinating reader.I feel that Stephen King has become one of the masters of (a) story-telling, and (b) character development. I believe his characters, care about them, and, even through the unbelievable worlds and situations through which these palpable characters inhabit and experience, believe them.In \"Blaze,\" which was originally written at a very young age, sat on the back burner for 25+ years, and fortunately revisited the author after his \"retirement,\" King is - in my opinion - at his best creating a situational plot line that follows two amazing characters blurring the lines of ethical/unethical, right/wrong, and nature/nuture.I recommend this relatively short book to anyone interested in a good story and a great character."}, {"userName": "Franco  Santos", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos", "userReview": "Buen libro de King bajo su seud\u00f3nimo de Richard Bachman.

It took me some time to really get into it,and at times it felt a bit slow. That took away that one star. But other than that,I really enjoyed this. The character of Blaze was so well written,I really started to care for him. The story tells his life story as well as follows him in present time. I didn't expect this too be as emotional as it was,although King does say in the beginning that there might be tears. It was sad! I felt so bad for Blaze. I love characters like that,kind of contradictory ones. You care for them,feel for them,but they do bad things,things that are wrong. Makes the reader really think,whose side are you on. Are bad things,like maybe killing someone for example,sometimes justified? Or,if not justified,at least understandable. Blaze is now one of my favourite King characters.

As is true to the normal style of Kings novels attributed to Bachman, this novel is a gritty pared-down version of what you would normally expect from Stephen King. That is in no way saying that the book is bad, to the contrary, it was a very well-written and moving story that I thoroughly enjoyed.The thing that sets the tone of the Bachman entries apart from other works of King is that, while still very detailed and developed, his Bachman books tend to not stray as much from the main plot line into the extraneous details that are prevalent in so many of his other works. These asides are part of what makes a Stephen King book stand apart as a Stephen King book.Blaze is a very fast paced read. We get some flashbacks into Blaze's past throughout the book, adding some color and flavor to the story. My only problem with the book was the placement of the final flashback. I think it would have served the book better to have it happen before (or even after) the final scene instead of having it right in the middle of the climax. It kind of slowed things down a bit too much at that point in the novel when tension was high and we were getting ready for the big bang.Other than that, this \"trunk novel\" is a worthy addition to the King library and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47765781-brian", "userReview": "3/5 \u2014 The longer you live, the dirtier you getThis review contains spoilers.Written before Carrie, then edited before its release in 2007 as a posthumous Bachman book, Blaze tells the story of sympathetic rogue Clayton Blaisdell, or \"Blaze\". King tips his hat to Steinbeck in this one, it being a shadow of Of Mice and Men. Our narrator splits the story between Blaze's tragic childhood and adolescence, and his life in the present. And, presently, our big galoot\u2014dull-witted but big and burly\u2014is carrying out a scheme of babynapping with his dead friend George. George was the brains of the operation, and had a soft spot for Blaze, whom he guided and protected throughout their criminal career. George might be dead, but he still talks to Blaze, keeping him on his toes and out of the fire as best he can. Or, at least, it sure seems like that voice is George's. Right, George? ...George?The story of Blaze's youth is what shines here. Watching him develop from a bright boy, to an abused and brain damaged boy, then to adolescence in an orphanage\u2014that's mostly why I gave this book three stars. If King hadn't explored that most important part of Blaze's life and connected it to his current predicament, his character would've pulled no sympathy from me. I mean, heck, I even like the guy despite his crimes. The plot running parallel to the flashbacks, with Blaze trying to pull off the ransom without George, is weak by comparison, and quite predictable. After thinking about it a bit, maybe that isn't a weakness for Blaze. As he wrote the story, King learned that there was no way out for Blaze. The readers can see it coming, too. To put it flatly, it's sad, we know it's going to be sad, it's been sad since the stairs. But, I was wishing for redemption until the end. You messed with this Constant Reader's emotions, SK. Good job."}, {"userName": "Janie Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5116650-janie-johnson", "userReview": "I read this book as a buddy read with a friend. This was the only Bachman book I had not read by King, so I thought I would give it a shot. Was this a masterpiece? No. not even close, but I did find it somewhat entertaining and it does seem to fit in with the Bachman books. If you read King or you are a fan, you learn his writing style pretty quickly and you can tell that this is one of his earlier novels. Even though, I still thought that the book moved along with a decent pace and with the mix of dark, dry humor, it kept me engaged in the story. Our characters are rather eccentric, and I think they were wrote this way on purpose, kind of like the good cop, bad cop routine. George, the evil go getter who thinks he is entitled to everything, and then there is Blaze, who is not very bright to start, due to beatings he received as a child, becomes a small time delinquent throughout his life, meets George and now worships the ground he walks on and would do anything he says. Blaze is wrote in a way that readers will feel bad for him at one point, and then angry at him the next, so they end up on a fence, do I like him or do I not? You get a decent amount of backstory on Blaze, but next to nothing on George, which is ok since Blaze is our main character.I still would recommend this book to others who like King just because it is was the 'lost' Bachman book. I also think this really allows us to see the growth in King's writing. This is probably not for everyone, but king fans will definitely appreciate it."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "I liked this book even better this time around. It WAS sentimental, but in an honest way. Blaze had a heart of gold, but he was certainly no angel. I don't believe was written by Bachman. I know. Who am I to say, but Bachman's books are always depressing or bleak. This one was neither. It was sad, but that's not quite the same thing, is it?"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "Okay I was asked if I wanted to read this along with a friend and I thought why not. In the early days of my reading I will admit I voraciously read my way through Stephen King's publication list and for the most of them I loved them (some were so so while others were amazing and I still refer back to them even today). However reading Blaze I realised two things. The first was that its been far too long since I immersed myself in Mr Kings work and secondly - and I guess this will come across a little pretentious - but I prefer the earlier works of King, and for a while at least it felt like he lost his way a bit - well this for me is him returning at least to the path of his earlier work even if it is not yet up there with the classics. So as you can imagine once I got in to it I was hooked, ironic really considering it was written under the Bachman name, (I still remember reading my copy of \"The Bachman Books\").Anyway the book - well it is an interesting tale - no spoilers here but if you are looking for another Salem's Lot or Pet Semetery (boy does my auto correct hate that) then this is not for you. This however is more for me in the realms of Shawshank or the Body where human nature is the star of the show and where life itself can throw out more horrors and hopes than any supernatural force. The main character for me though principled is deeply flawed but you get to see where those flaws come from and even in the final scenes you realise how a misguided act actually has an underlaying purity after all what was Blaze screaming as he exploded from the cave?I know its all to easy for an author to play with the readers emotions - from making the reading invest themselves in the characters to playing with their sensibilities at the injustices they are put through - however here rather than rail against the world at the pain he suffered he just carried on and for me that makes the rest of the world (and the people in it) all the more cruel.This is not his best work by far but it shows to me how great a storyteller Stephen King is (in which ever guise) and that sometimes the simplest of stories can carry great power. I also realised I missed reading his work and I should pay attention to great reading suggestions."}, {"userName": "Kinksrock", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228382-kinksrock", "userReview": "This is an ok book that I would not recommend as a first book you read by Stephen King. However, I highly recommend it if you are a Stephen King fan, but need a break from his books with more complicated plots and multiple characters. This one focuses on two characters (only one of whom is actually alive) and one simple plot, with some flashbacks. \"Blaze\" is a brain-damaged man who plots to kidnap a baby for ransom, following the instructions of his former partner in crime, who is only alive in his head.

After re-reading Blaze he decided it just wasn\u2019t very good. He stuck it in a box somewhere and forgot about it. After releasing his other early novels under the pen name Richard Bachman, King gave Blaze another read and decided that it still wasn\u2019t good enough and stuck it back in the box. Fast-forward thirty long, complicated, dangerous years and King has written a successful mystery novel called The Colorado Kid. He wants to write another mystery and remembers Blaze. It is, after all, the story of a kidnapping. So he digs up the manuscript, dusts it off, polishes it up, and decides it\u2019s not really appropriate as a cold case crime novel, but he releases it as another Bachman Book complete with apologies to his constant readers. For me, I tend to agree with King\u2019s previous assessment; Blaze is just okay. Clayton Blaisdell Jr. may be a sweet, somewhat interesting character, but he has a dark, murderous side, and so much bad luck that Thomas Hardy could have created him. To begin with, his dad tosses young, bookish, intelligent Blaze down a flight of stairs and smashes in the better parts of his brain. He has very limited mental abilities from then on. He may be capable of some clear thinking, but he attributes this to the ghosts of dead friends. Still, this one characteristic makes him unique among these kinds of characters.Blaze grows into a big kid, and the combination of size and limited intelligence is a recipe for disaster. He has the strength to kill people with his fists but not always the mental acuity to stop himself.  Blaze ends up in Hetton House, a home for poor kids where the headmaster really dislikes him. Blaze does make one good friend, Johnny, and their adventures skipping school and running off to Boston mark one of the high points in Blaze\u2019s life... and in the book. Blaze gets another break, and this should have been a great one. He\u2019s sent from Hetton House to work on a farm as part of a summer work program. He falls in love and gains the attention and respect of the farm\u2019s owner, a Mr. Bluenote. It looks like things will finally work out for Blaze. Bluenote doesn\u2019t want to send Blaze back to Hetton House. He wants to keep him on the farm as a hand, train him, and help him along. It sounds perfect, but on the last day of the program Bluenote has a heart attack and dies on the spot. All that hopeful future blows up in his face, and Blaze is back at Hetton House. Eventually, Blaze meets a grifter named George who uses Blaze to work a series of low-level cons. George decides that kidnapping is the big score, a way to get rich for life. George picks a perfect victim too, the newly born son of wealthy parents who live in an all-too-easily-accessed gated community. The baby\u2019s name is Joe Gerrard. I don\u2019t usually root for kidnappers, but I honestly do believe that neither Blaze nor George had any intention of harming the kid. So in a sense, I started cheering for Blaze, hoping that things would work out for him. Of course, given Blaze\u2019s luck, we know that couldn\u2019t happen. George is killed in a gambling fight before the kidnapping can even take place and Blaze is left to carry out the crime all by himself. What follows is a study in poor decision-making, disastrous mistakes, and more bad luck... though at least Blaze doesn\u2019t listen to those voices that urge him to kill the baby. In fact, he learns to love the kid. But the outcome is just as disastrous and inevitable."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11818290-sarah", "userReview": "I read this for the 2017 POPSUGAR Challenge prompt 'A Book by an Author Who Uses a Pseudonym'1/4 - I really enjoyed Blaze. This is the first 'King' book I've read in nearly five years (I read The Dead Zone in August 2012) and I was a bit worried about the quality considering the low average rating here, but I was pleasantly surprised by what I thought was an interesting thriller (sorry guys, definitely not horror, there were some supernatural goings on but it wasn't in the least bit scary) with a surprisingly sympathetic villain/MC. Blaze's horrible childhood combined with his diminished mental age were enough to get me on his side and hoping for his escape (I was undecided about whether his escape should be with the baby, or not).Rest of review in the morning...Sorry, make that four days later *oh well, life got busy and then I forgot*. As I was reading this I saw a lot of Stephen King's writing in Edward Lorn's books (which I hope is a compliment for E as I know King is one of, if not his most, favourite authors). If I had read this without knowing who the author was I could easily have picked E as the author, more easily than King as I haven't read anything by him in quite a few years. Usually I hate those \"if you enjoyed  then you'll love this\" recommendations that publishers have been sticking on the covers of books recently, but in this case I am happy to say that if you enjoyed this book then Edward Lorn could be another great author for you to try.Disclaimer: E and I are friends here at GR, but I'm not a promoter/pusher/advertiser for him (check out some of my reviews of his work if you want proof that I'm brutally honest and won't recommend an author I don't wholeheartedly enjoy reading) and he certainly didn't ask me to write this."}, {"userName": "Barbara Senteney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68987237-barbara-senteney", "userReview": "I honestly went into this story not expecting much because all the reviews I have watched or read seemed negative. I was however pleasantly surprised once I opened the cover to discover the candy center inside. Clayton Blaisdell, or Blaze as his friends call him is slow.When he was a small boy his father threw him down the stairs in a succession of 3 times. causing not only a huge dent in the center of his forehead but also his simple mindedness. Eventually he was taken from the custody of his father, tried and failed in foster care and dumped in Hutton House. A home for hard to place boys, with social, mental, or anger issues. He met his first friend there Jon. Sometimes they hired the boys out for the summer, to pick crops or be general farm hands. Some of these places were worse then the hom, some not so bad.George grew into a very large intimidating looking man, but he was simple minded so easily led to bad situations by others. One such person is George, a small time conman , who like Blaze for his simple mindedness. He would use Blaze, as a dupe, Blaze could do all the dirty work that George didn't want to be bother with, or thought was too risky to do himself.But. . George gets killed in a robbery gone bad, and poor Blaze is lost without him.Blaze's mind takes an alternate route. George becomes the other part of Blaze, telling him what to do and belittling him as always. Sometimes Blaze knows George is just made up in his mind, but sometimes he isn't so sure. Before George dies he plans a kidnapping of a 6 month old child of a local wealthy businessman. When Blaze asks what he should do now, George insist that he go ahead with the plan to take the baby.The story alternates from current time to Blaze's childhood. You get to know Blaze, and can't help but feel empathy. Then he takes the baby ( Joe ). You worry about the safety of this innocent child, even if he is taken good care of by the gentle giant, there is always George to worry about and he is not so gentle, even if he is imaginary.I listened to this on audio, it was 8 hours well spent. This story is truly about Blaze, his hard life, the abuse he suffered, and who and what it turned him into.
