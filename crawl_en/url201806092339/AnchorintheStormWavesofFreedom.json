I only wish I could grab book 3 right now and dive in to Dan's story, also.I loved the depth of feeling in the romance! Lillian is an amputee who wears a prosthetic left leg, so the attraction is not a continual round of legs, rear, and gorgeous hair\u2014so refreshing! She and Arch fall in love with each other as they attempt to solve a drug ring providing soldiers with illegally proscribed phenobarbital. It's their selves, not their bodies, that form the main attraction, and I loved it.An fully enjoyable edge-of-your-seat romantic suspense with a good illustration of true courage and faith."}, {"userName": "Amanda Tero", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36174922-amanda-tero", "userReview": "4.5 starsLillian's prosthetic leg immediately drew me into this book. I just haven't read about many heroines that had an appalling \"disability\" and yet, you love the character, don't pity her. I could identify with Lillian in many ways--her \"cold-heartedness\" (or \"wooden heart\"), her bluntness, her blunders. She felt very real.Arch was also to be admired. And yes, what I admired most was that he was real. He had a very real, very strong struggle to grow through in his naval career, and he didn't tackle this struggle on his own--he continually prayed for God's help.I've read more non-fiction than fictional WWII books, so this was a new type of book for me. I didn't think that the war was glorified in it--being that Arch was in the middle of a ship with men struggling with their nerves and Lillian worked at a store that saw the social war affects first-hand. It was very interesting and brought the era to life.Being the second book in the Waves of Freedom series, I wasn't sure how Anchor in the Storm would read as a stand-alone. No worries. It read amazingly. I assume that the first book was about Jim and Mary; this second book is about Jim's sister, Lillian. There were some references to Jim and Mary's back-story, but it only embellished this story, it didn't make it feel like a gap was missing somewhere.The spiritual theme of this book was that Christ is the anchor for our soul. Both Lillian and Arch clung to that. I really, really appreciated that, at times when one would be wishing for physical comfort from their love, they brought it back to, \"No, Christ is my sure anchor.\" In some ways, it could be that this message was the only spiritual message in the book, but it was definitely very present--not rushed over.The mystery in this book kind of surprised me (this is Sundin's first book that I've read, so she may usually have mysteries, I don't know). It was complex, interesting, and true-to-life. Another plus, in my opinion.There were a couple things I didn't care for. One, being that when Lillian was taken advantage of by a former boyfriend (back-story), she didn't tell her family or parents. Younger readers probably wouldn't want to read this because of that situation, plus there was considerable romance throughout the book and some violence (murders mentioned, ships bombarded, things like that).*I received this book in exchange of my honest review, from LitFuse Publicity*"}, {"userName": "Jesseca Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39986158-jesseca-wheaton", "userReview": "Wow!!!

I'm always delighted to hear another book is coming from this author - love her stories! Anchor in the Storm is book two of the WAVES OF FREEDOM series, and it does not disappoint!Lillian Avery is a young woman struggling to get by unnoticed with her prosthetic leg, shutting people out as well as she's hiding her secrets within.Archer Vandenberg, a naval officer, struggles with nerves and is determined not to be trapped in a sinking ship, or in a marriage with a woman seeking riches, ever.With dark pasts to face, and mysteries unfolding around the corner, Lillian and Avery must learn to trust God ... and each other.I loved getting Lillian's story! We were introduced to her in the first book as main character Jim's younger sister. And, of course, Arch is Jim's best friend! And now we get to see what's really going on their lives. *smiles* In Anchor in the Storm, we also got glimpses of lovebirds, Jim and Mary, and other familiar characters such as Quintessa and Yvette. Can't wait for Book 3 to see more from Quintessa!Sarah Sundin does a superb job writing stories set during World War II. I enjoyed learning about the US navy, surviving breathless attacks from German U-boats, tagging along with Lillian as she gets a job as a pharmacist in the 1940s, and just fun peeks at life in general during that era. So well-written and researched! Ah. I just so enjoy these books! ^_^ Also am loving the dash of mystery Mrs. Sundin has been adding to this series. Intrigue and danger and plucky heroines determined to solve a case! *grins* Though sometimes grim, it's been fun and suspenseful as well.I always like the messages, themes, and lessons woven throughout these books. Anchor in the Storm was no different. It had a beautiful faith aspect to it, and some real heart-searching and changing went on. I love the facing of past bad experiences and pain. The emotion. The healing. So beautiful and poignant. I like characters that have issues and struggles just like we do. I like seeing them cry out to God, and find His strength, just like we can! So yes, some truly soulful and touching moments.The romance was heartwarming and meaningful overall. A gentle and sweet pursuit was especially fun to read! After that, I did feel that kisses were exchanged quicker and more often than was prudent ... so that's my firm opinion on that. But overall, it was lovely. Friendship. Blossoming romance. Learning to trust. Making mistakes. Fighting for something beautiful and worthwhile. Aww.I rate Anchor in the Storm 4.5 stars. It left me feeling satisfied, my heart warmed, and excitedly awaiting the next book! Fans of WWII historical, you absolutely must read all Sarah Sundin's novels! ^_^I received a copy of Anchor in the Storm from Revell Publishers in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kellyn Roth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52072956-kellyn-roth", "userReview": "Right after reading it:Wow ... I read that so fast that I can't remember a thing that happened ... except that it was amazing ... *falls back on my bed with a dazed expression*After having reread it:**Originally posted on Reveries Reviews**This is going to be a short review due to limited time and me being behind on reviewing and struggling to catch up. However, I don't have a lot to say about Sarah Sundin's books that I haven't said before (not that they're the same, but that they all have the same level of awesomeness, and I tend to forget the differences in ranting about the awesomeness ...), so that's actually quite fitting. :)That was another great story by Sarah Sundin! I can't wait until book three of the Waves of Freedom trilogy comes out!Lillian and Arch were both great characters. All the characters are, but these two were my favorite.I loved Arch in book one. He's a swell guy, pretty serious most of the time, always a perfect gentleman (that scene in the bar was hilarious!), but he is prone to depression and very insecure about being loved for his money/social position/looks instead of for himself. Of course we love him for his faults. Yeah, I know, in my last review I was going on about this guy who was perfect despite his lack of faults ... well, Arch was perfect because of his faults. It makes sense. Just trust me on this one.Lillian is also pretty insecure (if you didn't guess!). As a kid, she lost her leg and now wears a prosthesis. You can imagine how that makes her feel! Overall, however, she's pretty confident about that, which surprised me. Her main problem is her 'wooden heart.' She shuts people out, pushes herself too hard, goes through life bluntly and without feeling. At least, his (evil!) twin sister thinks so ...Which reminds me, I hate Lillian's twin sister's guts. I don't know why, but I just do. I suppose because I can't stand people who whine. Drives me crazy. I'm a lot more like Lillian; I'd die before I'd cry or complain or let anyone know I need help. :PThe plot was, of course, fantastic. Another mystery, which I didn't mind one bit! Very exciting, intriguing, etc.It was also great to see Jim and Mary again, however briefly. I'm a bit surprised they're only dating, though, not engaged. Wait a minute ... no. I'm not surprised one bit! Thinking back, they just got around to actually confessing their love (after months ... and months ... and months ... not that it was irritating, but that their personalities are just like that!), and knowing their personalities ... this is gonna take a while. But they have to get engaged in the next book, mmkay, Ms. Sundin? They just have to! Please?Well, that's about all I have to say. I hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope you'll go pick up a copy of the book yourself so we can fangirl together.

Anchor in the Storm fits the bill perfectly!This Waves of Freedom series especially intrigues me because it touches on what to me at least are little known facts about America\u2019s involvement in World War 2. I L-O-V-E learning while I read fiction, and Sundin\u2019s books always give me an entertaining story with a fascinating history lesson as a bonus!Lillian and Arch both have handicaps (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual) that they must overcome to succeed in relationships and in life. When they meet through Lillian\u2019s brother Jim (the hero in Through Waters Deep), their chemistry is palpable. Watching their friendship slowly develop and then gradually blossom into something more lasting is full of smiles and heart-melting moments that are sure to delight any fan of romance!The mystery to be solved in Anchor in the Storm is foreshadowed by Lillian early on when she jokes with her family that she won\u2019t solve a murder mystery like her roommate Mary (Jim\u2019s girlfriend) \u2013 with her occupation as a pharmacist, she says, \u201c\u2026it\u2019ll be a drug ring.\u201d Yep. Got it in one. The drug ring is far reaching and I loved watching Lillian really come into her own strength (and God\u2019s) as she worked on cracking the caseBut more than the history and the romance and the mystery, I most loved the spiritual theme weaving through Anchor in the Storm. Both Lillian and Arch \u2013 for their own separate reasons \u2013 had to come to the understanding that Jesus is the only secure Anchor in any storm, that His hope does not disappoint. Words that are true for their fictional situations, for the world during World War 2, for the world today, and for you and me today as well.Bottom Line: If you like a blend of history, romance, faith, and mystery, then you for sure need to add Sarah Sundin\u2019s Waves of Freedom series to your TBR list! Anchor in the Storm is sweet and funny and poignant, and it will gently challenge you to cling to the only secure Anchor in a turbulent world. Kisses aplenty, hunky sailors, a feisty independent heroine, and the backdrop of 1940s Boston will treat you to a delightful afternoon of reading with truth to take with you.

Coming on the heels of Through Waters Deep, book one in the Waves of Freedom series, follows Lillian Avery and Arch Vandenberg during the height of WWII. Lillian, a strong character with a past that haunts her, overcomes all odds to work as a handicapped female pharmacist. Arch, wanting to escape the stereotype of a wealthy son riding on the coat tails of his families money, fights personal demons from his narrow escape from a sinking U-boat all while trying to prove himself as a working, competent officer. When their paths cross on a mission to solve a mystery involving drowsiness with Arch's men and Lillian's pharmacy, they forge a partnership to solve the problem and possible crime.I really enjoyed Lillian and Arches story. The rich details that Sarah includes truly make the story. I felt as if I was experiencing WWII with the characters. Lillian was such a strong woman and I love how Sarah crafted her as a hard worker with strength to overcome the difficulties of her handicap as much as her past. I also like how persistent and patience Arch is with Lillian and how he deals with his struggles.Sarah's writing and descriptions will drop you completely into the world of WWII in Boston. I felt like I was there and experiencing the stress of being a Navy officer in a ship as well as the frustration of being a woman in a position that wasn't traditionally held by women. As one of my favorite eras this was the perfect read!I definitely recommend this book to fans of historical fiction, sweet romance, and mystery.

She is such a strong story-teller and researcher that her books sing. This book is no different because she has created such memorable characters, and both so broken that I couldn't help but cheer for them from the first page to the last. Lillian is a heroine with a broken body, but even more important, a broken spirit. She believes she is cold, heartless, and unlovable, because that is what important people have communicated to her at crucial moments. Art believes no one will ever love him for more than his silver spoon. When you put these two together in the middle of a mystery that could get them killed, it's a plot that wouldn't let me go, while the romance, mystery and history built. I loved this novel, and it's perfect for others who love a good historical romance -- especially one set on the homefront during WWII."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27178457-hannah", "userReview": "Feb. 17, 2016 When will May get here! I wake up every day anticipating this book more and more. How am I supposed to wait?! Please, come May, please! Apr. 5, 2016 LESS THAN A MONTH! I CANNOT WAIT! Apr. 18, 2016 I need this right NOW! I just finished TWD last night (reread) and can't wait for my copy of this to arrive! One Plucky Female Pharmacist + One High-Society Naval Officer = Romance--and Danger For plucky Lillian Avery, America's entry into World War II means a chance to prove herself as a pharmacist in Boston. The challenges of her new job energize her. But society boy Ensign Archer Vandenberg's attentions only annoy--even if he \"is\" her brother's best friend. During the darkest days of the war, Arch's destroyer hunts German U-boats in vain as the submarines sink dozens of merchant ships along the East Coast. Still shaken by battles at sea, Arch notices his men also struggle with their nerves--and with drowsiness. Could there be a link to the large prescriptions for sedatives Lillian has filled? The two work together to answer that question, but can Arch ever earn Lillian's trust and affection? Sarah Sundin brings World War II to life, offering readers an intense experience they won't soon forget.Words cannot truly express how much I love Sarah Sundin's books.-they're just so good! I squealed and giggled when I opened up our P.O. Box to find a key for a parcel locker - and what was sitting in that locker, but my very own beautiful copy of 'Anchor in the Storm'! (First of all, the cover. Absolutely. Gorgeous.) I have to say, I enjoyed this one a bit more then 'Through Waters Deep', and let me tell you that 'Through Waters Deep' is one of my all-time favorite books! I don't know if I've talked about it enough. But this book was even better! I could hardly tear my eyes away from it at certain parts. I made myself read only a 60-70 pages a day, so it would last longer. But yesterday I decided to read a bit more, and when I saw that I had less than 30 pages left, I decided to save it for today. Lilian Avery is my favorite character. Her pluck. Her courage. She may be missing a leg, but she can put up a stand for herself! I felt so horrible for when.....well, I had better not spoil anything.Arch is absolutely dreamy! I felt like crying for him and reaching through the book to give him a hug. I felt so sorry for him...his struggling. *MINOR SPOILER*And when Arch and Jim fought...*gasp*! I was shocked. I was torn between being mad at Jim and being even more in love with him because of his protective attitude for Lilian. So sweet! (Yes, he's still on my list of fictional crushes.)When I finally finished this book, I was a little sad because it's over. I completely adore the stories and characters that Sarah Sundin has created! I'll definitely have to give all of her books a reread whilst I wait for the 3rd book in the 'Waves of Freedom' series. Overall, I completely enjoyed this book, and adore it, and fell in love with the characters! It was fantastic. And I have to wait almost a year for book 3?! What? I cannot recommend Sarah Sundin's book enough. I just can't. I can't talk about them and gush over them enough either. Seriously, you should read them!5 out of 5 stars! *Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my free and honest review.

Just the right amount of romance with a thread of suspense to keep you intrigued. And I love the fact that the author introduces a couple of real life topics such as the disability Lillian struggles with and the \"nerves\" (what we now know as PTSD) that Archer is struggling with. These characters are real and are each struggling with their own self-worth. Lillian because of her disability and Archer because of his wealth. They each struggle with actions they have taken in the past that have affected close friends and family. Their past relationships have also created some mistrust that make it hard for each of them to deal with the other in terms of loving and being loved for who they are. Nevertheless, they are strongly attracted to each other. Can they let go of the past, forgive themselves and trust God with the future?Lillian is a strong woman with a determined spirit. She doesn't let her disability slow her down and she is determined to show the world that she can live up to her goals of being a pharmacist. I loved how she reacted and interacted with Archer. She gave him the cold shoulder at first but then once she learns to trust him and they embark on solving the mystery, their interactions were fun. Until you get to the part where Archer is stupid (angry eyeroll ...lol) and then, well ... you'll have to read it to see. :DI so admired Archer and the man he has become and the man he grows to be by the end of the book. He's struggling with his \"nerves\" and nightmares about what happened on his last assignment, which is making it difficult to do the job he's grown to love. He's also determined to leave his family's wealth behind and become his own man. When he meets Lillian and realizes that she doesn't care about that wealth he can't help but fall in love! :) But circumstances and the mystery of the drugs that he and Lillian start investigating will bring him to a point of significant change in his life. He has to learn to trust God on a much deeper level.And I loved how the author used the illustration of the anchor in this book. Not only is it in the title, she also references the song My Hope Is Built by Edward Mote. I love old hymns and the author uses this song to illustrate the importance of putting your hope in Christ as your solid rock and anchor. When darkness veils his lovely face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.All in all, an awesome follow up to the first book, Through Waters Deep. With a sparking romance and a mystery with just the right suspense, you'll find it easy to get lost in this story! I'm looking forward to reading the next book!*Thanks to Litfuse and Revell for a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.

The protagonists Lilian and Archer were refreshing and interesting characters - Lilian has an obvious physical disability, and Arch struggles with what we know today is PTSD. Also they each have their own hang-ups that has shaped their personalities and makes relationships difficult for them, so it was especially sweet to see them change and fall for each other!As in the first book, there's a serious and dangerous mystery to be solved - this time it's a drug-ring. The tension and suspense is intense, I even cried at one heartbreaking discovery. The historical aspect is brilliant, I really felt immersed in the time period and I learned a lot too, an added bonus! Each of Sarah's books encourages me to consider areas of WW2 that have never even crossed my mind before.The spiritual message of having hope in Christ as the anchor of our soul was worked throughout the story really well, clear and encouraging.There was one part that frustrated me somewhat - I didn't like how Arch reverted pretty much back to his old self and ways, it seemed like he'd grown too much and been with Lilian too long to be able to do that, but the more I thought about, it's a realistic portrayal of every one of us - we can go so far and yet fall right back, and it's only because of grace that we can start over once more. So although it annoyed me as a reader at the time, I see the realism in it!Dan and Quintessa's story is coming next and I know it's just going to be as great as the rest of this series!* I received a free e-copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "Anchor in the Storm, the second book in the Waves of Freedom series, was an intriguing continuation of the series.

Anchor in the Storm has that perfect blend of historical detail, rich characterization, suspense, romance, and spiritual depth \u2013 resulting in a highly entertaining story that was hard to put down. I\u2019ve read five of Sarah\u2019s novels, all of which are excellent, but I believe this one is my favorite so far. It was great to reconnect with Jim Avery from book #1, Through Waters Deep, and continue with the story of his best friend, Arch.For one thing, I always learn something historically from every story. Anchor in the Storm follows a dramatic aspect of the war \u2026 the U-boat attacks off America\u2019s Eastern Seaboard during the first six months of 1942, when the Germans sank one hundred merchant ships. In this early stage of America\u2019s involvement, frustration was caused by a shortage of naval vessels that resulted in fruitless patrols and rescuing survivors. Arch and Jim experience this firsthand as they serve on the USS Ettinger.Capturing the emotions is the fact that Arch and several other servicemen live with combat fatigue, which we know today as PTSD. Only those who have experienced the horrors of war fully know what this is like, but my heart goes out to all who suffer its effects. Even more heartbreaking is that 1942 was a time when men were put in combat, then punished for their humanity, making them fearful of seeking help.Lillian Avery and Ensign Archer (Arch) Vandenberg are compelling characters, so appealing and relatable in their humanness that I would choose them as best friends in real life if possible. Losing her leg due to a childhood accident and having to wear a prosthesis gave Lillian a determination and desire for independence, and she became one of the few women pharmacists at the time. Arch comes from old New England money, yet he despises wealth and longs for the simple life. Without a war to level the playing field, this unlikely pair would never have met, and yet they both share a desire to be loved for who they are inside. I loved the romantic tension and slowly growing friendship between them.\u201cArch had grown up with an aloof stained-glass Jesus, but Jim had introduced him to the rugged carpenter in the fishing boat, genuine and straightforward.\u201d Lillian and Arch are both believers, but important lessons are still to be learned, lessons that speak to us as well. This world will always be full of physical and emotional storms, and the message that Jesus is our anchor, hope and refuge is needed just as much today as it was for Arch and Lillian.

Anchor in the Storm exceeded every single one of my expectations, Arch and Lillian's adventure was every bit as amazing as I had hoped it would be! I don't even know where to begin gushing, I loved Lillian, she has a permanent spot on my list of most awesome heroines! And Arch, oh my goodness! It is not often that a fictional character makes me swoon, but he totally and completely did *and I may or may not have spent almost as much time staring at the cover model who portrays Arch as I did reading the book* I found it to be such a great message that Lillian and Arch are not perfect, they have both made mistakes in their pasts, and yet they are both willing to look past them and love the other for who they are inside! As a young, single woman I found that message to be incredibly meaningful and inspirational, on so many levels! The mystery was so good, I hated to set the book down! I admit that while I am a lover of historical fiction/romance, for the most part World War 2 is not my favorite time period and I don't often read books that are set during that time period but I always make a special exception for Sarah Sundin's books, they are absolutely phenomenal, so beautifully written with such fabulous historical detail that I feel as though I am living right alongside the characters in the 1940's. I highly recommend her books! I think Anchor in the Storm just may be my favorite of Ms. Sundin's books that I have read, though there are still five of her books that I need to read but I am hoping to remedy that before the end of this year! I just can't express how much I absolutely loved every single moment of Anchor in the Storm, it is definitely one that has a permanent spot on my keeper shelf and I plan to reread it many times in the future!I look forward to the final book in the Waves of Freedom series, and all of her following releases! Sarah Sundin is one of my all time favorite authors! I was honored to receive a review copy of this amazing book from Revell publishers in exchange for my honest review!"}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965894-renee", "userReview": "I'm enjoying this series which features the Avery siblings and their loves during the first years of US involvement in WWI. Anchor in the Storm follows Lillian Avery as she leaves her home to live in Boston to work in a pharmacy ran by miserly old druggist, Mr. Dixon. She encounters adversity at work and in her personal life due to a disability she's lived with since she was a child. Lillian believes a normal person could never love her because of her appearance and her \"cold\" heart. Enter ensign Archer Vandenberg, her brother Jim's close friend. He's out to prove he's not like any other man and even though he's wealthy, that he's no snob. Their story is one of intrigue and danger, not so much by the hands of a known enemy, but rather the unknown leaders of a drug ring that threatens their lives and the lives of those keeping the American coast safe from German U-Boats. Anchor in the Storm is certainly a story that can easily marked as a book by Sarah Sundin. No other author I know can bring to life in a book the dangers of war and the complexity of everyday life like she does. I loved Lillian's pluck and cool composure when faced by enemies and Arch's loyalty to his men when lives were on the line. Unfortunately, Arch just didn't quite cut it for me as a romance hero. This is difficult for me to say because I count most of Sundin's heroes as book boyfriends. For someone who didn't care for money, he sure made a huge deal out of it. It was a little grating. He was pretty snobbish where Lillian was concerned, too. I kept thinking, \"Girrrlll, please don't let this guy wear you down. His first impression was less than charitable and not in a Mr. Darcy kind of way\". Oh well. Not every reader can like every character every time. Honestly, this story was very good otherwise. I just love how Ms. Sundin paints such a vivid picture. Whether it's an alleyway in Boston or a battle at sea, it always feels as if I'm living the story with the characters. I'm very much looking forward to reading the next book to see how Quintessa fares in her dealings with the Avery family. It should be very interesting indeed! *I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors. I am not required to write positive reviews.

The challenges of her new job energize her. But society boy Ensign Archer Vandenberg's attentions only annoy--even if he \"is\" her brother's best friend. During the darkest days of the war, Arch's destroyer hunts German U-boats in vain as the submarines sink dozens of merchant ships along the East Coast. Still shaken by battles at sea, Arch notices his men also struggle with their nerves--and with drowsiness. Could there be a link to the large prescriptions for sedatives Lillian has filled? The two work together to answer that question, but can Arch ever earn Lillian's trust and affection? Sarah Sundin brings World War II to life, offering readers an intense experience they won't soon forget. Wonderful book! When I read Through Waters Deep, I really liked Arch. I mean, I felt kind of bad for him. He is a rich, good looking guy who just wants a girl to love him even if he is poor, not just because he is rich. This book told the story of Arch and, as you can guess, a young pharmacist, Lillian.I am perfectly satisfied with this book! I mean, in any book, there are always ups and downs.

With most of the young men signing up to fight, she knows that qualified pharmacists are in short supply and most don't want to take a chance on a woman let alone one who is crippled. As she settles into her job in Boston, she starts to notice something odd with specific prescriptions to be filled. It seems that the dosages are too high. Lt. Arch Vanderbilt is grateful to be alive after his ship sank. Yet he can't sleep. When he is prescribed a large dose of pills, he starts to wonder if there is a connection between the medication and his crew's performance. Comparing notes with Lillian, the two soon find themselves in the midst of something that is possibly even more dangerous than the war. When Lillian begins to fall for Arch, she tries to stop. But can a wartime mystery bring two lonely and hurting people together?I have been looking forward to this book since I finished the first one in the series. I was anxious to see how Arch and Lillian would fall in love. I've also enjoyed each book of Sarah Sundin's that I have read. But let me be honest. I struggled with this one. I'm not sure why.The story was good, the characters were well developed, but for whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it. I did finally manage to finish the book, and I will read the third one next year.But I've come to the realization that I won't love every book by my favorite authors. And you know what? That's ok.I received this book for free from Revell Books for the purpose of reviewing. My thoughts and opinions are my own. I was not required to like the book, only give my honest opinion.Recommend to fans of WWII fiction, Sarah Sundin, Cathy Gohkle, Kristy Cameron.Rating: 3 stars"}, {"userName": "Meghan Gorecki", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9915397-meghan-gorecki", "userReview": "It has been quite some time since I read a novel set in WWII and this novel had me fall in love with the era in fiction all over again. Sarah Sundin wove a powerful, intriguing tale expertly set in multiple locations, chock-full of history and a tender romance. In short--this novel has it all.One of the best things, to me, about historical fiction is what you can learn from it. And it takes a masterful storyteller to weave the meticulous research done in preparation for the story, into the novel without bogging it down or having it read like a history book. A fine balance has been struck in this novel by Sundin--one that only adds to the intrigue of the plot and plights of the characters. Speaking of...Lillian Avery and Arch Vandenburg support the theory that opposite forces repel--which is how some of the best romances start. Much like the timeless Lizzie Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, the hero and heroine of Anchor in the Storm both carry a lot of pride, and prejudices and, even though I am a history buff, my favorite part of this story was watching how these two imperfect people grew from beginning to end. The funny thing? They grew most once their hearts were opened to love, to being surprised, to grace--and yes, even through hurt. Watching Arch and Lillian slowly but surely uncurl their fists to wholly lean on Jesus' name was a beautiful and inspiring journey to go on through this book. Fans of historically rich stories with depth of character and faith--pick up Anchor in the Storm today.*Disclaimer: I was given this book by Litfuse Publicity Group in exchange for my honest review.

My new favorite Sarah Sundin novel is Anchor in the Storm.As with Through Waters Deep, I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery element. In addition, it was incredibly interesting to learn about how PTSD was \"treated\" during WWII and other historical details. Through Arch and Lillian's story, we learn the importance of looking at the heart and actions of a person rather than the surface.

While I really loved the first book - Through Waters Deep - Anchor in the Storm was just as good! I related to Lillian a lot as she was cautious to let people past the walls she had created.

This book made me laugh, made my cry, made me sigh dreamily, made me angry, made me scared, and made me stay up till 1:30 finishing the book!Arch Vandenberg is Jim Avery's (from Through Waters Deep) best friend, and has always been looking for a woman who would love him for him and not his money. Lillian Avery is a strong-willed and independent woman if I ever met one! She does not let any challenge or obstacle slow her down. While Arch is at sea, he notices his men are struggling with their nerves, due to drowsiness. They seem to be taking and excess of phenobarbital which is a sedative. He consults in Lillian, who is working as a pharmacist in Boston, and the two begin to investigate together. You may already predict that they will fall for eachother, but you'll have to read the book to read the \"how they fell\" and learn the hardships and joys they went through and the journey they both took to get to where they are now. In this story they both learn how to lean on God for their strength and make Him their one true Anchor in the Storm. They also learn how to open up to other people and build relationships, on the foundation of Christ their ultimate Anchor. I also so so so soooo appreciate how their love for eachother is built upon love for the other's flaws, brokenness, and character rather than what the world is promoting today such as bodily looks and physical attractions. It also shows Arch's perseverance in Lillian, and his respect for her. He trusted God to show him the right timing and to give him the wisdom in how to show Lillian his love for her. This story was Through Deep Waters but amped up times 10!!! I loved Through Deep Waters, but I think Anchor in the storm has taken first place.
