Not even your headmasters. (hint, hint)The book blood fever is amazingly written. The suspense builds up with every turning page. James is with another enemy, his name is Count Ugo. James found out about a secret society known as the Milenaria which as he thought had long ago faded. But now his thoughts change. He thinks differently about what he had thougt before. But the biggest mystery is revealed around the end of the book whwn James finds out something that he least expected. Read through the book to find out how this book twists and turns your brain. be sure to read EVERY single page. Each page has a mystery that is revealed around the end of the story. Each detail is important because as I later found out, the least bit of information becomes the most interesting part of the book. If you push yourself to read through the few boring parts of the book, then you will find out that the overall book is very interesting.

Frankly, I would love to see what Higson could do with a story in Bond's later years.Even still, his version of teenage 007 stories are incredible as they set the stage for what's to come. Furthermore, they are very emotionally-charged; I got caught up in the events of both Books 1 and 2 in key scenes in ways that many former Bond books never got me.Another strong entry. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Claire Russell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10810155-claire-russell", "userReview": "James Bond is a pupil at Eton and finds life a little pedestrian with the exception of the Danger Society he is a member of. When the Society is almost discovered after a meeting, James escapes over the rooftops of Eton. He finds himself in an area he has never been in before, overhears two men speaking Latin and stumbles across a temple with the initials MM on a painting. Meanwhile in the Greek islands a boat is hi-jacked and the English army captain on-board with his crew are killed, whilst the captain\u2019s daughter and her tutor are kidnapped. It transpires that the girl is a sister of one of James\u2019 secret society friends and that his friend is desperate to rescue his sister.James\u2019 guardian is away during the summer holidays so it\u2019s agreed that James will visit his cousin in Sardinia and then join a school trip on the island with the popular master Mr Haight. The two strands of the story join together when James realises that the kidnapped sister of his school friend is being held at an Italian counts fortress that James and his Uncle are visiting. As can be expected from a young James Bond, danger is never far away and James is soon caught up in a World of art thieves. murderers and kidnappers. Will he be able to rescue the girl and find out who are the members of the secret MM society with Etonian links?There are a whole host of fascinating characters from \u2018Smiler\u2019 who had his face sliced for informing on his associates to Count Ugo whose Empire is built on lies and illusions and Zoltan, the Hungarian who kidnapped Amy and killed their father but has developed a strange sense of loyalty and love towards Amy. The book is as fast paced and adventurous as an Ian Fleming novel. It was a real page-turner and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. The characters are well formed and interesting and the plot is not sanitized. James endures some horrific situations such as being tied up and tortured by mosquitos, being beaten by the art thieves as well as an attempt to drug him and push him off a cliff. I think the book would be enjoyed by all readers, but would particularly appeal to boys who are reluctant readers \u2013 it talks to the reader as an adult. James is a brave, reckless and honourable character who would appeal to readers in Years 5 and 6. I think the ideal way to use this book would be firstly for independent reading specifically targeting the reluctant reader. Then use for a Big Write, asking children to imagine themselves as trainee spies and to think of an adventure they could have. Encouraging them to think about how they would confront dilemmas they encountered in dangerous situations."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47142455-alex", "userReview": "A great book.

Are they \u2018more\u2019 than friends?Higson:(Laughs) Well of course they are, I mean it\u2019s not anything that children would pick up on but that\u2019s there for the adult readers. They are obviously a gay couple, and why not? Ian Fleming\u2019s best friend was Noel Coward and I think there\u2019s a reference to him in the book. Ian Fleming moved in those circles and knew a lot of people like that. I was interested in that kind of upperclass-gay-expats group that ended up in Tangiers a lot of them in North Africa and certainly around the Mediterranean. I quite liked that weird Bohemian slightly outside of society kind of setup. I didn\u2019t want to labour the point though. Fleming was very open minded and as I say Noel Coward was one of his best friends, but he did have a few digs at homosexuals in his books which is perhaps slightly regrettable."}, {"userName": "Kerenza", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13799108-kerenza", "userReview": "WOW, what a book! My first thought was when i saw this book how can it live up to silverfin (first book) but wow it did. Twists and turns of the plot just make you want to read on and on and on. When i first started this book i found it really hard to get into an with its slow beginning, but i do believe that if we did not have the beginning it wouldn't totally make sense. We need to Know who Mark Goodenough is, the teacher at Eton Haight is, as he does quiet a main part to the plot but is not first very obvious and of course we want to know how James Bond is don't we?????As soon as they get to sardinia, thats were you really want to know whats actually happening. It speed up and you can really forever and not want to put it down. I love the fact that Charlie Higson has used the fact that we always jump to conclusions in the book. The ending is very good and is kinda what i was expecting but it kinda wasn't. it has the happily ever after but it is also tied in with the story and it is not what you are expecting.

His movies have always been great hits. The author Charlie Higson has rendered a teen series which portrays James Bond as student in Eton. In these books, James Bond falls into many precarious situations, an the stories display his wit and determination in making it out of dangerous times alive. I got the chance to read one of these books. This book is a great read and I recommend that its it is read by teens.In this book, James Bond travels to the peaceful island of Sardinia, with suspicions of Millenaria gang members on the loose. As he spends his time there, he confronts a powerful but ill-mannered Count by the name of Ugo. As time passes he becomes even more suspicious, thus initiating a thrilling story filled with adventure. This book was amazingly written and easily painted a picture in my mind. One thing I disliked was the complex and sophisticated diction in the book. It sometimes grew boring and made me stop reading.All in all, this book was very enjoyable.

I guess so in spite of the fact that i have not actually read the original Iam Flemming books but in my defence i have watched the movies and every single one of them from sean connery to now Daniel craigThe book and the plot is good and also reminded me how my brain is developed only to the level where i find books meant for 13 year olds to be perfectly in sync with my pace and understanding. Yah !! cheers to thatThe book is simple with straight cut plot which means it is no maze where you have no idea who is who and what is what. The plot keeps untying on its way to end and keeps you entertained all through. The book is actually second in series where they take you into the life of James Bond when he was just a boy studying in Eton, one of the Prestigious all Boys school.

When James Bond joins a holiday trip to Sardinia, he gets far more danger than he anticipated.James and his friends aren't the only ones at Eton part of a secret society. There is a sinister link between the school and a mysterious organisation in Sarsinia. Thievery and kidnapping soon lead to murder, with James caught in the midst of it all.Can he survive the wrathful ampitions of men...or will he be claimed by the world's deadliest animal?After SilverFin, I was hooked on Higson's narrative of Young Bond. Blood Fever proved to be a worthy follow-up.James Bond is a compelling character. It would be easy for me to be drawn to the series if I was already a Bond buff but I haven't read any of Fleming's novels (I know, shame shame) and I've only seen two Bond films, neither of which I remember very well. Bond's appeal as a protagonist rested solely on the way Higson had written him.There is quite a juxtoposition to the older Bond. James isn't sexual, to the point of dodging girl's kisses. He's more focussed on thrill and adventure but also has a strong moral sense.Coming bacck to sexual implicatioms in the novel, being for a younger audience (though I would classify it as YA, not KidLit) it's hardly even implied. Even when unsavoury men and young women/girls collide, the potential for sexual assault wasn't even touched on. It was as though it was too vulgar for the characters to imply past the subbtlest of subtext.Once again, Higson introduces strong, young female characters. From the start, Amy was feisty but Vendetta was my favourite of the two. I loved how oposite they were. Not because of their upbringing or cultural backgrounds but because one could forgive and the other could not.Just like 'SilverFin' I listened to the book, read by Nathaniel Parker. Brilliant as always but where Charmian has a Scottish accent n the first book, she now had an English one.The best writing of the novel is that of James' encounter with the world's deadliest animal. Higson knows how to write things in a way that affects the reader, even after the book ends. Just thinking about it now...I look forward to the next Young Bond book, 'Double or Die', the last to be narrated by Parker.(From my blog: Quill Caf\u00e9)In accordance with the FTC, I would like to disclose that I purchased this book.

Funnily enough Bond doesn't actually make much of an appearance in this book until the end.The story follows a girl called Amy who's father is murdered when their yacht is ambushed and ransacked by a group of pirates, the leader being Zoltan. Zoltan and his pirates kidnap Amy but the story soon begins to escalate after Zoltan falls in love with her. That's why I would class this book as a forbidden romance even though the feeling isn't mutual, because the idea of a kidnapper falling in love with his victim is disturbing and taboo.Can I stress however, that this book is not one of those soppy romances where the protagonist falls in love with her kidnapper despite the fact he murdered her dad. Amy despises Zoltan and is constantly trying to escape and look for opportunities to escape, to the point where she even stabs him, much like how Dolores/Lolita tries to escape from Humbert in Lolita. And like Humbert in Lolita, Zoltan knows his attempts to try and pursue Amy are wrong, but he can't help his infatuation.Part of the reason I rate this book so highly is because when I was originally reading it,  I could not put it down, or stop talking about it! I remember going up to all my friends and telling them how I was reading this amazing book and was informing them about what happens every step of the way. That's why if I could, I would rate this book 6 stars. Yeah it may not be the most intelligent book I've ever read, or nowhere near as intelligent as Lolita, but this book was profound and memorable and I honestly couldn't put it down at the time so I highly recommend you read it.5/6 stars."}, {"userName": "Mark ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4362514-mark", "userReview": "\u201cBlood Fever\u201d is an inspiring novel full of mystery, action and adventure. The story is about an adolescent boy named James Bond. He attends a very preppy english school called Eton. When James\u2019s teacher talks about a school trip to visit the ruins in the Mediterranean, he sees it as a perfect opportunity to leave the crew and stay at his Uncle Victor\u2019s villa in Sardinia, Italy. James suspicion raises when he comes across clues in England and Sardinia about a cult called the Millenaria. When James meets a man named Count Ugo Carnifex, he becomes very skeptical about his island and his morals. James soon becomes tied up with a plot for world domination and it is up to him to not only rescue a prisoner but save the island from destruction.\u201cBlood Fever\u201d by Charlie Higson is a very well written book. Higson knows how to write a story that can focus my attention and keep me entertained. Straight from the beginning, the book had me hooked. There are times in the middle where the story was a little slow, but the ending made up for it. Higson knows how to put James Bond in very uncomfortable situations that can make the reader feel worried for the character. When James was captured, it seemed like there was now way of escape and he truly was going to die. Though, there wouldn\u2019t be a sequel if he did. The characters are also very easy to understand and relate to. I would give \u201cBlood Fever\u201d by Charlie Higson five out of five stars because of the engaging story and great writing. I really enjoyed the first book of the series called \u201cSilverfin.\u201d The genre of the books accommodate perfectly to me. The books are fast paced and very interesting. There is always a twist at the end which I never see coming. \u201cBlood Fever\u201d was full of action, adventure, mystery, and suspense.

Most of the story takes place over summer vacation from Eton in 1933 as Bond is persuaded to go on a class trip to Sardinia where he uncovers a criminal conspiracy and a secret society dedicated to the rebirth of the Roman Empire led by a delusional leader who thinks himself to be the next Julius Ceasar funding his wealth with stolen paintings and artifacts. Bond encounters pirates, bandits, and two teenage girls along the way: one who he promises to save from captivity and another who helps save his life. The danger element in this story is amped up quite a bit from the first book as we get introduced to Bond's very first torture scene and we see Bond take many daring risks along the way. Indeed, as Bond matures he seems to have a penchant for thriving on danger and excitement. Early on, we find that he joins a secret \"Danger Society\" at Eton comprised of boys who dare to risk meeting after curfew jumping over rooftops to their secret hiding place. Indeed, when Bond is in real danger later on in the story, there are some quite stirring rooftop sequences and a quite a few references to Thunderball and You Only Live Twice. This story is a surefire pageturner with stunning plot twists and an amazing setting full of intrigue and wonder with a great tie in to some of the ancient history of the region.
