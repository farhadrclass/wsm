Let me say right away that I take my hat off to Mr Wintle for his brave and, dare-I-say foolhardy, venture. I'm admit I\u2019ve never been a parent, and after getting through to the end of this book - I'm quite certain I would not voluntarily throw myself into parenting a teenager - and especially not when the teenager is street-smart, creative, sassy, drawn to other troubled youth for company and seemingly a trouble magnet. Wintle writes with a warm and humorous voice, quickly engaging my attention with the details of his family members, his circle of Big Apple friends, his candid flashbacks to his lost loves, heart-breaking family tragedies and unfulfilled ambitions and dreams. This is definitely not a Disney-production storyline \u2013 some very explosive and confrontations between uncle and niece are outlined \u2026 but Wintle skilfully weaves enough warm fuzzy connection moments into the book to avoid the whole thing sinking into a sturm und drang pit.Given the age of the niece, I as an avid reader-observer got to experience the almost to be expected battles with an early teenager over internet and mobile phone use, curfews, drug use, appropriate clothing choices, staying over at friends, allowance limits, safe sex, body image issues and best friend woes. Given Wintle\u2019s age bracket, I was also privy to a range of financial, career, health, dating and mid-life transitional issues facing a stressed forty-something, good-looking film agent. It would seem the dynamic power in their uncle-niece relationship forces each to look honestly at themselves, their motives and needs and subsequent emotional and personal growth is achieved. Without giving away anything too much, two thirds of the way into the book, Wintle throws up a curve-ball that I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for and it took me the rest of the book to get over this shocking reveal. And so whilst the book ends on a good note for me \u2013 there\u2019s some sobering elements which stops the final scenes ending with an all-out song and dance sequence through Central Park.Throughout the book, I laughed, I cried, I rejoiced, I was outraged \u2026 and since I was so thoroughly moved \u2013 I can only recommend others read this book to discover what it is like to have breakfast with a Tiffany. Wintle does leave the ending open for some kind of a sequel but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s working on such at present."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john", "userReview": "Book reads quite well, but had the feel of a fiction piece to me as I went through it; not that he was making up details, but that they're so precise at times it was tough to accept such exact recall (though he mentions near the end he was taking notes, of a sort).There were a couple of points at which I nearly gave up on the book, between Wintle's shallowness and his refusal to deal with Tiffany's manipulative behavior.

Honestly, the title is what really appealed to me - clearly, it wasn't anything to do with Breakfast at Tiffany's, but I appreciated the reference.This novel, this memoir, is a truthful, brutally honest book about life. I can't say I know what it's like to be in the author's place - I'm not a man, I'm not gay, I am not the guardian of my niece and I don't even live in America - but the little things are just so real.Tiffany's home life isn't great, and one day her uncle volunteers to take her in. Never did he anticipate so much drama and pain from such a small girl. She's thirteen when she first moves in with her Uncle Eddy, and despite being a nice girl she is known to hang around with the wrong crowd. No matter how hard he tries, Eddy cannot prevent her from finding similar friends at her new school.The pair really go through their ups and downs, and Ed himself talks a lot about personal thoughts and issues. He'd tested HIV-positive many years ago, and was also an unsuccessful actor. He broke up with his boyfriend relatively recently, and suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder. Basically, life just has not turned out the way he'd planned.Living with a teenager teaches him a lot of things. He is reminded of his own youth, and has to get on with his life all while keeping Tiffany going too. It's not easy. Things do get rough, and he does find himself wondering why he ever got himself into this. But in the end their relationship is good, and they have a lot of fun together.I did find this book great. It has hints of humour, conveys the bitter truth, and even gave me a taste of what it's like to be a guardian of a teenage girl. There are definitely references I would have appreciated more had I been older than sixteen, and many of Ed's problems, thoughts or situations may have been more interesting or important to an older generation.That being said, I actually kind of loved this book. It isn't quite in my favourites - but who knows, maybe in thirty years time it will be. I think I can easily give Breakfast with Tiffany: An Uncle's Memoir 4.5 stars out of the full five."}, {"userName": "Liu Zhen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1670618-liu-zhen", "userReview": "Title: Breakfast with Tiffany: An Uncle\u2019s MemoirAuthor: Edwin John WintlePages: 352Publisher: 140135999X (ISBN13: 9781401359997) Breakfast with Tiffany: An Uncle\u2019s Memoir is a story about a gay forty-year old uncle becomes the guardian of his niece, a thirteen year old girl named Tiffany. The story started out very interesting with the rebellious experiences of Tiffany from Connecticut. As soon as the story unfolds, I found the tone of the novel dull and drowning. I gave up reading before half way through the book. At thirteen, Tiffany drinks and smoke and rarely goes to school. The plot seems a little unrealistic from my perspective. I did find motives to continue to read this book at the beginning. However, as the story continues itself, I can easily predict what is going to happen in the next few chapters since it is a memoir: Tiffany moves to New York City to live with his uncle, Tiffany do not like being in New York City, Tiffany slowly adopts to her new environment, and Tiffany gets to know her uncle and they learn from each other so on. I would recommend this book to people who likes memoirs and people who are undergoing teenager issues such as moving to a new place, and dealing with new relatives and environments. This book is for teenagers, and adults who are trying to get along with each other. People can really get a lot out of Tiffany and her uncle through this book."}, {"userName": "george", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090413-george", "userReview": "What happens when a forty-something gay man living in New York takes in his troubled fourteen-year-old niece for a year (or four)? We find out in Breakfast With Tiffany. Edwin enjoys his New York lifestyle as a single gay man working a stressful job as a film agent. But the relationship between his sister and niece is deteriorating fast and Tiffany is getting into more trouble than her mother can handle. Edwin steps in and offers to move Tiffany to NY to live with him and try to get her back on the right track. He had no idea what he was in for. The uncle and niece had previously had a good open relationship, with her living with him for a few summers, but this Tiffany is angry and feels victimized and Edwin is about to b introduced to a world that he knows little about: parenting. From finding a school to dealing with her bad crowd; talking about sex and trying to make Tiffany realize her potential; Edwin recounts the experience in detail. I really enjoyed this. It's beautiful to see how the relationship between Tiffany and her uncle evolves over the course of a year. They make gains and setbacks and gains and setbacks. Edwin shares a lot about his own life as well, which is interesting, relevant, and not distracting.

Tiffany is being *saved* from her life in Connecticut, where she fought with her recovering alcoholic mother, associated with delinquents and feared her mother's violent boyfriend. Wintle portrays Tiffany as a complex teenager. She drinks, smokes and dabbles in drugs yet sings beautifully, writes poetry and excels in school when she tries. Throughout all the events in Tiffany\u2019s life, Wintle struggles with his responsibilities as a guardian while trying to maintain his own life and career.

His life is pretty cool - nice NY apartment, good job in the movie business - and then he offers to take in his troubled 13-year-old niece, Tiffany. This book chronicles one year of Ed and Tiffany living together. It's based on a true story, although Ed admits that some parts are fictionalized. Perhaps one such part is the fact that his 13-year-old niece is a freshman in high school. I'm not sure how the East Coast school system works, but when I was 13, I was in 7th grade. I turned 15 when I was a freshman in high school. For a kid who apparently is a terrible student, I doubt that \"Tiffany\" skipped a few grades. But whatever.

He's more self-centered than I could sympathize with, even after learning what he'd been through in his own life from adolescence onwards. At times he was just as much a teenager as his niece, and that was his downfall in his conflicts with her. I suspect he at least had some internal acknowledgment of his failure to be the mature adult in their relationship, but sometimes I wanted him to admit it to his readers, too. Still, this book inclues a refreshingly honest take on American urban teenage life, as well as dysfunctional family issues like alcoholism, domestic violence, and general irresponsibility and selfishness."}, {"userName": "Thegirlintheafternoon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5934736-thegirlintheafternoon", "userReview": "Read for the Modern Mrs. Darcy Reading Challenge - a book you've been meaning to readI put this book on the first page of my actual, hard-copy \"to be read\" journal in 2005, when the book was first published, so it is kind of the ultimate \"been meaning to read it\" book for me.
