The trail is full of bad decisions, corruption, PTSD, arrogant jerks, mysterious documents, and a blood-crazed grizzly bear. Somehow, it all fits together.Fans of the Pendergast series will find many similarities between this book and Still Life With Crows. I can't touch on why too much without spoilers, but I will say you will either love it because you loved that one, or, you might think they are a little too much alike. While it didn't really bother me, a couple of times I thought that the storylines were getting awfully close to each other.I have said before - I believe on some of my previous Pendergast reviews - that you could probably read this alone without reading the series, but I think you are doing yourself a disservice if you skip the rest of the series. In summary - White Fire - not your typical Pendergast story, but definitely brings back memories of earlier novels. Worth the ride - and it's a hell of a ride!"}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "Seeing Douglas Preston in person (twice) and Lincoln Child via Skype (once), I can\u2019t help but be enthralled by the eccentricities of these two individuals, and the odd dynamic that must ensue from this powerful writing duo. So it\u2019s hard not to see how Aloysius Pendergast might have developed from these two brilliant minds fully formed and ready for action. He\u2019s odd and eccentric and intriguing and his dark suits never manage to get wrinkle, even when he\u2019s bounding through snow drifts up to his chin or playing Russian roulette with a loaded revolver.More than just Pendergast, though, WHITE FIRE filled its pages with entertaining characters and a few individuals from the days of yore. With Corrie Swanson leading the charge and immersing herself in skeletal remains and mining caves and mountain passes, this novel piles on roadblocks and adventures in equal measure, and then douses the remains in cans of kerosene. With stoic individuals stepping to the forefront and the interweaving of a story within a story, this novel moves forward as much as it lingers in antiquity. Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde and Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson weave through the pages, leaving footprints in white blankets and half-eaten meals behind.The rush of adrenaline helped me maneuver from the first page to the last, the throttle easing just enough to keep me from overexertion, the pages pounding with the precision of a jackhammer. The vibrations echoed through my hands and all the way up my forearms, as I drove my snowmobile through the ensuing avalanche. The tight plot fit about as well as a snug pair of gloves, and I leaned my back from the resultant wind current, my teeth chattering and my feet stamping in protest.If you don\u2019t mind Pendergast avoiding the spotlight as opposed to standing in the limelight, acting more as a mentor than the lead investigator, and you enjoy your plots more tightly woven than a pair of mittens, you\u2019ll probably find yourself enjoying this Colorado tale.I received this book for free through NetGalley.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Preston and Child never cease to amaze and this book helps cement the fact that their Pendergast series remains to this day one of my top favorite series. do I really have to wait another year for another?*Be on the lookout for a Q&A with the authors in the upcoming few weeks. I'll put links here, but it will be posted at Shelf Inflicted and a few other blogs! WITH A GIVEAWAY! :)The RECAP:Corrie Swanson needs to make a huge splash on her thesis, as she\u2019s competing in John Jay College\u2019s Rosewell Prize for Outstanding thesis and a junior, like her, has never won before. After a few failed attempts to pitch ideas to her advisor, a conversation with the College\u2019s museum/library coordinator leads her to an interesting tale: Oscar Wilde, famed author, heard tales of bear attacks in Roaring Fork, Colorado, in which the bears devoured the victims. Thinking that she could provide a huge contribution to research in the area of animal markings left on bones, she forces her advisor\u2019s hand into approval and sets out to the rich tourist trap of a town. The ski resort city, while at first seeming to be friendly and willing to lend her a hand, soon closes the proverbial doors on her. Things escalate, leaving Corrie in prison for a simple B&E, and Pendergast steps in. Good thing too, because Corrie\u2019s discoveries reveal that it was something other than a bear that ate those miners a century before\u2026 and soon, a serial arson killer joins the fray. The slow burn becomes a raging fire and a race against time as three massive storylines, along with a Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle thread, reach an explosive, fiery finish.The REVIEWWow, what a ride! This might just be my favorite entry to the series since Book of the Dead. Not to say there haven\u2019t been some great books since the end of the Diogenes trilogy, but this one really raises the bar. Fast-paced, chock full of murders, Sherlock Holmes, shocking twists near the end, great new characters, and even a moment of Pendergast showing some real emotion.There are three main storylines in White Fire.1. Corrie\u2019s thesis project, based around the bodies of 9 miners who had been killed and eaten by *something* in the 1870s, when the town was still a huge mining area rather than a ritzy ski resort -- and the powers controlling the town fighting against her solving the mystery.2. A serial killer and arsonist, murdering townie after townie and burning their bodies and their homes, as Pendergast works with local law enforcement (who are in over their heads with said killer) to catch them as soon as possible.3. The search for a lost Sherlock Holmes story that Conan Doyle wrote after hearing a disturbing tale from Oscar Wilde at a chance dinner meeting.All three of them are done well and integrated seamlessly into one big novel. The ending is cringeworthy, in a good way\u2026 it will have you on the edge of your seat as you await the conclusion, which ties up well, and hopefully has brought a new character into our beloved cast of recurring players.Overall, I give this story a 5 out of 5 stars. One of my favorite reads of the year, and one of my favorite entries of the series, right up there with Still Life with Crows, Book of the Dead, and my personal number one, Cabinet of Curiosities.*I was provided an ARC for review by the publisher and Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "This book was really good, the story was very interesting and I love the connection to Arthur Conan Doyle.

Agent Pendergast takes a backseat to Corrie Swanson (from Still Life With Crows), his protege, and a student at John Jay College, majoring in criminology. She has to write a thesis and has stumbled on a series of grizzly bear maulings of miners in a Colorado mining camp, now turned into one of the priciest ski resorts in the country. At the same time, someone is targeting the homes and lives of these one-percenters, burning their houses down with the occupants bound and still alive inside. There's also a tie to Oscar Wilde and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the form of a lost Sherlock Holmes story that Pendergast intuits will be the key to solving the mystery of the bear maulings. It all adds up to a surprisingly dull mystery, with some of the worst characterizations I've read in a Preston/Child novel. Corrie Swanson, our protagonist, is particularly poorly-written and continually does dumb things, merely because the story requires her to. The mystery of who the serial arsonist is could be solved by a third grader. And why the writers felt the need to fictionalize Aspen as \"Roaring Fork,\" is beyond me. Very disappointing novel, possibly the worst in the entire Pendergast series."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "First up I have to admit that I have not read any of this series about FBI Agent Pendergast. However, I don't think that matters as it seems to be an off-shoot of the series entered on Pendergast's protege, Corrie Swanson. Corrie is a college student who decides to enter a competition for the best forensic study by doing an in depth examination of some recently exhumed bones of a group of miners killed and eaten by a bear in the Rockies. However, when Corrie examines the bones she finds that the marks left on them are not quite what she expected. When Corrie's investigations land her in trouble with the local Mayor and police, Agent Pendergast arrives on the scene to rescue her and is asked to stay on to investigate a series of house fires.This was an entertaining read. There is an interesting connection with Arthur Conan Doyle who heard the grizzly tale of the miners. However, I didn't find Corrie a very likeable or believable character. She's whiny and self centred and frankly quite stupid in what are clearly dangerous situations. Agent Pendergast is an enigmatic character who seems to instil fear and respect into all who meet him so I do intend to go back and pick up the start of the series to read more about his cases."}, {"userName": "Charleen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2202347-charleen", "userReview": "I wasn't a huge fan of the Helen Trilogy, and I was unsure of this one in the beginning because Pendergast seemed to be very much on the periphery of the story... but in the end, I didn't have to worry. There's plenty of Pendergast to keep things feeling familiar, and I liked exploring his relationship with Corrie (makes me want to go back and read Still Life with Crows again).

It is basically Preston and Child's acknowledgement of the fact that Pendergast has drawn heavily from Holmes. This story has all the classic Pendergast elements going for it - a bunch of gory killings, an isolated place, some returning characters, great writing and Pendergast is not being as much of a dick as he's being lately. But, a couple of things bothered me. The first issue is how the final act relies on the stupidity of a main character to advance (which feels like lazy writing to me) . The second is a Hardy Boys type ending where we think someone is killed but is not actually. This plot device has been used repeatedly in the series and it bugs the hell out of me.But still, on the whole, this book is great."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16376057-jen", "userReview": "This was not a Pendergast book of note. Too much Corrie and not enought Pendergast. He's why I wait for the next in the series. Corrie pretty much annoyed me from the get go. Whiney, self-absorbed and quite stupid. There also didn't seem to be the thought, depth and layers that there normally are. I figured out who the arsonist was a quarter, maybe, of the way into the book. I realize that they can't bring back the older characters, but if Corrie is going to be a predominant character, I may decide not to continue with this series. I did, however, really like the weaving of the Wilde/Conan-Doyle story. I understand that over time it becomes more and more difficult to keep a series fresh and interesting. The Pendergast series has been one of my ultimate favorites since Relic. Maybe it's time to retire Pendergast."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "I've read the first novel of the Pendergast series, Relic by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, when it first came out in the 90s. It didn't impress me much, at least not enough to check out another Pendergast novel. I'm assuming I didn't like it because I remember hardly any of it. I have the enviable skill of being able to mentally block out books I don't like. It is a helpful superpower in which only the political rants of Anne Coulter seem to be immune to. Anne Coulter is my Kryptonite. But my talent is fairly reliable with anything else. When the recently published White Fire came under my radar as being the 13th book of the series, I figured I might as well return to it. After all, the novels seem to be popular enough to last two decades.I must admit White Fire was fun, albeit average fun. I do remember Relic as having supernatural elements. Yet White Fire is a fairly straight mystery. Pendergast is a somewhat eccentric FBI agent with Sherlockian perception and a disregard for the unconventional. He also seems to have amassed a loyal range of sidekicks and researchers. The main character in this novel is not Pendergast but a young forensic science student and Pendergast protege, Corrie Swanson, who he has helped in previous books. There is a lot of references to characters and events for the reader who has kept up with the series yet White Fire stands well on its own. The basic premise is that Corrie is researching the history of a 19th century string of grizzly bears attacks in an old frontier town for her university thesis. That frontier town is now a winter resort for the wealthy and her investigation is not only stirring up the town elite but pointing to a bigger mystery. I found it very entertaining. Yet I also felt it was slightly contrived. There are lots of set-up situations with sane people acting illogical. The main violator was Corrie Swanson who, for a person who is supposed to be quite bright, has a habit of doing really stupid things that would only happen if you needed it to move on the plot line like going out alone in a blizzard or ignoring the signs that say, \"Caution, Do not feed the homicidal maniac\". Pendergast is more interesting but he seems to have been placed a little on the back burner for this installment. But I must admit I now have an urge to go back to some of the older books.So overall, it is a very fun read. Despite the wintery background, I would label it as a good summer read for the beach or maybe even by the fireplace at a ski resort. You really don't think you'll find me on a snowy hillside trying to break my neck, do you? I'll read.

This book utterly failed to live up to my expectations. I read it in two sittings and felt as it focused more on the protege than on Pendergast.

His character seemed to regain much of his beloved \"superiority\" and unerring instincts that were sadly lacking from some previous books. Although I'm not a fan of Corrie Swanson (with the exception of her debut in STILL LIFE WITH CROWS), her character didn't bother me quite as much or \"detract\" unnecessarily from the overall narrative. Also pleasant to note was that this was a stand-alone novel, and not the start of yet another trilogy. I really enjoy most of the Preston/Child novels, and hope that the authors continue to develop Pendergast's character as the enigmatic force that he started out as, through additional non-series novels.Recommended!"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "Pendergast returns after the \"Helen trilogy\" which for me was somewhat a dip in the road in the series as written by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child. For one I do not like books with open endings and reading one story over three years, one that occasionaly flirted more than any book before with an too overly amount of suspense of disbelieve.But all is well with this new tale of Pendergast & Corrie Swanson, his protege and one of the persons he protects and stimulates. This tale of Americana is about the past of the US when the world was perhaps a darker place for the average citizen trying to build a life for him/herself. A story about a frontier and mining city and the \"realities\" of life there and now.Corrie Swanson travels for her thesis to a former miningtown and now multi-millionaires skiing resort. Her thesis concerns the tale of 14 men mauled and killed by a bear some 150 years ago, and after trying to study the remains she discovers something that will result in her getting jailed with a prospect of 10 years of jailtime. Enter Pendergast and an arsonist and the story starts running towards a dark page of history.The story is also about a missing tale of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Conan Doyle, and it too through a dinner with Oscar Wilde has a connection with this small paradise for the rich and its past.Another tour the force by this writing dua that is far more satisfying than the previous installments in threes. I prefer them writing in one closed story instead of big stories over three years. But that might be me and my impatience.I love the insight they give in the imperfect past of the US and its oddities. They did write a very exciting tale and the fact that they added the popularity of Sherlock Holmes through a tale within their story means they did well tapping into an extra source of readers or are just touching a vein of interest of themselves. I do not know why the writers chose for the figure of Arthur Conan Doyle and his creation Holmes. For all it is worth they did use him very effectively and made sure it is a part of the story, and it undoubtely added some pages to the grand total.These writers can still pull the purse-strings on my wallet with each release and a book as good and entertaining as this strengthens my somewhat blind faith in their writing. Which is good as this year will give us the release of a Gideon novel halfway the year and in November the next Pendergast novel.An easy and exciting read well worth anybody his or her time."}, {"userName": "Minnette", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1768549-minnette", "userReview": "This was a Pendergast novel that was not really worth the wait. I have been an avid lover of the series, but was very disappointed with this one. The story line was ok but I really missed the usual team of characters. They were all briefly mentioned but not in a way that moved the story along in any way. Pendergast himself was missing in a great deal of the book. I didn't understand why Preston and Child made Corrie the center of the book and then wrote her in such a whiny, spoiled, selfish way. She became so predictable during most of the book that I almost didn't finish it.I actually was happy when she was presumed dead. The way Pendergast responded, his angst and sadness, could have made for a darker Pendergast in the next book. Instead she was alive, learned nothing from her experience and instead was being rewarded for her stupid behavior and they all shared a warm fuzzy ending.Not what I expected from the normally great Preston & Child."}, {"userName": "Mihir", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229652-mihir", "userReview": "Full review over at Fantasy Book CriticOVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: After the traumatic events showcased in Two Graves, readers were presented with a broken Pendergast (mentally, and a bit world-weary). So readers were interested to see what would happen to him post the revelations of the climax of the Helen Pendergast trilogy. What I liked was how the authors decided to side-step reader expectations.This book is a standalone story and focuses on Corrie Swanson as she is looking for a historical project in regards to her thesis work. Once she finds out about a grizzly bear massacre in Colorado, she is hooked on to the case as it gives her a unique take on forensic odontology. Upon reaching the town, Corrie finds that things are never that forthcoming and she takes some unnecessary measures to reach her goal (proving her immaturity to readers). She lands in big trouble and it\u2019s left to Pendergast to help her as is his wont.Pendergast however takes a secondary role in the happenings of the book and this aspect of the book was very similar to his earliest appearances in Relic & Reliquary. I loved that the authors took this step as it made him into the mysterious enigma we know him to be. This story is entirely Corrie's story and it makes for a fascinating change to read. The icing of this story is its connection to Arthur Conan Doyle and his erstwhile creation: Sherlock Holmes, both of which form a vital cog of the plot. So not only do the readers get to read about Pendergast, they also get a brand new Sherlock Holmes story that is officially sanctioned by the Arthur Conan Doyle estate. This is an absolute first among recent thriller writers and kudos to Messrs. Preston & Child for this fantastic addition to the story.As with previous Preston-Child books, characterization remains a strong point and it\u2019s no different here. While I'm not a big fan of Corrie as a protagonist, she was much less abrasive or antagonistic (in her people skills) this time around and this perhaps heralds a mature turn to her (which is good). In this regard Corrie is presented as she is known to readers of the previous books but with more maturity and therefore this book is perhaps the best of her appearances. There's a small but crucial bit of news in regards to D'Agosta & another favorite character of mine, which was pretty cool to know. Lastly this book also introduces another intriguing and formidable side character, who is a former military captain and I hope the authors give her a bigger role in their future books. The pace of the story along with the plot twists are the strong points and while some twists are easily predictable, the uncertain nature of the storyline and its horrific climax help in making this story to further consolidate the plus-points.White Fire is a good follow-up thriller to the utterly fascinating Helen Pendergast trilogy. It is very much similar in scope to Still Life With Crows (which was also Corrie's debut) but presents a much different landscape. The story also has the addition of the new Sherlock Holmes story and that was something that one almost never reads about. White Fire can also be read as a standalone story and for new readers, it would be a good place to be introduced to the world of A.X.L. Pendergast and many more intriguing characters that dwell in the imaginations of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "Corrie Swanson has gotten herself into some trouble with the local law in a small Colorado skiing town, so Special Agent Pendergast, much to her chagrin and (quiet) gratitude, arrives to save the day. It seems Ms. Swanson\u2019s research into some long ago \u201cbear attacks\u201d has the town worried about what she may uncover. Add that to some sudden mysterious cases of arson of multi-million dollar mansions, and Aloysius knows he has a little investigating to do. Coincidentally, there is also a connection with a long lost Sherlock Holmes story. So \u2026\u2026 the reader gets a little bit of Hounds of Baskerville, something a little reminiscent of the Donner Party, and as another reviewer pointed out as well, some striking similarities to Still Life with Crows. Somehow it all blends together into an interesting story, but not one of team Douglas/Child\u2019s best. Aloysius is absent through much of this book, so Corrie Swanson is left to carry the story. I understand that she is, or at least would like to be Pendergast\u2019s new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but I missed the presence of Constance (given a mere mention in this book after playing a tantalizingly larger role in last book) as well as his usual big city entourage. Aloysius is by nature a very solemn and serious character and other than mourning his dead wife readers have not seen a lot of emotion from him, so I did enjoy a little display of his softer side in this book. I also have to confess that I laughed out loud at one scene where he could only be described as uncharacteristically disheveled. Does this portent of a change in Pendergast? I really hope not. I\u2019ve really come to like his uber-intelligent aloofness. Another Goodreads reviewer wrote that she enjoyed this book despite not having read any previous Pendergast books. I can see how this one worked well as a stand alone, or a \u201cjump into the middle of the series\u201d introductory book because of the lack of the peripheral characters, however as a constant reader I hope they come back in subsequent books and I certainly encourage anyone starting with this book (and enjoying it, of course) to go back to the beginning of the series, it\u2019s well worth it."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "Ah Pendergast, you have returned and I am so very glad to see you are back in form.

Fortunately, White Fire proved to be everything we've come to expect from the man in black . . . and then some.As it turns out, having Corrie take the lead was a smart move. The events of the Diogenes Trilogy (dealing with his brother) and the Helen Trilogy (dealing with his wife) revealed a bit too much of our enigmatic detective, removing much of his mystery. Having seen him at his very darkest, confronted by the very human sort of concerns and conflicts from which he once seemed so far removed, it's nice to have him step back a bit and once again resemble the odd sort of hero we first came to know and admire. That's not to say Preston and Child have rolled back time or forgotten his suffering - there are some glimmers of emotion here that are quite powerful - but they've allowed him to regain his composure and rebuild the walls of his personality.As for Corrie, she's a very different sort of protagonist, but likable despite her flaws. She's impetuous, headstrong, and rebellious . . . a typical college student. Her attitude gets her into a lot of trouble, and while some readers may accuse Preston and Child of exploiting that fiery defiance to create some of the novel's tension, there's nothing that is out of place for her character. We, as readers, may know it's never a good idea to ignore Agent Pendergast's advice, but when your education and your future career are on the line, in jeopardy of being overshadowed by a man of such legendary stature, you can't fault Corrie for her actions.As for the plot, there are really three story lines here that slowly converge over the course of the novel, revealing the extent to which they're connected. The 19th century forensic mystery that forms the basis of Corrie's thesis is probably the most unsettling of the three, pointing as it does to some very grotesque criminal behavior among the miners of the time. The contemporary mystery of the murderous arsonist is far more sensational, with some incredibly horrifying scenes of callous torture that rival anything we've seen before, but it's tainted by the times. We've come to expect that kind of violence - we see it every day in the news, or on television at night. While the events of 150 years ago aren't quite as sensational, they must be considered in the context of the time . . . a time in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself could hardly believe the news.That brings us to the third story line, that which pulls everything together. Having heard the true story of what happened from Oscar Wilde, Doyle wrote one last Sherlock Holmes story on the subject, but it was rejected as being far too horrific for Victorian sensibilities. It falls to Agent Pendergast to investigate the situation and track down that 'lost' story, which provides him with the clues to solve the case. Not only do Preston and Child incorporate Doyle as a character, but they set out to write that 'lost' tale, with the approval of Doyle's estate. It's a very Hound of the Baskervilles type story that they include here, serving as both an homage to the man who inspired Pendergast, and as a solid story all on its own.As for how it all concludes, the final pages of White Fire contain the same kind of breakneck pacing, twists, turns, and betrayals we've come to expect from the series. There's one scene I thought was a bit of a cheat, with the big reveal something we couldn't have easily anticipated, but looking back I can see the clues that at least suggested the possibility. Corrie comes off as a legitimate heroine in her own right, with a terrifying flight through rattlesnake infested old mining tunnels that is Indiana Jones worthy. As for Pendergast, he is very much the hero of old, restored and rejuvenated, and passionate once again about a mystery for the sake of a mystery.While I wouldn't count it in my top three Agent Pendergast adventures, it was still a great read, and one that deserves its place on the holiday bestseller lists. Yes, Agent Pendergast is back in fine form in White Fire. Fans will not be disappointed, and new readers will find this an easy entry point into the series.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike", "userReview": "White Fire is the newest book about the ever-intriguing Special Agent Prendergast. I received a copy of White Fire from the publisher via the good graces of blogger Steven White. In return, with many thanks to Steven, I am writing my honest review of this novel.Although I have not read the entire series, I have enjoyed several of them (and must remember to write up a few missing reviews in my copious free time). I have missed a few of the later books, so this novel picks up in unfamiliar territory. Like all of the novels, there are mysteries at the heart of this book, but unlike the earlier ones, there is a significant major and continuing character who undertakes the discovery and solution of them.First a little background (with minimal spoilers).The setting is a very tony US ski resort straddling the continental divide. A set of human remains has been unearthed to expand an exclusive housing development. While awaiting reburial, the remains attract the attention of Corrie Swanson a student of criminal studies who has been taken under Prendergast\u2019s care in a previous book. Among them are several victims who were supposedly killed by a grizzly bear during the days of active silver mining. She plans to use this study to augment forensic knowledge about animal attacks.In the town, she meets the Chief of Police. He agrees that her needs are reasonable and expects to give her permission the next day. From that moment on, things go bad very quickly. Without Agent Prendergast\u2019s timely arrival and assistance she would be jailed, dead or worse (worse!)The core story is pretty good. The research (as always) is excellent and convincing. Perhaps my memory is faulty, but this book seemed to be faster-paced than the first few. It definitely held my attention and I kept making time to read more: something I have not done much of lately. There were a few plot points that seemed a bit obvious to me, but in general the mysteries were excellent and maintained right up to the very end of the novel. Some of the final twists were among the best.Since I skipped the most recent few, I can speak for those who are new to the series. While I recommend that you do read the earlier novels, if you pick this up \u201ccold\u201d, you are going to enjoy it. There are enough backward references to answer the basic \u201chuh?\u201d questions while not so many that you are left wondering when the flashbacks are going to stop and the book get down to current business.Like every book written by this team, you have a solid story with good action. This book (as you can easily find out) has huge \u201cextras\u201d in it. First, it opens with the true story (which I had heard before) of how Arthur Conan Doyle met Oscar Wilde and they both agreed to write new novels for a publisher. (Doyle\u2019s will be The Sign of the Four, Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray). While this prologue is exciting enough, in the body of the novel they include a formerly lost (and final) Sherlock Holmes story, penned by Doyle in his later years. It\u2019s a pretty good story and very germane to the main plot. Plus, they introduce a member of the Baker Street Irregulars who helps tie this all together (comments not necessarily in chronological book order!)If you are looking for a well-developed, well-written yarn that moves quickly and holds your interest, then this is a great choice. If you are, like me, a Holmes fan who will devour everything and anything that includes even the merest hint of the Great Detective, then you will be very pleased with this book. This is an easy Four Star (4.0) ranking.  I strongly recommend the book and the series."}, {"userName": "Lanie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1838636-lanie", "userReview": "I read this book when it came out in November. I fell in love with it right away. A Pendergast novel is always a great gift to unwrap. He is clearly my favorite FBI agent. He's odd, he's brilliant, he doesn't like rules and he gets results. His oddities and his equally odd family are one of the reasons I will never stop reading them. Thank you, Doug and Linc, for giving us this wonderful character and his crazy family. Along with his family, there is another kind of family. His friends, colleagues, employees and acquaintances who remain loyal to him - Vinnie, Proctor, Wren, Mime, Constance, and of course our favorite goth, Corrie Swanson, who Pendergast 'rescued' from Medicine Creek, Kansas in Still Life With Crows. I always applaud any Pendergast novel that takes it out of the regular setting of NYC where Pendergast lives at the Dakota on the upper west side and also the house at 891 Riverside Drive in a more dangerous part of Manhattan. Whenever he has to travel, I feel he is stripped of a lot of his conveniences and comfort of his home and familiar surroundings. Personally, I am quite amused of the things that Pendergast finds annoying. We do see some growth in Miss Swanson - although not much, I'm afraid. But I like Corrie. I always have, and although there are times when Corrie's big mouth or acting before thinking gets her into trouble. But that's Corrie. I found it interesting that Pendergast, while a helpful mentor, is more of a researcher in this novel. If you've never read a Pendergast novel, he appears to be the secondary character, and that this is Corrie's story. Roaring Fork (what I believe is a Aspen-like town) is a beautiful setting. There is history there that is fascinating, and we uncover it along with Corrie, and I wanted to know more. I don't want to give the story away, or discuss it, but there are some wonderfully emotional scenes in this book. We see a side of Pendergast that touched me so deeply, that we see how he regards Corrie much like he would a daughter. I have never read any Sherlock Holmes books before, but the Arthur Conan Doyle connection here has really intrigued me, and in my future I vow to invest some time in those stories as well. The story was haunting, and beautifully poetic in so many ways. I am a huge fan of anything that takes place in our past, and I love stories where the past and present come together. There is so much I loved about this book, but I don't want to put any spoilers in here. I will tell you that it does involve another memory crossing - most other Pendergast aficionados seem to enjoy that as well so I know I'm not alone- that helps us find out clues to the mystery that Corrie is attempting to uncover. I want to also mention the introduction of a new female character, Capt. Stacey Bowdrie, who I truly liked a lot. I wondered myself about her sexual orientation, however she is a very strong female character. I felt this novel had a lot of female characters here - more than I can recall in any other Pendergast novel. This books was a wonderful marriage of the past and present, a nice nod to Arthur Conan Doyle, and just a wonderful story that unfolds in a great way. The action here is more subdued - no high speed chases involving Vinnie D'Agosta- and we are far from the previous dramas in New York. There is no drama of Constance, and no talk of where Alban is, other than letters of correspondence. At the beginning of the book, Pendergast is in a very dark place, but at the end of the story, he is much closer to the Pendergast we knew prior to Helen's death. He is changed, and although he is the one who seems to always save Corrie, perhaps in this novel, in some ways, perhaps Corrie has saved him."}, {"userName": "John Connolly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8329824-john-connolly", "userReview": "Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have been writing together since about 1995, I think, although I seem to remember that Relic, their first collaboration, was attributed in the UK to \u201cPreston Child,\u201d and only later were they surgically separated, as it were. Again, there is a slight shift in style between the writers, with Preston, I\u2019d guess, being the denser prose stylist.White Fire is the thirteenth of their books to feature FBI Agent Aloysius Pendergast, many of which have been good fun. They did hit a bit of a bump in the road with the so-called \u201cHelen Trilogy,\u201d comprising a series of novels that required not so much a suspension of disbelief as the racking of it, culminating in an attempt to explain how someone could appear to be eaten by a lion when, in fact, that person may not actually have been, which is a difficult trick to pull off for all concerned. I remember once being asked if I worried about my novels becoming a bit like the later seasons of The X-Files, when the show became tied up with its own mythologies to a self-defeating extent, and the Helen Trilogy veered close to that territory. (I can\u2019t comment on my own books.)So it may have been that I approached White Fire with a certain degree of caution. It moves along at a fair old pace, and does dispense with all of the wife/lion business to concentrate on a self-contained plot but, unfortunately for me, that plot involves a lot of Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, pivoting, as it does, on a supposedly \u201clost\u201d Holmes story. I\u2019m sorry: Holmes remains a kind of blind spot for me. I enjoyed the original stories, and I\u2019m very fond of the BBC\u2019s modern reinvention of the character, even if \u2014 as in the latter half of Conan Doyle\u2019s own career \u2014 the plots are less involving than the characters of Holmes and Watson themselves. But I really don\u2019t have any patience with Sherlockiana, or people writing pastiches of Conan Doyle, however affectionately meant or well done they may be. I\u2019m starting to feel that, when authors die, their characters should be allowed to die with them. So it\u2019s not the fault of Preston or Child, who strike me as very decent sorts. It\u2019s not you, guys, it\u2019s me.Okay, and maybe a little bit you."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 A new Pendergast is a cause for celebrations, he is such a strange and unique character with such an intriguing back story. In this one his back story takes a back seat, so to say, and his protege Corrie, takes a much more active role. An old silver mining town, that has now become a very expensive skiing enclave for the very wealthy. An old cemetery, old bones and a very old story Oscar Wilde told Conan Doyle, in the late 1800's when they found themselves in the same place. Now adding Wilde and Doyle certainly made this an even better story, especially when a hunt ensues for a missing Sherlock Holmes story. So the past and the present meet, with a mystery that includes arson, those old bones and present day ancestors with much to hide.My only little reservation is that I did not really like Corrie very much in this one. Not the mystery or the investigation part, but in the personality department. Won;t say more on that front. you will have to read this and see what you think. Anyway it was good after the last several books to have Pendergast again doing what he does so well, though I have to admit I did miss Constance."}, {"userName": "TJ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7394286-tj", "userReview": "\"White Fire\", the latest Pendergast novel from Preston and Child is another terrific entry in the series that won't disappoint the FBI agent's legion of fans. Pendergast actually shares center stage with his young protege', Corrie Swanson, in this adventure set in a fabulously-rich gated community near the Continental Divide.Swanson, in attempt to finish her thesis for a law class, stumbles on to a 150-year old mystery while doing her research in Roaring Fork, CO. As she searches for answers to help explain the deaths of a number of miners apparently killed by a rogue grizzly bear, she determines that each set of remains also show evidence of cannibalism. As she digs deeper for clues, she runs afoul of the law by breaking into a secure facility. After Pendergast secures her release, the plot takes another turn as an arsonist begins to systematically murdering some of the community's highest profile residents. As Swanson returns to her research, Pendergast agrees to help the local police chief investigate the arsonist. Soon, the duo find that their cases are starting to intertwine and that the arsonist may actually be trying to cover up something larger. The plot soars from this point making the book extremely difficult to set down because Preston and Child keep the reader guessing all the way to the novel's satisfying conclusion.Fans of the series will enjoy the pacing of the novel while trying to stay in step with Pendergast's preternatural logic. Some suspension of disbelief is required, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of Pendergast's character. Swanson is made more likeable as we see more of her character (and vulnerability) in this novel. This should turn her into a more prominent player in the series. Preston and Child always leave their readers wanting more and \"White Fire\" will have fans counting the days until the next great Pendergast adventure arrives."}, {"userName": "Toby Tate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3914321-toby-tate", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of all things Pendergast, have read them all beginning with THE RELIC, and this is one of the best. Corrie Swanson, whom we all met back in STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, is going after a career in law enforcement with the help of her mentor, Pendergast. She is trying to write a research paper that will please her asshat of a college professor, and runs across some very unusual and gruesome killings that happened a century ago and appeared to be caused by a grizzly bear. Well, it wasn't a grizzly bear - it was something WAY more terrifying and disturbing. What's more, the town where she is researching in Colorado doesn't want its old bones (literally) dug up and exposed to the world, so now they're trying to silence Corrie. But it doesn't stop there - someone in the town is killing off locals by burning their houses down - with them in it. As usual, Corrie is caught in the middle, and with the help of Pendergast and a new-found friend, she invariably discovers that all of these things are tied together in a very bizarre way. Lots of thrills, chills and tension. One of my favorite sections of the book was a supposedly \"lost\" Sherlock Holmes story hidden by Arthur Conan Doyle, which Pendergast finds and induces Corrie to read, because this also ties in with the case. The short story reads as if Mr. Doyle had written it himself - an amazing piece of work. An added bonus for those who love Conan Doyle. WHITE FIRE is another fine read from two fine authors."}, {"userName": "Jim C", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10296231-jim-c", "userReview": "This is part of the Agent Pendergast series but this one can be read as a stand alone novel. In this one, Corrie is writing a thesis for college. She discovers a group of old grizzly attacks that took place in Roaring Fork, Colorado. She goes there to look over the bones and there is more to these killings than a grizzly attack.I have said this before that Agent Pendergast is truly a fascinating character. In my opinion, the last several books have veered away from what makes him one of the best fictional characters. This book reverts to the older books and his true nature. There are three different story arcs in this book. The first is with Corrie and her thesis. The second is of an arsonist in Roaring Fork. And the third has to do with Sherlock Holmes. While reading I had my doubts of these three independent arcs in one book but the authors tied all three in with each other beautifully. The Sherlock Holmes arc is concerned with a fictional lost manuscript of that character. The authors take liberty and write their own Holmes short story. I loved this aspect as there was a story within a story. I liked it so much I plan to visit that character in the near future.This book reminded me of the early entries in this series and I am so glad for this. Pendergast is back to being his old self of cunning, smugness, and being ten steps ahead of everyone else (the modern day Holmes?). This series works best when it involves a scientific reason behind a fantastical mystery and throw in action scenes for a perfect mix. This book does this and I loved every second of it."}, {"userName": "Gatorman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3940952-gatorman", "userReview": "Likeable but rather slight entry in the Pendergast series. Much more background than actual plot in the story and the character of Corrie continues to annoy. Pendergast is good as always and the story moves along nicely, but there just isn't much going on here and it pales in comparison to the prior Pendergast/Corrie novel, Still Life With Crows. I fear the series is getting tired and the authors are too afraid to shake things up or create a really intense, hard-edged story for fear that many of the new fans will be scared off. I, for one, long for the days of Relic and the stand-alones Riptide and Thunderhead where the books had a real edge to them.

From his introduction in \u2018The Relic\u2019 to his incredible growth and presence in a score of others, Special Agent Pendergast books have literally been A+ across the board. In this new offering, the line above is stated by Oscar Wilde at a dinner table in 1889. Wilde is about to tell the gruesome tale he heard when he was on a speaking tour in the U.S.. You see, Wilde had come across a small town called Roaring Fork. This town was basically made up of miners long ago; men who barely ever saw the light of day because of the hard work they had to do. One miner told Wilde a story regarding men who were killed by an overly-hungry bear. Wilde offers up this tale to Arthur Conan Doyle, and watches as the creator of Sherlock Holmes turns pale and rushes away.Oscar Wilde is not the only one to see Roaring Fork. In present day, Pendergast\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Corrie Swanson, also finds herself traveling to this location in order to write her thesis. She is only a Junior and has very little chance of winning the grant/award she needs. But when a strange story appears on her horizon and she\u2019s told that bodies in a cemetery in Roaring Fork were actually dug up and moved so that a billionaire community could be built there, Corrie uncovers a project that she knows will blow her professor\u2019s mind.Roaring Fork is veiled with the glitz and glam that comes from wealthy snobs who want nothing more than to live in an exclusive community, when they\u2019re not living in their palatial mansions elsewhere. But there are also many secrets lodged within the glittering village; secrets that Corrie stumbles across when she rubs a woman of power the wrong way.The characters are many; from a librarian who wants to help Corrie and despises the rich; to a Sheriff who really wants nothing but coffee and quiet, and for all the bad stuff to stay far away; to a military woman who has more problems than you can possibly count. And when an arsonist begins to take their revenge at the same time as Corrie uncovers a human defilement of mammoth proportions, the story goes from A+ to A++.Pendergast is the quiet, accented voice; he is the man in black who brings more intelligence and more satisfaction to the story than any character ever written. Helping all he can, Pendergast soon finds himself heading back to the past to see if perhaps Sherlock Holmes once had the answers to his present-day problems.Amazing; excellent; exhilarating - name an adjective! The only wish from readers like me is that Pendergast could have a book every month. But he IS always worth the wait! Outstanding, once again, gentlemen - thank you!"}], "description": "Special Agent Pendergast arrives at an exclusive Colorado ski resort to rescue his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Corrie Swanson, from serious trouble with the law. His sudden appearance coincides with the first attack of a murderous arsonist who--with brutal precision--begins burning down multimillion-dollar mansions with the families locked inside. After springing Corrie from jail, Pendergast learns she made a discovery while examining the bones of several miners who were killed 150 years earlier by a rogue grizzly bear. Her finding is so astonishing that it, even more than the arsonist, threatens the resort's very existence.Drawn deeper into the investigation, Pendergast uncovers a mysterious connection between the dead miners and a fabled, long-lost Sherlock Holmes story--one that might just offer the key to the modern day killings as well.Now, with the ski resort snowed in and under savage attack--and Corrie's life suddenly in grave danger--Pendergast must solve the enigma of the past before the town of the present goes up in flames.", "title": "White Fire\n      \n          (Pendergast #13)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17159011-white-fire", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388193320l/17159011.jpg", "reviews": 1893, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12577.Douglas_Preston", "name": "Douglas Preston"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11091.Lincoln_Child", "name": "Lincoln Child"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Suspense", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17159011-white-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17368265-white-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17368378-white-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18753967-white-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67035.Relic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39031.The_Cabinet_of_Curiosities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39030.Reliquary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136637.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30068.The_Book_of_the_Dead"]}
