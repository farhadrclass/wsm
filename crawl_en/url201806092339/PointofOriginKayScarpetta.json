I enjoyed this book a lot, especially given the focus around Lucy and Benton. Cornwell gives such depth to her characters, you can't help but love and hate them at the same time. They feel incredibly real, and almost as if you've met them before. The suspense is at an all time high in this book. It's a very psychological book, especially given the two parts of they stories and how/when they might come together. If you're looking for strong characters, can take the blood and guts, and like being angry with your characters, this series is for you.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

Dedicated \"with love to Barbara Bush\". The way Scarpetta keeps oggling her naked niece's body gets more and more disturbing, esp. since I doubt Cornwell will make a real f/f incest case out of this. Poor Benton has his \"still surprisingly supple\" body dutifully admired, and pale feet like her niece.The blurb as usual proclaims not only that she does it best and has bad imitators, but that this one is \"her best and bleakest\" (don't get up my hopes - or maybe that just means the guy will die (to resurrect later)) and praises the \"sinister atmosphere ... cool prose\" = as usual the most puzzling thing about this series. Could she be so famous for political reasons? At least it's quick to skim through.ETA: 100 pages left to go, so a little about the \"plot\": we're back with Temple Gault! You thought she finally killed off that least threatening, most boring serial killer of all, but there's still his partner, who is similarly off-screen, has similarly inexplicable superduperhumannatural capabilities that enable her to work from inside prisons and across states in no time and with no money - where was I? Oh, yes, and Kay is so very scared and terrorised again because Claire is as much a scourge as Temple was *yawn* and so she makes a few extra-flights to run after her niece for no reason other than the descriptions of banal manual tasks hadn't filled enough pages yet. The \"death\" of Benton was of course only a paragraph but will duly be revisited as the trauma of her life, see all past novels. The FBI for the first time ever gets gently criticised, with disclaimers all around, indicating again her political involvement (I have no interest in finding out who took over the FBI when). The only one of her many personal-political opinions I thought good was the case of a child dying because it's parents were against medicine because god heals, but that was also gently done because - fitting with her politics - KS is more and more religious.There are less things to quote this time, so I will later add the pertinent lines - ignoring all the insane comparisons and semantically wrong conversations (just the sun bouncing like a manic child with her ball, no \"his voice was as muscular as his body\" this time, and I'm focussing on the interpersonal).But for now, just this: I actually threw back my head and laughed out loud at the ... well, perhaps it was meant a horrifying, tragic ending, but it was all too much: first the only other murders KS hadn't cleared yet were retconned to Carrie's new partner, who has nearly as stupid a name as Temple Gault but whose motive was that he had bad acne. Not. Kidding! And then, after spending the whole book talking about the ever absent Carrie as \"the monster\" and \"evil\", Kay and Lucy *shakes with sad hilarity* get into a helicopter battle with them ... *cracks up again* ow ow ow.

Now Temple Gault is dead (I think) but Cornwell once again brings back Gault's partner in crime Carrie who also once had thing with Kay's niece Lucy. Carrie it seems has escaped from the loony bin in New York and is determined to get even with Kay, Lucy, Weston and Marino. Add to this the arson/slash murders that have been taking place all involving pretty people and you have the background for this one.It is tough to read a series that was written years ago and be fascinated with the twists that Cornwell has set out in this one. Let's just say there is a big twist but I took it with a grain of salt knowing that things will change in later books in the series. Kind of an unintentional spoiler for me after reading the backs of other Scarpetta books I have purchased already. Things are still the same with the characters. Kay is a mean lady who is also getting creepy with her lustful looks at her lesbian niece Lucy. Kay just isn't a nice person. She is mean and rude to people. Lucy is still messed up and has switched jobs again to work with the ATF for Teun McGovern (who Kay is jealous of-creepy). Marino (who is really my favorite character is still overly protective of Kay and is needy for a relationship. Benton Wesley and Kay are still dating.

You'd think bringing Carrie back into the mix would have spiced things up, but it was the opposite, I was completely disappointed in how our infamous villain was addressed in this book. And don't even get me started on how anticlimactic Benton's death was, or even how anticlimactic the final 'fight scene' with Lucy & Carrie was.

Well, of course, I did. But I answered without really looking. And when I did look, I noticed that approximately 6 of the 8 books were Jodi Picoult. And those\u2019ll be great in a week or so when I get on a plane, but in the meantime I needed something else. It was the middle of the night\u2014no bookstore or library open\u2014so I picked one of the non-Picoult\u2019s: Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Point of Origin.Point of Origin is one of nearly twenty books featuring the protagonist Kay Scarpetta and her niece Lucy. (I\u2019ve read exactly 0 of the others, but if another turned up in my bag of paperbacks, I\u2019d give it a shot.) Medical examiner Scarpetta must help determine what caused a fire at a wealthy man\u2019s estate. In the midst of trying to solve the case, an old adversary escapes from the mental institution where she was being held.The novel reads fairly quickly, and I dare say that if you are a fan of crime fiction, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Me, I could do without the descriptions of charred bodies and other gory details.Though the novel is part of a series, it can easily be read alone. While there are references to occurrences outside the scope of this novel, everything is adequately explained without being overly explained."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "Scarpetta returns in an explosive thriller sure to send fans rushing out to read it. When a fire at a horse farm leaves a mysterious body in the rubble, Scarpetta is tasked by ATF to investigate.

Meanwhile, an old nememis escapes from prison with the goal of wreaking havoc on Scarpetta's life. The story comes to a head when paths cross and Scarpetta is left to put all the pieces together. Who'll get the last laugh in this cat and mouse game and can Scarpetta outwit this criminal mastermind and bring them to justice...again? Cornwell at her best, no doubt.The ongoing character development of Kay Scarpetta continues to entertain the reader in this novel. Much of her personal life has come to light over the last few novels and this one adds another layer to the story. Scarpetta, and those around whom she is surrounded, continue to grow and develop, entertaining the reader throughout.

I felt this novel revealed a more human Scarpetta; she comes face-to-face with the loss of someone dear, a reference to O.J. Simpson, eats at Burger King with her niece and speaks openly about homosexuality which has been building over the last few books and unless I missed it before Lucy's last name is revealed. If we watched a television show over a time period we'd expect the same kind of progress as characters evolve. The writing seems tighter and more focused; it was one of my favorites so far. There is rather explicit details of doing forensics on a burn victims which requires a strong state of mind.

I quit reading because I was downright angry at Patricia Cornwell. She KILLED him! Yep, it was a good plot twist. Yep, it built tension, suspense, empathy. Yep, it proved that I care about the characters. But it really pissed me off. So, I am trying again, and even though it didn't shock and surprise me this time, it did still anger me.Here's why: In my opinion Kay, Lucy, Benton and Marino are all too \"hard.\" Their lives are all about work -- and their work is all about the evils in the world. Their relationships humanize them. They need the love, friendship, tenderness and empathy to soften them. So killing one of them affects all of them, and while I understand that might be a good thing for many readers, for me it isn't. Having said all that, the story in this one is full of crazy action. The villains continue to take all of us on a roller coaster ride as Kay and friends try to catch them. This particular book is one of my favorites of the series, which may seem at odds with the fact that I quit reading after it came out. But I remembered the story all these years unlike the previous volumes.If you like Cornwell's style you will like this book. But please -- read it. Do not listen.

Anyone who writes a book deserves at least one star. Cornwell knows a lot about fires and autopsies. Most of the book is about those. The protagonist, Kay, does a lot of autopsies and investigates a lot of fires, many by way of flashbacks. None of them even pretend to have anything to do with the storyline. Cornwell likes minutia. If she were writing about an interview with me, before the first question the reader would get the following: On left corner of Glen\u2019s cheap, pressed-wood Stanton desk is a paperback copy of \u201cPoint of Origin\u201d by Patricia Cornwell. It is sitting askew on an annual property tax bill from the County of San Bernardino. Next to that are several business cards from various officials of US Bank spread haphazardly. There is a wire handled magnifying glass. To the left of the glass are several credit card charge slips. Near the far corner on the left is a brass key from the Chi Epsilon Fraternity, an honor fraternity for Civil Engineers. Next to that is a six-inch diameter globe of the Earth. Next to that is a marble business card holder decorated with small brass elephant heads holding cards advertising Glen\u2019s Neandertal trilogy. On the desk in front of the card holder are tickets to California Theater for the upcoming musical, \u201cEvita.\u201d Okay, I\u2019m going to give you a break and not describe the right side of the desk. If you are reading a mystery and I\u2019m a main character, several of those items could be important clues. However, if you have placed them in your memory to help you solve the case, you will be disappointed to find out that Glen is really not a part of the story, neither he, nor the junk on his desk, nor the information gleaned from the interview will appear in the book again. You have wasted your time and valuable memory space. Page after page we learn about fires and autopsies and every bit of minutia Kay comes across in her travels. We also learn about her niece, her lover, and a female murderer she sent to a mental institution where she is being held until her murder trial comes up.It all starts with a letter from the woman in the mental institution that is highly coded and impossible to understand \u2013 this is actually a great start for a mystery \u2013 the best part of the book. Then there is a fire where a beautiful blonde is killed and burned to death along with a herd of expensive horses. Kay and her co-characters go through experiences that tell the reader about them. This is good background and character development, except after learning a few things about the characters, they continue to do stuff, but it all only confirms what we have already learned. Cornwell keeps giving us details about fires and autopsies, and minutia, but nothing new \u2013 the story doesn\u2019t move. Cornwell decides to really impress us with her medical knowledge by blending in statements like, \u201c\u2026 kidneys show hyperosmolar vacuolization of the proximal convoluted tubular lining cells. Meaning, instead of cuboidal pink, they're clear, bulging and enlarged.\u201d Kay calls a father to inform him of the results of the autopsy on his son. \u201cYour son's cause of death was acute pneumonia due to acute diabetic ketoacidosis due to acute onset of diabetes mellitus. I'm sorry for your pain, Mr. Quinn.\u201d This poor guy is a member Christian Science Church \u2013 you can pretty well bet he is not going to be familiar with those kinds of medical terms. Then there are all kinds of suspicious, childish actions like someone ordering a pizza delivery to Kay\u2019s house, but it turns out none of them are connected with the plot. Though an occasional clue to the crime is woven in, it\u2019s obvious that the story is not moving, the characters are not developing, and nothing is going on but page count.Speaking of page count \u2013 on page 281 the actual story begins \u2013 it will basically end on page 392 \u2013 only 110 pages left. However, Cornwell cannot stop stalling it with descriptions of minutia, so there are actually only about 60 to 70 pages of story. What we have is a short story that could possibly be stretched to a novella. Ultimately, the conclusion was totally unsatisfactory. I won\u2019t be a spoiler and tell you what it is. On top of that there are many questions unanswered. For instance, one character has built up a collection of items over a period of decades beginning in Ireland and then all around the United States. Each of these items requires special care, especially when it is shipped someplace. There is no question the collector has spent an incredible amount of time and money amassing the collection, caring for it, and moving it around. At the end, he simply walks away from it, with no effort whatsoever to preserve it and there is no reason why he couldn\u2019t, though he would have had to leave pictures of the individual items to be found as part of the plot.

The books are readable and so far I\u2019ve always finished them but, for me, they could be much better. My biggest problem is that Scarpetta doesn\u2019t grow; she\u2019s stuck in her ways and terrified of change \u2026 as such she gets damned boring! Lucy\u2019s new boss Teun McGovern says this of her in this book, \u201cYou\u2019re awfully straight and narrow, aren\u2019t you, Kay?\u201d and so she is. Cornwell makes her say in response to this that this isn\u2019t how she sees herself \u2026 no surprises there then! Later, Lucy is teaching Scarpetta to fly a chopper and she has to learn to go with the wind, the air, rather than try to correct them and she says to herself, - this was hard for me. I liked to make things better. - Yes, very true, she does and thereby stem so many of her difficulties. I really wish she could grow.One thing in this book really got through. I lived ponies and horses all my childhood until my late twenties. At one point Scarpetta goes to see a farrier and there begins my problem with Cornwell\u2019s research! Scarpetta tells us \u2013 farrier which was a modern name for an old-world blacksmith \u2013 No! you silly woman. Farrier is the name of a horse-doctor who, as part of his work, shoes horses. A farrier combines some blacksmith's skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some veterinarian's skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb) to care for horses' feet. The word farrier comes from the Middle French ferrier meaning blacksmith and from the Latin word ferrum for iron. It has been in use in Europe for centuries. A blacksmith is one who works metal, makes gates, hinges, metal tyres for wheels and rings for barrels, cannon, jewellery, belt-buckles; and sometimes she or he is a farrier as well \u2013 but not that often. Things get worse!She goes on to say \u2013 he snatched a curved knife out of a pocket in his apron and began trimming the frog until the marbled white hoof showed underneath. \u2013 Yelp! Yikes! He\u2019s killing the horse! The frog is an important part of the horse's circulatory system \u2014 it pumps blood up the horse's leg each time the frog makes contact with the ground. The blood flows down the horse's leg into the digital cushion, a fibrous part of the inner hoof located just above the frog which contains a network of blood vessels. The horse's weight then compresses the frog on the ground, squeezing the blood out of the digital cushion, and pushing it back up the horse's legs. If the farrier cut the frog to the bone a) the horse would leap away from him in extreme pain and b) if he was able to cut to the bone the horse would likely bleed out and die. Do your damned research woman!She finishes this ghastly fiasco with the words \u2013 Marino clung to the wall as he walked behind a horse that was at least fourteen hands high. \u2013 Well \u2026 gosh \u2026 that\u2019s effing enormous! A hand = four inches therefore 14 hands = 56 inches, that\u2019s four foot six inches in old money! Children and small people (like me) ride ponies (not horses \u2013 a horse is 15 hand and over!) and as she describes Marino\u2019s height he\u2019d easily be able to tuck this one under his armpit!All this is not helping me get a good feel in reading the book. I keep getting annoyed. Her writing in this one isn't as good as some of the others, presumably she gets ups and downs like most people (except Scarpetta!). As Cornwell says - and most writers know - there's a lot of herself in Scarpetta. It's worth reading for the main tragedy which will make more sense of the later books (I hope). I'm also not convinced about this apparently indestructible baddy ... I've a feeling that may become dull and lead me to skip those bits.The real tragedy of the story comes about 2/3rd through and as usual Cornwell gives you hints of this well before. It\u2019s quite well done but not up to her usual standard. I\u2019m not saying what it is at it\u2019d be a real spoiler. It does give me some problems with later books though as I\u2019m trying to work out how it was done and how it was possible \u2026 and why. I\u2019m not sure Cornwell ever gives us all this, at least as yet. Am going to read Scarpetta and The Scarpetta Factor to see if she does.As you can see, despite her occasional real idiocy and the fact that she seems unable to allow, or enable, Scarpetta to grow up, I still read her *smile*. Perhaps my annoyance with her is that she\u2019s good but could be so much better. Sigh!

I never thought I would!It's hard to tell what put me off most. Was it the way Dr Scarpetta was unnaturally fascinated by her niece's body? Or maybe it was the sudden and illogical death of Benton? Granted, I didn't read the first 8 books (had I know there were 8 previous books, I would have never read this one) so maybe there were reasons mentioned in other books that justified the sudden killing of Benton. But to me, a newby in Dr Scarpetta's world, I was totally taken by surprise. It felt like Cornwell was stuck with her story and the only way out was to kill off one of the characters.But do you know what irked me the most? The irregular pacing of the book. The actual crime is committed pretty much at the beginning of the story. A 100 pages in and they're slowly though surely carrying on with their investigation of the fire. I was about halfway through and they were STILL investigating the bloody fire. And suddenly, around page 300 or so... Tadaaa! It suddenly all made sense to Dr Scarpetta, there's a quick Carrie take, and finished the book is. Not sure I explained it well, but eh... To me the whole book felt bumpy and rushed and, like I said, very irregularly paced.So why did I pick up the damn thing in the first place? Because of the title.

The plot centers on the suspected arson of a media magnate's home which resulted in the death of one female and several prize horses. A new villain enters the picture (Newton Joyce), and he's aided by serial killer Carrie Grethen, newly escaped from prison. There's a subplot involving Benton Wesley, Scarpetta's FBI paramour, which turns into the mother of all plot twists in her later novel 'Blowfly'. I felt that Cornwell didn't give her characters enough chance: she rapidly ditches both Joyce and Grethen in favor of Le Loup-Garou, her villain of 'Black Notice' and 'The Last Precinct', which in my opinion was a mistake. The supporting characters are back: Lt. Pete Marino (I swear if she kills him off I will never touch one of her novels again), FBI agent Lucy Farinelli, Scarpetta's neice (although too much of a deal is made of her lesbianism), and one of the best villains in contemporary thrillers, Carrie Grethen. Carrie can be placed easily next to Hannibal Lecter in terms of fictional villains. As you read, you'll learn about how arson fires are investigated and, incidentally, how fires work in terms of accelerants and point(s) of origin (where the fire initially begins); you'll also learn a little bit about how a scanning electron microscope (SEM) works. Cornwell's science is always dead-on, and this book is no exception."}, {"userName": "John Devlin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34033-john-devlin", "userReview": "(2.6)Full disclosure: These books diminished in quality but I was stuck w/a 4 e-book bundle of stories 11-14 so I'm determined to get there and get my money's worth.My problem w/these books and those like them is the dichotomy that the better the characterizations the more I feel sorry for the main character and her never ending sea of trouble and anguish. The type of crime stories just treadmill on and on and the poor character has to suffer through many near death experiences, the violent deaths of loved ones, and in Scarpetta's case a litany of gruesome autopsies. On the other hand if the reader doesn't care much for the character I guess there's entertainment to be found, but if I don't care about the characters what's the point of any clever plot.Specifically, Point of Origin borrows far too much from the Hannibal Lector trope and at times seems to sink deeper into the overwrought fantasies of Batman and Joker. Cornwell has talent and her books are better than they have been but she can't transcend the restraints of her genre like Ellroy or Mosely can."}, {"userName": "Kelv", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4341127-kelv", "userReview": "Chapter lengths were uncessarily long and there were areas where stopping would have been useful to stop and lock in events. Further, it was hard to tell who was speaking due to speach being broken up with 'Lucy said' only for 'Lucy' to continue speaking directly below - this was inconsistent especially when there was short fragments of speach where the person did not continue speaking below - it became irritating to read back to try and figure out who said what and when. The ending was a bit far fetched - a helicopter shoot out. Also, with this ending, can anyone be sure the fugitive was actually killed. Without knowing much about the Scarpetta book series or how Cornwell writes, it would not surprise me if there was a sequel with Carrie making a come back - a good example of this is Harry Potter.However, the book gave a good insight into fire investigation and how difficult a job it is - to this end, I believe this was a secondary goal (the first being a best seller) in which the book has achieved its purpose."}, {"userName": "MauraJParker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58475741-maurajparker", "userReview": "Wow. I was really surprised at some of the low ratings this book has?? I LOVED IT! I have read most of the Scarpetta series (unfortunately out of order) and while this wasn't my favorite, it's top 3! This book was a lot more personal of Kay Scarpetta than others in the series. I really enjoyed reading the emotions as she was going through a hard personal time and trying to work at the same time. There was a huge and sad plot twist I did not expect AT ALL towards the end of the book. Cornwell really knows how to write those twists, I never see them coming! I was so sad I felt like tearing up... I thought no way... This can't be real! I loved the science and forensics behind this book. Fire is neat and it was cool how she wrote factual evidence into the book. Definitely enjoyed it and now I'm moving on to my next Scarpetta book..."}, {"userName": "Nicol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2209781-nicol", "userReview": "This plot has the Cornwell classic of leaving important storylines out of the books - suddenly Lucy is ATF with a line of explanation that of course explains nothing - could that had not been a good subplot? The Gault plot is in fact not over and Catherine comes back with a vengeance. This another a book where you begin to like Kay less and less - it's never clear her all the sudden ambivalence towards Benton - and Cornwell decides to kill off a perfectly good character - one of the only ones readers like! Why??? Also, there is major wierdness between Lucy's boss and Kay - that really doesn't make sense - all around this is a strange book with a plot that revolves around Catherine but at the same time does make much clear."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2307922-penny", "userReview": "Dr Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner and consulting forensic pathologist for the fedreral law enforcement agency ATF, is called out to an isolated farmhouse in Virginia which has been destroyed by fire.

Her constant gawking at her niece's body disgusts me. I felt the story line left some unanswered questions.
