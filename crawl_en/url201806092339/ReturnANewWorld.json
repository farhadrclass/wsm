On this clear, summer night, the moon was out and almost full causing his skin to tingle only slightly from the reflected light. It wasn\u2019t as bad as when the other bright light, which caused immediate and intense pain, was in the sky.I confess I disliked the first book in this series, which makes my appreciation of this second part of \"A New World\" that much more surprising and enjoyable, even. In \"Return,\" Jack Walker and his crew must return back home, to McChord AFB, from Kuwait, where he rescued girlfriend Lynn and her mates. The return journey is fraught with danger from the night runners, and rescues of misfortunate souls who have the fortune, actually, of running into Jack Walker.Jack's got Teflon armor! He's the epitome of military might and common sense and can-do attitude, with a compassion and caring thrown in there. Jack takes on a CDC-building full of night runners and emerges unscathed. He rescues a stray dog. He's MacGuyver. And, he's really grown on me. You can't help but root for the hero.I also appreciate that the writing in this second book appears more refined towards the story itself. Gone are the long, internal monologues and flashbacks in Jack's head, of endless details on 'how-to-do' something, or a past experience that is recounted ad nauseum. Here, there are a few relevant flashbacks, but they are kept to a minimum. Instead, we gets lots of action, more characters introduced, and a more focused emphasis on the night runners themselves. A very good read. I'm looking forward to the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Debora Seifert", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50313901-debora-seifert", "userReview": "Awesome adventure!!Just finished reading both the first and second book in this series. Really fresh look on my favorite genre. Can't put this series down, always looking for this kind of story and you have done a great job of getting a different aspect to think of.

Now in Return, they must all return home.O\u2019Brien made me really happy by giving the monster creatures a fantastic name, NightRunners, not zombies. Because they are really not your typical zombies. They really only come out at night or occupy dark building and such. They run fast, can open doors, they even go to the bathroom, err, relieve themselves. I love this simple twist on the classic undead that everyone knows.On their journey home this group winds up getting the bright idea to try to get more information on what has happened and where the nightrunners came from. Now, where would you go to get such details? The CDC (Center for Disease Control) or course. But along the way they must land every so often for supplies. Because of these two factors they run into hordes, maybe the better term would be several infested buildings. Bringing the action level up to a ten.Return has so much action and tension early on, it made me want to keep listening for more. So much more than Chaos. One of my favorite parts of the story was the ending, and not because it ended, I know some of you thought I was going to go there. But not at all. What I liked about the ending was, no cliffhanger. Sure there was a great setup for the next book but it didn\u2019t end making me feel like the story was incomplete.Even though I did not enjoy the huge role that the groups airplane took in the story. The intricacies of flying and all that. I do understand why it was there. It is the first apocalyptic story where the group can actually fly where ever they want, except for maybe Day by Day Armageddon.If you want a military-ish, high tension, action packed apocalypse story with not so common ghoulish hordes. Look no further than the New World series. I have a feeling that from here on out the story is going to get much more complex.In the year between the release on the first book and this one Mark Gagliardi has changed his narration style so dramatically that some of the reviewers on Audible think that it is a different guy. Well it is the same narrator and yes Gagliardi has grown much as a narrator. While I think it will still take some getting used to as he is still a bit rough around the edges, I really hope that he continues to grow! There where however some noticeable production issues. In several spots you could really tell that a recording session ended and another began. Volume levels would switch fairly dramatically.Audiobook provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "Lexie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9466507-lexie", "userReview": "I really wish I could say that this series is terrible and the writing is horrific, but I can't!! The 2nd book was even better than the first. John O'Brien does a great job of interweaving his past military knowledge with humor and suspense through this book. I found myself laughing at the banter between Jack and Lynn, but even more so when reading Jack's inner dialogue to himself. It sounds just like things I would be saying to myself-minus all the combat/zombie issues.This really is a great series that is completely different than any \"zombie\" books I have read. I really like the fact that Jack has him family around him, he has a big heart tempered with a take no bs from anyone attitude, and the story line focuses on a bigger picture than just lots of fight scenes with \"night runners\" as Jack and his group now call them.I like the test message that popped up on his open phone lying in his hands, \"Are you alive? I need help.\" Excellent series. I would highly recommend this to anyone."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12534351-annie", "userReview": "I WANT TO LOVE THIS SERIES! But sadly I am not...I like the narrator a whole lot, and I like Jack...and I like his night zombies...its just a bit technical in parts, and military based...and the character development for the other characters, is really slow....I found myself zoning out quite a bit...and a little bored at times...I do like the story concept...and we get more explanation of the virus and monsters in this one....and let me just say, these are scary zombies, they think...and they communicate with each other, and are super fast!!! I am moving on to book 3, the reviews say its the best story line yet...so I am willing to give it another shot...I didn't hate this story at all..its pretty good...I just don't love it...and I like to love my books..especially my zombie fiction!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776370-sara", "userReview": "Return continues where Chaos left off. Jack was successful in finding his girlfriend and now he is headed home. There are necessary stops along the way and at each one, danger is waiting. As Jack and his group of survivors face these dangers, they learn more about the nature of the Night Runners. They also pick up a few new survivors- some military, some civilians. There is a lot of action in this book, but I like that the author is able to keep the scenes exciting without sacrificing character development. A New World: Return has one of those \"What the heck?!\" endings that makes you want to read the next book immediately. The good news is, there are seven more books after this one and you don't have to wait for them!"}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Captain Jack accomplished the Kuwait rescue of his girlfriend along with two dozen additional surviving soldiers from her company.
