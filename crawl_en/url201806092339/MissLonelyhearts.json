I have read it three times, at least, and each time it gets stranger and stranger.It's subject is an advice columnist--hence the name \"Miss Lonelyhearts\"--who is going insane under the weight of his disordered life and the burden of the letters from desperate souls that is piled on his desk every morning, It is unique in its elliptical development, its harsh realism vergin on nightmare, and its emotional viciousness. On the surface it is a stark condemnation of the American Dream more disturbing than Fitzgerald or Steinbeck, made brutal by its hard-boiled prose, and brought close to apocalypse by a hero obsessed with Christ's wounds and the necessity of blood sacrifice. But what I have said--strange as it is--normalizes Miss Lonelyhearts too much, for Nathanael West book is also blackly funny in a way that only a book steeped in European cynicism and iconoclasm could be. In spite of its superficial similarities, it is a world--I almost said an ocean--away from the earnestness of The Great Gatsby and The Grapes of Wrath. Nathan Weinstein--Nathanael West was his --was born into an upper middle class family of Russian secular Jews who lived on the Upper West Side. He had little interest in his father's construction business and instead read precociously, devouring Shakespeare and Dickens, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy--all by the age of ten. He dropped out of high school, forged his way into Tufts; dropped out of Tufts, forged his way into Brown, where he continued to study little but read much. He had little patience for the staples of American fiction, favoring a literary diet of French surrealism and British decadence enlivened with an occasional cup of Christian mysticism. After graduating university, Weinstein moved to Paris, began dressing like a dandy, and changed his name to West. He completed the novel he had been working on fitfully through college: The Dream Life of Balso Snell, a deliberately offensive piece of surreal near-obscenity, filled with Freudian cliches and literary parody, which takes place entirely within the body the Trojan Horse.It is helpful to see Miss Lonelyhearts as a continuation of the artistic aims of Balso Snell. Its jarring transitions, its disturbing juxtapositions of mystical visions with scatological and sexual themes is all part of a plot to assault the sensibilities of the reader and alienate him from the text of the work itself. This alienation in turn may lead him to question his assumptions about literature and life (although I'm not convinced West cares one way or the other if he does so).It\u2019s funny though. Throughout all of the novel\u2019s sordid scenes, throughout its hero\u2019s dark comic fumblings and messianic delusions, that pile of letters on his desk\u2014surrounded they though be by crippling ironies\u2014still move the reader. We cannot forget--anymore than he can forget\u2014the abject miseries of those lost souls who pour out the details of their hopeless lives in the letters they addressed to \u201cDear Miss Lonelyhearts.\u201dI will with end this review with one of those haunting letters.Dear Miss Lonelyhearts--I am sixteen years old now and I dont know what to do and would appreciate it if you could tell me what to do. When I was a little girl it was not so bad because I got used to the kids on the block makeing fun of me, but now I would like to have boy friends like the other girls and go out on Saturday nites, but no boy will take me because I was born without a nose--although I am a good dancer and have a nice shape and my father buys me pretty clothes.I sit and look at myself all day and cry. I have a big hole in the middle of my face that scares people even myself so I cant blame the boys for not wanting to take me out. My mother loves me, but she crys terrible when she looks at me.What did I do to deserve such a terrible bad fate? Even if I did do some bad things I didnt do any before I was a year old and I was born this way. I asked Papa and he says he doesnt know, but that maybe I did something in the other world before I was born or that maybe I was being punished for his sins. I dont believe that because he is a very nice man. Ought I commit suicide?Sincerely yours,Desperate"}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "L\u2019IMPERO DEI SOGNINathanael West si chiamava in realt\u00e0 Nathan Weinstein e proveniva da una famiglia ebrea tedesca non osservante vissuta a lungo alla periferia dell\u2019Impero Russo, in Lituania, da dove emigr\u00f2 in US poco prima che il nostro nascesse.Montgomery Clift \u00e8 il giornalista protagonista nel film del 1958 \u201cLonelyhearts \u2013 Non desiderare la donna d\u2019altri\u201d diretto da Vincent J.

La presunzione di controllare (traendone per di pi\u00f9 profitto), anche la vita onirica collettiva, incanalandone le pulsioni in direzioni innocue e ben collaudate, viene analizzata e smascherata da West partendo da una sua manifestazione marginale: l\u2019odierno surrogato povero della confessione costituito dalle rubriche di consigli ai lettori.Riccardo Duranti nella postfazione all\u2019edizione di e/o.Credo sia riprova che si tratta di un piccolo grande classico il suo iter editoriale in Italia: Bompiani, Edizioni e/o, Passigli, Minimum Fax.

Every character is a failure: as writer, poet, husband, wife, journalist, and most importantly, follower of Jesus Christ. All are \"stamped with the dough of suffering,\" demonstrate a sort of extreme frustration-neurosis, and are demoralised. Failure provokes cruelty and hatefulness: men dislike each other; men despise women, and gay men only slightly less; women manipulate men when they can; they ignore them when they can't. The world is essentially mad:\"You are plunging into a world of misery and suffering, peopled by creatures who are strangers to everything but disease and policemen. Harried by one, they are hurried by the other...\"The letters-to-the-editor, largely illiterate, describing the personal misery and failures of the public at large pour on to the desk of the advice columnist, Miss Lonelyhearts. He often feels compelled to recommend suicide as the only effective remedy for the pain that is recounted to him. And not just to reduce their pain: \"Christ may be the answer,\" he says, \"but if he did not want to get sick he had to stay away from this Christ business.\" Christ had become \"merely decorative\" not only in the protagonist's shabby room, where the human figure had been removed from his cross, but also in society at large.Violence by the stronger against the weaker is normal and expected. The slightest mis-step or ill-considered phrase results in rage and instant retaliation. Prohibition, the Great Experiment, is in force but unenforced; alcohol is the universal drug of choice to dull the tedium of life. Oblivion is the normal state of being for the protagonist. Social contracts from marriage to employment are meaningless formalities and breached in spirit if not in fact. The daily headlines testify to the general barbarity of existence. Racism and suspicion - of blacks, Jews, foreigners - is typical in everyday encounters.What are the alternatives? Back to the land is a boor. Escape to the South Seas is a worn-out cliche. Hedonism is too expensive. Art is an illusion. Treating the world as a joke is generally what the world does but Miss Lonelyhearts simply can't do that. Shrike, his editor, suggests the only available path, \"The church is our only hope, the First Church of Christ Dentist, where He is worshiped as Preventer of Decay.\"One has to remind oneself repeatedly while reading it that Miss Lonelyhearts was written in 1933. Nothing about it is dated. It anticipates the culture of sex, drugs, social disintegration and national narcissism that was only temporarily interrupted by WWII but that re-emerged with force in the 1960's and thereafter. Miss Lonelyhearts could easily be mistaken for the novelistic manifesto of existentialism. 'Suicide is always a live option' is a theme presented persistently a decade before Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus, and two decades before its translation hit New York City.That West was able to detect the more fundamental deterioration occurring below the more apparent economic ills of the Great Depression is remarkable. His perception is poetic:\"Americans have dissipated their radical energy in an orgy of stone breaking. In their few years they have broken more stones than did centuries of Egyptians. And they have done their work hysterically, desperately, almost as if they knew that the stones would some day break them.\"And not even if Christ gets back on his cross does it make any difference to the fate of anyone involved."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Book Circle Reads 100Rating: 4.75* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Praised by great writers from Flannery O'Conner to Jonathan Lethem, Miss Lonelyhearts is an American classic. A newspaper reporter assigned to write the agony column in the depths of the Great Depression seeks respite from the poor souls who send in their sad letters, only to be further tormented by his viciously cynical editor, Shrike. This single volume of Miss Lonelyhearts features its original Alvin Lustig jacket design, as well as a new introduction by Harold Bloom, who calls it \"my favorite work of modern American fiction.\"My Review: Totally with Harold Bloom here, this is one of the USA's cultural treasures. In just under 100pp, anomie and alienation and the Problem of Evil (theodicy) are examined thoroughly and from several viewpoints. While telling a louche little tale of drinking, fucking, and cheating, West also manages to incorporate an acid bath of gallows humor into the proceedings. His nudges and winks at the audience are almost post-modern: Shrike, who is the otherwise-unnamed Miss Lonelyhearts' editor, is named for a particularly nasty bird of prey, and the man we call Miss Lonelyhearts is both emasculated and depersonalized by his yclepture.It's hard to imagine a more complete telling of the tale of man's bitter fate than this one. Trudge along in your path, you dumb oxen, and this is what will overtake you; lift your heads, look at the sky, and dare to yearn? This is what will overtake you. West knew it, felt it, and ultimately lived it by dying early as he drove drunk.

If you don't like something, get up off your (couch) and change it.\nLast Sunday's Prickly City comic strip expressed it this way:\"I was wondering: Why do you let bad things happen?\"\"Why do you let bad things happen\"\"Touch\u00e9.\" Prickly City, August 9, 2015But, what if one is confronted with horrific circumstances way beyond one's pay grade? And really believes it's one's personal responsibility to fix them? ...And, by the way, the ground under one's own feet isn't all that solid....The set-up is that a young man has signed on as a newspaper's \"Miss Lonelyhearts,\" responding in his column to missives from lovelorn and unhappy readers (predominantly women). For the newspaper this is a publicity gambit to increase the circulation, but the suffering conveyed to Miss Lonelyhearts through the letters is real. For the columnist, known throughout the book as \"Miss Lonelyhearts,\" this presents an intolerable dilemma.As it so happens I recently reread a 2011 article from The New Yorker on the history of birth control that impressed on me the reality of the sort of letters Miss LH was getting (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201... ). I expect the author didn't have to make up those letters. Just to get the idea across: a letter from a woman who'd already had seven babies in twelve years and whose kidneys are now failing, but from whom duty demanded more of the same. She wrote in pitiful semi-literacy that the doctor told them another pregnancy would be the death of her. Her husband said okay--until they got home. That's not much of a spoiler since it appears on p. 2.Not only that, but the protagonist is a minister's son, already with a tendency toward hyperreligiosity. Not only that, but his readers/fans/clientele live in the same 'hood and patronize the same speakeasy. There are no boundaries. They know he's a male. Not only that, but his friends are hard-drinking, misogynistic, homophobic characters given to verbal and sometimes physical expression of those attitudes:At college, and perhaps for a year afterwards, they had believed in literature, had believed in Beauty and in personal expression as an absolute end. When they lost this belief, they lost everything. Money and fame meant nothing to them. They were not worldly men.These were hard-boiled times, but unlike detective stories described by that adjective, there's nary a hero in sight. If the protagonist is not quite part and parcel of the surrounding corruption, neither can he extricate himself from it.Not only that, but his supervisor is a cynical provocateur, egging him on.Sometimes our antihero takes it out on those seeking succor. After all, is it not they who have put him in this position?The common wisdom is that this is an allegorical tragicomedy, but there was nothing funny about it. The author supposedly had communist leanings, so common in those pre-Stalinist times, that he kept from being explicit in his work. I'm guessing he was writing between-the-lines, writing under the guise of allegory and comedy in order to speak out. These are not just allegorical figures. The author has gone quite a way toward making them people. And that's the answer, really, to the question I posed at the beginning of this review: try and tell the truth.To the extent there is humor, and if, once upon a time, it was dark, it's now sick humor.What service does Miss LH thinks he should perform for his supplicants? Sometimes he aims to tell them that by their suffering they are participating in divinity. But that trope won't hunt, so he's seeking a lock on a love that heals...but what sort of miracle could restore them, engulfed in a sick society?My edition included an afterword from the '60s by Stanley Edgar Hyman, a critic and contributor to The New Yorker who was well known at the time. He explained the allegorical aspects in ways that were helpful without being interpretations with which one would necessarily agree now, for example, with a lot of Freudian analysis. He also contributed a lot of biographical material on the author, fuller but generally consistent with what I could find easily on the Internet and sometimes including aspects that wouldn't be considered politically correct now. If that afterword is available online, I couldn't find it. I may come back and enlarge this section later. For now, suffice it to say that if F. Scott Fitzgerald died without knowing he'd later be considered great, so much the more so for Nathanael West.Incidentally, I came across an interview with Judy Blume at the beginning of The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2008 in which she said:I once spent three years putting together a book of letters: (Letters to Judy: What Kids Wish They Could Tell You) from my readers. It was emotionally draining, not just because I tried to tie them together with autobiographical material, but because of the letters themselves. At one point I had to go to a therapist to find out how I could keep writing fiction while being responsible (and responsive) to my readers. I was so involved with a couple of kids (I wanted to save them) that the therapist had to teach me how to step back while still being there for them. Over the years there have been seven kids who started to write to me at age twelve--kids with tough lives--who still write to me today and they're in their twenties and thirties now. Most of them are okay. Some are parents. I still try to answer the really serious letters myself.Life imitating art...imitating life...."}, {"userName": "piperitapitta", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35550351-piperitapitta", "userReview": "Anti(qualsiasi)pat\u00ecaPago anche in questo caso il tempo trascorso tra la fine della lettura e le poche riflessioni che provo a scrivere.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\" Lennon-McCartneyI wasn't nearly as enamored by this 1933 eighty-page novella, full of existential black humor, as the Yale prof/lit critic Harold Bloom, primarily because Nathanael West couldn't hide his contempt for all religion nor his scarlet leanings. As the book begins, an NYC newspaper editor, aptly named \"Shrike,\" assigns an unnamed male newspaper columnist (under the pseudonym \"Miss Lonelyhearts\") to write an advice column (similar in ilk to \"Dear Abby\"). Under the collective weight of the genuine agony and life's loads of the advice-seekers, Miss Lonelyhearts begins to suffer severe depression. At after-hours gatherings, Shrike repeatedly hazes Miss Lonelyhearts, condemning his religion (and his affinity for art) as the \"opiate of the masses\" and jokes that Miss Lonelyhearts is \"an idealist in collision with humanity.\"\u201cArt Is a Way Out. Do not let life overwhelm you. When the old paths are choked with the d\u00e9bris of failure, look for newer and fresher paths. Art is just such a path. Art is distilled from suffering.\u201d Miss Lonelyhearts, Nathanael West Exacerbating Miss Lonelyhearts' depression is his conviction that his advice column is merely a farce perpetrated on the public. To ease his pain, he turns to drinking, religion, traveling with his fiancee', and an animalistic affair with Shrike's wife. Miss L meets with a lady, at her insistence, who wrote that her poor crippled husband cannot satisfy her intimate needs. West leaves it ambiguous on whether Miss L's fornication with the lady was driven by a Messiah complex, an ephemeral apostasy, or a mixture of both. This novella had the feel of a Marxist parable, the explanation of which would require my going far beyond the scope of a simple book review as well as into the bio of the author. That should tell you, at least, that its 80 pages are charged with meaning, latent and patent, which is why I give this novella 4 stars.

Something that might be born if 'huh?' and 'haha!' were to copulate. Miss Lonelyhearts, a man known only by the name of his agony aunt style column, is deeply affected by the letters from his readers. At the beginning of the tale he appears to be on the fence with his ideas on faith and slowly tumbles into a full blown messiah complex. Along the way, Nathanael West's astute observations and sharp wit keep us entertained.Man has a tropism for order. Keys in one pocket, change in the other. Mandolins are tuned G D A E. Man against nature... the battle of the centuries. Keys yearn to mix with the changeThe overtly tragic comic tone of this tale is what makes it a win. Prodded by his conscience, he began to generalize. Men have always fought their misery with dreams. Although dreams were once powerful, the have been made puerile by the movies, radio and newspapers.And soon after this, he begins his descent down loony land. You'd think this is strange, but from what I have observed in the world, this is exactly how some people cope. Creating a strange alternate reality, with no space for these truths. Absurd.

Scott Fitzgerald; in fact, the story goes that when he died in a car accident at age 37, he had been rushing to Fitzgerald\u2019s wake, and the friends were given adjoining rooms in a Los Angeles funeral home. There\u2019s more than a hint of similarity to The Great Gatsby here: this is a very American tragedy and state-of-the-nation novel, and it\u2019s remarkable how much it achieves in so few pages. \u201cMiss Lonelyhearts\u201d (never given any other name) is a male advice columnist for the New York Post-Dispatch. His letters come from a pitiable cross section of humanity: the abused, the downtrodden, the unloved. In his role of confessor to the suffering, his boss notes, he\u2019s one of \u201cthe priests of twentieth-century America.\u201d Not surprisingly, the secondhand woes start to get him down (\u201chis heart remained a congealed lump of icy fat\u201d), and he turns to drink and womanizing for escape. Indeed, I was startled by how explicit West is in his language and his sexual situations; this in no way feels like a book from 1933. (And you have to love the metaphor \u201chis fat cheeks like twin rolls of smooth pink toilet paper.\u201d) West\u2019s picture of how beleaguered compassion can turn to indifference really struck me, and the last few chapters, in which a drastic change of life is proffered but then cruelly denied, are masterfully plotted.

There is a section where Shrike effectively tortures Miss Lonelyhearts with narrative, telling story after story of other lives, possible lives, while Miss Lonelyhearts lies in bed suffering from an illness that may or may not be entirely spiritual. Then you've got the letters to Miss Lonelyhearts, themselves also narratives of other lives, of suffering lives, though these are nothing like what Shrike puts together, the slick, generic productions he uses to torment and to distance himself from humanity, his dead pan.So that's going on.Then, there are these little moments within the writing itself at which I just marvelled. The fact that Miss Lonelyhearts has no name, and each step of the narrative reinforces the strangeness of this, his role not his identity:When Miss Lonelyhearts quit work, he found that the weather had turned warm and that the air smelt as though it had been artificially heated. He decided to walk to Delehanty's speakeasy for a drink. In order to get there, it was necessary to cross a little park. He entered the park at the North Gate and swallowed mouthfuls of the heavy shade that curtained its arch. He walked into the shadow of a lamp-post that lay on the path like a spear. It pierced him like a spear.What can you even say about writing like that? There are others: the description of the battle against entropy, the attacks of the inanimate objects, small, brilliant little asides that had me continually wondering at this tiny little book.Depite what goodreads tells you, I actually read this from a volume of four collected works of Nathanael West; I think I'll be coming back for the others."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705693-beth", "userReview": "Miss Lonelyhearts is the tale of a male advice columnist in Depression Era New York City. Though the column is intended to be fluff, and is seen as such by the editor to whom Lonelyhearts reports, for the people who write seeking advice, it is serious. The columnist finds himself overwhelmed by the many versions of tragedy that he must respond to, becomes depressed, and turns, on one hand, to drink, fights, and affairs, and on the other to a Christianity he deeply believes in, but which is mocked by those around him. Lonelyhearts himself is an ethicist's nightmare, violating boundaries with those who write to him for advice. This novel paints a bleak picture of Depression Era New York, and does so in crisp clear language. Little empathy is generated for the protagonist, and there is no hopeful vision of a functional alternative to either the ineffective religious fervor or the empty hedonism portrayed.It is hard not to see parallels to The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition which I recently read and reviewed. Both portray protagonists who are affected by the bleak letters to advice columns, both present unrewarding sexual relationships as the norm, and neither offer much hope to counteract the critiques of the societies they portray. On the other hand stylistically, they are vastly different. Nathanael West's prose is spare and he does little to deepen his characters and create emotional connection to them. Doris Lessing, by contrast, builds a rich, sometimes even lush, world, lingering over details, creating beauty and depth, despite the similarly pessimistic overall viewpoint. Lessing encourages the reader to engage deeply with her themes, whereas there is something almost aggressive in West's approach to the reader. It is not simply the spare masculinity in the style of West that has this effect, since Ernest Hemingway's prose has those qualities, and yet, at least for me, Hemingway uses the style to create profound connection and meaning. Many appear to find this book brilliant and darkly funny, but I came away cold. If you want dark and funny, I'd go with Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger. He provides an angry, funny critique of a society, but builds firm connections to characters, and provides a sense of hope that makes for a much more enjoyable experience."}, {"userName": "Amal Bedhyefi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47697152-amal-bedhyefi", "userReview": "This has got to be one of the strangest book I've ever read.

I wanted to love this book. I bought this book because a sign from a bookseller recommended it by saying, \"the only book Jane and I have ever agreed on.\" Oh. I see the problem now. I assumed they agreed it was great. Clever bookseller. Alas, no. He probably loved it. As Flannery O'Connor is on record loving it. As Harold Bloom (aka literary tastemaker who revived this book) is on record saying it's his favorite work of American prose fiction. There are some lovely turns of phrase in here (this is why I'm writing this and trying to decide if it's one or two stars), but ultimately this book is undercooked. The characters are going through hugely dark stuff and I could give too shits because the writer never gets us close enough to anyone to care. At the end of the book, a deeply unsatisfying ending that falls off a cliff, I circled back to read Harold Bloom's introduction and made it through about three pages. It was all, this character is the devil, and this character is Job, and there's the problem for me right there. He's reading with his head while I read heart first. I can see that Harold Bloom is probably right and this poor author who died in a tragic car accident in 1940 has created this short little piece of intellectual brilliance that ultimately fails for me because it doesn't reach my sappy little heart. Somewhere Harold Bloom is pitying me and all readers like me, I suppose. And I guess if Miss Loneleyhearts is what the Harold Blooms and Flannery O'Connors of the world hold up as top marks, then my future as a writer is very grim indeed. Perhaps I'm just grumpy because I'm turning forty and I'm tired of being told which books are good and which are bad when my heart is perfectly capable of telling me what holds up and what falls flat.

(Plenty of reviewers seem to disagree with the former: many give this short novella either 2-3 stars for having an awful, unrelatable protagonist - I've read plenty nastier - or 5 for all-round brilliance.) It's a close-third person narrative, which, during pauses, I recalled as a first-person, such was its access to one character's inner life whilst the rest remained as if behind a pane of frosted glass. Miss Lonelyhearts is a young American 1930s newspaperman, straight, reluctantly assigned to write an advice column. He is referred to throughout only by this name, the queerness/dragginess of which charmed me so much that it was always an effort to remember how different (emasculating, demeaning) it was intended to sound, and would have to most readers at the time and for decades afterwards. The name probably made me more kindly-disposed towards the character than if he'd just been called plain old Fred or Joe.The paper's policy to fill the column with religious hokum rather than genuine responses means that he's powerless to help the people who write in. Not only does Miss L lack vocation and aptitude, he's more helpless than people in most helping professions, where funding at least allows for sticking a band-aid over a compund-fracture of a life. Street scenes sound like Breughels; these are Great-Depression families in desperate need of decent health care, jobs, social security, social workers, therapists, better domestic violence laws and better housing. \u201cYou are plunging into a world of misery and suffering , peopled by creatures who are strangers to everything but disease and policemen. Harried by one, they are hurried by the other . . . \u201cPain, pain, pain, the dull, sordid, gnawing, chronic pain of heart and brain. There's not a lot you could merely *say* that would make a difference. He too considers the job a joke, but after several months at it, the joke begins to escape him. He sees that the majority of the letters are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual advice, that they are inarticulate expressions of genuine suffering. He also discovers that his correspondents take him seriously. For the first time in his life, he is forced to examine the values by which he lives. This examination shows him that he is the victim of the joke and not its perpetrator. Lurching between moments of Zen-like serene empathy and a raging chaos, he applies some traditionally American means of attempting to cope, including Evangelical Christianity, booze and violence - as well as fever-dreams, a nice little trip to the country, three shambolic affairs* (this is a milieu between westerns and Mad Men in which the men are brutal, the women ill-educated, sex often bartered or coerced, and there seems no hope these people could live companionably in the way many modern couples expect). And most of all he makes a complete mess of what we'd now call professional boundaries. If you've ever worked with deprived communities the readers' letters are horribly recognisable - not enough has changed. (Other than policing and perhaps medicine and teaching, this encompasses lots of jobs which rarely find their way into fiction, despite huge potential for interesting stories.) You may even once have had a similar colleague with rather unsympathetic attitudes whose presence in the work was baffling, and who made more realistic versions of the mess Miss L does. The prose is well honed; a great deal of meaning and feeling is mysteriously enshrined in few words, not necessarily unusual ones. However, the editor's, Shrike's (the shrike, the butcher bird which impales its prey on thorns) rants can be hyperbolic and surreally hilarious: God alone is our escape. The church is our only hope, the First Church of Christ Dentist , where He is worshiped as Preventer of Decay. The church whose symbol is the trinity new-style: Father, Son and Wirehaired Fox Terrier.I'd seen the title 'Miss Lonelyhearts by Nathanael West' plenty of times before, and had thought it stood for something twee-er and wryer, about letters from society ladies, not the poor and desperate. (For some reason I had also associated West's name with Herman Melville, and I only just noticed that he wrote The Day of the Locust which must be the basis for the John Schlesinger film.) Stylistically this turned out to be something of a hidden gem, though in subject a very rough one.* A review of a different volume of West's works suggests that the chapters parody pulp novels; the structure makes more sense seen that way."}, {"userName": "Rick Slane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17459218-rick-slane", "userReview": "A somewhat amusing look at life in the USA in about 1930 from the perspective of a reluctant advice columnist."}, {"userName": "Arwen56", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9615245-arwen56", "userReview": "Mi trovo in grave imbarazzo a commentare questo romanzo.

Anche se un tempo i sogni erano stati molto potenti, oggigiorno il cinema, i giornali e la radio li rendevano puerili. Tra i tanti tradimenti, questo era senz'altro il peggiore\u201d.La fama di West \u00e8 basata in gran parte sulla sua sfiga. No, sul serio. Dovreste dargli un premio. Persino la sua morte prematura, drammatica, scioccante \u00e8 stata offuscata non solo dalla morte quasi contemporanea di Fitzgerald (un altro esperto in fallimenti e autodistruzione) ma persino dalla morte di sua moglie (un'attrice). Aggiungiamo anche il fatto che in vita nessuno, a parte una manciata di critici, si era filato i suoi scritti. Sembra una beffa. Una tragedia beffarda. Come questo racconto. Era iniziato tutto con uno scherzo. Un giornalista viene assunto con il compito di dare consigli a lettori disperati in cerca di una miracolosa rivelazione o di un semplice conforto. Il tormento. Quale miglior modo di lucrare? La rubrica avrebbe dovuto aumentare la tiratura del giornale e dare la possibilit\u00e0 di fare carriera allo scribacchino ambizioso. Per tutta la redazione, \u00e8 uno spasso. La rubrica verr\u00e0 firmata sotto lo pseudonimo di Miss Lonelyheart, che da questo momento in poi diventer\u00e0 l'unica identit\u00e0 riconoscibile per il lettore che infatti non sapr\u00e0 mai il vero nome del protagonista. Quello che inizia come un gioco per\u00f2 si trasforma in un incubo. Le esistenze disperate dell'America nel bel mezzo della Grande Depressione, narrate spesso in maniera sgrammaticata nelle lettere che riceve, si insinuano sotto la pelle di Miss Lonelyheart che non riesce pi\u00f9 a scrollarsi il dolore di dosso. E soprattutto non riesce ad accettare la sua impotenza. Nelle lettere sono contenuti \u201cappelli profondamente umili per ottenere consigli di ordine morale e spirituale, espressioni inarticolate di una sofferenza autentica\u201d Miss Lonelyheart si trova costretto a verificare i valori su cui \u00e8 basata la sua vita\u201cQuesta verifica gli dimostra che \u00e8 lui la vittima dello scherzo e non viceversa\u201d.Qualsiasi cosa faccia, non riesce a dimenticare quelle lettere. Scivola in una spirale di autodistruzione: frustrazione, isteria, deliri di onnipotenza. Queste sono le fasi. Il taglio della narrazione \u00e8 blasfemo, cinico. Con un brillante humour nero, West ci presenta una parata di personaggi grotteschi, storpi, mutilati, morbosi. Menzione d'onore per il direttore del giornale, un campione di disumanit\u00e0. L'intreccio \u00e8 frammentario, deformato da sogni, visioni, deliri del protagonista. La scrittura in questi passaggi si fa iperbolica, spigolosa, forse troppo. La pecca \u00e8 quella di aver creato un racconto, geniale nell'idea, ma fin troppo cerebrale nei suoi sviluppi. L'inevitabile fallimento di Miss Lonelyheart non scuote emotivamente il lettore. D'altronde non credo che l'intenzione dello scrittore fosse quella di emozionarci, ma, al contrario, quella di rendere bene l'idea di una desolazione sentimentale.

O intuito dessa coluna era apenas aumentar a circula\u00e7\u00e3o do jornal mas Miss lonelyhearts leva a s\u00e9rio essas cartas e por se sentir impotente, n\u00e3o poder ajudar de uma forma concreta , sofre com isso pois ele quer encher de amor todos os desesperados do universo, quer operar um milagre. Miss Lonelyhearts tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 submetido \u00e0 uma press\u00e3o psicol\u00f3gica de seu editor , Shirke, um homem sarrista que o faz passar muita vergonha e ironicamente o compara a Jesus Cristo. No decorrer do livro acontece muitas coisas \u00e9 como que se cada cap\u00edtulo fosse um conto isolado, mas a hist\u00f3ria vai se juntando formando um livro fenomenal. A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 cheia de humor negro ,medita\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a sociedade , religi\u00e3o .

Miss Lonelyhearts, and West, were truly ahead of their time, and the murky and dark and downtrodden nature of the words are an aspect I can say I gained enjoyment from, but the story itself, the content, the plot, and the way it unfolded, was something I found very difficult to like. This isn't a bad book, and some might even call it magnetic and brilliant, but for me it was a huge disappointment. I wanted to fall for this book, to find something truly memorable about the tale as it unfolded, to experience Nathanael West's work for the first time and be in awe. I wasn't, but I will read on, I will continue to read West's work because I do think he had a very unique voice, a human one that wasn't afraid to speak out of turn or kick up a few dusty rocks. Such a shame though, I wanted more here. Maybe next time I'll be more lucky."}, {"userName": "Nazish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365750-nazish", "userReview": "It would not be wrong to say that this unconventional modern American prose is a work of genius! How much does it encompass the abstract aberration of this world is another matter altogether. The characters come out so murky and noir at the end of the chapters that you silently shiver under the intricacies of the plot. Miss Lonelyhearts is a journalist who runs an advice column for the Desperate, Brokenhearted, Sick-of-it-all, and Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband. People believe in his intellectual capacity and expect him to turn out a living (more or less virtual) messiah for them; however, he himself struggles each day with his religious postures and private affairs. The dark comedy with a perfect blend of idiosyncrasies shows the protagonist as an impersonator who is not really that brilliant and falls prey to violence, sex and gore to help people he advises. Well-deserved 5 stars and I look ahead for some more of it next year."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4496242-sarah", "userReview": "This has got to be one of the strangest book I've ever read. Like a wild, acid dripping fever dream, the characters in this book are over the top, unsuspecting, poetic, obnoxious and tragic all at the same time. The narrator, both a hero and antihero in varying moments, has layers and layers of complexity, and he never even gets a name. West undoubtedly worked tirelessly on this because the interwoven themes of depression, spirituality and social anxiety really came through in a nuanced and heart wrenching way. I would recommend this book to anybody with an open mind who appreciates dark humor. The writing quality alone will force you to appreciate it."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "What a bizarre book. I raced through it. I quite enjoyed it but overall found the unremitting Depresson-era bleakness a bit too much and the humour, such as it was is so very dark. I suspect there are numerous themes that might be interesting to dwell upon but, to be honest, I am glad to finish it and not particularly keen to dwell upon it. I read it for a group read discussion in January 2015 so, after we've discussed it, and I've reflected on it, I may come back and update this review. For now though, my overriding emotion is relief that I read it so fast and it's over. It's unusual and eminently readable but dark and black too. Not really to my taste."}], "description": "As described by Atkinson in the NY Times: \"A scornful feature editor of a newspaper picks an ambitious young reporter to conduct the advice of the lovelorn column. Ambitious, opportunistic, 'Miss Lonelyhearts,' as the conductor of the column is inevitably dubbed, begins with contempt of the correspondents and confidence in his own cleverness. As time goes on, the genuineness of the agony in the letters that come in gets under the skin of the columnist. He is distressed to find himself presiding over a monstrous swindle.
