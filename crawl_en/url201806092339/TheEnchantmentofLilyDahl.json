This book has that eerie feeling that one gets by reading Emilie Bronte's Wuthering Heights and at the same time watching an R-18 movie with frontal nudity. Lily Dahl, this novel's main protagonist, is a 19-y/o county girl who is a waitress in a highway side cafe in a small sleepy town in America, Webster, Minnesota. She is dreaming for a better life as an actress by going to New York. So, aside from working as a waitress, she plays bit roles in the town's local production. Example of this roles is that of Hermia in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.In that town are all those mysterious characters. Lily Dahl is like Alice but not in the wonderland but in a creepy and secretive town. Hustvedt made a wonderful job of intricately interweaving the lives of her characters using, as backdrop, a laidback town whose history was laden with many secrets spanning at least two past generations. Then after establishing the interwoven lives, she slowly revealed those secrets while maintaining the foreboding danger to Lily's life with only the sextuagerian lady, Mabel as her supposedly protector. The friendship between Lily and Mabel in this book is very unlikely because of their age difference: 16 and 76 but the way their characters are portrayed made it all plausible. An example of this is when they sleep in one bed. Their bodies touch like two small girls and they wake up in the morning not minding what position - bodies and limbs touching or interlocking - they find themselves in. I'm not saying that I want to be in bed with a friend who is a young man and that our bodies can touch without malice to prove that our friendship is true and platonic. All I'm saying is that this is how imaginative Hustvedt is by choosing an odd friendship for her novel. Odd in a way that it is very likely to happen in real life but the way it was portrayed in the book made it seemed like it is a regular fare that is not too unlikely to happen. This is my second book written by Paul Auster's (one of my favorite authors) wife, Siri Hustvedt. Early this year, I read What I Loved and it was one of the suprisingly good novels I've read this year. It's nice to be surprised by reading and liking a book that you did think to be good. So, when I picked up this book, her second novel, The Enchantment of Lily Dahl, my expectation was high and I was glad that she did not disappoint me. This is totally different from What I Loved so I think Hustvedt is one of those authors who do not rewrite themselves. I am still her fan.Given those characters and setting and Hustvedt being a female writer, one would easily guess that her stories would dwell heavily on emotions and feelings. However, Hustvedt puts more brain rather than heart in her works. Not sure if husband Paul Auster has something to do with her style of writing but considering the mystery-thriller ingredient in Hustvedt's works, I will not be surprised if my guess is correct. As you know, Auster's works are strong on mystery-thriller flavor.Keep on writing, Siri Hustvedt. You have one avid fan here in the Philippines. Well, I am one of the moderators of Filipinos group here at Goodreads with 1,700 members and I am still to hear any of them raving about you yet so I think I need to spread a word to read your works."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "An unsettling tale set in small town America. Centred on 19-year old Lily Dahl, a waitress and aspiring actress, it is part rites of passage and part psychological thriller, populated with a memorable cast of eccentric misfits. Probably not the best starting point for anyone who has not read any Hustvedt, but still interesting, enjoyable and well written."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4914087-christie", "userReview": "Despite early reservations, I kept reading The Enchantment of Lily Dahl, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that I loved the novel in the end. It\u2019s a strange book populated by a cast of characters so odd it seems impossible that they should all end up in the same story.There\u2019s Lily, the 19 year old waitress who worships Marilyn Monroe and dreams of becoming an actress. There\u2019s Mabel, her elderly next-door-neighbour, who can\u2019t sleep and spends her time writing the story of her life. There\u2019s Dick and Frank, two elderly men who are so filthy they leave a black cloud wherever they go. There\u2019s Hank, Lily\u2019s beau-hunk of an ex-boyfriend. There\u2019s Edward, the artist who lives in the building across the street. And then there\u2019s Martin, an oddly menacing boy Lily has known her whole life. This wild assortment of characters live in a small town, Webster, Minnesota, where Lily works as a waitress at the Ideal Cafe.The story Hustvedt is trying to tell seems to be one about secrets and memory, youth and old age, dreams lost and realized. The whole middle section of the book, though, reads as though Lily is crazy and it\u2019s hard to say whether this is a triumph (and I am just too dense to see it) or a failing.In between waiting tables and sleeping with the painter from the building across the road, Lily is rehearsing her part in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. She also seems to be, to some degree, coming apart at the seams - although I think this is supposed to be the character navigating the tricky road from innocence to experience.For me, though, while her coming-of-age-journey was nicely written, I never felt connected to Lily or what was happening to her. Both the real and the imagined obstacles were off-kilter\u2026as odd as Lily and the people she spent time with."}, {"userName": "Devi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8959631-devi", "userReview": "Erst dachte ich ... dieses Buch wird so ein \"naja sooo toll isses jetzt nicht\" Buch, aber die zweite H\u00e4lfte des Buches hat mich \u00fcberzeugt.

I liked the descriptions of their erotic world very much - it was understated and honest. There was a surreal quality to the book, at one point in the narrative I wondered whether the strange events were occurring only in Lily's consciousness. The enchantment of Lily occurs on a number of levels: she enchants others - her ex Hank and the disturbed Martin - and Ed and the creative life - in Lily's case acting - enchants her. In particular her performance of Hermia in a Midsummer Nights Dream, creates a sense of new confidence and possibilities for her, as an artist and as a woman with sexual agency. I liked the interpretation offered of Hermia in this book as a \"tough broad\". I've always thought of her as a whiny princess, used to having it her own way!I also loved Lily's relationship with an old older woman Mabel. There's a moment towards the ending of the novel where they escape to bed, surrounded by books.The book is an interpretation of the Alice in Wonderland quest, where the quest is sexual identity, a confident and in-control womanliness. (Maybe that's what Freud would make of all those holes anyway).

Second, there\u2019s a spiritual connection between this book and Sherwood Anderson\u2019s odd masterpiece, Winesburg, Ohio, in both its small-townness and the entwined themes of identity and sexuality.A little further into the book and you may also be thinking of Edward Hopper\u2019s paintings of American loneliness. There are times when the book veritably aches with loneliness and yet it doesn\u2019t dwell there, merely uses them as launching off points for big questions.Here\u2019s an example: \"Do you ever feel nothing's real?\" Lily looked at him. \"Well,\" she said slowly,\" sometimes I think ordinary things are kind of strange...\" Martin nodded vigorously. \"It's, it's like there's a skin over everything, and if you could just get under it, you'd, you'd get to what's real, but you never can, so you've got to look for a way to cut through it. You see?\"It\u2019s a lovely exchange, though serious readers will note it has one adverb too many. There aren\u2019t so many of the big questions that the book becomes pondersome. Indeed, at times Lily is so brave her character verges on becoming incredible, which may be a more serious flaw than an extra adverb.Still, she pulls us into a romance with a mysterious artist, meetups with the mentally-challenged Martin, and explorations of the theater and persona with her best friend, Mabel. The book pulses and crackles. It is vivid and engaging. There are some lovely images here: burnt shoes, a realistic doll, paintings. There are also some horrifying images, but you start to realize that will happen about two-thirds of the way in.What strikes me most about Siri Hustvedt\u2019s writing is her ability to generate sparks from sentences about ordinary things. This is about a small town in Minnesota and as we read we find it is us that are enchanted, alongside Lily. A lot of this magic is in the words. Here\u2019s a snippet: The room was warm, and the heat seemed to make Mabel\u2019s perfume stronger. Its sweet smell mingled with the dust, and the sun shone through open curtains onto the coffee table.Or The room smelled of paint, smoke and other nameless but familiar things, and when she sat down in the canvas chair, Lily felt afraid of those smells. A delightful read that makes you want to read more from this wonderful writer."}, {"userName": "Bridgette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8602997-bridgette", "userReview": "It's interesting to me that other reviews have discussed the notion of 'mystery' in this novel, as if this is the central core. I agree that there are mysterious things happening, but they seem to me to simply be the sum total of life in a small town where idiosyncrasy can often reign. This novel is well written and thoughtful, it creates a series of slightly, but well drawn characters who bring and overall sense of truth to the story. Hustvedt's skill always seems to me to be foremost in her understanding of human interactions and how these can be almost limitlessly unique. I still prefer What I Loved, but this is really good too, at it's best, erotic, strange and poignant."}, {"userName": "Laila", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87905-laila", "userReview": "There were some good nuggets in there but as with her other novels, I find the story so creepy and the characters so wildly unlikable (except Mabel) that it wasn't worth the read.

Jeg fik ikke et s\u00e6rligt forhold til hende eller de andre karakterer, og jeg oplevede heller ikke en iver efter at l\u00e6se mere eller f\u00e5 l\u00f8st mysteriet.

He seems to want something with Lily that can't be stated outright and which is linked to their past, but Lily only has eyes for new-in-town artist Edward. They embark on an affair, but the small-town gossip suggests Edward is not all that he seems and as the story unfolds Lily's behaviour becomes erratic and strange.This novel feels a little like the literary equivalent of a David Lynch movie; set in not-quite-normal small-town America, populated by some decidedly odd characters, and with a menacing undertow that is hard to define. It is not however sophisticated enough to be truly mistaken for Lynch - the underdeveloped writing and clumsy story-telling stands in clear contrast to Hustvedt's later works. Lily is supposed to be a bold and feisty heroine, but I mostly found her immature and annoying, and the motives for her actions are largely unexplored. There is no real sense of how or why the love affair between her and Edward develops, and the portrayal of Edward himself is two-dimensional.Having said this, the story's dreamy sense of mystery kept me reading, if only to find out what the hell was going on, but the unexpected ending didn't quite satisfy this curiosity. The book and its characters does however linger after it's been put away, and for this it deserves a somewhat higher than 'ok' rating."}, {"userName": "Tonia Harris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5781042-tonia-harris", "userReview": "While most of this story was thoroughly engrossing and washed you in the depths of a dream world, I did not find the end satisfying. Endings in many books are ambiguous, and leave the reader asking questions and thinking what exactly the story meant. The same story can mean many different things to many readers. I wanted to be able to feel this way when I finished the book, because it was beautifully written, but I didn't know the right questions to ask at the end of this one. I felt like the writer had broken my trust after leading me so far into a world of madness, grief, and the town the story takes place in.I did like this book well enough that I want to read others by the author, including her book of poetry.

I loved the authors attention to detail and her recording of the small details of life. I also love stories that contain bizzare characters in small towns but the authors blending of fantasy and reality was confusing at times. I also found the character of Martin Petersen very disturbing. I could not shake the raft of similarities between the Martin in the book and the notorious Martin Bryant.

The setting for Lily Dahl was Webster, Minnesota. Either Hustvedt spent some time living in small town Minnesota, or she did some solid research. It seemed fairly spot on.

And I found some of the reviews really 'weird'... I kept looking for the unfathomable ground in the middle of the book where Lily cannot make head or tail of strange happenings. It reads quite a lot like a fairly typical murder mystery in this middle section. I think it's supposed to encapsulate all things stereotypical of small town communities: poverty, gossip, inbreeding, narrow horizons but Hustvedt breaks these images - the wise words from Filthy Frank, the tolerant views from Dolores, but these are the excellent minor characters. The centre of the book is the gorgeous, wonderful relationship between Lily and Mabel (50 years between them), and then carefully and very much on the periphery is Lily's love-interest, Ed from the big city. The love scenes feel absolutely genuine; Ed however golden boy though he seems is a typical male, and it takes Lily's large heart to forgive him.Nice descriptions of rural Minnesota, felt real.

I definitely loved her fluid writing and how vivid her characterizations are. The topic and how the story when suddenly to a mystery-thriller type was just not my cup of tea, because I hadn't expected it so I guess I was caught off guard and it took me longer to finish the second half.

Overall, I did enjoy the reading and am quite curious to read her other works.Around the Year in 52 Books: A book by an author you haven't read before - 17/52"}, {"userName": "Ani Artinyan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160809-ani-artinyan", "userReview": "\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e-\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \"\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0445\" \u0438 \"\u041c\u044a\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446\". \u0421\u044a\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430. \u0418 \u0432\u044a\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0447\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0432\u043e - \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u044a\u0434\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u044a\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u0438\u0437\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f. \u0421\u0438\u0440\u0438 \u0425\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u043f, \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0438 \u0435 \u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 :)"}, {"userName": "Anne-Marijn K\u00fcthe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41616755-anne-marijn-k-the", "userReview": "\"She had been watching him for three weeks.\"She = Lily Dahl.

Here gossip, secrets, and storytelling are as essential to the bond among its people as the borders that enclose the town.The real secret at the heart of the book is the one that lies between reality and appearances, between waking life and dreams, at the place where imagination draws on its transforming powers in the face of death.", "title": "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125497.The_Enchantment_of_Lily_Dahl", "average": 3.43, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407773297l/125497.jpg", "reviews": 126, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40851.Siri_Hustvedt", "name": "Siri Hustvedt"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Novels", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125497.The_Enchantment_of_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320534.The_Enchantment_of_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1176036.The_Enchantment_Of_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320528.Die_Verzauberung_der_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320529.Enchantment_of_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17225777", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9754898-lily-dahls-fortryllelse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1254313.L_Envo_tement_de_Lily_Dahl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8463191-lumous", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125502.What_I_Loved", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143974-the-blazing-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10223697-the-summer-without-men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2244799.The_Sorrows_of_an_American", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125496.The_Blindfold", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
