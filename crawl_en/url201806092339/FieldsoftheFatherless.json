Her historical research is so in depth that she puts you right there in the middle of the events surrounded by the sights, smells, and sounds. Fields of the Fatherless focuses on one of the first and most vicious pre-Revolutionary War battles in Menotomy Village Massachusetts. The main characters are the Russell family. Betsy, the eldest daughter, is caught up in the events and wants to be able to protect her family as her father is disabled from a plowing accident. As the town prepares before the War even begins, they don't realize what they are about to face. Cooper doesn't make war pretty and writes exquisitely the truth of what happened on that awful day in Menotomy. But at the same time, Cooper shows the role that God plays in the hearts and minds of people when they realize that no matter on what side of the war a soldier is fighting, if they are wounded seriously or die, someone is left without a child, a husband, and/or a father. They will grieve and cry the same tears and their hearts will ache or break the same way no matter on which side their relative fought. Betsy learned this lesson as she cares for a British soldier who no more wanted this war than she did. This book left a lasting impression. I highly recommend it for those who love Revolutionary War historical fiction. FAVORITE QUOTES: \"Tis your heart God seeks. A heart that desires to forgive and submit to His laws. Our sinful nature leads us down one road. But a heart that desires to follow His ways--that is the path that leads to God.\"\"Tis one thing to follow what's right on this earth, to take a stand against an unjust cause. 'Tis another altogether to forget the precepts of God when there is a person in need. \"\"T'would not have mattered, if I had died doing the right thing...If I did not do the right thing, it would mean something inside my sould had died.

The American colonies wanted freedom from the British crown and that meant war, it was unavoidable. We are invited to live this time, the later 18th century, to actually live the very first battle through the diary posts of a teenaged girl in the small town of Menotomy where the first shots would be fired and a simple farming community would take the first stand against an absent government who became a crushing force in the colonies. This is how history should be told, not through the dry accounts of history texts, lest we forget the human element, the passions of a fledgling world striving to become an independent nation. Through the eyes and words of Betsy Russell, we will witness both the inhumane and the humane sides of war. We will feel the religious passions of a simpler time, the social exchanges and the all too real fears and hatreds.Watch a young woman come of age and grow into her own set of values and dignities, as well as her own need to do the right thing, against the popular belief of her fellow villagers, but in line with her beliefs in a greater power and the greater good. It was this battle that ignited the freedom to choose in a nation unlike any known before, one that would not be perfect, but would continue to grow and change.FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS by Elaine Marie Cooper is the human side of war, the real side, the finality of death, the hopes for a future that made war unavoidable. It is the story of the first shots fired, the first deaths recorded and the first lives forever changed by the American Revolution. The afterword from the author details present day proof of what happened in this small village and the impact these brave people had on both history and the future. If this isn\u2019t\u2019 in school libraries, it should be, if you haven\u2019t read this amazing tale, you should, it is the history of the labor pains of a nation giving birth to itself.Publisher: Lighthouse Publishing of the Carolinas (June 14, 2016)Publication Date: June 14, 2016Genre: YA Historical FictionPrint Length: 137 pagesAvailable from: AmazonFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Dorine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942470-dorine", "userReview": "Rated 3.5 - FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS by Elaine Marie Cooper is a realistic reenactment of the first day of the American Revolution in 1775 from a young woman\u2019s point of view. Eighteen-year-old Betsy Russell grows up fast when forced to protect her family during an unexpected turn of events. Caught between the British and the American militia, her bravery does not outweigh her sorrow.Why was this book on Dorine\u2019s TBR? One of my Goodreads friends (Penelope - that's you :) reviewed this book and I couldn\u2019t resist buying it. I read it for Wendy\u2019s TBR Challenge for the March 2017 \u201ccomfort read\u201d theme, but I\u2019m late with my review. You may wonder why I\u2019d ever choose a fictional novella during wartime as a comfort read, especially when it\u2019s not a typical romance. Well, I happen to love American history during the 1700s, so even though this book is war-torn, the era and the faith of the characters, along with a somewhat romantic ending, comforted me.Join the discussion at my blog, The Zest Quest.First, let me say that novels depicting war are not normally something I enjoy reading all the time, even though I\u2019ve read quite a few of them. I love the era and the bravery of our forefathers, but the brutality of hand-to-hand combat can be appalling. Even though this story has realistic wartime content, it is the human-interest side of it and the faith message that stands out.Author Elaine Marie Cooper has a gift for storytelling. I would have preferred the characters\u2019 day-to-day activities to be a bit more fleshed out to ease the transitions from scene to scene. At least, that\u2019s what felt choppy to me in a few places, and maybe that\u2019s because of the novella length. I would love a more detailed view into Betsy\u2019s future as well, so this novella could be expanded. That said, none of my quibbles detracted from my overall enjoyment of finding an author who writes American historical fiction, as well as her ability to eloquently incorporate a faith message that enhanced the story.FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS whetted my appetite for more. Emotional and compelling, this story meant even more to me after I read the Afterword and the author\u2019s notes at the end. I\u2019m pleased to discover that Ms. Cooper also writes full-size novels during this period of American history. The first book of the the DEER RUN SAGA, ROAD TO DEER RUN, will happily land on my TBR, especially since it\u2019s only $.99.Review by Dorine, courtesy of The Zest Quest.

Diary posts inspire this fictionalized account of the emotionally charged months leading up to the first shots of the American Revolution. Betsy's vulnerability and honesty carry a tale of grit, loss, and ultimate triumph through faith. Betsy battles her growing fears in the changing times in Menotomy, a small town on the road between Concord and Boston. Young men she knows have already joined the militia, while older men like her father would shelter her from the horrors to come. But even wise and faithful Jason Russell cannot spare her innocent eyes forever. What transpires among her family and close-knit townsfolk on that fateful April day will affect her the rest of her life, but not without passing through the filter of an earthly father's prescient wisdom and a heavenly father's sovereignty. Betsy must learn which battle lines to draw and which to surrender to the Lord's love.Written with a tender authenticity and faithfulness to the times, Elaine Cooper has opened a portal to a world gone by, and yet drawn parallels to a world not so different now. This is a beautiful novel ideal for young students of history and literature, as well as for adults who cherish the power of a good story."}, {"userName": "Deborha Mitchell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253300-deborha-mitchell", "userReview": "After reading this epic tale, I immediately sat down to write my review. I had to get it down while this story was fresh in my mind.I am totally spent after reading The Fields of the Fatherless, all my emotions are either at the surface, or have spilled over. Elaine Marie Cooper has truly shown what it was like during this terrible time in history. I found myself vividly envisioning such unthinkably, vivid scenes, yet I kept reading because I needed to \u2018witness\u2019 it until the end. I appreciate Elaine\u2019s writing so much, as she doesn\u2019t hold anything back. She not only tells the story, but she \u2018shows\u2019 the story through her words. This story is based on fact and Elaine did a great job incorporating her own imagination into it all.I simply love this quote from the story\u2026it spoke to my heart.\u201cT\u2019would not have mattered, if I had died doing the right thing.\u201dShe paused. \u201cIf I did not do the right thing, it would mean somethinginside my soul had died.

You will find yourself totally immersed in the time\u2026..and find yourself learning a very important lesson in forgiveness and what if truly means to show compassion and love to everyone\u2026including your enemies. Thank you, Elaine, for writing this story. And thank you for including your Author\u2019s note. It added to the impact of this story.

This is one of them. You don\u2019t just read this story however; you are immediately transported back to 1775 to the small village of Menotomy in Massachusetts - only three months before the American Revolution. With every fibre of your being, you\u2019ll feel the fear of the rumblings of war, watch with trepidation the ominous preparations, and when the incoming troops ride past, your heart will pound along with the thundering of the horse\u2019s hooves. Nothing can properly prepare you though, for the assault of gunfire, the boom of the cannons, or the tortured cries of the wounded. This is the compelling story of Miss Elizabeth Russell (Betsy), an eighteen year old woman and the only daughter of Jason and Elizabeth Russell. When the war becomes imminent, her father instructs her to trust in God and do all she can to protect the family should he be unable to be there for them, but when he hugs her more tightly than he has ever done before, fear surges through her. What would it be like for a young woman to go through a horrific war right on her doorstep, to see and hear things she should never have been exposed to, all at a time in her life when she should be thinking about pleasant things like courting? At the beginning of each chapter, Betsy shares her journal entry of her innermost thoughts and of scripture verses that have been a comfort to her that day. These precede the chapter as a foretaste of the chapter\u2019s essence which I found to be a poignant introduction to each one.While the men of the area were employing their weapons to defend their rights and freedom, and facing a horror all of their own, this story is very much about the women and children that carried on their own battle against often overwhelming fears. Fear of the approaching war, of the safety of loved ones called to fight, of being discovered by the King\u2019s soldier\u2019s, and fear of the harrowing sounds of war; these were just some of the unsettling terrors that plagued Betsy, and the other women and children. God will use even the direst of circumstances, and Betsy learned much from her experiences, some of which she could never have imagined she\u2019d be in. I couldn't help but put myself in many of those same situations, and contemplating how I would have reacted.\u2018Fields of the Fatherless\u2019 is based on genuine events and people, with the author Elaine Marie Cooper keeping the real history intact as much as possible in this novel. Elaine has written this powerful story with integrity and conviction, but containing a rich eloquence that will stir your heart as evident in this quote, \u201cThe tears she kept prisoner in her heart threatened to escape her jail of restraint. Once one prisoner broke out, a flood of mourning would surely follow. She tightened her jaw and sniffed. No tears would bypass the barred doors of her tenacity.\u201dYour emotions will tear at your heart while reading this amazing story, opening it to empathy, forgiveness, and love, which will linger in your thoughts and heart long after you reach the end!"}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880552-samantha", "userReview": "This novel tells the story of the Battle of Menotomy in 1775 through the eyes of 18 year old Betsy Russell. Her father, Jason Russell was one of the men involved in the bloody but little known battle between colonial minutemen and British regulars. Written for younger readers, Betsy's point of view provides a useful example of how events are often more complex than we believe and few wars can be broken down into good versus evil.I enjoyed the way the author utilized true events to demonstrate Betsy's awakening to the idea that British soldiers, those she hated for their massacre of good men she knew, were not all the cruel barbarians that she assumed them to be. She is able to find mercy and forgiveness through an unexpected connection with a wounded redcoat, who she only assists most reluctantly. The story takes off slowly and emphasizes somewhat too much Betsy's supposed frustration with her place in events due to being female. This is part of the story that is not backed up by historical evidence, but many writers of historical fiction like to assume that women of different times were frustrated by their lot in life. Certainly some were, just as some continue to be today, but I do not like the assumption that most women wished for more than what was socially acceptable for them. Too much of Betsy's thoughts were given when they could already be inferred by the action and dialog. Maybe this was in the interest of younger readers, but it seemed unnecessary and condescending. Once the battle begins and we follow the characters through the aftermath, the story improves and captured my interest much more than previously. I appreciated that this novel was written to highlight an event in US history that is not given the attention of other battles taking place around the same time. It is a novel that I would recommend for middle school level readers with an interest in history."}, {"userName": "Jim Not", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24064671-jim-not", "userReview": "This book was not what I expected. Going in, I knew it was about the first day of the American Revolution but I didn't understand that events would be seen through the eyes of a teenage farm girl. Most war or suspense stories I read have strong male central characters with one-syllable names and killer instincts. Needless to say, Betsy was no killer. What she was, instead, was a young woman struggling to survive and cope during an extraordinarily violent, difficult day. Her pastoral life vanished in a cloud of musket and canon fire. This meticulously researched book explores events the afternoon of that first war day in Massachusetts. The action takes place, as it did in real life, in a small village through which British troops retreated as they made their way back to Boston only hours after brief battles at Lexington and Concord. It's largely unknown in our time that the biggest battle that day was fought in the village of Menotomy. None of the people there that day could have predicted the ebb and flow of the battle nor understood the high cost it would extract. Author Cooper shows us the horror from the point of view of women and children who are paying just as dearly as the men engaged in warfare. You will sense how close the battle is and how unforgiving it was for many. There is a deep authenticity to this story that lets us feel the terror, the anger and the sorrow of those who were among the first Americans to die for their country. \"Fields of the Fatherless\" is an exceptional work."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1595001-lisa", "userReview": "In 1774, Massachusetts isn\u2019t exactly the safest place to be, what with the Red Coats and all, trying to keep the colonies from declaring Independence from England. Young Betsy Russell is about to learn one of those life lessons that only experience can teach. Just who is the enemy, after all? When their home community of Mentonomy Village becomes a hot zone battle ground in the spring, Betsy must choose to fight her prejudices and fears or give in to hatred. After her father is murdered, Betsy\u2019s neighbor begs for help caring for wounded soldiers in her home. One of the men is eventually claimed and taken away by family. The other is a lobster back, a British soldier, an enemy, alone in a strange land. How could anyone find it in her heart to give aid to those responsible for the death of her father, a crippled old man, unarmed, on the doorstep of his home?Fields of the Fatherless is a soul-searching read, meant to encourage the reader to look inside our own hearts and examine our prejudices and hold them up to the light of Christian love and charity. Are we better persons for defending our rights no matter the circumstances? For holding our ground, no matter how or why?Join Betsy and her family as they experience life during this tumultuous time in American history, with all the laws and customs, culture and speech, life and death, packed into this great short read.

Throughout the pages of this work the lives of the Russell family come to life and demonstrate the true nature of a charicter that is rooted so deeply in Christian values. These values are suffered by the youth and elderly alike as the conflicts of man approach a looming War with Great Britain.The dedicated care of how the Citizen Soldiers who bore this conflict dipicted by Mrs. Cooper is spot on. The same feelings shared on the pages of Fields of the Fatherless by the Citizen Soldier who took up arms to defend his home are the same as the Citizen Soldier of today. Reading this book my mind reflected to my own experiences and feelings during combat and after. Page after page I held back my own tears as to not offend the Charicter in the book the inner most feelings of their own fear, grief, anger,the love of a woman, and the love of Home that for some is so close, and others so far away.In this work we find all that we are, and all that we aspire to be, not only as one person, but as one people united in a cause greater than ourselves."}, {"userName": "JoAnn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4850911-joann", "userReview": "Elaine Marie Cooper always brings an excellent, thought-provoking and engaging story with well-drawn characters and plenty of drama and action (with just the right touch of well-placed humor).

Both begin simultaneously in Elaine Marie Cooper\u2019s newest book, intending a realistic comparison of the grueling pain and bleeding during birth and war. Believing the characters were fictional and the story based on Ms Cooper\u2019s admirable deep research of that era and area during The Revolutionary War in Massachusetts, I was astonished to learn otherwise! Just this morning I finished reading this compelling story, and fell behind other readers posting reviews. Having read through several inclusive reviews about the story, I wondered what more I could say that would impress a reader to obtain a copy of Fields of the Fatherless \u2013 if they weren\u2019t already convinced. Nearly every lexis or depiction has already been used to illustrate this exquisite story. I can only add I am profoundly touched by the sensitivity shown in Elaine Marie Cooper\u2019s narrative of historical changing events of our nation.There is no romance in Ms Cooper\u2019s story\u2026only the courting of God to the hearts on either side to believe and trust in Him. During the short time that Betsy cared for an injured enemy soldier with such compassion and forgiveness did I think romance might emanate. There is a slight impetus that suggests that possibility is not null and void in the future for Betsy. From the 1700\u2019s, we read of the horror and atrocity of war, and yet do we truly understand the pain unless we ourselves have been in current warfare? Betsy\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end without promise. We do go forth. Reading only snippets from Betsy\u2019s diary gave me a longing to read its entirety, owning up to my snoopy curiosity. Betsy\u2019s story says much to me about the author\u2019s personal relationship with our Lord. Stories, fictional or real based on the Revolutionary War or all wars are not pretty. The beauty of Ms Cooper\u2019s story is being witness to the growth and maturity of Betsy and those in Menotomy spiritually and emotionally. Love and war are much the same in any century that God\u2019s children struggle. The most challenging part of humans experiencing what these families and community lived or died through is forgiveness. It would be easy to venture philosophically into the need today of the same kind of loyalty to good morals, love and faith displayed within the Russell family. Betsy\u2019s faith and obedience firstly to her beloved earthly father was the heart to understanding her Heavenly Father. Ms Cooper creatively poses enough dangling hooks in this story, for which there is purpose. I\u2019m already growing impatient for that purpose to be revealed in her next novel. My review has left some relevant details out, so if you want to know what they are\u2026.do Elaine Marie Cooper the honor of reading Fields of the Fatherless.

What I experienced in reading Fields of the Fatherless was an engrossing, heart-wrenching read with characters that grabbed my heart and a wonderful historical tale, suitable to be shared with the entire family, the sort of book grandmothers can confidently pass on to their granddaughters.What makes this story special is that it is based upon true accounts of an actual battle and its aftermath on the small village of Menotomy, Massachusetts, at the start of the Revolutionary War. Ms. Cooper makes history come alive in a first person account told through the eyes of real-life Betsy Russell. Betsy was a teenager when this significant, but little told, battle in our country\u2019s fight for independence took place, and she makes for an endearing character.Imminent signs of war disrupt her life and place the Menotomy townsfolk on alert. Betsy\u2019s father teaches his young son how to handle a firearm, and Betsy yearns for the same skill to ease her feelings of helplessness. In the tension-filled days leading up to the battle, Besty experiences cozy moments with her family along with the fear of what may lie ahead for their community. She has been told her place is to tend the home. As a female, she is destined for domestic life. But although Betsy is an obedient daughter, her fierce protectiveness for her loved ones\u2014which include a young nephew and a sister-in-law about to give birth\u2014lead her to take matters into her own hands.When the fighting is over and the redcoats have passed through the village, the Russell family is forced to deal with the after effects of the bloody battle. Betsy struggles with her faith. How is she to hold true to the Bible\u2019s teachings and keep hatred from her heart? Where is God\u2019s presence to be found in the midst of the ravages of war? Her greatest challenge comes in the form of forgiveness when she is called upon to put aside her anger and do God\u2019s work in helping a fellowman in need.Fields of the Fatherless grew more intense the deeper into the book I read, until I was unable to put it down. I enjoyed the unexpected twists at the end, including a surprise for Betsy that brought hope through the despair. Through its trials and hardships, this story carries a wonderful spiritual message and embraces the power of forgiveness.

The heroine, Betsy Russell\u2019s, a teen who must grow up too quickly. Writing from Betsy\u2019s diary, Elaine Cooper, brings the struggle of the colonists in the small village to life. Minutemen discuss an onslaught of the British military. Then they get word that the red coats are coming. Betsy retreats with the other women and children to a neighbor\u2019s house. Even though she\u2019s not in the path of the battle, she can hear the gun shots and screams. Simultaneously outcries of a Mother in a difficult labor resound from the birthing room. Betsy\u2019s called upon to help with the baby delivery then to accompany her brother to the site of the battle to clean up the blood and ravages of war left, her own father killed, shot then stabbed. She develops hatred for the British, but is asked by an exhausted neighbor to help care for a dying British soldier. The young lieutenant fell in the neighbor\u2019s house, and the woman believes relieving his suffering before death is the right thing to do. No one will aid the caretaker, some even calling her a Tory, but she\u2019s been up day and night. Betsy\u2019s heart goes out to the tired woman, and she agrees to assist her. As Betsy sits with the young lieutenant she learns that he personally didn\u2019t want to be at war. He wanted to be in England marrying the love of his life. Before he dies she understands him as a human being rather than an enemy and no longer hates him. Mrs. Cooper does an excellent job of putting the reader into the time and place. The book intensifies as she juxtaposes the death taking place in the battle with life emerging in the birthing room. She successfully shows the devastation wreaked upon those attacked by the British, but humanizes the enemy when the reader gets to know the young soldier. I high recommend Fields of the Fatherless as a suspenseful read that takes one back in time."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3632480-tina", "userReview": "Fields of the Fatherless***** by Elaine Marie Cooper Audio book Months before that first shout, \u201cThe regulars are coming!

The regulars are coming!\u201d, Betsy Russell\u2014only daughter of Jason and Elizabeth Russell\u2014prepare the best they can for what is certain to be impending war between the American colonies and the British. Fields of the Fatherless conveys the thoughts, fears and prayers of the Russell family and the colonist living in Menotomy Village (now Arlington), Massachusetts located on Concord Road\u2014leading to Boston. Before each chapter we get a glimpse of Betsy's heart, fears and prayers from her journal writings. On April 19, 1775 their worst fears come true, the war has come\u2014right to their front door. What follows is nothing like Betsy, her family or neighbors could have even imagined. As her father leaves to join the minutemen, he reminds Betsy that he is counting on her to keep everyone safe. As pops, sharp bursts of ignited gunpowder continue to grow into explosive terror, thunderous blasts\u2014cannon fire, followed by the wails and screams of the wounded, Betsy's sister-in-law struggles to give birth. Birth\u2014such a blessing but there is death too on this day\u2014so much death. Who died, who is wounded? Lives forever changed. Elaine Marie Cooper has taken historical facts and written a powerful, compelling story from Betsy's view from her journal entrees. Her descriptions are such that I felt as if I were among the colonists, experiencing what they experienced\u2014not just reading about it. Heart-wrenching emotions, forgiveness, love, compassion and faith take hold of your heart as the story unfolds which stay with the reader long after the ending.

As an author, I enjoy the research I do to make my novels as true to the era I write as possible. But Ms. Cooper has gone above and beyond the norm, taking a small thread from an historic era and transforming it into an intense read. And by intense I don't mean the shoot 'em up scenes from a Jason Statham move. I'm talking intense as to actually smelling the fear and grief her heroine does throughout the entire novel.The story begins with Betsy's ears ringing from her sister-in-law's agonizing screams during child birth, and from the roar of gunfire and cannons outside her door. The British are storming through her hometown and the male townsfolk are ready to defend their land and country from England, including Betsy's crippled father. Ms. Cooper than takes the reader back a few months where Betsy struggles to make sense of the impending war, where she fears for the well-being of her family and her neighbors, where she has an urgent need to possess some type of weapon to help keep safe everything and everyone she loves, including herself. Where she falters in her relationship with God to understand right from wrong, love from hate, and most of all, forgiveness. Without the gruesome visual of battle depicted in Saving Private Ryan, Ms. Cooper gives just enough description to allow the reader to imagine on his own the ravages of war. Chilling in reality, Fields of the Fatherless precisely conveys the devastating effects of war on both sides and how, as humans, we must band together to protect what is most precious--life. As you cheer, weep, cringe, pray and even learn, you'll come away from this novel with the same feeling as I did--Wow!***Note--This book will be available for purchase in October 2013. I received an advanced copy from the publisher to write this review."}, {"userName": "Hylah Cagle (Borwey)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24904635-hylah-cagle-borwey", "userReview": "As you must have gathered from the surrounding reviews, Fields of the Fatherless is the story of young Betsy Russell and is set just days before the beginning of the Revolutionary War. While it is the story of the first battle of the Revolution, it\u2019s really the story of a young woman struggling with tough decisions, expectations, and personal tragedies. Now, the best thing, in my opinion, about Mrs. Cooper\u2019s novels is just how much research goes into everything she writes. She researches the battles, people, way of life, and must spend hours poring over eye-witness documents. Don\u2019t let anyone fool you: Elaine Cooper knows her subject very, very well. While this latest story of hers might have unfolded just a tad bit too predictably, I still found it worth the read. If for nothing else, it was worth it for the history which was so deftly woven into the narrative. After reading the Author\u2019s Note, I was surprising to find how many scenes in the book had actually happen in real life (such as the incident with Anna\u2019s tea -- who would\u2019ve thought?) The second thing I have to address is Betsy. At eighteen, she\u2019s not really a teenager anymore, but in some ways, not quite an adult. Regardless, Betsy is still faced with the same hard choices as everyone else in her village. Choices that often have very spiritual implications. At the peak of Betsy\u2019s spiritual journey, towards the end of the novel, she has to decide whether or not to care for a dying enemy soldier. Ought she let herself hate the enemy as everyone else does? Should she wallow in her hate and bitterness? Or ought she forgive? And what happens then? If you're someone who enjoys this particular genre, I can just about guarantee you'll enjoy this book. The characters are compelling (my personal favorite? Okay, I admit it was Betsy's little brother, Noah), the writing was well-done, and the moral conflicts were worth thinking on long after you put down the book."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/723560-maureen", "userReview": "I loved the way that Elaine Cooper brought the struggles of the American Revolution to life in her new novel, Fields of the Fatherless. I felt as though I had been transported back in time to 1775. All of the details of life in Boston in 1775, no matter how minor, made you feel as though you were there. You could feel their passion for the cause of freedom, as well as their dread at what lay before them, and almost hear the cannonballs and the beat of the soldiers marching through town.I live in the town between Boston and Menotomy (now Arlington). Here in Massachusetts we have a great understanding of and appreciation for the history of the Revolution and the Minutemen. I have seen the Jason Russell house, the Paul Revere house, the many battle sites, the authentic reenactments of the battles, etc. The Fields of the Fatherless, though, brought the story to life like never before. All of the characters were so real, and I could easily relate to the way they reacted to the situations in which they found themselves. Their emotions, ranging from fear to anger to hatred and even to compassion helped you to understand those times, and the ordinary people caught up in them, in a very human way. But Ms. Cooper went beyond the mere historical aspects of her story. The book gave you a glimpse into the lives of people just like ourselves. We were shown how it is possible to believe in a cause so strongly that you are willing to give your life for it, while still being able to show compassion for your enemy. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fields of the Fatherless, and I cannot wait for her next book!"}, {"userName": "Kevin Sorensen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5653385-kevin-sorensen", "userReview": "I want to thank Elaine Cooper for the privilege of reading a preview copy of 'Fields of the Fatherless.' What a delightful book. Having read her previous trilogy (The Deer Run Saga: The Road to Deer Run, The Promise of Deer Run and The Legacy of Deer Run), I knew I was in for a treat.First, I love the historicity of Cooper's writing. She's thoroughly researched her subject matter: places, locations, names, dates and battle information. Yet the one piece that lends the most credibility to her fiction in 'Fields of the Fatherless' is the journal of Betsy Russell. Betsy becomes Cooper's chief character in this novel. Each chapter begins with a small snippet from the real Betsy Russell's journal, so there is 'real life' in this story.Second, the faith which is exhibited is also believable and deep. The spiritual struggle Betsy goes through during the various plot twists in the book make one ask, 'How would I respond? Would I do that? Or would I give in to the serious temptations seeking to ensnare Miss Russell?'And finally, the pacing is so good. The reader isn't running willy-nilly through the entire narrative, but there are times when the eyes simply cannot fly fast enough over the words to see how this portion will resolve itself. If you've not read any of Elaine Cooper's previous work, I would highly recommend them. As for 'Fields of the Fatherless', well, get your order in now. I wouldn't be surprised if the printer's have short-sighted this run and it will be sold out quickly."}, {"userName": "Penney Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20726672-penney-douglas", "userReview": "I just finished reading \"Fields of the Fatherless\" by Elaine Cooper. It has been a while since I read a book that touched my heart and made me weep so much. Elaine Cooper has brought this relatively short time period to life in a way that I have never considered in all the times that I have studied the beginning of the American Revolution. The story is about the town of Menotomy Village, Massachusetts, a town which lay between Lexington and Concord that lost more people that night than either of those famous towns that we all learn about in the history books. I felt the fear and dread that the people of Menotomy felt as they wondered when the British regulars would be marching through their town. They were certain that they would come; they just didn't know when. Elaine does a fantastic job of portraying the emotions of the real people who inhabited the town in that tumultuous time period, from the struggle to keep their Christian principles intact and not give in to hatred and rage at the enemy which was so brutal and tyrannical to the overcoming of fear and sadness to do what needs to be done and keep living even when life seems to be intolerable and not worth living anymore. This was more than a piece of historical fiction. This was a picture of how to live as a Christian in the midst of war and injustice. If you want to be immersed in the time period of the beginning of the American Revolution, this book will do it for you."}, {"userName": "Susan Baganz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7667548-susan-baganz", "userReview": "Field of the Fatherless is a new young adult novel out by Elaine Cooper. I thought it was a disturbing but honest portrayal of what life was like at the beginning of America's war for Independence.Betsy Russell is a young woman struggling to cope with the reality of what life is bringing to her small village. The fear, the devastation and the heartbreaking losses create a well of resentment within her. Called on by a neighbor to help care for a dying man she agrees before she learns that the man is British. Can she care for a man who is part of an army that so ruthlessly killed people she loved?Confronted by this man's grave injuries she provides care, because God calls us to love our enemies. She begins to understand that the choices he had to made were not always in his control either and that war is brutal on both sides. Both the British and the American's were capable of gross atrocities.This book looks at the reality of life in 1775. Told from Betsy's perspective we see the harsh realities of not only that time period but the sacrifices made for independence. The cost of duty and devotion are not minimized. This story has a strong faith line as Betsy struggles with her fear and to forgive as well as to move past the images and sounds that occur to live in the world that her father and many others died to preserve. While written for young adults, the story would be one that any adult would be impacted by. Thank you for taking us there, Elaine!"}, {"userName": "Tammy Doherty", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3491559-tammy-doherty", "userReview": "I just finished reading this novel and all I can say is, \"Wow!\" The depth of historical facts depicted here is amazing. I live a short distance from Menotomy (Arlington) and we as a family often go to the parade in Concord in celebration of Patriots Day. The general details of that fateful day, and events leading up to it, are familiar to me. Elaine Cooper has taken these dry facts and brought them to life, writing about these events from the point of view of a real person - Betsy Russell really lived in Menotomy in 1775. Her reactions, and those of the other people of Menotomy, during the days leading up to war and during those horrible hours on April 19th open the reader's eyes to the true horrors of war. How Betsy copes with the aftermath and learning to forgive her enemies is truly amazing while at the same time it flows in a natural way, never forced. It's easy to believe that Betsy really felt these things, said those words. Reverend Cooke did actually speak the word of the sermons Ms. Cooper includes in this novel. Some of what he said over 200 years ago apply so aptly to current events. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes historical fiction and those who love American history."}, {"userName": "Marie Tschopp", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24681933-marie-tschopp", "userReview": "\u201cFields of the Fatherless\u201d is the first book I\u2019ve read by author Elaine Marie Cooper, but it will not be the last.

Our heroine is eighteen-year old Betsy Russell, the unmarried and only daughter of Jason and Elizabeth Russell. Ms. Cooper\u2019s tale is a delightful mix of history and fiction. She is a masterful storyteller, and her storytelling created a desire in me to learn more about the colonial period in our nation\u2019s history. Her characters are likeable, yet real-to-life. Perhaps this is because they are based on real people, and I kept turning pages to discover their fate. At the book\u2019s close, I appreciated anew the sacrifices made in the founding of America. I recommend this book, and it is one I will be rereading. If you enjoy historical faith-based fiction, you won\u2019t be disappointed.

Ms Cooper also has a unique perspective on the locale of the story as she was raised in Menotomy, MA, now Arlington, MA. FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS is based on actual events and people of Menotomy, MA on April 19th, 1775. The massacre in this small village has long been overshadowed in our history books by the Battles of Lexington and Concord that occurred on that day. Yet more soldiers (American and British) were lost there than all the other towns between Concord and Boston; not even take into count the civilians in the village who also perished. This is more than a story of the tragedy of war; it is a story of faith, fortitude, and forgiveness. FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS is both gritty and tender. I was intrigued by young Betsy Russell\u2019s story, struck by its intensity, and found myself unable to put it down.

She grabs the reader's attention immediately and you become the main character. The depth of research that went into the writing of this work is obvious when you check out the facts. Mrs. Cooper's Christian values show up so clearly in her characters and you feel a sense of pride from just knowing them. As I read this book, I felt all of the emotions that Betsy Russell was feeling. I felt honor and respect. I felt fear, anger, sadness and grief, but I also felt hope, love and joy. The heroin's character was so real to life that when she cried, I cried. The book paints a picture of the life and struggles in the earliest days of the American Revolution and even though that was more than 200 years ago, it became very real to me today.
