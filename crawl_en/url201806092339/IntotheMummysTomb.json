Keely", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "A nice collection, including some stories I haven't come across anywhere else. Particularly intriguing is a travelogue by H.P. Lovecraft originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini.That story, along with Doyle, Haggard, Kipling, Stoker, and archaeologist Howard Carter provide a view of the mysterious Egypt which lured the English of the Victorian age. The Poe, Twain, and Bradbury provide more absurd and amusing views of the mummy myth. The inclusion of an original Egyptian myth gives another useful insight, as does Elizabeth Peter's well-researched period piece, though it was not as culturally intriguing as the actual myth. The Rohmer is amusing, though as unpolished as one expects from the pulps. I could have done without this particular Anne Rice piece, which pales in such close quarters with masters of structure, humor, and especially tone.It's a good introduction to a once-rich setting for stories and myths which has now been mostly boiled down into action movie fodder. Most interesting is how it recalls a time when Egypt and its mummies were filled with a promise of mysteries; a sense that each stone unearthed might rewrite history, yet again.Today, the myth has become a cliche, the magic has been codified, and the mummy is more likely to invoke Scooby Doo and Brendan Frasier rather than an alien and unknown threat from a time long dead. It was nice to be reintroduced to the myth as it once was."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11291565-derek", "userReview": "Great collection of fiction and nonfiction stories dealing with mummies, tombs, curses, and Egyptology in general. All the stories were quality and fun reads.

It was actually one of the better anthologies I have read. Anthologies are really hit and miss for the most part, but I lucked out and this one was mostly hits for me. My favorite stories were: Lost in a Pyramid, or The Mummy's Curse by Louisa May Alcott The Demon-Possessed Princess by an Ancient Egyptian Priest The Majestic Sphinx by Mark Twain Smith and the Pharaohs by Sir H.

Particularly, a story ghostwritten for Harry Houdini byH.P. Lovecraft titled, Under the Pyramids aka Imprisoned With The Pharaohs, based on the real-life experience Houdini had in the Egyptian tombs. Kinda cool how he was not only friends with H.P. but also with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as having a tie to Frances Mary Griffiths & Elsie Wright, the girls who became overnight sensations for their story of interacting with real-life fairies - known as the Cottingley Fairies - as seen in the movies, Fairy Tale: A True Story and Photographing Faries, and can be read about further in a few books I will note later. Can't say I found any favorite stories here, but my Egyptian education just went up a few notches. I think my favorite story was by Agatha Christie; The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb, a really well done mystery for such a short story."}], "description": "The Mummy. The first thing that comes to mind is the curse... reanimation..and revenge. But what further mysteries are there to be unwrapped in the tombs of the Ancient Egyptians?This exciting new anthology from the editor of Vampires, Wine and Roses features a diverse selection of remarkable talents, from major bestselling authors like Anne Rice (famous for her vampire and mummy novels) and Elizabeth Peters (mystery's master of Egyptology), to all-time favorites such as Bram Stoker (who wrote one of the first mummy novels) and Agatha Christie (queen of the sealed \"tomb\" mystery). Into the Mummy's Tomb even includes a few surprises -- a short story by Tennessee Williams (his first professional sale), an actual translation of a tale written in 300 B.C. by an Egyptian priest, and nonfiction pieces by famous Egyptologist Arthur Weigall and the discoverer of King Tut's tomb, Howard Carter.
