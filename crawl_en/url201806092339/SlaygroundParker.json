Very soon now, the hunted was going to become the hunter.After a botched armored car robbery (hint - when pulling a heist, make sure your wheelman is well vetted), Parker grabs the loot and heads for the nearest refuge - a closed-for-the-season amusement park. Before long, the place is surrounded by crooked cops and mobsters. They want the money, and they want Parker DEAD. Now it's Parker, with four bullets in his gun, versus fifteen well-armed men. I've only had one previous Richard Stark experience - Parker's first escapade - The Hunter. It held my interest enough, though I wasn't sure I wanted to continue with the series. And, while this entry was entertaining, I'm now pretty sure that two is enough for me. Keep in mind - most people liked this one WAY more than I did. There is a lot here to delight fans of the series - taut suspense, tricky situations, and well written dialogue. The action is pretty realistic, and even though he is outmanned and outgunned, Parker does not come across as an over-the-top, one-man army.Unfortunately, I think part of me was really looking forward to that. I wanted more of a slam-bang, shoot-'em-up. This book offered a roller coaster ride all right, but one that consisted of a long, slow trip up the hill; the suspense and tension were palpable - this was going to be SO good! Then there was a not-very-big drop, and we pulled right back into the station. The whole thing kind of ended with a shrug. I was not enthralled.In other words .. . . worth the ride for the great build up, but I probably wouldn't do it again."}, {"userName": "brian   ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian", "userReview": "to hell with y'all and all your crummy new years resolutions: 'lose weight, stop smoking, go vegetarian (<--although, that you should do!), be more/less adventurous, etc...' boring. totally boring. my resolution: gonna read every one of richard stark's 'parker' novels this year. and they're all gonna be those lovely gorgeous knockout new U. of Chicago editions. y'know what... lemme throw a few more chips in the pot: i'm gonna read all the ones currently available - that's 15 of 'em - this month. and then in april, when they release the next nine, i'll pound through those. so i'll have two months in between to recuperate or go into withdrawal... we'll see what happens. it doesn't always work out as planned, but i try and divide my life bilaterally: the one half is a blur of lost days, days of adventure, dementia, drunkenness, travel, etc.; the other half is leaving the house as infrequently as possible and consists mostly of sitting in my office subsisting on a diet of massive amounts of coffee, books, music, dog-cuddling, masturbation, writing, and crap television/movies. the end of january marks my 37th birthday and what better way to celebrate than to head back to nyc for a week and run around like a chicken with its head cut off revealing me, in truth, as some pathetic rapidly-approaching-middle-aged loser still chasing his childhood... so in the weeks running up to my birthday it's the 'quiet' side of the equation, which means headphones roaring with the likes of bitches brew, new tijuana moods, singles going steady, and live dead; the oaks (my local coffee spot); working on these two stupid stupid scripts; editing this stupid stupid film; golden-hour hikes with my doggie; and total immersion in the world of 'parker' -- a great world to inhabit assuming, of course, you don't end up on parker's bad side. and why the parker books? well, because they're the best. i've been hearing this forever. boorman's point blank, his version of the hunter, is some kinda loopy, jagged masterpiece.

I only vaguely remembered it, mainly for it\u2019s use of George Thorogood\u2019s Bad to the Bone in the early scenes of the movie. (Thank you for writing that song, George. If it weren\u2019t for you, there would have been countless film and television scenes where we would have had no clue that the character was \u2019bad\u2019 without your helpful lyrics on the soundtrack.)Fortunately, the movie bears so little resemblance to the book that I didn\u2019t even realize the two were connected when I started reading the Parker novels or I may have discounted them because the movie is kind of a crappy horror story with a deadly hitman killing off some thieves. Hell, they don\u2019t even call him Parker in the movie, he\u2019s known as Stone. I don\u2019t know why they bothered buying the book rights because the two share so few similarities that Stark (a/k/a Westlake) couldn\u2019t have won a lawsuit over it.It\u2019s really a missed opportunity because in the right hands, this could have been Die Hard if they would have filmed the actual story. After a car crash during the getaway of a heist, Parker flees with the loot and tries to hide in an amusement park closed for the winter. Some gangsters and dirty cops see him go in and decide to kill him and take the money, but they make a critical mistake when they allow Parker enough time to get ready for them.Carnage ensues.It is awesome."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Slayground, Parker #14, is surely one of the best of the series. Parker faces cops, corrupt cops, thugs and principled thugs, (he is himself a principled criminal), in a web of doublecrosses that are woven like an intricate spider web. A preface by Charles Adai makes it clear Stark is an artist; just as a poet may work within the constraints of the sonnet to create very different effects, so does the master detective storyteller within this genre. Slayground begins not with a usual slow, careful tale of planning, but in the very frantic middle of an armored car heist which goes sour only when the driver\u2014the best guy they could get at the time, apparently; Parker\u2019s first mistake\u2014rolls the vehicle in a chase. Parker has the satchel with the loot in it, and walks on to nearby Fun Island, an amusement park featuring various smaller \u201cislands\u201d\u2014Treasure Island, Manhattan, Hawaii, even Alcatraz (which includes a wax museum with famous murderers and thieves; cute?). This is Parker\u2019s second mistake. Some cops see Parker go on the island; presumably they know the heist took place. Soon Parker realizes there is only one exit to the island, and that these cops have made a decision. And others\u2014including the corrupt owner of Fun Island\u2014are making decisions, too. And all of these decisions have to do with doing mean things to our (anti-)hero Parker.One cop makes suggestions about how to catch and kill Parker based on his reading of detective novels, particularly ones focused on \u201cclosed room\u201d mysteries (such as those written by Agatha Christie, some of which also take place on islands).Carnivals and amusement parks are good places for misdirection, and booby-traps, if you are an escape artist\u2014fun houses with distorting mirrors, exploding fireworks, flashing colored lights and loud calliope music, canned creepy clown laughter\u2014Parker might be able to distract his predators and get out. Mayhem happens. That\u2019s Slayground, not Playground, kids. I really really was entertained by this tale. I am giving this 4 stars now, but when I am done with all of them (24 in all) , and if it lasts as one of my top books, I will elevate it to 5 stars.Slayground as imagined and illustrated by Darwyn Cooke:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...A trailer to the Peter Coyote film (very) loosely based on Stark\u2019s novel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP09J...Slayground shares the first chapter with The Blackbird, which tells the story of what happened to partner-in-crime ladies man and actor Alan Grofield, who also escaped from the rolled car after the heist, which I will maybe read right after this:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4..."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "The armored car heist would have gone without a hitch if Parker hadn't been saddled with a second-rate driver.

Some of the tricks Parker uses seem familiar but that's probably because movies and tv have used them since the book was written.

A relatively easy job just bungled by the poor driving of a second rate wheelman Parker knew he shouldn't have brought on to the job. Stuck near an amusement park as police arrive he jumps the fence to the park and finds himself stuck with only one possible exit and mobsters descending on the back looking to relieve him of the loot. The rest of the novel is Parker trying to stay alive and escape the park with the odds against him. I don't know if there is something to be said about the novel being the only Parker novel that incorporates the dreadful mystery novel use of a pun in the title. Is it a homage to the locked room who-dunnits that are mentioned by a corrupt cop while he is helping to find Parker in the fun park? Or did Westlake just think that Slayground sounded pretty bad-ass and appropriate for a Stark/Parker novel? I don't know, maybe the introduction to the book would have answered this question for me, but I haven't enjoyed any of the introductions to the Parker novels, so I stopped reading them (and they annoy me because the same introduction will be used for all the novels re-issued in a particular season, so you get three or four novels all with the same introduction). The book is more fun than a three star book but I've gotten into some weird rating system for these Parker novels and they should be taken as being relative only to the other Parkers, and not in relation to other books I've read. Two more of the original 1960's / 70's novels to go!"}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "One of the best Parker books.

I mean the guy's a thief and arguably a psychopath. But he's interesting...Maybe give the Parker books a shot (get it??? \"a shot\"??? yeah alright I'll move on). Anyway if you like action, crime etc. maybe try them yourself."}, {"userName": "Debbi Mack", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334550-debbi-mack", "userReview": "The late Donald Westlake is another one of those authors who's been praised to skies (especially after his death) and whose work I've been meaning to check out--again.I can't remember which Westlake book it was that I tried first--something with Dortmunder in it, I think. It had to be Dortmunder because that was his comic character and Westlake was trying so hard to be funny. Ha ha, I said, and put the book down without finishing it.Then I read all those glowing post-mortems on Westlake's career. I wondered, \"Is it me? Maybe I should try another one.\"I saw from the retrospectives that Westlake wrote under no less than three names. (Wow, I thought. It's hard enough just to write under one. And, if you read Wikipedia, it'll tell you he used many more.) And, under the name Richard Stark, he wrote about a hard-edged anti-hero, a cynical robber named Parker. And one Parker novel drew this blurb from Anthony Boucher: \"Nobody tops Stark in his portayals of a world of total amorality.\" Wow, Anthony Boucher said that? I'm in.SLAYGROUND starts with an armored-car robbery gone wrong. The getaway car in which Parker and his two cohorts flee the scene gets into a terrible crash. Parker grabs the cash and leaves the cohorts to their own devices. He runs for the nearest hiding place he can find--an amusement park called Fun Island. (Can you feel the irony yet? Don't worry, you will.) As he climbs the gate with the cash, he notices two men in hats and dark overcoats (it's winter and the park's closed) with two uniformed policemen--out there in the middle of nowhere. One of the cops is holding a long white envelope. And we all know what that means--it's not a love letter inside that envelope, it's cash, and that means that the cops are being bought and that means that the men in hats and overcoats are \"wise guys.\" The Mob. And they notice Parker noticing them.Parker realizes he's in big trouble when he finds out there's no other way out of the park. He can't go out the gate, because then the bad guys will nab him. So he knows they'll eventually be coming in for him. And he gets ready for this. He runs from one section of the park to the other--from New York Island to Alcatraz to Treasure Island and Voodoo Island and so on and so on--setting up traps (it doesn't say so, but it's pretty obvious that's what he's doing) in the funhouse the various boat rides and the submarine ride and so on and so on. And his circuit of the park is described in \"over the river and through the woods\" detail from about page 15 to about page 38, at which point, it's night and Parker is waiting and wondering why those guys haven't come after him yet. And I'm thinking bo-o-o-ring and I'm almost ready to put the book down. But I always give a book 50 pages. And the next 12 pages made all the difference.That's when you get to meet the bad guys--the two cops and the two hoods--each of them interesting characters. You get to find out about each of their agendas and why they waited so long to come in. Once they're inside--let in by a hapless night watchman who ends up tied up, blindfolded and gagged in the watchhouse--all the fun starts. It starts with a bang and things seem to go well for Parker at first. But then things take a turn. And Parker suddenly finds himself in deep doo-doo.\u2028\u2028The rest of the book is Parker versus the bad guys. Parker's movements continue to be described in great detail (\"over the bridge, past the tiki hut, into the blacklight ride . . .\"). I think the description is supposed to reflect the cold nature of his character--his sheer calculation--because Parker really hasn't much personality to speak of. Or maybe it was just the author's style. I don't know. Anyway, Parker is so thoroughly a man of strategy and action, without those attributes he'd be as colorless as the invisible man.\u2028\u2028Yet, oddly, I got used to the cadence of description and the level of detail as Parker plays cat-and-mouse with the Mob. I got so caught up in the suspense, I stayed up late reading because I simply had to finish the section (the book's divided into four) that I'd started.\u2028\u2028So did this book work for me? Well, yes. It was exciting, well-written, escapist fun. (I did blow through the description a bit, but still . . . I liked the story.) Would I agree with Boucher's assessment? Well, Boucher wrote it in 1966--before The Sopranos, The Wire and all sorts of other tales of amoral folk. I suppose, for its time, this was pretty harsh stuff. Nothing about the people in this book particularly shocked me in the amorality department, but it's not 1966 anymore, is it?\u2028\u2028 The book ends on a note that practically begs for a sequel. And there is the small matter of the hapless watchman. I wonder what happened to him?"}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "This is the fourteenth entry in Richard Stark's excellent series about Parker, the amoral criminal whose carefully-laid plans almost always come undone because of some unforeseen accident or because of an act of carelessness by one of the other crooks involved in the plan. In this case, it's the getaway driver who screws everything up. This is not the driver that Parker would have prefered, but it's the driver that Parker had to settle for. And it's Parker who will now have to pay the price.Parker and two accomplices hit an armored car for $70,000. (This is back in 1969, when $70,000 was still a lot of money.) The overconfident driver loses control of the getaway car and rolls it only a couple of blocks from the scene of the crime. With the cops hot on his tail, Parker grabs the loot and escapes into an amusement park across the street that is closed for the winter.Parker fully expects an army of cops to surround the park and flush him out, but then several hours pass and nothing happens. It turns out that the two patrolmen who saw Parker go over the fence are corrupt cops in league with local mobsters. Rather than bringing Parker to justice, they intend to hunt him down, kill him and keep the cash for themselves. The result is a great cat-and-mouse chase in which Parker, out-manned and out-gunned, must use every trick in the bag to save himself. He's even more inventive and resourceful than usual, and Stark (Donald Westlake) produces a taut, gripping story with a great climax. Fans of this series will be very grateful to the University of Chicago Press for resurrecting this title which has been unavailable for a good number of years."}, {"userName": "Mohammed", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1842155-mohammed", "userReview": "The non-standard Parkers are not my fav type of a Parker book, i enjoy the heist planning,the build up,the betrayels and so on most.

I read a lot, and I think I\u2019m hard to surprise, but this one did it. This book is a great example showing how Parker is a brilliant strategist with keen insight into others.I usually don\u2019t like \u201cfirst person\u201d stories. This is an example of how rich a story can be when you don\u2019t use first person, because you get inside others\u2019 heads.

All the guys are unconscious except Parker. Sirens are on the way, so Parker leaves with the money. He climbs the gate of a nearby amusement park which is closed for the winter. Some local mob guys see him do this. They tell the cops that Parker drove away with the money. Then they enter the park with a crew intending to kill Parker and take the money. There is no way out but the front gate which they guard.NARRATOR & FORWARD:The narrator Joe Barrett was good, better than Stephen R. Thorne, but not as good as Keith Szarabjka.I liked the Forward by Charles Ardai. It appears in both books 13 and 14.THE SERIES:This is book 14 in the 24 book series. These stories are about bad guys. They rob. They kill. They\u2019re smart. Most don\u2019t go to jail. Parker is the main bad guy, a brilliant strategist.

I thought the claustrophobic feel of Parker being trapped in a \u201cfun\u201d amusement park and the entire setting of this to be a major plus of the book. I mean, here is Parker with nowhere to go, nowhere to run. Outmanned, with only one means of escape. He\u2019s in quite a jam. This really heightens the tension really from the opening moments. Where this book excels is giving you a clear picture of Parker and his overwhelming situation. And the atmosphere of the bizarre scenery and rides and, well, \u201cfun house\u201d make for an interesting touch to the plot, as Parker desperately hopes to escape and keep his loot, the big prize. There are some really tough hoods out to get Parker, and one really, really tough leader of the gang (who more than one time will let you know he is tough. Really, really tough). Not to mention, there are two crooked cops in on the mix with the hoods after Parker as well. But, the hoods are quite bumbling and things seems pretty convenient for Parker sometimes. Some of the dialogue between the hoods is a bit cringe worthy, and Parker, being outmanned, has a bit of a Rambo-esque escape instinct that seem slightly over-the-top.

Slayground jumped out at me as the place to start partly because that\u2019s the next one Cooke\u2019s adapting and I want to see the difference between the original and the adaptation, but also because of the delicious setup. Parker is a master thief who, alongside two accomplices, one of them his longtime partner Grofield, knocks over an armored car and makes off with $73k. But things go pear-shaped as the unreliable driver crashes the getaway car. Parker is the only one conscious in the wreck so he grabs the loot and runs for cover - in a nearby amusement park! Except some gangsters and crooked cops are nearby doing a deal and see the suspicious figure of Parker toss a satchel over the fence and jump in after it just as dispatch alerts the cops to a recent and nearby robbery. Trapped inside the amusement park (which is shut for the winter), Parker must lay out traps in order to survive from the cops and gangsters preparing to storm the park, kill him, and take his money. Game on! It\u2019s a great setup, right? Buuuuuuut... I didn\u2019t love the book like I thought I would. Westlake is a fine writer - his prose is lean, his dialogue is crisp, and he writes at a decent clip.

Sure, we get the burst of action that comes with the initial robbery but once Parker\u2019s in the fairground? The cops/gangsters stand around waiting for their group to gather while Parker wanders about discovering his surroundings, making plans, setting traps - all fine, but boy, is it boring to read! Once the action does start I did notice a difference between Westlake and Cooke immediately - whereas with Cooke, who can convey action quickly and effectively with his art, Westlake must use his words to set the scene, and the description, of which there are paragraphs and paragraphs for a single scene, overwhelms the action, slowing it down immensely to become almost inaction. Couple that with the character of Parker who barely says two words at the best of times, and you\u2019ve got a near dialogue-silent novel with Westlake\u2019s descriptive writing carrying the entire book. The most disappointing thing about my first Richard Stark Parker novel was that I knew what the story was as soon as I read the synopsis - and after I put the book down I realised Stark/Westlake hadn\u2019t surprised me once. The last prose novel I read before this was The Believers by Zoe Heller and if I were to explain the plot of that book - family drama where its discovered the patriarch has a secret second family - and you read it, you would see how reductive and misleading the synopsis actually is. With Slayground, it is exactly what the synopsis says it is, and nothing more. This is the story of a stoic master thief, surrounded by danger, who lays traps in an amusement park to escape from that danger - and that\u2019s what you get with the book. Fair enough, The Believers is literary fiction and Slayground is genre fiction, a crime thriller, but I think it\u2019s clear that Westlake\u2019s prose is good enough to surpass the genre label and be considered literary. In this way he joins fellow crime writers Chandler, Cain, McCoy, Higgins, and Leonard, who\u2019ve escaped the tags of their pulpy roots to become revered as literary masters in their own right. But while there is a certain charm to the simplicity of a story like this, delivering exactly what it says on the tin, I found it a bit unexciting in its predictability. Although I did like that Parker was vulnerable in this book - the Cooke adaptations have shown him as impossibly flawless in his approach to heists and his encounters with other crooks. Here, he is cowed and weak, albeit temporarily.Maybe Slayground wasn\u2019t the best Parker novel to start with? Although I wasn\u2019t put off from reading any more Parker novels in the future, I wasn\u2019t impressed enough to reach for another one immediately after."}, {"userName": "Piker7977", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3571033-piker7977", "userReview": "Cornered like a rat in a maze, Parker is stranded in a closed amusement park after an armored car robbery turns sour. Mobsters, thugs and half-assed cops are waiting to get one over on Parker but little do they know ... the hunters will be become the hunted.Slayground is top notch. By maxing out creativity and fun in this entry, Stark (Westlake) hits a home run as this book is by far one of the most unique offerings in the series. Let's stop and think about it for a second ... a career criminal trapped inside an amusement park??? What!? It sounds pretty bizarre but Stark crafts the story into a suspenseful and entertaining adventure. Imagine a very adult Home Alone where the booby traps are more deadly and the thugs are scarier than Marv and Harry. The park's attractions come alive in Stark's writing and you will find yourself smiling throughout the book. This one doesn't fit the normal Parker formula which is a good thing. The repetitive nature of the previous entries are welcoming, comforting, and entertaining but the survival twist is fresh. As I read these novels for the first time, the ones that bend the rules and establish their own feel (e.g. The Outfit, The Score, The Green Eagle Score) have been an absolute joy to read. This book was sooooo much fun that I envy those reading it for the first time. Get ready for some surprises and thrills. I lost count of how many times I muttered \"badass\" out loud. However, if this is your first Parker experience...DO NOT READ IT. Be smart and begin with The Hunter and proceed from there. I could not imagine reading these books out of order. They build off one another very well and Stark peppers in easter egg references from previous books. This is my first time through the Parker series and as I get closer to Butcher's Moon my excitement and anticipation grows. I do wish I would have savored them a little more but oh well...it is/has been a hoot reading these from start to finish."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/354760-david", "userReview": "I prefer to read novels knowing as little as possible about them going in, so Slayground represents a special achievement for me: I began reading the often-discussed, often-praised fourteenth Parker novel knowing absolutely nothing about it--I even managed to tune out the illustrations on the cover of the Chicago reprint (except for the always-present Big Gun).

Grofield ends up in the hospital where he is recruited by the CIA in \"Blackbird.\" Parker, however, gets away and hides inside an amusement park, that is shut down for the winter. In front of the parkas Parker makes his entrance, a pair of hoodlums is busy paying off a pair of cops. After hearing a radio report of the armored car heist, a crack team of professional hoods enter the park to hunt down Parker and the $70,000 he is reportedly carrying with him. There is but one entrance and one exit and the hoods can keep calling in reinforcements while Parker has but one gun and a limited number of bullets.This is quite different than most other Parker novels as it really doesn't center around the planning and execution of a heist. This is more like a horror movie with the serial killer chasing the teens around the funhouse, popping out at the oddest moments and creating general havoc Parker-style. It is a solid, quick read that is about as fun to read as any crime novel ever has been. No, the plot is not all that complicated, but it doesn't need to be with Parker ingeniously improvising as he darts from one amusement park ride to another. How many hoods does it take to take down Parker? Gotta wonder.Giving this one high marks not on its depth and complexity, but on the absolute amount of fun and enjoyment this was to read."}, {"userName": "Serge Pierro", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11190201-serge-pierro", "userReview": "Wow! If there ever was a book in the series thus far that should be made into a movie, this would be the one. This time we see Parker in a thriller in which he has to use his ingenuity to try and escape from an amusement park surrounded by Mafioso and crooked cops. I would consider this to be a non-standard Parker story, seeing as how the heist is only a couple of pages long and is only used as a setup for the rest of the book. Parker is pushed to the extreme and\u2026 well, you'll just have to read it and find out for yourself!

Maybe I expected a little more but I found in 'Slayground' that I didn't really care about Parker's battle against his adverseries. The concept and plot was interesting but there was so much set up before the big showdown that I began to grow a bit weary as Parker booby-trapped the playground.What I did admire and found engaging was when the narrative focused on the police and the hoods. I was actually more interested in their back story than in the actual showdown when it came and the ending was a little perfunctory and perhaps a wee bit contrived.But having said that, Stark could not write a dull novel.
