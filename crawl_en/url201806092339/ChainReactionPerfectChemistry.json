HOT cover! To be released 24th May 2011 16th August 2011. Bring it! I've had LUKE PASQUALINO in my mind as my Luis Fuentes ever since I saw him on UK Skins Seasons 3 and 4 (LOVED him as Freddie Mclair. *sighs*). And now, strangely, I think he kind of looks like the guy on the cover. ^_^ Really looking forward to reading this! Loves me some Fuentes brothers!My Luis (Luke Pasqualino) and now my Nikki (Victoria Justice): ^^^I wish the Lake scene had been as hot as this picture!^^^~*~*~*~*~ SEPTEMBER 2011\u2026AFTER READING\u2026 4.5 of 5 Stars -  Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading Den  (This is an Adult-who-enjoys-reliving-the-stirrings-of-first-love-and-self-discovery-during-the-teen-years-through-YA books review) **CONTENT WARNING - Since this is a YA book I will include a warning that this book contains some Sexual, Drug and Alcohol, Course Language and Violent Content - Recommended for Older Teens and Adults who enjoy YA books***sighs* Still loving \u2018em Fuentes brothers! ^_^I was totally drawn into this, read it quickly and really enjoyed it\u2026 but\u2026 Perfect Chemistry is still my favourite. What can I say, I ADORE Alex and Brittany! Now, about Chain Reaction\u2026.In August 2010, in an interview for Return to Paradise, Simone Elkeles had this to say about the third \u201cPerfect Chemistry series\u201d book:\n\u201cLuis Fuentes is a good boy who doesn\u2019t live with the angst that his big brothers, Alex and Carlos, have always lived with. Luis is smart, funny, and has big dreams of becoming an astronaut. But when he falls for the wrong girl, Luis enters a dark world he\u2019s never known, and just when he thinks he\u2019s got life all figured out, learns some disturbing news about his family that destroys his positive outlook on life. Will that Fuentes bad boy streak come out with a vengeance and lure Luis to live on the edge like his new girlfriend and his own father?\u201d\nLink to interview hereWhen I read this, I was interested to see Simone Elkeles turn around the \u201cbad boy \u2013 good girl\u201d formula of the first two books to a \u201cgood boy \u2013 bad girl\u201d story in Chain Reaction. This is not what she ended up with, however. While mostly everything else in the above blurb remained unchanged, Nikki is not the \u201cbad girl\u201d that Elkeles had originally planned on, and Luis certainly isn\u2019t such a \u201cgood boy\u201d. Please see the link below where Ms. Elkeles talks about why she changed this: Link to interview hereIn Chain Reaction, Simone Elkeles gives us shades of gray in both Luis and Nikki instead, ie. ordinary teens who make some grave mistakes, that they can overcome and which need not direct/ruin the rest of their lives. I really liked that she did that! Luis Fuentes, is considered the \u201cgood boy\u201d in his family, but what the Fuentes family didn\u2019t know, until Luis gets injured in a stupid stunt two weeks before Alex\u2019s and Brittany\u2019s wedding\u2026pause for a SQUEE-SQUEEE!!! Uh-Huh\u2026^_^...is that Luis is an adrenaline junkie. So, it is Luis\u2019own risk-taking nature that leads him to make some stupid decisions when he returns to Fairfield, Illinois, involving the Latino Blood (Alex and their father\u2019s old gang). This misadventure leads to Luis to discovering some horrible truths that shake his very foundations, causing him to spiral out of control. While I suspect some may think this book is too similar Perfect Chemistry, and may be dissatisfied, as a result, I felt that Elkeles was trying to portray that even for the so-called \u201cgood boy\u201d of the family, he couldn\u2019t run away from the legacy of the past of his family\u2019s involvement in the Latino Blood. Also, for me, other aspects were different enough not to be an issue.Of course, there were some parts when I was like, \u201cWhat??? Luis, nooooooooo!!! Don\u2019t be such a pendejo (idiot/dumbass)! Aaarggh!!!\u201dYes, I clearly went on an emotional ride because of Luis. LOLAnd Nikki\u2026. Out of all the girls in this series, Nikki has the most \u201cbaggage,\u201d from a painful life experience, which she suffers at the age of 15. I really connected with Nikki and felt for her. Nikki is feisty and vulnerable, at the same time. In order to protect herself, Nikki has built walls around herself and has severe trust issues with boys...and who could blame her? But Luis Fuentes makes her want to believe in a happily-ever-after, even though she fears trusting her heart to him. Luis is just as sexy as his older brothers. I enjoyed the chemistry between Luis and Nikki and there were some very hot scenes between them. Hot Daaaammnn!! Although... it wasn't as strong as, definitely, Alex and Brittany, and perhaps, Carlos and Kiara...for me, anyway.I loved that Luis wanted to reach for the stars, literally, and I loved the special gift that Nikki got for him. And his poem? *sighs* Luis is a romantic.I loved Nikki's after school job and I adored \"Granny\"!I loved how Luis was with Nikki's brother, Ben. I loved that while Nikki had been born in Mexico, she wasn\u2019t in touch with her Mexican culture, and it was Luis who showed her the importance of not forgetting where you come from, to be proud of your culture, while not letting it confine you, either.I enjoyed seeing Mrs Peterson, the \u201chard-ass-zero-tolerance\u201d Chemistry teacher, again.I really liked Nikki\u2019s best friend, Kendall, and her boyfriend, Derek. But OMG, I seriously wanted to smack Nikki's ex, Marco, soooo many times!! Grrr!!! No love here for that total pendejo!!!I loved the brotherly bonds between the Fuentes brothers! I loved, LOVED seeing Alex and Brittany with little Paco, who we met briefly as a teen in the epilogue of Perfect Chemistry, and is an adorable toddler here. I loved seeing Carlos and Kiara, a few years down the track, and how Carlos can still be an idiot. LOL Thank you, Simone Elkeles, for giving us readers this continuity in the later books! I love this aspect of the series!Oh, and I loved the epilogue!!! I love seeing the snippet of the Fuentes family, many years down the track.So... that's a whole lotta \"love\", huh? WHY was this a not-quite-5-Star read, for me, then? You mean, besides the times I was yelling at Luis? ^_^ Well, mamacitas, I still had some questions surrounding the shocker in this book. It just felt a bit unresolved and rushed, for me.Also, I must say that I was a little disappointed that the shower scene on the cover, while was a cute scene, was not the hot scene I expected it to be. C\u2019mon, Ms. Elkeles, how could you tease us like that?! LOL Though I never thought there were handcuffs involved; having always thought the chain in the picture was the shower pull.And while I love the Mexican-Spanish words included in all the books, I do wish Simone Elkeles would have included a Glossary of those terms in the books so I wouldn't have had to google them.I was actually debating giving this book 4 Stars, but seeing as I loved a lot about it, was so happy with the Alex and Brittany and Paco parts, and I'm re-reading it, soon after... well... I had to give it 4.5 Stars!Being a huge Alex and Brittany fan, I just have to share this scene I loved: \n\u2018\u201dI got Peterson for chemistry. Feel sorry for me?\u201dBrittany and my brother smile at each other.\u201cDefinitely. She\u2019s brutal,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBrit, didn\u2019t she give us detention every day?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve tried to block those days out.\u201d Brittany cringes. \u201cI really hated you back then, Alex.\u201dHe slides the back of his hand slowly across her arm. \u201cCome on, chica. You wanted me, but you were afraid to admit it.\u201dBrittany bites her bottom lip as she looks into my brother\u2019s eyes. He cups her cheek in his hand and pulls her close, then kisses her.I slide my nephew off my shoulders and shield his eyes. \u201cSeriously, guys, aren\u2019t you past the honeymoon stage by now? You\u2019re on your second kid already.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to get past this stage,\u201d my brother says.\"Me neither,\" Brittany coos.'\n*sighs* I love you, Alex, mi corazon! If Ms. Elkeles does do any Fuentes next generation stories, I will certainly read them, what with how she\u2019s completely whetted my appetite with the epilogues in this series! Though I hope she mixes up the formula. Keep the Fuentes swagger, but no more gang related stories, please. ^_^Reading Order for the series:1. Perfect Chemistry - Review here2.

Being hit with a bucket of water? I just\u2026. I just don\u2019t know.This book\u2026.This book\u2026This book slammed into my intelligence like a bucket of water on a flame full of intellect. I think my eye just twitched in process.I know I shouldn\u2019t complain but I mean come on\u2026 I am a complete advocate for reading books that should technically be classed as \u2018guilty pleasures\u2019 even if I don\u2019t believe in them. (If something brings you pleasure, why should you feel guilty?)This book did not bring me pleasure, not matter how much this Fuentes brother tried.Let\u2019s talk about the characters.Luis Fuentes- come on dowwwwwn.Mate, I don\u2019t like you. Seriously, I have a lot of tolerance when it comes to the Fuentes brothers. HEY, I have boobs, it\u2019s in my nature. Right? RIGHT? All the girls love the Fuentes. ALL OF THEM. With your washboard abs and your violence and your sexually aggressive tendencies.But you, mi chava, you were so dull and infuriating at the same time. It was like the boring/dull/horrendous parts of Carlos and Alex had been smushed together and we\u2019d been given you. Gah.\"I don't know if it's a good idea to get involved with me right now.\"The only time I want a YA boy to say that- is if he is actually a {insert supernatural creature here} who will EAT his lady love. Not an adrenaline junkie gang bangin\u2019 poet who can\u2019t keep his la tengo duro to himself.Speaking of lady loves\u2026Nikki- come on dooooowwwwn.I wanted to like you, really I did. I relate to you so much. I know exactly what\u2019s it like to be broken up with because I\u2019m not Mexican enough. It\u2019s awful, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s happened to me so many times I\u2019ve lost count. You\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t bother me now but you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s rough, yeah?You taught me a lot though, darling Nikki, because now I know as long as I have a bicep to cling onto, I\u2019ll be reet and I\u2019ll be able to face the world with my head held high and\u2026. what not.Also, was it just me or did the italicised Espa\u00f1ol get ridiculous? I have no idea what half of this book said. Oh and every time someone says \u2018andale\u2019 to me, I get this song in my head.This book made no sense. The characters and story lines were just flung together in the way I imagine the ingredients would be if I were to ever make enchiladas.I have so many questions.Why was Luis in a gang?Why did Nikki hate boys so much and then kiss them in pool houses?Or\u2026 OK, fair enough\u2026. A bit of a distrust but why did she think that Luis was going to be the same as Marco? Not every Mexican boy is the sa-Wait\u2026. Just got a call from Latino Boys In YA Official Group of Gangbanging and Officialness and I\u2019ve been informed that yes, every Mexican boy is the same as Marco and they are all affiliated with a gang and they all take drugs and gangbang each other (did I use that right?) and shoot people and fall for rich girls who they see as a \u2018challenge\u2019.I have more questions but I get too angry to ask them.In a sentence- I wanted this book to be about a shy Latino boy with two badass gangbangin\u2019 brothers who meets a sassy Mexican gal who is all sassy and\u2026. um.. sassy.In a paragraph- I wanted this book to be about a shy Latino boy with two badass gangbangin\u2019 brothers who meets a sassy Mexican gal who is all sassy and\u2026.um\u2026. sassy. I would love to have seen Nikki completely sass him (is that a thing?) and have had a Fuentes brother who didn\u2019t know what to do with a full-blooded mamacita. Instead I got a book with two unlikeable characters that I didn\u2019t understand, a completely unfeasible plot (tell me again why Luis is in a gang?), angst thrown in for no apparent reason (HEY MARCO!) and scabby dogs. Oh and character assassinations of people that I loved. Carlos\u2026 crying? You\u2019re having a giraffe, right?I have no more words so I\u2019m going to post random snippets of the commentary my fellow readalongers and I created. They aren\u2019t in any order and they don\u2019t make sense\u2026 kind of like this book.I\u2019m keeping this bit anonymous so we can play a game of Pin the Snark on the Reviewer. Out of Reynje, Flann, Trin and I.... Who said what?SPOILERS.  I would vomit on someone if they proposed to me like that. \n   She sounds like she lets her PANTIES drop for any Mexican around \n   If I was Kiara, I would kick Carlos in the face while he\u2019s down on one knee. \n   I\u2019m just skimming for biceps now. \n   This hey, hey business is the worst EVERYTHING IS THE WORST! \n   **** this ****ing book. \n   Because all gangbangers are awesome at sex and not one of them ever was not anything less than a facepunch of sex-awesome, according to Elkeles. \n   I couldn't stop laughing thinking about driving over there and just picking up a Mexican guy for sex. \n   I always think of other boys when I'm in bed with a gangbanger. \n   I just can\u2019t stop straddling things. It\u2019s a real problem. \n   WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME I ALMOST BREATH! This is so tense you guys! \n   I hate it when my boyfriend's beautiful mesmerising eyes pierce my soul. \n   If someone got gangbanged, I'd think they were in a porn video rather than in the hood. The way the Elkmeister uses it is such a secondary meaning for everyone. And it makes me chuckle every.damn.time.. \n   May the gangbangers ever be in your favour. \n   As much as this review is full of snark and negativity, I want to reiterate something: I finished this book. Yep, I finished this book. Thus the power of Ms Elkeles, she will always get the last laugh.And it seems I am, and always will be, a sucker for gangbangers.That sounds so wrong to my fragile English brain I can\u2019t even deal with it.You can read this review and lots of other exciting things on my blog, Wear the Old Coat."}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3564852-ariana", "userReview": "Ay carajo!\nThere are only so many times you can enjoy the same old story.. in my opinion it gets down to probably two.I loved the first book because of the characters, and the chemistry and the action and I enjoyed enormously the humor in the second one, but when it comes to this one... I am terribly sorry to say that it was such a big disappointment.Please Simone Elkeles, I know you can write better than this, I've seen it before, just come up with something new the next time. I just feel like I've seen it all and I have no interest in reviewing the same story from different angles.One thing that I liked is the cover - yes it's hot - but can someone please tell me where the hell did the scene from the shower go? Did I get the wrong copy or what? I was expecting it, damn it! The only shower I've read about is the one from the chemistry class.. and God help us all, I don't know what's the point of that.Another thing I was expecting is a \"bad girl vs. good boy\" thingy going on. Am I the only one realizing that there is no such thing? I know Simone had to rewrite the whole story, but I didn't think that this was suppose to change too.Because there is the same good rich girl, now called Nikki (the only difference from the previews books is that she is suppose to be Mexican, but she doesn't know Spanish and for 99.9% of the time she is denying her origins - so it doesn't really count) and the same bad boy, this time the young Fuentes brother Luis (we only have a few glimpses of his family beliefs that he is a good boy, but he is definitely not - in fact he is not a \"bad boy\" either, he is more like an average boy with a bad attitude or something along these lines). And he was suppose to be smart so why, I mean WHY did he do the same mistakes like his older brothers? The I-must-be-with-the-Latino-Blood-to-save-my-family crap is getting so old I want to scream, so is the fact that he must lie to his girlfriend and his brothers because they would not approve (Didn't you wonder why?? You smatra$$ could have learned more from your brothers and saved us from this retelling, you know?)Now the characters are the ones that really got on my nerves. They change their mind and they switch principles like really dirty socks (ten times a day). I didn't feel like they were the same ones through the story. It was like they had no personality at all, and they simply went with the flow changing their mind for convenience - I am mostly talking about Nikki and Luis, but it is the same with the others. Minor Spoilers:I wanted to shoot Luis and Alex at the wedding (I suppose you know about the wedding between Alex and Brit so it is not much of a spoiler - it happens right at the beginning) - it was suppose to be sweet and romantic and it ended by being really embarrassing . *hiding my face in the pillow*Then I wanted to shoot Carlos when he said that he was single (to another girl!) just in front of Kiara!!! Then I wanted to shoot Nikki's parent for liking Luis a moment and being against him the next one.Then I wanted to shoot the Chemistry teacher - why did she had to change her personality in this book? \"Zero tolerance policy\" mean ZERO, none! And then I wanted to shoot the Fuentes mother - because she was totally UNDER-protective in this story.What's wrong with these people? Well, I'm out of bullets, so I didn't end up by shooting myself because of this big disappointment.To end on a good note, I feel that I should tell you that there are also a few funny or sweet moments, and also there are some hot scenes between the main characters (but I was too annoyed to enjoy them) - so I don't know, just read the book if you want to, and judge it by yourself. Maybe you will love it.2.5 stars\nThis review can also be found at ReadingAfterMidnight.com ____________________________________________Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO)____________________________________________"}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "[ Alex and Britt\u2019s wedding was just awful!

I like romantic subplots in science-fiction, in historical-fiction and in mystery - in fact, in just about anything - but straight-up romance? Can't say I've ever been a big fan. But there will always be exceptions, like Anna and the French Kiss for example. This is one such exception.This is mindless, sexy teenage fun. With emphasis on the sexy. That cover look steamy to you? Wait until you see what this has inside. No joke, this book is seriously hot, if you're put off by anything more than kissing and holding hands then you're nothing like me better off finding something else to read.The two main characters are interesting, likeable and relatable (especially Nikki), and best of all: they are refreshingly far from perfect. I don't know how many times I've read both adult and young adult romances and the characters are all flawlessly charming - though, naturally, Luis is sex-on-a-stick ;)Also, this story follows a similar theme to Perfect Chemistry, and probably Rules of Attraction too but I haven't read that one yet. If you liked the first then you will probably like this book, and personally, I much preferred this story. In Perfect Chemistry I wasn't too impressed with the ridiculously over-cliched characters: good girl cheerleader and bad boy gang member, I acknowledged that the chemistry was sizzling and that the book was reasonably entertaining but, um, I might as well have just watched Grease. Chain Reaction had more original characters. Luis, a science genius who longs to one day become an astronaut if he can only break away from his family's violent past and gang involvement; and Nikki, a girl who was knocked up and dumped by a guy who left her to join the mexican gangs, and who now fears relationships with boys, particularly those with connections to the 'Latino Blood'.This is definitely my favourite of the two books I've read in the series, though I intend to read Rules of Attraction pretty soon. This book is for those looking for something pleasant and light with an inevitable happy ending.Many thanks to Lindsey for letting me borrow this :)"}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3114825-ari", "userReview": "Edit After reading august 16: I was seriously debating giving this book three stars, but my loyalty to the author stopped me from comitting the crime... les cocottes I know you're gonna read this, so let me tell you that I'm a bit disappointed.

I'm sad to see their stories come to an end. I will miss them. If you have not read this series... all I have to say is WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?!Luis was the brother that you didn't really see much in the first two books, he was there and made a few small appearances but he wasn't what I was expecting. Luis had always been described as the \"smart\" brother.... so I thought maybe, just maybe he might learn from his brother's mistakes... not so much.Luis was a lot more cocky and full of himself, and although that usually turns me away, he had a good heart underneath it all, so you couldn't help but love him. And poor Nikki, she had been through so much she shouldn't have had to deal with at fifteen that you can't help but want to wrap her in a protective cocoon... (and she is a dog lover so that's like one million times infinity cool points for Nikki.) You will love these two characters! It was difficult to watch Luis and his internal struggle to stay uninvolved with the gang, though it doesn't work out for him exactly as he hoped. Old habits and friendships are hard to break.Their were hints and clues to (and and almost confession if I'm remembering right... it's been a while since I've read the other books) a \"secret\" involving Luis. It didn't exactly come out how I was hoping... but it plays nicely into the story... did not expect it!This is just a great series, that I've thoroughly enjoyed reading.

Chain Reaction could have sated my lust for love, and yet, like its prelude, it fell flat in all the important areas.Luis Fuentes is doing his best to stay on the right path, and when he meets Nikki, the girl with the angelic face and beautiful soul, he thinks his life is finally starting to come together for good. Sure, Nikki has a lot of baggage and doesn\u2019t really trust a \u201cSouth Sider,\u201d but hey, didn\u2019t his brothers go through that too? Luis thinks he\u2019s got it all figured out, that cocky kid, until the LB comes rolling back into town claiming debt. Suddenly, Luis\u2019s life isn\u2019t so perfect anymore and he\u2019s now trapped in a world of lies, deceit and violence, with not a clue on how to get out.Sounds familiar, right? Chain Reaction is basically the same thing as its lead ups, but just with different characters and a few plot strings ripped off from Gossip Girl. Elkeles writes clich\u00e9s like she\u2019s creating them in the first place \u2013 she twists the rich, stuck-uppity one, the bad-boy-gang-kid option, the Romeo-and-Juliet scenario, generally respectably \u2013 but even so, her writing skills seemed to have disappeared in this installment. This book lacked in pacing, in climax, in characterization, and all because there are only so many times you can run a clich\u00e9, and because I\u2019m damn sure Elkeles got lazy with her dialogues.Truthfully, I didn\u2019t really like Luis. He was everywhere with his emotions and thoughts. He is the shady guy Nikki suspects him to be, and a lot of the time I found myself questioning his motives, which was ridiculous because while doing so I was reading from his POV. Luis wasn\u2019t a very well-rounded character, but then I can also now say that for his brothers too. Because, yeah. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ALEX AND CARLOS? LEGITIMATELY, WHAT THE HELL? When we start off the book, Alex is getting married to Brittany and all is good for the whole wide freaking world. Alex seems cool, as usual, and seems like an ACTUAL MALE HUMAN BEING\u2026 which freakishly changes fast. Suddenly all you hear from him are these sappy-ass lines, and then just as snippily, you\u2019re hearing them from tough-guy Carlos too. I got the feeling that Elkeles got stuck in her Hot Boy Wonderland and just decided to ignore how real boys actually speak, because something happened to her male characters that seriously scared me into taking a break from the book.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think Simone Elkeles has the ability and potential to write solid main characters. Case in point, Nikki was much stronger and more relatable in comparison to Brittany and Kiara, and I could actually see myself being friends with her. Oh, and while we\u2019re talking about befriending, I think I should mention that I love how Elkeles actually gives the \u201cbest friend\u201d space to grow and become something other than \u201cthe best friend.\u201d In this chemistry-ridden universe, the best friends get to be best friends, and get to be treated like best friends, and really, that\u2019s truly wonderful because damn it, Elkeles is doing as expected.Chain Reaction was romantic, but it was more steamy then anything else. I think I like this series so much because when Elkeles talks sex, she doesn\u2019t just tell it, she shows it. Although the scenes were genuinely sappy about 85% of the time, I think that most YA authors could learn something from one of Chain Reactions sexcapades. It was refreshing and fun to simmer in the heat in the chemistry between the characters.This book \u2013 nay, this series - could have been so much more, but this trilogy really did make me happy at points and made me a fan of Elkeles. I\u2019m sad that the Fuentes\u2019 are finished telling stories, because they really did tell riveting ones, but I\u2019m also looking forward to something new. Something very, very new.

I wouldn't normally bother with a book as bad as this, but I'm shockingly disappointed because I liked Perfect Chemistry well enough.Seriously, though. Chain Reaction might as well have been done in point form, as there is absolutely no supporting evidence of sincerity, both from the characters and the author, herself. She tells us everything we need to know, taking no time to actually show us why we should believe her. Luis and Nikki are weak, fleshless, glossed-over characters. There's no reason to sympathize with them. Oh sure, they have problems but the focus veers towards the inane that you just end up wanting the story to end (which isn't hard - just put the book down, right?). Let me summarize: Luis is a cocky adrenaline junkie who happens to be a gorgeous, straight-A student with ambitious plans of becoming an astronaut. Nikki is a sexy Latina who volunteers at the animal shelter but who acts like a judgmental bitch to ward people off, especially boys, except it only makes her even more desirable. Luis wants to bang Nikki because he's a \"daredevil\" and she's a \"challenge\". Nikki wants to bang Luis \"to prove\" they have no chemistry and that she can be \"emotionally detached\" with anyone...guess how this ends. Furthermore, people don't speak like this. If anyone pulled any of these lines on me, I'd throw up in my mouth. And the italicized Spanish got old real fast. It wasn't cute; it was demeaning. Its like the Pavlov effect...whenever I hear chica or mamacita, my reflex is to cringe and fling my arm wildly about my person to hit the mouth from whence the abomination came. I'm now damaged goods.Characterization done, onto the plot...Plot done, onto the conclusion...This book is juvenile, lazy and dispassionate. It does nothing for its genre, offers nothing to its readers and is a disservice to young people. This paper gets a D, if only for the few funny lines that actually managed to make me snicker. ---Update: Okay, I just re-read this and think, perhaps, I might have been just a tad melodramatic...but still, I stand by all I said."}, {"userName": "SimBim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3509728-simbim", "userReview": "Oh My God, the cover...Luis, you kinky beast ;)"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "3.5 stars. My review is going to be quite half-assed this time. Either you love these books or you don't. I have to fall on the love side because so many experiences in these books are ones that I have witnessed first hand. Sure, there are people who feel it a bit fake, but not everything can be 100% accurate. I feel like the author did her research and came close enough for me to relate, being someone who has been there, lived that.Good lord, it's as if these books are half documenting my teen years. It's crazy how much of this stuff actually happened to me and exes of mine. It's nice to read something that isn't so far off from my life, me being the girl who dropped out of high school and had a baby as a teen and still managed to overcome and make something decent out of my life. This is one of the only book series that at least sort of gets what the rest of us \"bad kids\" went through.Were the love stories a bit sappy and overdone? Perhaps? But maybe not as much as some people complain about. Even my hard-assed gang-living high school boyfriend had a sappy side. He used to write me poetry. He used to whisper words of love and affection in my ear that used to make me melt. He probably reigned it in a little when around his friends because of the whole image thing, but that side of him was still there under the surface. I swear, there was so much of Alex (from book 1) in my first love, but I can pull out qualities of both Carlos and Luis that would match up with other boyfriends of mine.Call me blasphemous (Alex I still got your back!) but dare I say I liked this one just a little bit better than even book 1? I thought it was great how the author managed to bring all three brothers together to tell the continuing story of the family as a whole. I still got to have my Alex fix, but also got to see where Carlos and Kiara's relationship was headed. And then...then there was Luis. He was all of the good qualities of Alex, while managing to be even more in spirit. He was so much fun. The cockiness was playful, not serious, which added an adorable appeal to the youngest Fuentes brother.Nikki, the girl in this book, was hands down my favorite girl in the series. I never really attached to either Brittany or Kiara. I'm not sure why all three girls had to be rich girls, but whatever. Small complaint. If you were a fan of the first book, but not so much of the second, I'm here to tell you that you'll be getting some of the original magic back with this book. Partway into the book, the whole family moves back to Chicago, so we get away from the small-town mountain setting of Boulder (awesome town, but yeah...not so much for these books). This story needed to be told in Chicago. Book 2 lost something for me when the setting changed, so I was happy to see that a relocation was in order."}, {"userName": "Aly (Fantasy4eva)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1491042-aly-fantasy4eva", "userReview": "I've been very conflicted about this one. So I'm going to just go ahead and list what I did and didn't like.* THE COVER. I loves. At first I was like WOW. And then all traumatised when my dad saw it and gave me the WTF look. Now I just say WHATEVS. Sometimes I even stare. I DON'T EVEN CARE.* Nikki Cruz in the first half I really liked. In the second half I guess something just changed because my original opinion of her diminished.* The cheesy dialogue? Oh man. I know there's bits of it in the previous book, but if it was sprinkled on the previous two, then it was pure full on splashed on this one. And I found it all a bit too much since it was so constant in the book. A lot of eye rolling involved. Also quite a bit of cringing :/*It was heck of a breezy read. I absolutely devoured the book and that's something I can always count on when it comes to this author.* The themes and plot I have all seen before. And at this point it was a pretty annoying.* I was all about seeing the scene that is shown on the cover. Sadly, I was very disappointed. * I didn't buy Luis' reason for doing the things he did. Mostly because I felt like he did them not because he had no choice and had to protect his family, but just because he purely did it for the thrill, because he wanted to. And I'm not OK with that. And I'm not OK with how he lies to someone he cares about over and over again as a result of it.* His mother was pretty disgraceful in this book. Not only did she do nothing as it all unfolded before her (apart from sulk) but she hid something that he had every right to know. Failing to use her common sense to know that not telling him would only cause him to not only distrust her but to gravitate to the very people who she wanted him to stay away from.* I have to admit. It was lovely to see Alex and Carlos again. Although their personalities seemed a little off on this one. And do not even get me started on that scene with Carlos. That boy can be pretty oblivious sometimes.* I thought the prologue was pretty cute. Guys, I know some have a thing against them but I love them! Although I think I loved ROA prologue a little more :D* I really felt for Nikki at the beginning. It's horrible what she goes through and relateable on so many levels. So it's understandable why she would hold a barrier for so long. I certainly don't blame her. But the girl had a major case of ignoring 'the signs' when it came to Luis. * Paco!!! This kid is so adorable. I need to read PC prologue again. :)* I wish there was more to Marco. We all know he's a douche. but I'd like to think there's more to him than is let on. What if he did genuinely like her, what if he has a seriously messed up background or story that could help us understand him better. There are a few people like Nikki's best mate and her bf, including Marco, that I found interesting and would have loved to have known them better. *The last few pages seemed a little all over the place. I felt like everything was fast forwarding and it felt very jumbled up.*The authors writing really didn't seem on point compared to her two previous books. It definitely became much more evident towards the middle and the end. I was left pretty let down by it.*It still contained moments that made me laugh. But it wasn't quite as swoon-y, funny or have the same great banter as the previous two books did. Which was a shame because it's mainly the highlight for me when it comes to the authors books.* Despite the conflicted thoughts, I did have a good time with it.

That is so not true.They Both have baggage.At least she wasn't the kind of chick into drugs and partying and all that other teenage bad girl stuff that was going on in this book. I liked her. Ok,made my point. NEXT!Holy Mother Of Unholiness! We get more then the average joe story plot in this novel.For instance.Alex and Brit: Marriage and babies...Swoons! Can I claim his babies? His baby boy has me wrapped around his fingers,he can smooch and drool on my cheeks any day! hehehehehe.....Carlos and Kira: Major issues,but love them forever and always. LOL!! Just like Carlos would say \"make-up sex\" is always worth the wild...ahahahaha....Now as for Luis and Nikki: Nikki reminds me of myself,I'm so generic it's pathetic! ROTFLMAO!!!!!! She claims she's not Mexican but she is,and I claim I'm Spanish,but never show what I'm truly made of,don't know why =P OK! Back to my point! I love that Luis is totally into his culture,and doesn't let anyone tell him he's not. LOVE IT! These two combined set each others fireworks off. Nikki has a strong \"FU\" Vibe and Luis has an \"I'll FU Vibe\" It doesn't get better than that. 2years later after they meet at Alex's wedding,they bump into one another during their Senior Year at Fairfield High. Nikki has a past and doesn't trust any guy who tries to get near her.But she feels a strong connection with Luis. Luis is determined to get what he wants,in a very good boy fashion way till,Nikki keeps pushing him away.So that's when his Bad Boy persona releases. AND even I can't deny the desire! Well,to keep my review short and spoiler free,let me just say.It's Truely Suspenseful and heart breaking. There is major Family togetherness that will bring you down to your knees.(Loved how this family sticks together.)Romance,and so much more....... If you started the series and haven't finished it. Stop being lazy and pick it up,Or Else......I will harass anyone I know if they haven't finished the series yet.LOLZ! Ya'll know who you are! =PTo all teens out there..Simone Elkeles has written a wonderful series that any teen can relate too. Remember we're not all perfect.Shite happens,it's up to everyone of of you to pick up the pieces in your life and make something of yourselves. And it can all start with just a book \nBTW!!!!!! I'm so grateful that Alex and Carlos are in their 20's now.So I can officially put this novel on my \"Quiver Shelf\" Ahhhh...nice! heheheheInterview on my blog with Simone Elkeles S,E,R's Awesomness!"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22020479-jessica", "userReview": "I loved reading this companion series, it was really fun and family based which I loved. It had its funny moments, it had its cheesy moments and it had its more serious moments and I loved them all. I will say that sometimes the main love interests were annoying but I still highly enjoyed it. I think there is going to be a 4th book which is really exiting."}, {"userName": "Yuli Atta - Damaged Pages", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15999947-yuli-atta---damaged-pages", "userReview": "The thing about this book that is so off is that the characters are supposed to be the smart ones, they are supposed to no how things would go and yet they are just fools.\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u044a\u0436\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c, \u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0432\u044e \u0432 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438 -_-"}, {"userName": "Mihail", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14580317-mihail", "userReview": "\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e. \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0415\u043b\u043a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441. \u041c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044a\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0448\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0442\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u044a\u043c \u043f\u043e-\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438."}, {"userName": "Brittany (Hiatus-On/Off)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5743835-brittany-hiatus-on-off", "userReview": "To me this one was the funniest in the series! :D Awe. ^^ Next book in the series please!!Full review to come... ;-)"}, {"userName": "Joyzi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1591538-joyzi", "userReview": "5.24.2011OMG Is that a hot shower scene on the cover?YUuuuuuuuMmmmmmEEeeeeeee!!!*I just clicked on the cover to see a closer look of it and I just stared at the computer screen with my mouth hanging open and I think I just drooled a little*Can't wait, can't wait!!!"}], "description": "ASIN: B005ERL4CM updated version found hereLuis Fuentes is a good boy who doesn't live with the angst that his big brothers, Alex and Carlos, have always lived with.
