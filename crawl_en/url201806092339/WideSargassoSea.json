Have you ever considered that she may have a tale to tell? Jean Rhys has, and she tells it to you in all its traumatic colours. Our crazy lunatic isn\u2019t that far from Jane. Bronte describes her as a semi-human, an animal that growls and raves as she stalks the hall of Thornfield like some unidentifiable spectre. But what drove her to this state? What made her this way? Well the simple answer is a man named Rochester. As the second son of a rich family, he needed a means of creating his own wealth. What's the answer to his problem? Marry some rich girl and steal all her money and not worry about the consequences, but there more to it than this. Do you remember that scene in  Jane Eyre where Rochester tries to dominate Jane and make her into something else by picking out her clothes? Perhaps Bertha had this but on a more intense scale. Indeed, Bertha isn\u2019t even her real name. Rhys names the character Antoinette, a name Rochester refuses to use when he learns of her past. Antoinette has a family history of insanity on the maternal side, but, again there is more to it than this. What creates this insanity? For Antoinette it is the simple of act of belonging nowhere. She is a hybrid, a figure that walks between cultures. As a white European girl she was raised in Jamaica; thus, she is neither fully Jamaican nor European. This sounds very similar to the role of the governess, a figure that belonged to no particular class structure. Neither culture would accept Antoinette as one of their own, as she herself recognises: \u201cIt was a song about a white cockroach. That\u2019s me. That\u2019s what they call all of us who were here before their own people in Africa sold them to the slave traders. And I\u2019ve heard English woman call us white niggers. So between you I often wonder who I am and where is my country and where do I belong and why was I ever born at all.\u201d  She is stuck in-between with an uncertain identity, so when this Rochester figure comes along proposing love she is swept away. Could she really be this happy? This man offers her hope and a new life, but it is all a lie. When she finds out it breaks her. The last bastion of refuge shatters and she realises her hate for this false man: she finds yet another place she doesn\u2019t belong. Rochester takes his grief stricken wife home, and shoves her in an attic. Then BOOM! He finds himself utterly shocked at the manifestation of her madness. Such a fool.We cannot blame Bronte for her depiction of Bertha. Bronte wrote during the peak of the British Empire; these ideas were imbedded into her cultural psyche: this is how the Victorians saw the world. Bronte was unconsciously aware of this; she even went as far as to apologise at a later date for her depiction of Bertha. She didn\u2019t fully consider how it would be received. In her fixation with women\u2019s rights in an unjust Western society, she failed to look beyond the realms of the English experience. But that is not to overlook the phenomenal achievements of  Jane Eyre. It does wonders for recognising the voice of women; however, Jean Rhys just goes a little bit further."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "In short - incoherent overpraised rubbish.

Now, I have read Jane Eyre many times, but If I hadn't I would have been clueless as to what Rhys was babbling on about here. For me, this book really demonstrates that the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list really does not mean \"The 1001 Best Books Ever\". And I do appreciate the original idea behind Jean Rhys' novel. The mad woman in Mr Rochester's attic had a story to tell, it has long bothered feminists and other critics how this character was portrayed in Jane Eyre because, at the end of the day, this mad woman was a person with a history - or should have been - not just a little crazy puppet there to pop up and throw a spanner in the works when Jane and Mr Rochester finally got together. Rhys wanted to give her the past that Bronte didn't, and she also wanted to show her decline into madness so the reader could appreciate who she was and where she came from and why she ended up the way she did.I just don't think it was handled very well and I didn't like the writing style at all. The narrative relies upon dream-like visions, fragmented impressions, incomplete sentences, and multiple first-person voices to create an overall sense of disorientation in the reader... or so is the intention according to my little bit of google research. I'd say \"complete bewilderment\" is more accurate than \"disorientation\". I find that I can't appreciate this feeling of being drugged up to my eyeballs when reading a book, though I know many readers look on it favourably. It's more trippy than beautiful to me.Plus, I think the attempts to show how she became mad were a failure. This book appears on lists like \"Novels for Feminists\" and \"100 Books Every Woman Should Read\" - why? When this is a book about a woman who falls into madness because she distrusts her husband and their relationship is falling apart. I appreciate that it isn't feminism if the woman is always strong and never makes mistakes, but she basically crumbles because her husband doesn't give her enough attention. Not very believable, and not very pro-woman either."}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "Probably contains some spoilers  \u201cOur garden was large and beautiful as that garden in the Bible \u2013 the tree of life grew there.

Orchids flourished out of reach or for some reason not to be touched. One was snaky looking, another like an octopus with long thin brown tentacles bare of leaves hanging from a twisted root.\u201d - Jean Rhys, Wide Sargasso Sea I was curious to read this book as it was considered a sort of prequel to Jane Eyre. So I guess this counts as fanfiction? At least it\u2019s very well-written fan fiction!The writing style is of course different from Jane Eyre. The depictions of the Caribbean are beautiful. It\u2019s a relatively short book and it tells the story of Mr. Rochester's first wife, Antoinette Cosway, whom he met in Jamaica. The themes explored in the book are very postcolonialism (discusses the relationships between former slaves and slaveowners after Emancipation), identity (Antoinette is Creole and is therefore not accepted by either the blacks or the whites) and madness.I\u2019ve just finished reading a book about the Suffragette movement that looked into historical accounts of insanity in women. I had no idea that the word \"hysteria\" was first used to describe a supposed mental ailment that women suffered from all because they had a uterus. *sigh* Apart from being frustrated by that piece of pseudoscience, what's also frustrating is the fact that historically a lot of people were unaware that the environment one lives in can make one \"crazy.\" Women in particular, who were often reliant on men and didn\u2019t have their own freedom were obviously more likely to suffer from nervous breakdowns. I\u2019m pretty sure most readers will change their opinion of Rochester after they read this. I will definitely see him in a less than favourable light when I do re-read Jane Eyre."}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "Every once in a while, I stop to think about the neglected characters in various novels who exist only as plot devices. What are their stories? If you saw the novel through their eyes, what would it be like?Therefore, ever since I heard the premise of Jean Rhys's novel, I was eager to read it. Bertha, Mr. Rochester's first wife, must have had a life other than as the \"madwoman in the attic\". I do not know if Charlotte Bronte ever thought about it, but Ms. Rhys obviously did, and this compellingly readable novel is the product.The language is beautifully evocative. I could see the West Indies, even though I have never been there. I could see, hear and smell the tropical countryside (very much like my homeland), at once breathtakingly beautiful, compellingly seductive and strangely frightening-like Antoinette. Especially to the eyes of an Englishman whose green meadows and rolling fields hold no secrets.Yes, the countryside is beautiful... but dangerous, since you can get lost in it. It may suddenly cloud over and start to rain, and you may find yourself in the burnt-out ruins of a country house populated only by ghosts of dead slaves and murdered slave-owners.The characterisation is perfect. Rhys draws each character, including the minor ones, with a few deft brush strokes. Rochester, for all his faults, comes across as sympathetic, a victim of his times and society: the \"evils\" he does are part of his social makeup. And Antoinette is a masterpiece-inseparable from the landscape she inhabits. As we progress through the novel and she slips more and more into madness, the narrative also matches her mental state. In fact, the third part is downright creepy.However, I am still plagued by a niggling doubt... would this novel be effective for someone totally ignorant of Jane Eyre?Oh well...maybe the question is irrelevant."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "[ does he ask Rochester for hush money, when what he's said is apparently common knowledge?

But it takes a life of its own... merging elements of brutal nature and brutal nurture both, to birth a spectacle like one I've never experienced before. Not short of magical, it's baffling how truly impactful these short novels really are. Rhys gives us so much by giving us the absolute least. Leaving the reader naturally to ask for more.

Also, as a stand alone book without referrence to Jane Eyre, I don't think it is a particularly interesting book.The story for me was a bit flat. I didn't fully understand the motivation of the characters. This is a case of having to know a bit of the background of the world at the time the book was released to really get it.

You have to understand, Jane Eyre was my first \"adult\" novel. I was still a tomboy who had only read Enid Blyton's \"The Secret Seven\" when one scorching summer day the torn spine of a seemingly ancient book caught my attention among a few volumes sitting on my Godmother's shelves. I remember that summer as one of the best of my life, and while Jane became my personal heroine and I developed a fervent crush on Mr. Rochester, I discovered an awkward but exhilarating female awareness completely foreign to me. Call me nostalgic, but I didn't want to lose that simple and uncomplicated feelings from my childhood. I should have known better. Doomed Bertha, from fire you come, consumed in fire you will go. Antoinette Cosway is the scapegoat of a decadent, expatriate and exploited society. She neither belongs with the \"whites\" nor the \"niggers\". She is a white cockroach, a white nigger who carries the heavy burden of her slave-owner ancestors during the last remains of the British and French Colonialism in the Caribbean Islands. A neglected child, she blossoms in isolated existence, nurturing a strange communion with the exotic, humid landscape of her home in Coulibri. Prejudice and superstition ignite her dormant sinister tendencies when her mother's house is set on fire by the locals, killing his half-witted brother Pierre and leaving Mr. Mason, her mother's second husband, as her sole protector. A young woman who shies from light and longs for the cool shadows of a convent where she recovers from shock. Her beauty thrives attuned to the hostile and oppressing tropical surroundings. One should never leave lonely alone.  Mrs. Rochester, with her sad, dark alien eyes. And her red dress, as blinding as furious flames but in complete harmony with the  too much red flowers, closes in on her young husband, choking him, disorienting him. Impressionable Edward Fairfax Rochester, the typical Victorian gentleman, overwhelmed with the intensity of these somber, bizarre, damp landscapes with its menacing and reproachful people, can't avoid feeling equally appalled and attracted to his new wife. His cold and possessive masculinity keeps him from acting far from virtuously with his young wife, pressing instead of soothing, demanding instead of empathizing, presumptuous instead of trusting. Clash of cultures, class and race relations, the suffocating subconscious of unknown misdeeds...history makes a victim out of Antoinette. Deranged woman? Or simply a collateral undesired effect of the oppression of colonialism and patriarchal tradition, embodied of course, in Mr. Rochester? Jean Rhys masters the helplessly biased, non reliable, first person narrative form, alternating the voices of both Antoinette and Edward, smothering the reader with her misleading lush tone, hypnotizing him with her exquisite and deeply disturbing style, which builds up imperceptibly towards a suffocating and unavoidable culmination. Antoinette says \nIt is always too late for truth.\nTruth. Such an elusive word. We all seek truth. But which truth? I have found my own truth, better said, I have shaken hands with my long time found but not avowed truth. A truth I already perceived in Mr. Rochester's guilt, in his deceitful ways, in his rough domineering character. He never loved Antoinette, Bertha as he called her in a futile attempt to change her, for she was much of a wild spirit, caught alight, impossible to cage. She didn't have a place in this world, so Mr. Rochester forced her to create her own. And curiously, this new found truth does nothing but enhance my feelings for my childhood hero, this wounded rogue, shinning with all his flaws, who comes more alive today than ever. I should have known better. Rhys' novel stands on its own and it's her subtle and haunting voice that allows us to listen to those who never dared to speak before. I have listened and understood. Have you?I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and its magic and the secret I would never know. I hated its indifference and the cruelty which was part of its loveliness. Above all I hated her. For she belonged to the magic and the loveliness.

Especially in this instance, you are talking about an iconic work, a masterpiece, the gold standard of classic English literature, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. But somehow Jean Rhys pulls it off without too much damage to the original work, and let's face it, Bertha needed to have her story told. Bertha's real name is Antoinette Cosway, and this is her story. A passionate Creole woman who finds herself married to an Englishman, decamped from her Caribbean home to the English countryside, and eventually locked away in the attic of an old English manor and proclaimed insane by her husband.Jean Rhys is an interesting person in her own right. I would think her biography would make for good reading. Unsuccessful most of her life, Wide Sargasso Sea came late in her career, \"too late to make a difference\" she would say. \"If I could live my life over again, and choose......I would rather be happy than write\"."}, {"userName": "Jenn(ifer)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/780933-jenn-ifer", "userReview": "As many of you who read my reviews are aware, I had devoted this summer to exclusively reading female writers, as my reading list was woefully lacking in books written by the fairer sex. It has been an exceptional experience for me as it has opened my eyes to such great writers as Flannery O\u2019Connor, Virginia Woolf, Alice Munro and the incomparable Jean Rhys.Jean Rhys! I feel I owe a debt to the original publishers of Wide Sargasso Sea because if not for its publication her exceptional early work may have remained for ever out of print and I may never have been introduced to Jean. The Jean of Good Morning, Midnight. The Jean of After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie. She is my soul mate (if I believed in that sort of thing). We are kindred spirits.You see, back in the 1930\u2019s, before the second world war when young Jean\u2019s novels were published, they didn\u2019t catch on with the general public. Maybe people just didn\u2019t get her (don\u2019t worry, Jean, I get you). They met with some critical acclaim, but widespread readership was not to be had. So with that, Jean vanished from the literary scene and spent the next twenty years living in relative obscurity. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the 1950\u2019s that she was located and it was discovered that she had been working on the manuscript for Wide Sargasso Sea. With Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean finally received much deserved recognition for her body of work, although with her failing health she often remarked that this recognition came \u2018too late.\u2019So let\u2019s talk about Wide Sargasso Sea. If this had been my introduction to Jean Rhys, I don\u2019t think I would have cared to read the rest of her work. Because, for me, this is not representative of Jean\u2019s writing. I like the idea behind it. To take the frightening lunatic from Jane Eyre and give her a voice, tell her background, tell her story; it\u2019s a remarkable idea. But the execution\u2026 of that I\u2019m not convinced. It was all too heavy handed; it lacked the subtlety of her earlier work. It\u2019s as if Jean put all of the pieces together too neatly for me and didn\u2019t leave any room for me to have my own feelings. I\u2019ll try to explain what I mean by giving you examples of two songs about loss. One is Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u2018Without You\u2019 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bQGRR... and the other is Glen Hansard\u2019s \u2018Leave\u2019 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB4RlK.... Nilsson not only writes with beautiful simplicity, but he doesn\u2019t put it all out there for you; he holds back just enough to keep your interest. He leaves something out, allowing the listener to fill in the blanks. There\u2019s a subtlety to it; like secrets he hasn\u2019t told. Wanting to know the secrets, we listen to that song again and again. That might not make sense yet, but maybe it will after you listen to the Hansard song. Yes, he writes beautifully and yes he makes you feel his loss, but damn, he sucks the air out of the room so there\u2019s nothing left for the rest of us breathe! Stop punching me in the stomach, Glen, I get the point already. Damn. It pains me to write this review. I don\u2019t want Jean tied to Glen Hansard in my memory. I want Nilsson! Thankfully, I saved Quartet for last. For those of you who haven\u2019t read Jean Rhys, or those who don\u2019t feel particularly attached to her early work, you may want to read some of the other reviews that have praised WSS. As for me, my heart is a little bruised today because I\u2019m left with this taste in my mouth after finishing the final pages. It is the taste of mediocrity. But as I said in the beginning, without WSS, Jean would have disappeared into obscurity and who knows if her early body of work would have ever again seen the light of day."}, {"userName": "Rakhi Dalal", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3655942-rakhi-dalal", "userReview": "Oct.11,1964 Sitting in bed.

Very soon she was as eager for what's called loving as I was - more lost and drowned afterwards.\"Forget the Jane Eyre parallel, you don't need it. This book encapsulates the melancholy of evolving times and evolving minds and it measures human decency. Just when one thinks there is some progression towards human decency, money stills morality. And I'm not just alluding to American politics, I'm also referring to Antoinette, the main character who sees her mother taunted and abused because of her mental disorder, only to watch while the same thing happens to her years later. The common denominators? An enviable house and land, skin color, inherited money from a stepfather (even if she was dirt poor before), black nationalistic pride that determines she is a white minority who must be excavated, despondency of blue-collar employees, and so on. Go, her black housekeeper of many years warns her, take your money and leave your husband and he'll be a poor man. But she doesn't listen to her, something about misplaced trust. What's with the complacency and lack of togetherness that drowns women in deeper mire? Do something. It's coincidental that I read this after reading Of Human Bondage, but after watching recent news with tears in my eyes as I had to once again doubt basic human decency, I thought how it must have been fate that linked me with these two works that illustrate life and the oddities of humans and their complexities. I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever color, I hated its beauty and its magic and the secret I would never know. I hated its indifference and the cruelty which was part of its loveliness. Above all I hated her. For she belonged to the magic and the loveliness. She had left me thirsty and all my life would be thirst and longing for what I had lost before I found it. It's hard to sympathize with the Cosways who once owned the slaves who birthed those harassing them, but it is not too difficult to empathize with Antoinette who is a child and innocent partaker to the 1830s Jamaican society wanting to erase the brutality of human ownership and colonization. I'm happy that I've read this work of Jean Rhys, because Good Morning, Midnight was not one of my favorites. The mood of this book is sharpened through terse, yet visceral prose that proceed in a fragmentary haphazard and hallucinatory manner, in order to elucidate the renderings of psychological upheaval. It is an underscoring of generations who refuse to break the pattern of suffering. Antoinette wants to leave, just like her mother before her, and yet she doesn't until she is forced to. She has money, unlike her mother before her, and yet she, a white woman, allows herself to become a slave to the white men around her: her half-brother who turns over her wealth to his best friend, and a husband who uses her and cares nothing for her well-being. In the end, Antoinette is no different than those of Creole descent around her who for years, fought to gain back their basic human rights, including the right to individualism. Yes, there is something brutal, yet self-actualizing about watching history repeat itself. \nAs for my confused impressions they will never be written.

We were catching up after a long time and like most friends do, we picked up our favorite teen (innocent) crimes to gorge on. One of our best memoirs was of those sprints we made to the nearby movie hall to grab the tickets of a show at the penultimate minute of the show time. And we were suddenly overcome by the desire to relive those days. Since I was visiting her city, I let her choose the movie hall and the movie. She quipped that a certain film festival was running at one of the city\u2019s best multiplexes and we could sneak in a show there. We checked the showtimes on their website, chose a show of a well acclaimed, classic movie that was a mere 20 minutes from commencement and yes, sprinted. Upon reaching the multiplex, we somehow managed to get two tickets at the kiosk and were all gung-ho about re-experiencing the teen charms. And that is where all my sprinting took; the finishing line drawn there. The next two hours or so drew different pictures on our faces - On my friend\u2019s face, there was a light glow of joy, a slim smile slipping from either side of her lips, confirming the allure of romance that the lead couple on screen was trying so hard to keep together from falling apart. I turned my head this way and that and found most faces with similar face paint; a dizzying bunch of clones swaying on emotional ripples. Perhaps mine was the only face in the entire hall that bore a different countenance; the couple\u2019s sensuality seemed an act which effectively muted any adrenaline rush and my face color remained the same; their differences, although meaningful, seemed imbued in sepia tones, putting a distant feel to the struggles brought therein and my eyes didn\u2019t look strained to go behind the camera and touch the personal efforts; their conversations sounded jarred, as if one had break-opened a room swamped by flood but the cacophony emanating from multiple complainants, all at once, sapped the savior of his compassion. I managed to sat through the movie hoping the climax might redeem the work which I was supposed to like. But alas! it was not to be and I exited the hall with a sad heart. Once out, my friend, with a quivering happy voice and bouncy eyebrows, asked me what I felt about the movie. I sheepishly ended up saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t understand most of its subtle meaning.

The slave trade and its profits are behind much of the nouveaux riches of the eighteenth century and their country houses; especially in the west of England and around the port cities of Bristol and Liverpool. The novel addresses the aftermath of the end of slavery and juxtaposes another sort of slavery; marriage. The link is an obvious one; the marriage is arranged by Antoinette\u2019s family with Rochester, not with her consent. She is treated as property and her name is changed; there is little to distinguish her condition from slavery. Rhys does manage to capture the breathless heat and sense of decay and disintegration very well. The political point that slavery was not replaced with a racial, political and gender independence. Rhys pretty much throws everything into the mix; race, class gender and mental health. Of course the symbolism of the Sargasso Sea and all the myths surrounding it is significant; on the surface marriage offers Antoinette many opportunities, in reality the waters are treacherous.The juxtaposition of the Byronic hero Rochester in Jane Eyre and the same man as callous villain here is a sharp one. Part of the strength of the book is giving a marginalised character voice. As Rhys herself said; \u201cShe seemed such a poor ghost, I thought I'd like to write her a life\u201d. The problem now is that I read Jane Eyre forty years ago (that makes me feel very old) and I need to read it again. The changing narrative voices can be a little confusing and though I think I prefer Rhys\u2019s early stuff is better, but this is an important adjunct to Eurocentric nineteenth century novels."}, {"userName": "Caroline ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline", "userReview": "[could have been avoided had Rochester shown her more love and adoration (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "Love\u2019s Fierce Play\"Wide Sargasso Sea\" is both a \nparallel novel\n with respect to \"Jane Eyre\" and a novel that could stand alone, if read with no knowledge of the connection. It explores the Caribbean background of the marriage of [Bertha] Antoinette Mason to an unnamed Englishman (presumably Edward Rochester) and their return to England, where she is confined to a room in a \"great house\" (or is it made, as she believes, of cardboard?). Antoinette is a Creole, her origins being half-English and half-Martinique, but she is described as both white and beautiful. The title of the novel isn\u2019t overtly explained. However, it\u2019s possible that, because the Sea is located between the West Indies (on the west) and Africa/Europe (on the east), it represents \nthe gulf between the \"civilized\" world of England and its West Indian colony.\n There is an equal gulf between Creoles and the race of each parent. They are accepted by neither race. Antoinette is regarded as a \"white cockroach\". This social status as well as a head injury during her youth contribute to Antoinette\u2019s ostensibly unsettled mental state at the time of her marriage. There are rumours of mental illness in her family (\"Look the crazy girl, you crazy like your mother\"; \"a raging lunatic and worse besides\"), although it\u2019s arguable that there is no underlying physical cause of her state, apart from the social tensions which confront her locally, in her marriage and in England. The geographical environment in which she lives is tropical and idyllic. It provides such simple pleasures for the inhabitants. Colours and scents are vivid: the blue-green of the water, the orange, red and green of mangoes; the scent of frangipanis, cloves, cinnamon, roses, lime trees and orange blossoms. Her husband promises her \npeace, happiness, safety\n (the same things Marya sought in the earlier Parisian novel, \"Quartet\"), but they are empty promises. For him, the marriage is little more than a marriage of convenience, designed to smooth over a rivalry over his own family\u2019s estate and to find a home for Antoinette\u2019s substantial wealth. Rochester never really relates to the West Indies. At first, he acknowledges its beauty: \"It was a beautiful place \u2013 wild, untouched, above all untouched, with an alien, disturbing, secret loveliness. And it kept its secret. I\u2019d find myself thinking, what I see is nothing \u2013 I want what it hides \u2013 that is not nothing.\" Its true appeal is not apparent to Western eyes. They look at it in purely financial terms: \"Gold is the idol they worship.\" Soon, he views the forest as hostile, even thinking in terms of \"enemy trees\". Colonialism has acquired something it doesn\u2019t know how to deal with, just as, in marrying Antoinette, Rochester has started something he can\u2019t finish. \nHe defiles its and her beauty:\n \"I broke a spray off [the orchid] and trampled it into the mud. This brought me to my senses.\" While the colonial message is front and centre, so is a feminist message: \n\"Woman must have spunks to live in this wicked world.\"\n Antoinette remains a stranger to Rochester, all the more so, because she comes from a strange land: \"I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and its magic and the secret I would never know. I hated its indifference and the cruelty which was part of its loveliness. Above all I hated her. For she belonged to the magic and loveliness.\" Soon, she is equally discontented with life in her homeland: \"We were alone in the most beautiful place in the world.\" She hopes that things will improve in England, where she imagines \"chandeliers and dancing, swans and roses and snow.\" Only there, Rochester continues to scorn her \"blank hating moonstruck face.\" Like the Paris of \"Quartet\", her English caretaker, Grace Poole, recognises that \n\"the world outside...can be a black and cruel world to a woman...\n[That girl] lives in her own darkness...she hasn\u2019t lost her spirit. She\u2019s still fierce.\" Still, Antoinette can see that they have lost their way on the \"way to England.\" Something vital, love perhaps, mutual respect, if it ever existed, failed to survive the crossing of the wide Sargasso Sea.http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/20...Joanna Walsh's illustration for Chloe Pantazi's blog on Jean Rhys in the Paris Review.

languid, stifling, and claustrophobic. It is not surprising that people go insane here, what is surprising is that anyone is able to keep their sanity. In this world of mysticism, racial mixtures and moving boundaries, is born the tragedy that becomes the catalyst to one of the greatest love stories of all time. But that is after, this story belongs, not to the governess, but to the wife.Antoinette Cosway is a girl who is pressed beyond her limits. Subject to her environment and her mother\u2019s precarious hold on her own wits, Antoinette is destined to be a mix of all that is fragile and all that is fierce. She battles, and narrowly wins, until she is sold into marriage to her unlucky bridegroom. His lack of understanding of who she is, and her unconventional worship of him, take her beyond the limits of her abilities to cope, and plunges her into a darkness that is frightful.There is a mix of voodoo, mystery and madness in this novel that is riveting. You pray for help and hope for this poor girl, and yet you know it is not coming, for you know her end before you even begin her story. You have glimpsed her before, almost without pity, but in Rhys\u2019 hands you find the pity and it is all encompassing. Short and sweet and fantastic. One hundred and ninety pages of power. A must-read."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "How do we as mere humans define the term \u201cmadness\u201d or even know what madness is as defined in everyday society? Does it take an external factor such as the case of a gunman who \u201carbitrarily\u201d goes into a classroom and shoots innocent children; a person who robs someone and decides to stab or strangle him/her as the choice may be, or is it purely an internal \u201cgenetic illness\u201d that gradually erodes into the psyche of a person hurtling him/her down a path from which there is no return, towards destruction and the ultimate suicide?So when I found out that Jean Rhys based her novella \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d on Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d from the mad woman\u2019s (Bertha\u2019s) perspective and not Jane\u2019s, I began to wonder if I should reread Jane Eyre as I haven\u2019t read it for over twenty years. I\u2019ve seen TV films, etc. but then these are not always faithful to the book. Also the thought kept running through my mind as to whether madness is within all of us and that it only takes some supposedly minor event in which to set it off.In a way, I\u2019ve found myself in a parallel situation here with these two books but decided it was best to view this book as a separate entity even though the Creole heiress, Antoinette Cosway (Bertha Mason) was married to the English gentleman, although unnamed throughout the book, \u201cMr Rochester\u201d. Her mother Annette, who became mad, was based on Bertha\u2019s mother who was also in the same situation. Difficult to thrust the other book from my mind, as there are so many similarities between the two, but I hope I succeed.The story is based in Spanish Town, Jamaica in 1836, three years after the Emancipation Act abolishing slavery came into effect, finds a country where emotions are running high. Antoinette is caught in the cross-fire between the English who are trying to retain the island towards the end of British colonialism in the Caribbean, even though France still maintained a strong presence in Martinique. Also the black population, even though the island has mixed races, doesn\u2019t seem to approve of individuals such as Antoinette and her mother Annette, who is from the French colony, Martinique, as is the servant Christophine, a Catholic who dresses very differently to the other servants, practices \u201cobeah\u201d and can supposedly do magical but evil things.There are just so many themes running through this book but to me the main ones are: colours, madness, genetics, the backdrop with slavery being abolished and the end of colonialism for the British.With colours, red is predominant throughout, starting with the fire at the Coulibri Estate where Annette, her family and her new husband Mr Mason live. He just never settled in with the \u201clocals\u201d and with tensions running high, the house is burned down with disastrous consequences, one being the resultant madness of Annette.Another case of red is Antoinette\u2019s red dress, which has to remain with her regardless as it contained so many memories for her:\u201cThe scent that came from the dress was very faint at first, then it grew stronger. The smell of vetiver and frangipani, of cinnamon and dust and lime trees when they are flowering. The smell of the sun and the smell of the rain\u201d.These are all the happy parts of her life before her marriage to Mr Rochester, who takes her to England and imprisons her at Thornfield Hall. Yes, it was the same red dress that sets her on her inevitable journey and destiny with the subsequent fire.When Antoinette and her husband go for their honeymoon on Dominica, to the Granbois estate. Mr Rochester comments on the flowers as having too much red, and \u201cEverything is too much (for him), I felt as I rode wearily after her. Too much blue, too much purple, too much green.\u201dBut this was so important for Antoinette as this was her haven, her life, and by being forced into marriage by her step-father (with the added enticement for the husband-to-be of \u00a330,000), she is being dragged unwillingly away from it. I guess inwardly she rebelled especially with the continuing deterioration in her marriage even at this early stage.The colour green is shown with the sad incident with Coco, the green parrot when the house is burning down and the menacing crowds are shouting outside the house, as Mr Mason began to pray. \u201cMay Almighty God defend us\u201d. And God did indeed prove to be \u201cindeed mysterious\u201d because suddenly the yells stopped:\u201cI opened my eyes, everybody was looking up and pointing at Coco on the glacis railings with his feathers alight. He made an effort to fly down but his clipped wings (due to Mr Mason unfortunately cutting them) failed him and he fell screeching. He was all on fire.\u201dThe apparent madness of Antoinette I believe started (although genetically it was obviously there on her mother\u2019s side) when her mother married Mr Mason; also the fire on the Coulibri Estate thus seeing how her mother was dramatically affected, and which was further exacerbated by Antoinette\u2019s own marriage. And in fact even her husband when he was writing to his father, is concerned about the marriage at this early stage whilst on honeymoon, in that he found something strange about \u201cher eyes\u201d; finally the evil gossip implying her madness, made worse by the letter he received from Daniel Cosway.There is just so much to talk about and admire in this exquisite book but I don\u2019t want to \u201cgo into full flight\u201d. All I can say is I absolutely loved it and have thought about it for several days. It is definitely one of my favourites."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45870338-claudia", "userReview": "4,5 Sterne.Zauber und Wahnsinn der Karibik\"Jeden Tag beobachteten wir den Sonnenuntergang von dem strohgedeckten Pavillon aus. Wir beobachteten den Himmel und das ferne, in Flammen stehende Meer - alle Farben waren in diesem Feuer enthalten, und die m\u00e4chtigen Wolken waren von Flammen umrandet und durchschossen. Ich wartete auf den Duft der Blumen aum Fluss - sie \u00f6ffneten sich, wenn die Dunkelheit hereinbrach, und sie brach schnell herein. Keine Nacht oder Dunkelheit, wie ich sie kannte, sondern Nacht voller glei\u00dfender Sterne, voller fremder Ger\u00e4usche.\"Jamaica, Anfang des 19. Jhd., es ist eine Zeit des Umbruchs. In einem alten Herrenhaus w\u00e4chst Antoinette Cosway zwischen zwei Welten heran. Auf der einen Seite die schwarzen Dienstboten mit ihren Liedern und Ritualen, auf der anderen Seite die wei\u00dfen Plantagenbesitzer. Die Sklaverei wurde gerade abgeschafft und die schwarze Bev\u00f6lkerung begehrt erstmals gegen die ehemaligen Herren auf.Es kommt zu gef\u00e4rlichen Situationen. Das Herrenhaus wird angez\u00fcndet, Antoinette flieht mit ihrer Mutter und dem Stiefvater Mr. Mason.Die Mutter verkraftet die ganzen Aufregungen nicht, da auch Antoinettes kleiner behinderter Bruder bei diesem Brand um's Leben kommt. Sie wird geistig verwirrt in eine Nervenheilanstalt eingewiesen.Jetzt ist Antoinette ganz auf diesen Mason angewiesen. Er fackelt nicht lange und steckt sie ein Nonnenkloster. Nach Verlassen des Klosters wird durch ihren Stiefvater eine Ehe mit einem mittellosen Engl\u00e4nder arrangiert. Mit dieser Heirat geht Antoinettes Verm\u00f6gen an diesen Mr. Rochester, der somit keine finanziellen Sorgen mehr hat. Anfangs ist Rochester durchaus von seiner sch\u00f6nen Ehefrau und der bl\u00fchenden Inselwelt fasziniert, was aber sehr bald in \u00dcberdruss umschl\u00e4gt. Er beginnt seine Frau und die prachtvolle, alles beherrschende Natur zu hassen.\"Alles war sehr grell und bunt, sehr seltsam, bedeutete mir jedoch nichts. Genauso wenig wie sie, das M\u00e4dchen, das ich heiraten sollte. Als ich sie schlie\u00dflich kennenlernte, verbeugte ich mich, l\u00e4chelte, k\u00fcsste ihre Hand, tanzte mit ihr. Ich spielte die Rolle, die von mir erwartet wurde. Sie hatte nicht das Geringste mit mir zu tun. Jede meiner Handlungen war eine Willensanstrengung und ich wunderte mich, dass niemand es bemerkte.

Or a lie...\"Yesterday I reread Wide Sargasso Sea, the last in my \"Jean Rhys The Complete Novels\" book. I read it the first time when I was in my early twenties (twenty-one, two at the latest), and when it came time to rate it, years down the timeline on goodreads, I planted a lukewarm three star kiss and patted its butt to move along for other books I halfheartedly remembered. It would take too long to lay out my theories on age and memory and \"losing\" books in this review. Some books I \"count\" and others I don't because I remember fuck all about them (this goes for books I read in 2009). I had been unsure if I really did remember Wide Sargasso Sea when I was loving the hell out of Rhys's first three novels. It's possible I was wrong, grew up, blah blah. My tastes change a lot, etc. It would really take too long to roll out those carpets in one review. If you've read any of my other reviews you might know that there is one thing that I value more than anything else: being trusted to put it all together myself. I need room to breathe! Between the lines spaces and the complications that anything could go on another way, if any little bit of chance was left to other chances. Please, don't just tell me what the hell it is all about. I only come to life in a book that is breathable. I want to know the people like I could really be there myself. I felt like I found one of my kindred spirits in Jean Rhys when I read Voyage in the Dark and Quartet (and to a lesser extent After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie). Then she has to go all first person perspective in Good Morning, Midnight and Wide Sargasso Sea and lose everything that had meant so much to me. Nooooooo!So my three stars remain and the twisted feeling in my stomach is back. Three stars of that could have been special. Three stars to say I'm a bit pissed off and disappointed. Three stars like when I give my favorite Kawabata three stars. It's still an experience.I can see why Rhys had thought about Bertha, Mr. Rochester's mad in the bed, head and loins first wife of Jane Eyre. She's helpless too all earthly resources. A haunting figure for being ignored on her own account. I don't think it was the right decision to write about her for this story, though. It was tragic what happened to her and I never would have thought to look at her husband for who to blame what ultimately happened to her. She could have ended up much worse. Asylums, especially for women, were horrific places. These are not the same men in Rhys and Bronte's novels. In Wide Sargasso Sea Mr. Rochester is a grasping and patronizing rich man, not capable of being seen on his own accord, here. I'm confused why he had to take everything away from her, even her name. Did Rhys really take this away from Jane Eyre? I read a complicated man. A live one, guilty and conflicted who takes what he can get out of life same as anyone else. But not a bad man (he keeps the daughter of his mistress from another man in his own family home!). That's why Jane Eyre is such a wonderful book.Antoinette isn't different for all that she cannot be understood by an unwilling man. I wish that that had not been the point of this. She too wants to hold the wildness of the island (near Jamaica) and its people in her hands. Her fingers would all be green and they would let themselves be tilled by her into a secret English garden by herself. She wouldn't call it an English garden. She would say that it was a tropical jungle paradise and she was a song bird the same as them. If there was a sense of bars she would rail against the big bad key holder. Sing loud, swinging cage. I was really bothered by the \"them\" about the black people. I was really bothered by the \"white nigger\". I've always hated to hear \"white trash\" bandied about, like people were kinds of trash and it meant anything. Time and place, this is it? Antoinette could be one of those girls from my school who called kid me a racist for being pale and bragged about sleeping with an edgy black boy. Mr. Rochester could never understand them as she could! If Antoinette couldn't sit by her mother's bed for hours as she brushed her hair and waited to be consumed off by another man. If Antoinette couldn't wait for the only in the dark sex for herself. If Antoinette couldn't be told what she was by people she couldn't figure out didn't have the answers any more than she did. It's like when a poor person eats all that they have in one bite, knowing there won't be another. No diets, no saving for later, dessert first. You spend all of the money you get anyway and tomorrow does come. New ways of living, watch their chests move up and down.It's a cheat to cut to time and have Antoinette \"know\" that they didn't have the answers she was looking for. It's a cheat to have them just SAY that they know something.I have a bad feeling about Wide Sargasso Sea that it's a patronizing revenge novel about an evil man who crushed the spirit of a helpless woman. I want a real woman, not a victim. Who was Antoinette other than wanting to be a \"one of them\"? Just like in Good Morning, Midnight the time skips on and on like \"What are you complaining about? I just told you what happened\". I felt the speed bumps. But you didn't! You just told me what happened. I didn't get to see it for myself. Substitute the we're so deep because we're poor Bohemian French people scenesters with we're so deep because we HAVE to live with the land poor island people in the eyes of the two women who would belong if only they could feel that they did. No one is going to say, \"It's okay, you're one of us.\"What happened to the Jean Rhys who understood that people feed from all around them? Why did she have to steal Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre and give him the boot to squash the (apparently) white roach who scurries when the day light of day to day life comes on? I don't think it is really anyone else's fault if someone doesn't get to do what they want to do ALL OF THE TIME. Maybe Jane Eyre the novel represented England to Rhys (hold yourself up. Jane did not get her power from stealing it. She is so unlike the \"English\" people who look distant and safe, held up on visible strings of position) but was the island really all that different? They all needed money. No money, no happy. Freedom in one bite doesn't last and maybe it only looks like freedom to the person too afraid to take the whole bite. I know about the \"what the hell\" and doing it anyway. Tomorrow does come. What's the point in revenge on anyone else, anyway? It feels like a lie to blame anyone. If you're going to have your secret world just for yourself in your own head and heart then you can't blame anyone else for having theirs.It is Jean Rhys so there were good moments. I believed that Antoinette wanted to switch places with the distant and safe like a hurricane Tia, the girl who stole her dress and could not take her place (Tia probably did have a worse position, no matter what Rhys insists about it being worse to fall down the societal totem poll). Until I was pissed off by the double standard of how Mr. Rochester viewed what HE couldn't take. But it is Jean Rhys so I expect a hell of a lot better than short cuts. Don't tell me that the moral of the story is a man who wants everything. (Lordy, Jane Eyre was definitely NOT that book). Did anyone really read that book and take from it that Bertha was drugged and THAT'S why she couldn't leave her bed (other than some homicidal sleepwalking)?Why couldn't this have been a story about a woman who blazes it to the skies that she's carefree want, want, want and then oh so distraught when the local poor folk don't let her into their barefoot dance party on the ship before it sinks? That it hurts to not make a decision too? Sometimes the waiting room void is worse than what's the hell you imagine on the other side.I want to tell Rhys that she was a great writer and shouldn't have been so angry at men who couldn't give her everything that she wrote this and Good Morning, Midnight. Can this be what loneliness feels like? It seems to me that the tragedy is losing your mind, as Bertha in Jane Eyre did. If you can't put anything together, even know what the parts are. True loneliness because there are no other spirits that have anything in common with you. Rhys said that she identified with Bertha when she read Jane Eyre. Would you identify with someone who couldn't speak and then say that the tragedy is that they were unheard? Then would you speak for them to blame instead of connecting? Her screams would accuse if there were a God. What I got out of Antoinette was someone who wanted to speak for the jungle, with no resources to hear it, other than dreams. Why not the dreams, then? There was more than one kind of loneliness, more than one kind of void unfilled (going unfucked in the end was the least of her problems!).I've started reading from two different Jean Rhys short story collections. I find the first person stories the most unreadable in the way that I like to read things. It really would be a tragedy to lose that sensory of life. To be able to sit there and watch people and maybe none of it would make sense until other stuff happens and you can start to form a background. I wonder why Rhys couldn't resist saying what she wanted to say this way, instead of painting the room with the sky and walls with pictures on the walls and people standing too close or not close enough and ugly rugs and dying plants and too hot air and breath when it's cold. All the things that add up to she doesn't want to be here and in five minutes he'll wish he was somewhere else. It's not taking the secret away like she says in Wide Sargasso Sea. It's giving a damn to consider that there is more behind everyone else's walls than just what they want you to think there is. It's the closest I'll ever get to \"It's okay, you're one of us\" because none of us know everything and we all wonder about an awful lot.The Masters of Photography page has some of Brassai's photographs. The Brassai picture for Wide Sargasso Sea is \"Seaside\". I hate to say that I've seen enough (I'll never get tired of them) seasides in my own life to impose over any feeling of this one. This sea is in black white and I can't tell if it's placid or anything is under the surface. Does a storm loom? No one else is staring at it, that I can tell.My head has been hurting all day so I am not sure if I'm saying all of this right. I got a pretty damned condescending tone out of Rhys from this one. That's what I know. I probably did back when I was young, too. (It could be too concious for me. I have since literary criticism on this and that's just stuff I don't care about too much? It's always just my opinion, anyway.)My bookmark that I used to divide between books in this five book collection was a losing scratch off lottery card. I am not a scratch off card kind of person so I can't say where I got this one. Maybe I wasted two dollars on it in some pipe dream fitful moment. It does make for a pretty fitting bookmark for these books, though.P.s. I'm sad that Jean Rhys only became famous because of Wide Sargasso Sea, her weakest novel, in my humble opinion. (Yeah, right. I trust my feelings if I don't trust myself on facts of what I can't remember.) So unfair!"}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "Jean Rhys, a Creole woman from Dominica, writes back to the racist and ableist strand in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, which painted a woman with the same background as Rhys as a monstrous lunatic, locked away on the third floor of the house. Rhys tells the story of this character from childhood, seeking the roots of her tragedy.This melancholic, shadowy, evocative, power-shifting book, elegantly and beautifully written, is a much needed reproof to a literary tradition which has presumed to speak for, and affected the marginalisation of non-European and especially colonized people. Antoinette's experience as a woman is painful and limited due to the patriarchal norms in her own country, but in moving to England where her brown body and her behaviour are Other and unacceptable she is stripped of even more power and control over her circumstances and her body, even losing her name.The description has extraordinary clarity, particularly when the island's flora and fauna intrude into human spaces. The mixture of unvarnished realism and sharply focused description of certain signifying details has an evocative and often viscerally uncomfortable effect. While she brings Antoinette's lost voice into a literary dialogue, Rhys also speaks in her own; her style of conflicts and contrasts expresses her willed resistance to colonial forms and the European tradition."}, {"userName": "TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2634423-thegirlbytheseaofcortez", "userReview": "I loved Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre, but the character in that book I was most interested in wasn\u2019t Jane, it was Mr. Rochester\u2019s \u201cmad wife in the attic,\u201d Bertha. I felt sorry for Bertha. I didn\u2019t feel she was treated right. I also wanted to know more about her. I was fascinated by Bertha. I wanted to know where she came from and what it was that drove her mad. In Jane Eyre, Bertha is a raving lunatic, almost inhuman. But something had to drive this poor woman insane. Surely Rochester didn\u2019t marry her in that state. But what could it have been? I always wondered. Of course, in Jane Eyre, Bertha functions more as a plot device, something to get Jane to run away from Thornfield Hall and Rochester, and later, to bring closure to the story. But I think any character deserves a little more humanity than that. If you felt the way I do, then Jean Rhys\u2019 classic, Wide Sargasso Sea, is the book for you.Wide Sargasso Sea is set in the colorful and exotic Jamaica of the 1830s and revolves around the early life of Creole heiress, Antoinette Cosway, the woman destined to become Rochester\u2019s mad wife, Bertha. The story is told in three parts, though Part Three is very, very short.In Part One of Wide Sargasso Sea, we follow Antoinette in the exotic, but oppressive, colonialist society of Jamaica as she flees the decaying plantation that was her home for Aunt Cora\u2019s house, then, when Aunt Cora goes to England, to a convent school.While Part One was told exclusively from Antoinette\u2019s point of view, Part Two, which is a much longer section, is told primarily from the point of view of a very young Mr. Rochester, though he is never named, adding to his mystery. (In this book, Mr. Rochester is the mysterious character, and we get to know his beautiful wife.) Mr. Rochester is clearly in love with the young, beautiful Antoinette, but when disturbing rumors reach him regarding Antoinette\u2019s past, Rochester begins to believe those rumors might carry more than a bit of truth, especially when some of them are confirmed by Antoinette, herself, and she begins to display some of the madness that we first saw in Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre. (This isn\u2019t a spoiler, if you\u2019ve read Jane Eyre, you know Rochester\u2019s wife is mad.)Jean Rhys, herself, was more like Antoinette than Jane. Rhys was Creole and not given to Jane Eyre\u2019s rigid self-discipline. In Antoinette, Rhys created a character she, herself could identify with, a character who was driven almost totally by emotion, a character who would be subject to bouts of irrationality, spontaneity, and mental breakdown, and who would, despite all this, always be immensely sympathetic because, after all, we understand why Antoinette is the way she is. To bring about this sympathy, Rhys makes us privy to Antoinette\u2019s tumultuous childhood and a time when she was rejected by those she loved over and over again.While Rochester is definitely a hero in Jane Eyre, he\u2019s more villain than not in Wide Sargasso Sea. He clings to his rigid Victorian upbringing even as he fears it, an upbringing that forces him to separate love and sex. When he\u2019s \u201cin love\u201d with his young bride, he can\u2019t feel desire for her, and when he feels desire for her, he can\u2019t feel love. (We have to wonder how Jane fared as his wife.) And in the end, for Antoinette, at least, it\u2019s desire that wins out.Wide Sargasso Sea is filled with lush imagery, exotic imagery to a man like Rochester who has come to expect the misty skies and the heath of Yorkshire, which are dull by comparison. In the Caribbean of Jean Rhys, everything seems to be constantly in bloom, constantly changing, fluid, alive, and colorful. While Antoinette glories in the heat and the color, Rochester is disturbed by it. \u201cEverything is too much,\u201d he says, \u201ctoo much blue, too much purple, too much green.\u201d And if the vivid colors aren\u2019t enough, there are the strange people \u2013 Christophine and Am\u00e9lie \u2013 and their strange rituals and practices. It\u2019s all so heady and disorienting that we can almost forgive Rochester his faults. Almost, but not quite.The book is filled with symbolism. Every major occurrence, and many minor ones as well, are echoes of another incident that took place in either Jane Eyre or earlier in Wide Sargasso Sea. And it is often through this symbolism, rather than through the narrative, itself, that the book\u2019s true meaning emerges. The prose is hypnotic, almost like a drumbeat in a hot, tropical night. Joyce Carol Oates has suggested that Wide Sargasso Sea, with its dense and elliptical language, is more \u201challucinatory prose poem\u201d than it is novel.As we read, we come to believe that Antoinette\u2019s fate \u2013 to be driven mad \u2013 might just be inevitable. Indeed, Antoinette, herself seems to think so. \u201cI would make no effort to save myself,\u201d she says, \u201cif anyone were to try and save me, I would refuse. This must happen.\u201d And Rhys seems to agree with her. Her mother, after all, was driven mad by the death of her son, Antoinette\u2019s younger brother. Antoinette\u2019s name is so similar to her mother\u2019s name of Annette; physically, the two are so much alike, and Jane Eyre has already been written, seemingly sealing Antoinette\u2019s fate.Yet in Wide Sargasso Sea, we learn that Antoinette\u2019s tragic fate need not have been. As she\u2019s waiting with her new husband to leave the honeymoon house that was anything but happy, Rochester thinks, \u201cIf she...weeps, I\u2019ll take her in my arms.\u201d And Antoinette wants to weep, but she\u2019s been warned that tears will have no effect, so she holds them back. Rochester, Victorian to the core, cannot tell his wife what it is he wants and needs. We turn pages, hoping against hope that these two will run into each other\u2019s arms and make their true feelings known.Readers must look to Jane Eyre to find Antoinette\u2019s ultimate fate, though Jean Rhys has said that she imagined it as \u201ctriumphant.\u201d I didn\u2019t see it that way. I saw it as tragedy heaped upon tragedy, for even in death, Antoinette doesn\u2019t exact revenge on her cruel husband, but drives him into the arms of another, instead. Antoinette might dream a triumphant and glorious jump from the towers of Thornfield Hall, but Bertha smashes to the ground, with no one to mourn her.Jane Eyre doesn\u2019t dictate everything, however. With Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean Rhys has changed the way readers look at Jane Eyre. Readers of Wide Sargasso Sea will not be able to easily dismiss Antoinette/Bertha even as they root for Jane. Rhys has freed Antoinette to live in ways she has never been free to live before.There are those who have dismissed Wide Sargasso Sea as a feminist attempt to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d in Jane Eyre. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the well-researched and courageous story of a character who has been far too little known, and far too much forgotten. \u201cThere\u2019s always another side,\u201d Antoinette tells her husband, and so, we learn, there is. It behooves us not to make a judgment until we\u2019ve heard both of them.5/5Recommended: Yes, especially if you liked Jane EyreL or want to know more about Bertha, the \u201cmadwoman in the attic.\u201d Even if you haven\u2019t read Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea is a wonderful book about the clash of the wild and the exotic with the more mundane. It\u2019s a wonderful character study of a willful woman\u2019s descent into madness.
