When the Nazis entered Paris, Dr. Sumner was the chief surgeon, he stayed when most of the other doctors resigned, leaving Paris. He and his wife, Toquette joined the French resistance and aided many in information and helping other get to safety.I felt emotionally drained after reading this book. Reading about the Nazis actions in the four years they were in charge of Paris was horrific. The tension, wondering how long these wonderful people could escape detection while living right in the middle of the Nazi elite. What would happen to them if caught? They were not Jewish but they were collaborators and political enemies. I also never knew that when liberation was close, the Nazis herded prisoners onto prison ships. So a hard read as most of these holocaust book are, but so glad people who had received little recognition were afforded some at the end. The book carries all the way to the war criminal trials were Summers son, who was only sixteen when his childhood abruptly ended, testifies. His son was also instrumental in the writing of this book.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": " Charlie - A Reading Machine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12357261-charlie---a-reading-machine", "userReview": "A real joy to read and a complete immersion into Nazi occupied Paris.

I feel as though I was transported to Paris, to Avenue Foch from the beginning of the German Occupation and stayed until the liberation-though in reality, it was only a two day stay. From the second I began to peruse the first page as I usually do when I get a new book, I could hardly put this down. Avenue Of Spies by Alex Kershaw has it all: guts and glory, horror, bravery, cowardice, greed, atrocity and heartbreak all with a backdrop of love, kindness and most of all, bravery.Alex Kershaw's writing style is spectacularly simple but gives the reader an acute understanding of what is happening which is rare when I read history, and is a sure sign of a good writer-I have read quite a few books about WWII this year, and this book by far is my favorite-but it's not even the history that is riveting in the pages of this book-it's the story of heroes. In this tale, Kershaw recreates the German Occupation in the City Of Lights. His subject is an American, Dr. Sumner Jackson, who lived on the posh Avenue Foch with his wife, Toquette, and their boy, Phillip. Dr. Sumner was the head doctor at the American Hospital in Paris and if that wasn't enough, he chose to help in the resistance against the Nazis as did Toquette and Phillip. Even when they could have gotten out, they stayed. Even when things got perilously close in danger they didn't leave-when the noose began to tighten on Foch Avenue and they were surrounded by the enemy, they stood firm.This book is inspirational. It could change a life. It could inspire you, dear reader, to be bigger than yourself. With the example of the human beings in the pages of this book, you could be bigger and better than ever and aspire to do good things. This is no mere history book, though the history is appallingly real, this book is more about humans at their best and their worst. This story is about real people who faced an empire and did not back down though most did. The hunger, the horror, the power the Nazis held over France was impressively strong and Paris fell with a whimper due in part by what had happened in Poland, but in the background there were people such as Sumner, his wife, Louise Marie Dissard, Violette Szabo, British Intelligence and other forces who where chipping away at the regime with the very real cost of being caught and murdered. The Gestapo and the SS had sinister ways in which to capture those in the resistance, such as the Funkspiel, where the Germans would impersonate a British spy after taking control of a their radio. In this way, and others, they were able to crack into the line of resistance fighters and gain valuable information. It was a cat and mouse game on Foch Street and the Sumners never knew when someone would turn them in or confess information after being tortured. Parisians left and right were either working for the Germans or had befriended them.So, if you want to read a really great book-pick this one. This is an incredibly great story. I can't recommend it more. I was literally stuck to this book for two days and while I wasn't reading it, I was talking about it.I would also suggest the Notes in the back of the book for further information and reading. I also see that Alex Kershaw has written several other books and I intend to get them. This is my great book alert for you. There is no way you would be disappointed reading about great heroes in the midst of terrifying danger in the most beautiful city in the world during one of the ugliest wars in history."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3549517-cynthia-dunn", "userReview": "I continue to read Holocaust and Nazi history because I keep wanting to be reminded and never to forget how brutal men can be to their fellow men.

It mostly dealt with one family (a husband, wife and their young son) who lived on Avenue Foch which just happened to be one of the richest streets of Paris during the second World War.The father was a doctor who was instrumental in getting a lot of people out of Paris and into ally countries. His wife was instrumental in getting involved with the resistance.Of course, there were other players in the book but these were the main ones. The story starts before Germany captures Paris and ends when Germany falls. It gives a total insight as to the inner working of the Third Reich and how some of the officers were not exactly playing by the book. I've read books that talk about the Germans coming in and taking over Paris and how they would act. But this book tells exactly what was going on behind the scenes and it gives a clearer picture about the train rides and the camps.

His family becomes part of the Resistance, and actually lives on the same street that the Nazis decide to set up their headquarters, Avenue Foch. This book was just an amazing inspirational story.

But this is a very special story, one of an incredibly heroic doctor and his family.Dr. Sumnar Jackson was working in Paris in the 1930\u2019s. He was a part of a group of Americans who had volunteered for the British Medical Corp. While there he met and fell in love with a Swiss nurse who was working with the French. He married Charlotte and they returned to the States.In 1940 Toquette and Philip moved back to Paris, he was then head of the ANH and they had begun treating fallen soldiers once the Germans attacked France. They lived on the Avenue Foch, one of the most affluent streets in Paris. When Paris fell, many of the houses were vacated, some belonged to Jewish families and others were just \u201cappropriated\u201d by the Gestapo. They set up one of these houses as a torture center. The Jacksons are able to live alongside them and hide British and American pilots who were shot down.This story is real, the author had personal testimony to support the life story of Dr. Jackson, including the personal recollections of the doctor\u2019s son. The family had triumphed in it\u2019s efforts to help the resistance and was said to be willing to do it all over again.Many of the atrocities written about in this book have been documented before, the round up in early 1944 of citizens of the allied nations, the sadistic acts of the Nazis, how many people were imprisoned and executed.The writing style didn\u2019t seem to flow for me.

Sumner Jackson was a surgeon from Maine who was working in the American hospital in Paris because his Swiss wife couldn't stand living in the USA. Their son Phillip was a typical teen-ager who was comfortable in both worlds. When the German army invaded France, Sumner decided that his job at the hospital was too important to abandon. He sent the rest of the family to their house in the country where they could be safe from the SS and Gestapo who were moving in to the residential homes on Avenue de Foch, next to the Jacksons. The tension ramps up when America enters the war and the Nazis take an interest in their neighbors on the block. It doesn't help that the Jacksons have been using Sumner's position at the hospital to help smuggle downed British pilots back to friendly territory.The story moves along quickly in this book and it doesn't flinch from the gruesome realities of interrogation, torture and the concentration camps. It is also not sensationalist which is often the downfall of other similar books. There are periods of suspense, action, terror and disbelief that will keep you turning the pages. There are many stories of resistance from WWII and this is one of the better told ones."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Eckel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465880-jennifer-eckel", "userReview": "Via-Netgallery. While I gave this only 3 stars I did like the book and would encourage WWII readers to find and read this book. It tells of an American and his European wife who aided the French Resistance in WWII right under the nose of the Nazis occupiers of Paris. How the family triumphed and would do it all over again, is proper testimony from the unsung heroes and heroines of WWII. I'm glad the story was told.I do have issues with the writer's style. At times he is gossipy, and his use of adjectives to describe the evil sadistic, Nazis is overdone and redundant. Still when he tells on the ultimate end of the head of the Gestapo in Paris one cannot help but feel a little angry. I had to wait until the end of the story to confirm what I had long suspected the author had eye-witness and personal testimony to document the life story of Dr. Sumner Jackson.

Life is good. This is Doctor Sumner Jackson. He was part of a group of Americans who volunteered for the British Medical Corp before the US entered the \u201cGreat War\u201d. He met and fell in love with a Swiss nurse (Charlotte Sylvie Barrelet de Ricou) who worked with the French. The married after the war and returned to the States but, Toquette (as everyone called her) missed home and her family (she was one of five).Moving back to France meant that Jackson would have to become fluent in French and pass all of the same exams that a French medical student would. Their son Phillip was born in 1928. By that time Jackson was a respected surgeon working in the American Hospital (AHN) in Neuilly. After the Second World War broke out in 1939, he wanted to take his family back to the US, but Toquette refused. She did move out of Paris to their summer home in the Massif Central.In 1940 during the \u201cPhony War\u201d Toquette and Philip moved back to Paris. Jackson was now head of surgery at the AHN, and began treating wounded soldiers once the Germans attacked France. They all thought that the Germans would be stopped before reaching Paris and that a stalemate like in WW1 would settle in. No one was prepared for the quick surrender of French forces and the Armistice that was signed creating Vichy.The Jacksons had ground floor apartment from a friend who lived on the Avenue Foch. It was one of the fanciest streets in one of the fanciest neighborhoods. The Baron de Rothchild had a mansion down the street and many of the most important bankers and politicians also lived in the area. With the fall of Paris, many of the houses became vacant (some belonged to Jewish families and were appropriate). At 84 Avenue Foch, the Gestapo set-up one of their torture centers and with so many other houses taken over by German officials that the street was nicknamed \u201cAvenue Boche\u201d (the equivalent of Kraut in French). But the Jacksons were never bothered by their neighbors.Jackson was asked by one of his neighbors (who was part of the Resistance) if he would be willing to hide British and American pilots who were shot down. The pilots were then smuggled to the south of France and over the Pyrenees to Spain. They didn\u2019t tell their thirteen year old son what they were doing. Each time they knew if they were caught it would mean death or at least a Concentration Camp.In early 1944 the Gestapo began rounding up citizens of all the allied nations. They feared that they could be working as spies. But they were split up and didn\u2019t see each other until after the war. Jackson and Philip were moved around as they Germans began to lose the war, but Toquette spent all of her time in the woman\u2019s camp at Ravensbruk. This is the story of quiet heroism. The Jacksons did what they felt needed to be done to fight the scourge of Nazi-ism. They felt everybody had to do their part, and that\u2019s what they did.

Sumner Jackson, an American surgeon, was living in Paris with his Swiss wife Toquette and young son Phillip when the war was imminent. Their beautiful home was located on Avenue Foch, a street which would come to be associated with unspeakable horrors in the days to come. Many neighboring homes were subsequently seized by the SS for use as Gestapo headquarters and torture chambers. Despite the chilling German presence and increasingly oppressive atmosphere, a choice was made to remain in the city where Dr. Jackson could continue his practice as chief surgeon at the nearby American Hospital. What befalls this heroic family and countless other brave souls who elect to risk joining the French resistance is chronicled here. The contrasts are many \u2013 the beauty of Paris in the spring, the sheer sadism, the appalling horrors, the ever-present terror of betrayal, the grim details of concentration camps, the unsung courage of so many!

Avenue of Spies tells of the occupation of Paris and the French Resistance from the perspective of an American doctor who lived in Paris and worked at the American hospital there in alternating chapters with the point of view of the Nazi and SS officers who took over most of the residences on the Avenue Foch, where Doctor Sumner Jackson also lived. The tale includes heroic deeds, nasty Nazis, and slimy collaborators, many of whom were able to thrive after the war when others whose crimes were arguably less, but whose influence and social standing were also less, were imprisoned or executed. The Germans are portrayed almost completely unsympathetically, as subhuman sadists, which is unfortunate. A more balanced portrayal might have given the book more depth. Though there were several gripping passages, as a whole, it is not of the caliber of Ben Macintyre\u2019s work in Double Cross, or Operation Mincemeat. The material is all there, but somehow, the narrative doesn\u2019t gel. The reader keeps waiting for the story to get off the starting blocks and it never does.

It often seems that way, doesn\u2019t it? Certainly, the reality of life in times past is far easier to get our arms around when we read about the lived experience of individuals rather than the kings, generals, presidents, and other muckity-mucks who tend to dominate the history books.Avenue of Spies is a case in point. Despite all the reading I\u2019ve done about World War II \u2014 dozens, and perhaps more than a hundred books \u2014 I found Alex Kershaw\u2019s account of one extraordinary American family\u2019s experience in occupied Europe during the war to be at least as revealing as the best political or military histories. I learned things that would never turn up in conventional history books, things that gave me the feeling that I was getting at least an inkling of what it was really like to live in Nazi-occupied territory while despising the Nazis and everything they stood for.The title refers to the Avenue Foch, the widest thoroughfare in Paris. There during World War II the Gestapo had commandeered one venerable mansion after another, turning some into offices and others into torture chambers. This was the headquarters of Nazi efforts to deport French Jews to concentration camps and to destroy the French Resistance. The same street was home to an American surgeon, his Swiss wife, and their adolescent son whose house lay within yards of the headquarters of Hitler\u2019s secret police. The doctor, Sumner Jackson, was the wartime head of the American Hospital, which he operated as an escape route for scores of downed American and British pilots. Jackson\u2019s home on the Avenue Foch served as the Paris hub of one of France\u2019s principal Resistance networks, courtesy of Jackson\u2019s wife, Toquette. There, virtually under the noses of the Gestapo, Resistance fighters and couriers visited under cover as patients of Dr. Jackson, dropping off or picking up communications from their comrades.Kershaw focuses not just on the heroic Jackson family but also on Helmut Knochen, the Gestapo\u2019s chief spy-hunter in France and, later, effectively the ultimate authority in the country outside of Vichy France, the fascist client state established under the aegis of the German occupation. Knochen and his staff were notoriously effective in hunting down, torturing, and killing scores of Frenchmen and women who volunteered for the Resistance. Along with the French militia, the Milice, and the pro-Nazi leaders of the Vichy government, they were also ruthless in searching out and deporting many thousands of French Jews, nearly all of whom perished either in the Nazi death camps or by being worked and starved to death in German factories.In other words, if you\u2019re looking for light reading, this book isn\u2019t it. However, it would be difficult to find a fictional account of the times that is equally suspenseful, and if you want to gain deeper understanding about the day-to-day reality of life under the Nazis in occupied Europe, Avenue of Spies will open your eyes.Alex Kershaw is a British historian, journalist, and nonfiction author who has written six popular previous nonfiction books about World War II."}, {"userName": "Terri Wangard", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11095305-terri-wangard", "userReview": "The Germans\u2019 bestial mindset boggles the imagination. Gestapo agents salivated to round up opponents of the Third Reich, Jews, and \u201cterrorists\u201d who resisted them. They hired French criminals to assist them, and these Frenchmen, plus the French Milice, thrived on repressing their countrymen. The years of World War II warrant the moniker The Dark Ages.Sumner Jackson was an American physician who stayed in France because his Swiss wife did not living in the U.S. As Alex Kershaw frequently states, the Jacksons lived on Avenue Foch, surrounded by the Gestapo, which took over the mansions of neighbors who\u2019d fled.His wife Toquette agreed that their apartment could be used as a drop-off point for messages and money for the resistance. As a doctor\u2019s apartment, people would come and go naturally. Sumner continued working at the American Hospital in Paris. He falsified records of American, French, and British prisoners to show they had died, when in fact they were returned to England with the help of the Resistance.The Jacksons were arrested in May of 1944. They experienced the full range of horrors as prisoners of the Germans. Jackson and his son Phillip spent a year in Neuengamme camp. At the end of the war, they were moved onto a ship in the Baltic Sea. An RAF squadron, believing the ships were transporting German soldiers, attacked, killing 10,000 prisoners. Philip survived, but Jackson died in a particularly tragic case of friendly fire. Toquette survived Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.The narrative contains several comments like, \u201cSumner may not even have been told\u201d or \u201cIt must have been heartrending for him\u201d or \u201cHe was thought to have\u2026\u201d This gives the impression that much is based on assumptions, although Kershaw did interview Phillip Jackson. While the Jacksons are the primary subjects with the Resistance, others are included, like Violette Szabo.Astounding is the attitude of many of the Nazi torturers after the war.

An American, he grew to love Paris after marrying his Swiss wife, Toquette. They and their only child, Phillip want to do everything they can to aid the Allies. Sumner uses his position in the hospital to smuggle British and French fighters to Spain and then to Britain. Toquette becomes involved in the French Resistance. Living on the Avenue Foch where the other houses had been commandeered by the Gestapo, makes becoming involved in the Resistance an extremely dangerous activity and the Jacksons and their son paid the price. Seen through the eyes of the Jacksons from their vantage point on the Avenue Foch, this book shows the horror of the Nazi occupation of Paris in vivid colors. Many of the beautiful mansions that had been commandeered by the Gestapo were used as torture chambers to encourage people to turn in their neighbors and locate any Jews in hiding. The story is particularly poignant by, in addition to telling the story of the Jacksons, following the career of Gestapo agent Knochen, Dr. Bones. Knochen is a charming, learned individual who loves Paris, but he wants the power to form it in his image. The contrast between the Jackson family and Knochen is startling. If you're interested in WWII and the Nazi occupation of Paris, this is one of the best books I've read.

My own lack of background knowledge of the resistance in Nazi-occupied Paris, as well as my ignorance about much of World War II, put me at a significant disadvantage as I read. The author assumes his readers have a rather strong working knowledge of this time period. There were parts that felt confusing to me and many names that were meaningless to me. This made the book drag on at times and I confess to perhaps drifting off from time-to-time in my reading.At the same time, there were portions of the book that read like fiction -- narrow escapes, kind and heroic acts, and a few great action scenes. These parts of the book made me feel like I was watching a movie and were great redeeming features of my reading experience. I am glad I made the effort to push through the more difficult, slow going bits.I think readers who are frequent readers of WWII history will really enjoy this book, as it is likely a little known story of resistance, so I appreciate it for that contribution. It also showed me my own gross ignorance about this time period and I am grateful to the opportunity to fill in some of the (rather embarrassing) gaps in my historical knowledge."}, {"userName": "Doug Phillips", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24057473-doug-phillips", "userReview": "Having read numerous historical accounts of World War II and the corresponding years, it was a definite treat to read this account of the Jackson family and their story. It is clear that the author completed extensive research to complete this book, and we are all the better for his diligence and personal interviews with Philip Jackson and other survivors while they are still alive to tell their stories. Mr. Kershaw weaves in just the right amount of historical data, while at the same time, painting descriptive character portraits of the key individuals in this lesser-known chapter of the German occupation of France. I found myself carefully reading the tactical details, as well as the traits of the many German, French and American military and civilian people whose stories are now told.As I read, I could easily envision this work becoming the basis for a movie adaptation. This story was one that needed to be told, and Mr. Kershaw's writing style yields sufficient detail without burying the reader in tactical details.After hearing the author speak at the book's launch event in New Orleans, I do hope that he has at least one more of these great and unique stories yet to tell. It is a pleasure to invest the time to soar through \"Avenue of Spies\" and consider the possibility of sometime later, pulling it off the shelf and enjoy it all over again."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16803939-marti", "userReview": "I had a hard time putting this book down. You definitely know that something bad is going to happen, but you are not sure exactly what and how. If I were in the Jackson family's shoes -- an American doctor and his family -- I believe I would have left Paris before the Nazi's got there. However, I am not sure even they knew what they were in for. And the main reason they stayed was that the Doctor's Swiss wife did not want to live in America, and they did not want to let the American Red Cross Hospital fall into enemy hands. Other than that, I feel like I can't say too much without spoiling the story.However, it does seem that life in occupied Paris was slightly less grim than someplace like Warsaw, mainly because the Germans did not actually want to completely destroy the city (even after the Fuhrer ordered them to reduce it to rubble before the Allies arrived). For them, it was a holiday camp where they could indulge at five star restaurants and quaff champagne. Absolutely no one wanted to be sent back to Berlin.This is not to say it was fun for the occupied, but the better connected one was, the more likely one was to survive unscathed. This was what kept the American family safe for so long. However, when it all started to go wrong, it went very wrong."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris", "userReview": "This is the story of an American doctor, Sumner Jackson, and his French wife and son living in Paris in the 1940's. In June 1940, their lives were completely turned upside down by the Nazi invasion of France and subsequent occupation of their city. The street they lived on, Avenue Foch, was an upscale address, and so, Nazi officials began moving into the houses surrounding their home. Despite the proximity of Gestapo officials and the danger this posed, the couple decided to do what they could to help the French resistance movement. This entailed harboring downed Allied airmen in the American hospital and allowing French Resistance workers to use their home for meetings. Avenue of Spies paints a vivid picture of what life must have been like during this time in occupied France. The book gives the points of view of Gestapo officials as well as French resistance workers and those who were helped by the Jackson family. One very interesting tidbit I learned was that the July 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler's life affected the command structure in Paris. After the assassination attempt, the Wehrmacht in Paris was informed to arrest SD and SS officials there. They did so, but quickly released them after it was discovered that Hitler was alive and well."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225293-sarah", "userReview": "Story of am American doctor and his family in Paris during WWII. A journey if people doing their best while facing Nazi brutality and the unnecessary loss of millions."}], "description": "The best-selling author of The Liberator brings to life the incredible true story of an American doctor in Paris, and his heroic espionage efforts during World War II\nThe leafy Avenue de Foch, one of the most exclusive residential streets in Nazi-occupied France, was Paris's hotbed of daring spies, murderous secret police, amoral informers, and Vichy collaborators. So when American physician Sumner Jackson, who lived with his wife and young son Phillip at Number 11, found himself drawn into the Liberation network of the French resistance, he knew the stakes were impossibly high. Just down the road at Number 31 was the \"mad sadist\" Theodor Dannecker, an Eichmann prot\u00e9g\u00e9 charged with deporting French Jews to concentration camps. And Number 84 housed the Parisian headquarters of the Gestapo, run by the most effective spy hunter in Nazi Germany.From his office at the American Hospital, itself an epicenter of Allied and Axis intrigue, Jackson smuggled fallen Allied fighter pilots safely out of France, a job complicated by the hospital director's close ties to collaborationist Vichy. After witnessing the brutal round-up of his Jewish friends, Jackson invited Liberation to officially operate out of his home at Number 11--but the noose soon began to tighten. When his secret life was discovered by his Nazi neighbors, he and his family were forced to undertake\u00a0 a journey into the dark heart of the war-torn continent from which there was little chance of return.Drawing upon a wealth of primary source material and extensive interviews with Phillip Jackson, Alex Kershaw recreates the City of Light during its darkest days. The untold story of the Jackson family anchors the suspenseful narrative, and Kershaw dazzles readers with the vivid immediacy of the best spy thrillers. Awash with the tense atmosphere of World War II's Europe, Avenue of Spies introduces us to the brave doctor who risked everything to defy Hitler.", "title": "Avenue of Spies: A True Story of Terror, Espionage, and One American Family's Heroic Resistance in Nazi-Occupied Paris", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23648884-avenue-of-spies", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435684342l/23648884.jpg", "reviews": 318, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30764.Alex_Kershaw", "name": "Alex Kershaw"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "Cultural", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23648884-avenue-of-spies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23519922-avenue-of-spies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25097342-avenue-of-spies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1312031.The_Longest_Winter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13532239-the-liberator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665782.The_Bedford_Boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2626624-escape-from-the-deep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/925833.The_Few"]}
