Once we get to the farm..we get to meet the parents.\nWith a smidge of this:\nThen we find out some stuff and thangs.

When he has to work the next day.At the Dairy Queen there are some female teenage weirdos..including one that should have made girlie jump out of that car and run.\nThen the ending. That frigging ending. \nI read it twice the other night when I finished this book. Still didn't understand it.I read it again this morning before writing the review. I'm sorry. A whole bunch of people are really liking this book. I LOATHE that stupid ending. It's not like I can't handle weird stuff.\nBut damn..that still has me mad enough and frustrated enough that this book is getting the big old one star. If I had a physical copy I would possibly punch it. In it's stupid little book face. Yes, I'm a tad ragey.

This was one of those books. I was immediately requesting this one on NetGalley the second I saw it, as it sounded right up my alley. Creepy, suspenseful, vague-YES! However, I\u2019ll say that my not liking this book was not reflective on the writer\u2019s abilities and talent; the book was very well written in style and he is clearly very bright. My problems all lie within the plot itself.\u201cIf I had your number, we could talk, and I\u2019d tell you something funny.\u201dThere\u2019s not much I can say about the plot; there\u2019s a reason the blurb is so vague. Jake and \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d are heading on a trip to his parent\u2019s farm and weird things start happening. Then they leave and stop off at an old school and more weird things happen. That\u2019s the gist of it; coming in at 224 pages this one is very brief, and I think if the plot had been fleshed out a little more it might have worked for me. It all felt so BAM BAM BAM DONE! I was left holding my kindle thinking \u201cUm. What?\u201d It takes until 40% of the book for it to even get going; up until that point they are just talking in the car about a lot of weird stuff (ex. \u201cYou are the new man. How delicious cannot forget, special taste. Return the turn flavor.\u201d). Yes, I guess it makes sense once you get to the end, but that was my other big problem; I had this book figured out within the first chapter. If the ending isn\u2019t obvious to you, you very well might enjoy this book much more than I did. Even though I didn\u2019t give this book a glowing rating, I\u2019d like to end my review with a list of things I did like about the book as the author clearly put time and energy into this book and all reviews are worthy of that.THINGS I LIKED:The author put together some very intelligent narrative, probably too intelligent for me and proves why I wasn\u2019t a good fit for this book. He clearly researched the meaning behind many big words to make Jake as verbose as he is.From about 40-90% this book had me sucked in. These parts were gloriously creepy, especially all the farm house scenes. If the entire book had been of this nature I would have given it 5 stars.Without giving away too much, I really appreciated how the author managed to connect the ending with the beginning; that was a really neat touch that I\u2019m sure was difficult to construct.*Thank you to both NetGalley and the author for providing me a copy even though it wasn\u2019t my favorite book of the year. I appreciate how publishers and authors take that chance knowing many people will not write glowing reviews and that they don\u2019t stone us in our sleep."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "I listened to the audio of this one and at first I didn't find it too bad. A woman and her boyfriend, Jake are on their way to his parents for dinner. She is like the title says.....thinking of ending things. \"You will be scared. But you won't know why\"That quote from the book is very true. I was so confused and felt very uncomfortable for almost the entire book. I think this book might be too smart for me because I still don't think I understand it. I wonder if reading the actual book would have made a difference in this case. This book did give me a reason to think about audio vs. book and how easily things can be heard wrong. For example, I thought the girlfriend was saying \"I should have told him about the collar\". Similar sentences were said a few times before I realized she was saying CALLER not COLLAR. it wasn't until she said something about her phone that I realized my mistake. I thought she was wanting to tell him about a collar. I know that makes me sound dumb. Like really? why would she be talking about a collar. Because this book was an odd one \"collar\" seemed like a possibility. Had I been reading the book I would have seen the spelling and it wouldn't have been an issue. However I have still been enjoying audio books and this was the first time that has happened. I was on edge for almost the entire time. I'm not saying it wasn't interesting, because it was at first. I enjoyed learning about the couple, the visit to the farm, etc.. But then everything started weirding me out. Especially the narrator. The girlfriend was thinking about some weird calls she was getting and the messages this person was leaving. When the narrator did the voice of the person leaving the messages my skin started crawling. By the time she repeated it the third time I was freaked right out! I don't know if it's just me but that voice made me shudder. To be honest I almost dnf'd this one. However, I thought I would give it another try and so I did. I did want to find out what happened. But then I didn't get the ending at all. I listened to the ending a few times and I still didn't get it. I have my theories about what happened which I won't write because on the .000001 percent chance that I'm right I wouldn't want to ruin it. Maybe it's just me and I missed something. I wasn't always sure who's point of view I was hearing. Maybe in the book the chapters have headings which would definitely make it easier to follow. I am giving it 2.5 stars because it was right about one thing.......I was scared and didn't know why. I just wish I understood more of what was happening, especially the ending!!I think this will get a variety of ratings. I can totally understand how some people would really like it. But it just wasn't for me. 2.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Maggie Stiefvater", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater", "userReview": "The back of this book merely promises that you will be afraid and not know why.

I freaking loved this book! It blew me right way! I got if from the Overdrive library and I'm going to be buying it to keep. Okay, so like the narrator is this woman that I have no idea who she is, name-wise. Unless I missed it, they never say in the book. She's on a road trip with her boyfriend Jake. He is taking her to meet his parents for the first time and they live a few hours in the country on a farm. Through-out the ride, SHE, talks about her thoughts. She tells about this man that calls her on the phone all of the time but she hasn't told any one. She hasn't even told Jake. He says scary things, bizarre things. And, SHE, is kind of weird herself. She keeps talking about ending it with Jake and not ending it with Jake and people and places and weird stuff. I actually thought this book was about teenagers when I started it but these are two adults. Jake works in some kind of lab and he's super smart. There is a certain point that I started to figure things out. I thought a few different things at first but then the stranger it got it started to click into place. I was on the edge of my seat to get to the bottom of everything I'm still confused on a few things but it's okay, I never figure everything out in books.

The unnamed duo who've been talking between the chapters are discussing the book found next to Jake's body, and the guy tells the woman that he thinks she should read it once and then read it again, only backward. This is a pain in the ass to do in audio, but I did it. I suggest you do the same. You know, if you wanna. Yes, Jake killed himself because he was struggling with schizophrenia, as most super-intelligent folks do. No, there never was any girlfriend. It was always him. He made up, in his mind, everything that happened after the night he met her in the bar. This book is a very sick man playing in his own head. It's sad and disturbing and even a bit beautiful. Madness usually is.Jake did work in a lab. He left that job to take a job as a janitor. Somewhere he could just blend in and do his own thing and, even though he was around people, he kinda wasn't. How many of you remember your high school janitors? Did you hang out with that person or did they just kinda exist on the edge? I understand why people didn't like this book, but I fucking loved it. Reid made the book just short enough that you can reread it with ease right after reading it the first time. Bravo. Good on him for trying something unique with his fiction. Lastly, in the audiobook, right at the repetitious part at the end, when he says that one line over and over again, the narrator switches from female to male. I don't know how they pulled this off in the book, but in the audiobook it is chilling and makes the twist clear. That's my favorite part of the book, really, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the entire experience. Thanks for joining me.

It's a slim volume that packs such a WALLOP! that creeps up on you, it would be super easy to spoil it for someone if you weren't careful. Many people have this filed as 'Mystery' or 'Psychological Thriller' and it's sorta a blend of those, but way closer to 'Psychological Horror' for me than anything else. It's an unsettling, paranoid mindfuck that at first appearances seems pretty slow-moving and innocuous. There's a young couple on a road trip to visit the guy's parents at their secluded farmhouse, and the girlfriend is \"thinking of ending things\". In her head she's ruminating on the course of their courtship and mulling over the nagging feeling that it's time to pull the plug on a relationship whose expiration date is past. But she also has a secret. Dun-dun-DUUUUUN.But the boyfriend -- who starts the novel normal and quite nice -- starts to appear odd and off kilter as soon as we get to the farmhouse. Then things inexorably creep to majorly weird and unsettling with the parents by the time we get to dessert. And just as you're processing what's happening in that farmhouse and freaked the hell out because you don't know where the threat is coming from, the book will move to its final act in a deserted high school. This isn't a book about what HAPPENS. It's one of those HOW WE GET THERE. It's a book of atmosphere and tension and a narrator who absolutely takes the cake on unreliable. It's a paranoid chant in places, and I was literally gripping the book as I was reading it because everything started to feel so portentous, so HEAVY, that the most horrible thing could happen at any moment. All bets are off. As a reader, when I am in the hands of a writer like that, and at their complete mercy, there is no other place I would rather be. It was horror god Nick Cutter who brought my attention to this book first when he tweeted this about it: \"Creepy as hell. You owe me a few fingernails, Reid, because I've bitten them off reading your book!\" When Mr. Cutter endorses a book like that I will do just about anything (and I do mean anything people) to get my hands on a copy. Fortunately, I didn't have to kill anybody (and lose precious reading time getting rid of the body since my woodchipper is in the shop). The publisher provided a review copy for free, no violence required, no cleanup in aisle four. Thanks Simon and Schuster Canada! I want to compare this short read (which you should do in one sitting for maximum impact) with other great stories of the same ilk, but I don't want to risk spoiling anything. I'm Thinking of Ending Things is psychological, subtle, mind-bendy, and utterly unnerving. I can't wait to read this one again to enjoy its construction and appreciate even more the flawless execution of its moving parts.

It\u2019s black, old. We\u2019ve been following that truck for a while, pretty much for the entire story. I try to see the driver as we go by but can\u2019t make him out. There haven\u2019t been many cars with us on the road.\u201cWhat did you mean when you said all memory is fiction?\u201d I ask.\u201cA memory is its own thing each time it\u2019s recalled. It\u2019s not absolute. Stories based on actual events often share more with fiction than fact. Both fictions and memories are recalled and retold. They\u2019re both forms of stories. Stories are the way we learn. Stories are how we understand each other. But reality happens only once.\u201dThis is when I\u2019m most attracted to Jake. Right now. When he says things like \u201cReality happens only once.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just weird, when you start thinking about it. We go see a movie and understand it\u2019s not real. We know it\u2019s people acting, reciting lines. It still affects us.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that it doesn\u2019t matter if the story I just told you is made up or if it actually happened?\u201d\u201cEvery story is made up. Even the real ones.\u201dAnother classic Jake line.\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about that.\u201d\u201cYou know that song \u2018Unforgettable\u2019?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I say.\u201cHow much is truly unforgettable?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure. I like the song, though.\u201d\u201cNothing. Nothing is unforgettable.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Part of everything will always be forgettable. No matter how good or remarkable it is. It literally has to be. To be.\u201d\u201cThat is the question?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Jake.and that\u2019s a whole page of the book spent on\u2026that. it successfully creates a hazy, pseudo-intellectual stoner mood, but is that the most appropriate atmosphere for a book like this, listed here as \u201chorror, thriller, mystery, suspense?\u201d passages, pages like this provide zero tension. and this is what we get for (nearly) the entire first half of the book. there are some spooky lumps studding the word-porridge, and they do cause the readerly hackles to stir in inquiry, but then we\u2019re dragged back into muuusings:\u201dThere\u2019s something about modernity and what we value now. Is there a general lack of compassions? Of interest in others? In connections? It\u2019s all related. How are we supposed to achieve a feeling of significance and purpose without feeling a link to something bigger than our own lives? The more I think about it, the more it seems happiness and fulfillment rely on the presence of others, even just one other. The same way sadness requires happiness, and vice versa. Alone is\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you mean.\u201dnot spooky, just tedious.so far, a two-star book. but then, about halfway through, it escalates exponentially into scenes of such incredibly grotesque theater they feel like david lynch on a sugar high. and those sequences - everything from the farmhouse to the dairy queen - are absolutely perfect. it\u2019s not a big chunk of the book, but it\u2019s fantastic, and it\u2019s what made me give it an extra star. it is so creepy - a blend of real and surreal and overt and implicit and the tension is 100% on point. and if this energy had been nursed and maintained throughout the book, it would have been gold. but here, it\u2019s such a sharp escalation, it doesn\u2019t really feel earned, and then after the dairy queen, it continues at a frenzied, manic pace, but it isn\u2019t as inventive - it\u2019s just ticking off the expected horror movie beats until the moment of ta-daaaaa, which i\u2019d already surmised, and which is a fun OMG, but is not, i do not think, accurate or convincing once the shock cools. i am no expert, but i think some liberties are taken that prioritize dramatic payoff over how things go in the real world with stuff and things. not a successful horror novel or thriller, but i can\u2019t deny it\u2019s got some wicked memorable, queasy-making scenes. oh, and not to be a noodge, but since this book is so self-consciously precise and smartypantsed, it should know that thomas bernhard is austrian, not german."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Seriously, what the hell was this?\"I think what I want is for someone to know me. Really know me. Know me better than anyone else and maybe even me. Isn't that why we commit to another?\"In Iain Reid's \nI'm Thinking of Ending Things\n (I'll admit I thought of ending my reading of this book more than a few times), an unnamed woman is on a road trip with her boyfriend, Jake. They've been dating six weeks, and she enjoys his intelligence, his sense of humor, his intensity, and the way he surprises her with simple gestures that show how much he cares, yet she's thinking of ending things with him. But since they're traveling to see his parents, she figures she'll wait and see how the trip goes before making any decisions.As the drive progresses, the pair have a number of conversations, about the imperfection of memory, the importance of relationships, the value of faith, science, free will, and fear. Periodically the peace of the trip is interrupted by a persistent caller on the narrator's cell phone, but she refuses to answer those calls or discuss them with Jake, although he can clearly see she is agitated by them.When they arrive at the farm where Jake was raised, the tenor of the visit starts to disturb her. She is left feeling ill-at-ease by Jake's parents, although they're doing their best to be pleasant; she is troubled by Jake's swift mood change as he interacts with his parents; and she sees and experiences a number of things that unsettle, even frighten her. She doesn't know what is going on or what she's supposed to do, but she does know she absolutely must end things with Jake when they return home. Then things utterly disintegrate on the trip home, beginning with an ill-advised stop at a Dairy Queen (in the midst of a snowstorm), and ending with an unexpected detour.The story of the road trip is interspersed with flashbacks of the past six weeks since she met Jake, as well as snippets of a conversation between two people about a tragic incident.I had no idea what to expect when reading this. Much of the hype I've seen talked about how terrifying and unsettling the book was, and I guess I agree with the latter part of that statement. To be honest, I am not sure I understand some of what happened in this book, and I guess I don't think any book should purposely be this obtuse. The story just kept getting weirder and weirder, and I couldn't discern what was actually happening and what was the work of an unreliable narrator.There's no denying that Reid is a talented writer. He kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen even as I kept shaking my head and getting squeamish from time to time, and his use of language was extraordinary. The issues raised in the conversations during the trip were also fascinating and thought-provoking. But in the end, I found this unsettling and ultimately unsatisfying, partially because I think the book took a very strange turn, and partially because I just wasn't sure what I just read.If you've read this and enjoyed it, we should talk!!

Or you'll want to hide it in the depths of the earth never to be seen again. Probably won't be that much inbetween those two things and the range of reviews would seem to back me on this.Me? I'm going to tell everyone I know to read this book then read it again.It scared the living crap out of me but no, don't ask. Iain Reid has written, in my humble opinion, a masterclass in unsettling the reader without them being able to put their finger on why exactly. It has a surreal, emotional and deeply disturbing vibe that starts on the first page then builds to a crescendo of turmoil at the end followed by a \"Wait. No just wait a minute. What the all heck did I just read? Wait what now?\" Then a sudden dawning of realisation as it settles and a desperate urge to go back to the start and see it with new eyes. I did that. I was just as haunted the second time round but for utterly different reasons. Brilliantly constructed, absolutely gorgeous use of language, those little things that make you shiver, glance behind you, wonder what that noise was coming from the other room and when the blurb says \"you will be afraid but you won't know why\" that is exactly it. That right there.It is incredibly difficult to review. Its a road trip for sure, one hell of a ride. Its like Stephen King dropped acid then wrote a story about a girl who is not sure whether she wants to break up with her boyfriend or not. And very much like King when he's bang on the money, you won't know what you are getting until you get there and when you DO get there everything you thought you knew will be turned on its head. That might get over some of the sense of it. Maybe. You should just read it.Iain Reid has his own unique writing style to be sure that feeds into the story being told perfectly, there is an intensity of prose, an intuitive sense of things, it shines through and then sucks you into a vortex of impossible to describe, erm, things. Life is in here, a twist of life, some insightful commentary on how we all see things, how human interaction works. Or does not. Or could. Or something.Oh yes I'm not making sense - but at the very heart of this one is one thing that I can't talk about without spoiling where this possibly ill fated couple end up. So really you probably just need to decide to read it. Or not. I would. I'm probably going to again because I'm sure I've missed nuances. I'm sure actually that I missed a lot of things. Only lets just see if I can sleep first. I doubt it. I'm still a little afraid to be honest...I'm Thinking of Ending Things will quite definitively not be for everyone. But it was absolutely for me.

It started out with a certain amount of promise, then... the last 150 pages just rambled into an incoherent ending. Either that, or I didn't get the memo.\"Update: If you're spoiler averse, don't read this. Readers have a plethora of reviews available to them which dance around this novel so completely that the innocent and unwary can't assess whether it's a book they'd like. I'm here to help. Really. I initially had difficulty identifying why I found I'm Thinking of Ending Things to be so unsatisfying, even irritating. Initially, I pinned my reaction on the fact that there are unreliable narrators and then there are unreliable narrators, by which I mean, an author can use an unreliable narrator as a device for creating a certain amount of surprise, which is fine, but if, as here, an author uses the device to keep the reader in the dark for 95% of the novel, this reader wants to toss the book across the room. For a successful use of the unreliable narrator, see the obvious, relatively recent example, Gone Girl. It's approximately 50% through Gone Girl that Amy's character is first revealed fully to the reader. For the rest of the book, the reader is \"in on it\". The reveal is perfect. The timing doesn't seem to abuse the reader's trust. In ITOET, the reader spends the majority of the novel accompanying its characters at night during a snowstorm through the dark countryside , then a farmhouse, then a Dairy Queen and finally, endlessly, a darkened high school. Interspersed italics dialogue create curiosity and dread, but as Hannah Pittard's NY Times review I've linked below indicates, \"To get to the answers, one must keep reading. While this bait-and-switch tactic is by no means a flaw \u2014 the early instances are especially effective in encouraging the reader to continue \u2014 by the novel\u2019s end they come to feel more gimmicky than earned.\" The idea that it's the reader's job to re-read this book again, backwards is a bunch of [insert your fave term here].Rather than come up with another way to say the same thing, I'm excerpting from Pittard's spot-on review below, to explain why I found ITOET to be more perturbing than brilliant, and adding \"non-diegetic\" to my vocabulary.*******************\u201cI\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things\u201d relies on a surprise finish that\u2019s crucial to any evaluation of the story. Without giving anything away, then, I\u2019d like to talk about my disappointment in the \u201cbig reveal.\u201d In class, I sometimes talk about non-diegetic mysteries versus diegetic ones. It\u2019s an imperfect use of the term, but it suits my purposes. The distinction, basically, is this: Diegetic mysteries exist for both the reader and the characters. (When Gregor Samsa finds himself \u201ctransformed in his bed into a gigantic insect,\u201d he\u2019s as confused as we are.) Non-diegetic mysteries, I propose, are those in which the reader knows less than the text, in which we are at the mercy of a less-than-forthcoming narrator or author. In its cheapest form, think \u201cI see dead people\u201d; at its best, consider the narrator of Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cIn the Lake of the Woods,\u201d who intentionally \u2014 and to devastating effect \u2014 withholds information to win us over in the face of impossible crimes against humanity.Reid\u2019s mystery feels more non-\u00addiegetic than it needs to be. Midway through the novel, causality seems to fall away entirely, as the characters \u2014 both the principal players and the bit ones \u2014 begin making head-scratching decisions: deciding to tour the farm before dinner though it\u2019s arguably too cold for comfort and too dark to see anything; deciding to explore the basement alone though there are scratches on a trap door that look \u201cfrantic\u201d; deciding to stop for \u201csomething sweet\u201d on the drive home after dinner though there\u2019s now a full-on snowstorm and nobody is remotely hungry; deciding to drive down a remote, unplowed road in order to throw away the sweating cups of icy lemonade because they might melt and turn the cup holders sticky. In almost every instance, the decisions being made in the novel\u2019s homestretch feel applied rather than organic, and this reader at any rate found herself longing for reason and connection.Does the ending provide a solution for these brow-\u00adfurrowing choices? Yes, it does. But to my mind it is not a convincing one, neither does it live up to the novel\u2019s stunning and startling opening.***********************I'm not a fan of being at an author's mercy, or of characters that make one head-scratching decision after another. If it's not okay when Nevada Barr or Alifair Burke do it, Reid doesn't get a pass because his work is deemed literary.

It will appeal to a niche group that likes a well-constructed psychological read.

It\u2019s time to meet the boyfriend\u2019s parents. Jake. The boyfriend.

As the drive finally results in an early evening arrival at the house, I can feel myself getting tense, taut, on edge. The drive has been too much for me. The house is not what I\u2019m expecting.

Puzzles are like that. We each have to solve our own.\"Iain Reid's fiction debut is unsettling, disturbing, and nerve-wrecking, an atmospheric novel about the fragility\u00a0of the human condition.\u00a0I'm Thinking of Ending Things will draw you in from the first page\u00a0and drive you crazy trying to figure out what in the world is going on.\"The most important things are perpetually overlooked. Until something like this. Then they are impossible to ignore. What does that say?We're mad at these limits and needs. Human limits and fragility. You can't be only alone. Everything's both ethereal and clunky. So much to depend on, and so much to fear. So many requirements.\"I won't discuss what happens in this book at all but instead want to talk about how I felt when reading it. The\u00a0synopsis\u2014which you should read because it doesn't give anything away\u2014is what made me think, \"Oh my goodness, I need to read this book right now!\"\u00a0It's a true testament to the writing when an\u00a0author is able to bring\u00a0the reader into the scene and relay feelings so intensely\u00a0like Reid did here.One of the most memorable parts about this book is how the suspense and unease just keeps\u00a0building. That feeling deep in your guy\u00a0that something is not right was ever-present and unyielding. And I loved it.\u00a0I felt uneasy and uncomfortable\u00a0throughout the whole book. I don't often go through an endless range of emotions when reading, but this book did a number on me. I was\u00a0creeped out and disturbed, and like the publisher promised, I didn't know why.The author's characterization is brilliant. Through \"the Girlfriend's\" eyes you get a vivid picture of Jake's character and a look into his brain and thought process. You also get a look at the Girlfriend's state of mind, which left me feeling creeped out in the beginning too. I didn't know which person to trust.\"A memory is its own thing each time it's recalled. It's not absolute. Stories based on actual events often share more with fiction than fact. Both fictions and memories are recalled and retold. They're both forms of stories. Stories are the way we learn. Stories are how we understand each other, but reality only happens once.\"Amidst\u00a0all of the unsettling moments are philosophical themes prominently displayed throughout the book. Reid explores the questions of solitude\u00a0and independence versus choosing to pair up with someone, life and death, and human connections. These sections of the novel were beautiful written. I highlighted so much of what was said.\"Sadness is a normal human condition, no different from happiness. You wouldn't think of happiness as an illness. Sadness and happiness need each other. To exist, each relies on the other...\"While this book is easily one you could read in a day or two due to its short length, I would recommend savoring it and picking it apart. I am looking forward to rereading this one because I'm positive the second read will be an entirely different experience.\u00a0Reading this book at night may not be the best idea. I would have liked a few things tied up more in the end but overall this novel was riveting!I would whole-heartedly recommend this book if you like books that leave you with a sinking feeling in your stomach with one caveat: this book won't be for every reader. I will warn you that this book is quite disturbing and dark. It's the scariest ride to \"meet the parents\" that I have ever read.* I received an advance copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\n____________________________I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS is one of my \nMost Anticipated Reads of 2016\n!!\n\nRead this Review \u2022 My Website \u2022 Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Pinterest \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Subscribe by Email****************\u2605\u2605UPCOMING BOOK RELEASES\u2605\u2605****************"}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "One thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never hear \u201cHey Good Lookin\u2019\u201d again with having chills go down my spine\u2026Iain Reid\u2019s novel is not for everyone. I think that you will either hate it, or, as I did, love it! Some reviewers termed it a \u2018mind f**k\u2019. I have to agree. It is the type of book, that to appreciate all the nuances, you have to read twice. Even though my TBR is long, I did go back and reread many pages in order to get my head around it. This review will be different because I can\u2019t say much without giving too much away\u2026I am a retired library cataloger. If I was still working and this book came across my desk I would have likely given it the genres \u2018psychological thriller\u2019 AND \u2018horror\u2019. It had a feel of Stephen King crossed with Minette Walters.The story begins with Jake and his \u2018girlfriend\u2019 traveling to his parents\u2019 farm in order that he might introduce her to them. The car conversation is overshadowed by the \u2018girlfriend\u2019s\u2019 thoughts. In fact most of the book is told from her point of view. The girlfriend is \u201cthinking of ending things\u2019 with Jake, although they seem quite well suited. She has not told him her intentions. Another thing that she has not told him is that she has an anonymous \u2018Caller\u2019 that sends her texts messages. Sometimes several times a night \u2013 AND they always come from her own phone number. The messages are always the same: \u201cThere\u2019s only one question to resolve\u2026\u201dJake is super-intelligent. He is a scientist, a reader, an intellectual, and a philosopher who has a great sense of humor. He met his \u2018girlfriend\u2019 at a pub\u2019s trivia night. They haven\u2019t been going out for long, just over a month. In this short time they have become close and have developed an intense attachment.The weather worsens as the day draws to a close. Their arrival at the farm is written in such a way that it makes you uncomfortable. Not overtly menacing, but menacing all the same\u2026 The parents are quirky and not altogether what one would expect.Refusing to stay the night, Jake and his \u2018girlfriend\u2019 leave the farm in the worsening storm. Weirdly, they stop at a Dairy Queen to get lemonade. Then when they want to get rid of the cups he travels a distance out of their way to go to an empty high school he knows of to dump the lemonade cups in the trash. He leaves the girlfriend in the car and takes the keys. When he doesn\u2019t return, she follows him into the school. That\u2019s when things get frightening and intense.This is an intelligent novel that expounds on loneliness and solitude (though this is done in such a way that it is almost incidental). It is a philosophical treatise on how fine a line there is between genius and madness. How you never really know another person.I can understand that the cerebral quality of the narrative would not appeal to some readers. Some just won\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019. I think I did \u2018get it\u2018, but then again, another reader might think the same and will have interpreted it a different way. As Edmund Wilson said: \u201cNo two persons ever read the same book\u201d. I just know I liked it. I liked that it made me think, it made me uneasy and ultimately it made me applaud what I believe to be an outstanding debut.Many thanks to Gallery/Scout Press via NetGalley for my digital copy of this novel in exchange for my unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "It's so difficult to review this book without explaining the book!

It gets in your head. There is this unnerving feeling that there is all this subtext going on just under the surface of what you're reading but you, the reader, can't get to it. The author has hidden it from you.There are certain reveals in the story where you *think* you've pulled a thread out to follow--a little theory to cling to but then that thread is quickly pulled away as the author leads you somewhere else.I'm not going to give you anything in this review.You are totally on your own as far as I'm concerned and it is my opinion that you should buy this book before someone spoils everything for you and read it straight through in one sitting.Then, follow the author's instructions when you're done.

At 224 pages, this can easily be read in one sitting and maybe the best way to enjoy it. My initial reaction on finishing this was too rude to be repeated here, and I was all set for a 2-stars rating. Then I went back to the first chapter and went over it again, and that's when I started to appreciate the real brilliance of this. As the road trip in the cold and dark to the remoteness of the parents' farm started, it was all quite slow with the most peculiar \"conversations\". It wasn't until the destination of dinner-with-the-parents was reached that I was really getting into this. From then on, I pretty much had to keep going just to discover how exactly things would be ending.As is already apparent from the reviews so far, this isn't a book for everyone and opinions will differ widely on this. Its promise of \"You will be scared\" wasn't quite delivered. But it had an unsettling and compelling atmosphere that kept you reading. I think readers who enjoy psychology and philosophy will enjoy this. If you're looking for a straightforward suspenseful psychological thriller or even traditional horror story, you may be disappointed because this is more literary fiction exploring the human condition. It really wasn't until I read over some of it again that I could see how cleverly constructed the entire plot was and how I missed little clues. Smart, for example, in the way the theme of the \"there's only one question to resolve\" kept getting picked up throughout the story and the \"are you good or are you bad?\". However, even after skimming it again, I'm still left with questions (the man outside the window? The girl in the Dairy Queen?). I find it quite difficult to rate this because a) I'm not sure how much of this was just too over my head, b) my first reaction to it was less than positive but c) the more time I'm spending with this and think about it, the higher I want to rate it. It's definitely very different, and I guess if a book stays with you like this and keeps you thinking about it, it deserves a better rating. Hence, 3.5 stars rounding up. An oddly entertaining experience.Thanks to Gallery Books for my copy via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Brandie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132341-brandie", "userReview": "I don't even know wtf I just read.
