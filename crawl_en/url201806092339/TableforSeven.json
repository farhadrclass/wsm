The novel is about seven people that decided to start a dinner club. What starts out as a dinner club soon turns into an interesting turn of events. As each member gets to know more about each other they learn even more importantly about themselves. Fran and Will have what seems to be an idealistic marriage but over time it has turned into a less than ideal life together. Jamie and Mark are a blended family. Jamie has a tough time dealing with Mark who has had a previous marriage and spends lots of time with his stepdaughter. Jamie has growing suspicions that Mark's stepdaughter isn't the only person he is seeing when he is away. Audrey is a widow of seven years that lost her husband and isn't too excited about reentering the dating poll. Coop is a bachelor with sex appeal and a reputation with the ladies. Leland is a seventy-five year old widower that has years of wisdom and a great personality.

The characters seem a bit more three dimensional than some \"fluffy\" books, but don't seem to take themselves to seriously. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Coop and Audrey develop and I was rooting for them the whole way. And I really enjoyed Leland, the retired neighbor. He was a unique character added to the mix and I am glad the author introduced him to us. The ending was good, without being too predictable, which sometimes happens.

Bring everyone together is Fran and Will Parrish. They\u2019re having a New Year\u2019s Eve party and in an effort to do something different, Fran preps a multi-course meal to count down to midnight. She\u2019ll serve one course on the hour leading up to midnight. No one really wants to go, but they end up having so much fun they decide to start up a very informal dinner club, with someone different hosting every month.I thought this was a very interesting set up. And with so many characters, the story flowed very well. There was no confusion of who or what because each person is going through something very different. Will and Fran have been married for just under 20 years. Fran\u2019s world is rocked that New Year\u2019s day when Will tells her to invite Cooper, his best friend. You see, Fran and Cooper had a moment very early on in her marriage. Nothing happened\u2026but she thinks if Will hadn\u2019t woken up when he did that day on the boat that Cooper would have kissed her. Ever since then, she\u2019s kind of had a little teeny tiny flame going for Cooper. They haven\u2019t seen him too much over the years and she\u2019s excited to learn he\u2019s moved to their coastal town. Maybe too excited?The other couple is Jaime and Mark. She\u2019s his second wife and she\u2019s struggling with Mark\u2019s schedule and his daughter\u2019s demands on his time. They have two young children together but she feels Mark is always off for Emily\u2019s tennis practice or tournaments. She thinks it\u2019s too much time and wonders if that\u2019s all he\u2019s doing.Audrey is Fran\u2019s best friend. She owns a successful spa and she\u2019s been a widow for 7 years. She\u2019s sick of Fran\u2019s attempts to set her up. Fran knows this so when she invites Audrey to that first dinner party, she doesn\u2019t want Audrey to think she\u2019s setting her up with Coop so Fran tells her he\u2019s gay. LOL That led to a few funny moments. But Audrey has trouble opening up. Her first husband was an alcoholic and she\u2019s refused to see the truth of her marriage\u2026and that\u2019s preventing her from opening up to anyone new. Coop hasn\u2019t had a real, long-term relationship ever in his life. He\u2019s definitely a bachelor through and through and he\u2019s definitely intrigued by Audrey (especially at first when she was super friendly with him, thinking he was gay). But she refuses to date him and his persistence definitely challenges both of them and their beliefs about relationships.The seventh member of the group is Leland. And he was my favorite. He\u2019s a retired judge, in his 80s and he was a great character. He was a great observer of the group dynamics and he gave gentle nudges where they were needed. He loved bacon. Cute character.So yeah, there were a few interesting things going on with this book. With Fran and Will, I was caught up in Will\u2019s obliviousness to what was going on with his wife. She was taking better care of her appearance and working out and dressing better. Everyone noticed but Will. So her getting caught up in a fantasy flirtation with Cooper makes sense. And then you realize she\u2019s getting ready to make a move and you just feel so bad for her, because you know he\u2019s fallen for Audrey. And Audrey is so the opposite about being open with her feelings, she doesn\u2019t even tell her best friend she slept with the guy. LOL I also enjoyed Jaime\u2019s path she took. She was so sure her husband was cheating on her she even followed him at one point and there was nothing to see. She really matured as a character. Same with Audrey. She really didn\u2019t want to deal with what happened with her husband and it was preventing her from moving on. It was so easy for her to rebuff Coop\u2019s charm\u2026something that made him try harder, something he hasn\u2019t had to do in a while.I liked all the characters (except one\u2026and no one cared for him either) and I liked the way all the stories unfolded. Because the author did a good job of giving us pieces of each story I read this pretty quickly. It was very engaging and I recommend it for when you need a break from all the New Adult you\u2019re reading.

All the guests have a lovely time and agree that this is a great way to spend an evening. That is when the Dinner for Seven Club is born. As time goes by and the dinner parties become monthly events, it soon becomes clear that there is much more going on in the lives of the Table for Seven Club members than it first appears. Will and Fran\u2019s marriage seems rock solid, but, the strain of dealing with an uncommunicative teenage daughter and what seems to be the methodical, uneventful passing of the years starts to produce cracks in their relationship. Audrey, is usually the target of Fran\u2019s well intended match making but she needs to find her own way to move on after being widowed seven years previously. Audrey and Fran\u2019s perfectionist friend, Jamie, the second wife of Mark, suspects him of having an affair. Will\u2019s oldest friend, Coop, is a confirmed bachelor and doesn\u2019t know how to handle being in love so steers well away from it. Will and Fran\u2019s neighbour, Leland, a retired Judge, enjoys the company. It is a change for him to spend time with younger people and he brings wise counsel and insightful guidance to the group. The Dinner for Seven Club changes all of their lives forever.This is a lovely book about friendship, relationships, love, emotional support and of course, food! Whitney Gaskell weaves the characters together perfectly and it is instantly clear how each person is connected to the other. As the story develops so the relationships between them all change and grow. Some bonds get stronger, some start to fracture and some break altogether. It is because of the prose and realistic conversation that this book is so enjoyable. It is funny and poignant at times and provides the reader a great way to escape for a few hours. Table for Seven is the first book of Whitney Gaskell\u2019s I have read and it will not be the last. I checked out her website to see what else she has written and found that she writes a really funny blog too. I love her sense of humour, wit and the frequent, seething road rage she feels when in the school drop off queue. She doesn\u2019t mind using the odd profanity to make a point clearer and sharper, which in my mind puts her right into the \u201cmy kinda gal\u201d category.

The group of friends had so much fun that they decided to make it a monthly thing. You get to see the menus in the beginning of each month, each couple (or single) has everyone over and cooks for them. They take a turn so it isn\u2019t a big deal. The food seemed absolutely delicious although I loved Leland\u2019s menu the most as it seemed more I could relate with.Each person or couple had a set of problems they were dealing with such as Fran and Will, having to face their marriage turning stale. Jaime and Mark, the thought of an affair in the mix. Coop, who is single and seems to fall for also single Audrey. Audrey who is still getting over the death of her husband 7 years prior and isn\u2019t ready to date or fall in love. Loveable Leland who is a widower himself and also seems to be the guy that dishes out the very wise advice when people need it.I kind of wished there was more of Leland in it because I really enjoyed his parts. There was a lot of foreshadowing about what his end would be but it still had me in tears anyway. I really liked following the different couples problems and anyone that has been in a relationship for any amount of time has faced a majority of the issues touched on in Table for Seven.The only problem that I had with a good majority of the book as well as their dinner parties was that they drank so much wine and alcohol during these dinner parties but yet, there was really no mention except towards the end on how they made it home in one piece. It bugged me a bit. It was mentioned some times that the others were driving someone home, someone had started on water earlier in the evening and things like that.Jaime and Mark\u2019s situation was the most surprising to me, not because of what happened but rather who was involved. Fran and Will, they were a little different and it is a common thing to take your marriage for granted and I liked that it shows that you have to keep working at it and not let it go stagnant or someone might stray.In the end, the book was fantastic and made me hungry! I had no problems visualizing the food they were eating because the details were there. I loved the menu\u2019s at the front of the chapters, I thought it gave it a fantastic touch. This is definitely a book anyone can relate to and love.

I loved how the food sounded so detailed and how it sounded so good. I loved how the characters interacted with each other. I loved how everyone in the book got along until the end. Let's start with the characters. Will and Fran are married and they have two kids, Iris and Rory. Iris is tough to handle, with her dating a senior in high school and getting arrested in the book. Jaime and Mark are married, but I was mad and sad when they got divorced in the end of the book. I was mad at Mark for cheating on Jaime with his ex wife, who always barged into things that didn't involve her. Mark even talked bad about his wife, so he didn't seem like he was having an affair with her. Mark and Jaime have two children, Logan and Ava. Mark had a child with his ex wife, Libby, and her name is Emily. Emily is obsessed with Tennis, which makes Mark obsessed with it too. Leland is an old man that is widowed. He can cook, and he has a dog that snores. Audrey is also a widow. Her drunken husband died in a car accident seven years earlier, and Audrey still grieves him. Lastly, Coop (Preston Cooper) is a flirt. He's dated many girls, and is known by being self-centered. In the end of the book, Fran has a crush on him and almost ends her marriage with Will. Let's get to what happens in the book. The characters start the dinner club at the New Year's Eve party hosted by Will and Fran and call it the Table For Seven. Each of the members and their spouses take turns on hosting the dinner club. All goes well so far. Well, not exactly. Mark starts cheating on his wife with Libby, his ex wife. This ends their marriage. Leland gets a heart attack or a stroke and dies at the end of the book, and Audrey takes his dog and takes care of it. Coop falls in love with Audrey and they get together as boyfriend and girlfriend. Fran falls in love with Coop, but Coop isn't in love with her and turns her down. Fran feels bad and goes to confess to her husband. Will isn't sure he wants to be with Franny anymore. Iris, Will and Fran's daughter almost gets arrested by driving without a license and speeding.

The author really liked to tell how meals were prepared as she narrated the chapters, each with a complete menu as the heading. The book, set in Florida, begins when one couple decided to have a dinner party on New Year's Eve.Because they did not want to seem to be setting up their widowed friend, they included an elderly widower and a forty-something single man, along with another couple, as their holiday guests. All the people, except for the elderly gentleman, were in their forties.It took a while for me to get the characters in the two marriages and their situations in mind. While each chapter was based on one of the monthly meals that followed their New Year's Eve Dinner, the reader was invited into the lives of the people between times -- their jobs, their families, and so forth. By the middle of the book, the actions of each individual and the relationships among the seven became quite interesting as their times together were reflected between the monthly get-togethers. The \"Table for Seven\" group took the summer off and began again in the fall. Relationships began, ended, faltered, and some were reconfigured. Most of the narratives about their lives seemed believable and sounded like authentic possibilities. From the author, there was an economy of words used, never did any part seem overstated. Although it was not a difficult read, it did require some thinking about the consequences of thoughts and actions among friends. I liked most of the people in the group, and I was not quite ready for the book to end.
