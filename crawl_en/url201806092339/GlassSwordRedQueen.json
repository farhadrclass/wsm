I sensed it coming but it was just as epic as I hoped. I felt less chemistry between Mare and Cal in this book (even though I'm #teamMaven I still loved Cal in the first) and while I could be dead wrong, here is what I think: Victoria is setting us up for a Warner-esque (of Tahereh Mafi's Shatter Me) love story between Mare and Maven. I know it makes no sense -he committed countless unexcusable crimes (a la Darkling and Warner)- but do we know for sure that was him? Do we really? Did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book? No. Okay, well technically, he did hurt Mare with that branding thing but.... Gah. I just feel like there is some sort of explanation. Maybe somehow it protects her? I dunno. I just know there is more to the story. And all of the BAD things that DID happen, Cersei -excuse me, Elara, was still alive and well. And do we know why she was in the prison? Do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out? Why was her hair graying and her appearance worn? I tell you why: because there is more to this whole \"Maven is evil\" business than meets the eye. I am getting very strong Juliette (of Shatter Me) vibes where Mare is going to start to understand or find out more about Maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series. I am wishing for a HEA between M&M but most likely I think she will help save him from himself and end up with Cal or alone. Maven is not pure evil and I don't think he is the villain the way we think he is. I think there are other factors at play that will be revealed -like how we thought Warner was pure evil in Shatter Me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels.\n\"No one is born a monster.\" But I wish some people were. It would make it easier to hate them, to kill them, to forget their dead faces. \"Even Maven.\" I'm sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well. SHADES OF GRAY, PEOPLE, SHADES OF GRAY.>>Now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking. Your reaction to my prediction is probably this:And you can throw a hundred things Maven did in my face and tell me I can't explain all of that away.There are people who read Shatter Me who refused to forgive Warner. I realize rooting for Maven is crazy to a rational eye, but in books I tend to love and sympathize with the villain and I'm sorry but reading that ending where Mare has given herself over to Maven in exchange for everyone's freedom... I just know there is so much potential there.Maybe I'm wrong and he really is a psychopath. But I got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book. I'm sorry but I'm just not getting an epic love story for Cal & Mare, I think she is going to fall for Maven & try to save him from himself in the next two books. I could be dead wrong and I realize I sound crazy, but I'm telling you, I think there is more to Maven than the villain Victoria has been leading us to believe. She's a master at twists and I am TELLING YOU that I think Maven is her trump card. I think Maven is end game for this series and I do not think he is pure evil even though we've only been offered evidence of the contrary. I'm calling it and if I'm wrong, well maybe I am, but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white, evil and good. This series is going to be about SHADES OF GRAY.Final notes: Why oh why did I have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with Maven? I know why. Because Victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but it's exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book (there's four planned now, right?). Glass Sword did have second-book syndrome -it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned, but it was truly necessary for the stage Victoria is planning to set. We all saw what she was capable in Red Queen, and I have faith the next two books will be a non-stop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters (I see what you did there!) so that she can let blood fly in the next. Did I love this book more than Red Queen? No. But I think Victoria did an excellent job preparing us for what's to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book.

My dislike for first books like Cinder and The Winner's Curse turned into love for the later books in the series. So I thought I'd give Aveyard a second chance.No disrespect intended, but I really do struggle to understand the popularity of this series. Nothing about it is particularly good or compelling. YA fantasy is made up of lots of fluff, but even the lightest of romantic fantasies generally offer some excitement, some pull, even if the world-building is scarce and it is heavily diluted by romance.This sequel offers nothing like that. The prose is bland and the plot contains a lot of meandering between places and constant repetition. Mare's narrative is tiresome and dull, going over the same thoughts about Cal, Maven and her own specialness. Only the last few chapters contain any real action or story development - the rest of the book shows the characters going from place to place in search of those with special abilities who can help their mission.The author is too lazy to craft thought-provoking scenes and characters, only ever writing something or someone when it furthers Mare\u2019s mission. Everything feels orchestrated around the super special Mare, none of the characters have their own identity or purpose, which makes it not only boring, but also turns every character into a chess piece, a stereotype, and a trope. Glass Sword introduces many new characters and not a single one of them is memorable.And Mare alone cannot carry this story. If, perhaps, her character had been so strong and interesting that it didn't really matter about the one-dimensional other characters, then maybe this book wouldn't have been terrible. But Mare is neither a likable character, nor an anti-heroine that demands your sympathy anyway. She's an immature, often stupid, mess.Mare blends in with a sea of forgettable fantasy heroines. Even her flaws are not portrayed as such; her first-person narrative so self-obsessed. She's arrogant; always concerned with her own power and mission. She's selfish; often forgetting her family even exist and rarely expressing emotion befitting the situation. If you enjoy reading about super special heroines, stick with Throne of Glass. If you'd rather read about a fascinating and morally questionable anti-heroine, then check out The Young Elites.For everything you could possibly be looking for, I can suggest a better book/series than this one. Unless you are actively seeking poor writing and boredom.The late dose of action couldn't save the book, nor could the ending that is more cliffhanger than resolution. It is a boring, derivative fantasy that only stands out from the crowded genre when it sits dazzling prettily on a bookshelf.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "FREAKING AVEYARD AND HER FREAKING FINALES THAT HAVE YOUR HEAD SPINNING.

Unavoidable spoilers from book #1.\n\u201cAttend to your own fate, Mare Barrow.\u201d\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\u201cTo rise. And rise alone.\u201d\nAs I sat wallowing in self-pity, speechless, angry at this cruel world, I had a revelation -- Victoria Aveyard enjoys being an evil mastermind. She enjoys making me laugh, fall in love with countless characters at the same time and then drown into an endless puddle of my own tears. And she does it with such glorious creativity that, even though my heart is breaking into shards of glass, I cannot help but applaud her every time her writing mojo blows away my mind. She's done it twice already. First, with Red Queen. And now, with a sequel worthy of its predecessor -- Glass Sword. Glass Sword is unputdownable. If it weren't for Christmas chores and drooping eyes, I would've read it back to back, because from the beginning you're caught in a whirlwind of action, intrigue and betrayal and you cannot shut the damned book. The fast pace sets the tone, but some profound, haunting psychological echoes reframe a darker atmosphere. \nThis sequel brings the story of Red Queen to a whole other level, exploiting the divide between Reds and Silvers in a realistic manner -- new allegiances are made, old enemies gamble their power, queens and kings fall to their knees and some of them kneel with bleeding hearts. The hunt for newbloods is on and Mare has to save as many as she can while trying to patch up the deep scars Maven carved into her soul. \nAnd this is where the main big difference between these installments lays. Mare. The time spent with the Silvers molded her into something entirely unique -- Red and Silver alike, not just her blood and abilities, but her mentality as well. Mare, at her core, remains the heroine we've been introduced to in the first book. She's strong. She's badass. She's selfish around the edges. She's brave and she's cunning. But she's shackled by guilt. She's haunted by memories. She's weaving webs of lies and she's loosing herself into an abyss of heartache and, not surprisingly, fear. Who wouldn't after such treacherous events? Not to mention her trust issues that, even if they resemble paranoia sometimes, are good reasoned. \n\u201cIf I am a sword, I am a sword made of glass, and I feel myself beginning to shatter.\u201d\nHowever, I adored her. I had a bit of a trouble supporting her in the prequel thanks to her double faced demeanor, but now she had my unwavering respect and admiration. I know some readers will feel conflicted about her occasional stumble into merciless, ruthless, vindictive and Silver-like behavior, but I felt it justified, although sad. And for the love of gods, she tries so hard and so much in this book to keep everyone safe, to concoct moves and countermoves, to get rid of her emotional instability, to escape Maven's shadow and to change the world a little bit. To make a difference. The little lightning girl is not so little anymore and I could not help but love her, because even though she loses a lot of fights with inner and outer demons, Mare always had the courage to battle for her beliefs. \n\n\u201cI see you as you could become, no longer the lightning, but the storm. The storm that will swallow the world entire.\u201d\nCal is also a great difference. He reminded me of Celaena in so many ways. Gone is the prince in his overwhelming intensity; a boy with nightmares, a thirst for revenge and endless loneliness remains. I think he's even more lost than Mare is, because his home, his people, his whole goddamn country want him dead and he's running away from people he used to care deeply for. That kind of messes with his head and it triggers subtle changes in his personality and behavior, but still -- I. Loved. Him. To. Bits. He's tough. Loyal. Kickass. And quite swoony -- a scene with him and a child had me dying of FEELS. \n\n\u201cI made mistakes because of him. And,\u201d he adds quietly, \u201cI made mistakes because of you.\u201d\nNow on to the most interesting character of them all -- Maven. He was exactly like The Darkling in Siege & Storm -- not there but for a few sparse pages, but always there. You get it or I'm talking nonsense? His presence was almost palpable for he is constant in our main characters' thoughts and whenever he does make an appearance, he only instates his wicked, power-hungry, cruel ways, making it even harder for the rest to escape his mental grasp. He's strong, cold and calculated and a wonderfully nuanced complex villain -- I'm anxious and enthusiastic at the same time for what it's to come. \n\n\u201cNo heart can ever be truly understood. Not even your own.\u201d\nI have to warn you beforehand -- the romance is certainly not the focus. Actually, I could say that it barely survived the aftermath of book 1. You can wave the fragile \"love triangle\" goodbye. With Maven not being physically present for most of the story, that leaves us with Mare and Cal and, um, well, to say that their relationship is complicated would be the understatement of the year. Each of them got burned by the other and they have walls in place to maintain distance. Arghh, and there's tension. And wildness. And desire. Regrets upon regrets. They still use and hurt each other. But, paradoxically, they protect one another despite their past. AND I JUST LOVED THAT. It's no secret I shipped Mare and Cal to the moon and back, so I'll admit I devoured every scene with these two in it, especially those where they just crumble without the other nearby. *happy sigh* \n\n\u201cI must keep my eyes ahead, and away from the fire of a fallen prince. I must freeze my heart to the one person who insists on setting it ablaze.\u201d\nTo Maven's fans -- don't worry, Mare still clings to him no matter how much she tells herself not to. So you see, we have a confusing, effed up mess, one deliciously agonizing. Let\u2019s get to what is also known as my new favorite secondary characters. Shade and Kilorn. And even Farley. THEY WERE ASDFGHJKL. Shade especially. I completely fell in love with Shade -- he was a great addition to the cast. He's clever, easy going and just cute, not to mention that his love for his sister was awww worthy. \nKilorn evolved quite much. I mean, I don't hate him anymore. I love him now. He's a central piece to the story and despite his \"uselessness\" he proves to be a good friend, a brave soldier and an all-around great guy. His friendship with Mare was awesome and my heart ached for his unreturned romantic feelings -- I might bless a possible Kilorn and Mare couple. I might. \nAnd Farley was another kickass chick I was glad we spent more time with. She's just, courageous and determined. Plus, her fate brings a bittersweet smile on my face whenever I think about it (you can't bribe me to spill the beans). \nI have to admit there were a few flaws (but not major enough to deflect my boundless love for this book). The newbloods plotline develops and tons of characters are introduced, some of them memorable and some of them not. The world-building is not extraordinary, although we get to venture in new cities (not that it ever was in RQ) and the Red Guard only has a minor role in current events, keeping its enigmatic traits. The mild reminiscences of Shatter Me linger, but this time they are coupled with Breaking Dawn and The Young Elites deja-vus due to the expansion of the newbloods' power palette. Nonetheless, there are some characters that have managed to amaze me with their original abilities and I had an overall sense of badassery every time their lot became the focus. I do have one slight regret though -- I would have liked to know each one better, because there was a gold mine of awesomeness for side stories. Expect twists and turns. The jaw-dropping kind. The clever ones. The shit-God-no-I-wanna-go-back kind and also the yeah-you-are-going-down-bitches kind. These twists are part of what makes GS a thrilling sequel -- no one is safe, no newblood, no Red and, for once, no Silver. And I CRIED A LOT THANKS TO THESE TWISTS.\nBut HOLY GODS THAT FREAKING ENDING. I had tears streaming down my face because I thought the book will most likely end on a sorrowful note, you know, I expected that, but then shit just hit the fan, K-BOOM, pow-pow, things I didn't expect happened in a matter of a few lines and I was left crumbling on a cliffhanger that gutted me. Nooo, the author just couldn't have kept me sane and I AM HERE WONDERING HOW TO FAST-FORWARD MY LIFE TO GET MY HANDS ON THE NEXT BOOK, because while the last few pages killed me, the epilogue pretty much stomped on my grave. \n\u201cLove blinds.\u201d\n\nThe decision to expand this series into a four-volume saga couldn't have been more right, because there's no way in hell Aveyard could tie up all the loose ends we're left with in just one novel. And even if she would, there are worlds to be explored. Kings to be conquered. Queens to be made. And you don't want that exquisite potential to feel rushed. Regardless, I have a feeling the dynamic will change dramatically in the third book. \n\n\u201cI am a weapon made of flesh, a sword covered in skin.\u201d\nGlass Sword was an electrifying sequel (shhh, let my pun be). It was an emotional roller coaster, one careening towards an explosive final, riveting, surprising, vivid and glorious. It made me cry, smile in anticipation and crave more and more of this enthralling universe. Glass Sword is exactly what a sequel should be and I cannot wait to see what the dawn brings for these amazing characters. ENJOY! <3P.S.

I'm not saying this because I found the plot slow like I read on many reviews, or because it suffered from second-book-syndrome, but because for the first time in my life I wanted to physically hurt the heroine with such a seething passion. It's like Mare's face was calling for my fist.Mare is a horrible, horrible person.I gave up every effort to understand her and instead I started imagining which death is more appropriate for her. She kept acting like a martyr and God's greatest creation and gift to all those unfortunate souls who were not powerful and amazing like her. Hey your Superiorness, I have news for you! Power doesn't come from the random ability to manipulate the elements around you, power can be found in sharp minds and kind hearts. Your lack of brain and heart makes you a weak and pathetic brat that only cares about herself and the other newbloods and ignores everyone else. There was actually a point where she wondered how Kilorn managed to survive since he was no one, just a simple fisher boy! I am not a fan of Kilorn (I found him annoying most of the times but he surprisingly grew on me towards the end) but I wanted to cut my arm and throw it at her! Always thinking her decisions are the best, always ignoring the voice of reason, always so self-righteous and self-involved, eager to manipulate and control, to sacrifice others for her own purposes. The way she kept judging and blaming Cal made my blood boil. She accused him of fearing to act when he wanted to show mercy, a concept unknown to her, she judged him for not trying to make things better for the poor when she was the one who stole from the poor to satisfy her selfish needs, and I keep wondering how did she know that he wouldn't change things when he never had the chance. She turned his world upside down, she betrayed him and took everything from him, she was his downfall.I hate her.\n\n\u201cKneel or bleed.\u201d \n\nAnd I also hate Maven. I can't find any redeeming quality in him, I knew from the very start how rotten and corrupted he was. He's not a misguided soul that started off as good and lost his way, he didn't exprerience an upleasant childhood or a trauma that made him this monster, he is just evil. He craves power, he's full of jealousy and hatred, he.murdered.babies. for heaven's sake to make a point! But I can't help but admit he's one of the reasons that made this book so gripping, while he had very few scenes, he was always present, making you shiver.\n\u201cI am your rightful king, Silver-born for centuries. The only reason you're still breathing is because I can't burn the oxygen from this room.\u201d \nI love Cal. He's the victim of the worst betrayal, he has no one, he is no one, he clings to Mare and tries to salvage the humanity that's left in her but he rarely succeeds. He doesn't belong anywhere, he's broken and scarred but he's still noble, he endures the mistrust and the insults and he starts to realize the awfully wrong way the world works. He is smart and kind and by far the best character in this book. I just want to hug him and tell him everything's going to be alright.As for the plot, I loved the idea of recruiting newbloods, it reminded me of Professor X and Magneto in X-Men First Class (only they did not force anyone to join them) and Hunger Games at the same time, with the revolution brewing. There were times I wished Victoria Aveyard didn't elaborate so much in some scenes, but in general I found Glass Sword action-packed and I was constantly afraid of what was about to happen next, I was fully invested to the story with its schemes and beautifully crafted fight scenes and plot-twists! And of course, the world-building was utterly intriguing, the blend of modern technology and dystopia and high fantasy is what won me over in the first place!\n\n\u201cI am a weapon made of flesh, a sword covered in skin. I was born to kill a king, to end a reign of terror before it can truly begin.\u201d\n\n(well you gave this reign of terror the chance to begin but there's no point repeating that, right?)Victoria Aveyard is without a doubt a very talented author, and the fact that she created so many flawed and three dimensional characters and inflicted so many emotions (albeit the most dominant ones were wrath and terror) is proof enough! The cliffhanger though shattered any resolve I had left, which meansI need some anger management sessions."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35007929-cody", "userReview": "Glass Sword picks up straight after the explosive ending of Red Queen. Mare and Cal are now with the Scarlet Guard but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re safe, far from it. They're being hunted down by Maven, who is now the King of Norta. The race is on to find these so-called \u2018New Bloods\u2019: Reds who possess the powers of Slivers, the only question is, who will get to them first; Mare or Maven? It\u2019s really hard to talk about Glass Sword without giving away spoilers but anyway the whole point of the book is to track down these New Bloods, King Maven will obviously send them to their death as they undermine his rule, after all Mare was portrayed to be Mareena Titanos, a lost Sliver girl living with Reds. Mare wants to find the new bloods to protect them from Maven\u2019s wrath, she gives them a choice, runaway or join The Scarlet Guard who's mission is to dethrone the sadistic King. So it\u2019s basically a wild goose chase for Mare, she must find the New Bloods before Maven, protect her family, as well as avoiding capture because she\u2019s now a traitor to the crown.Mare changes a lot in this book and not all of it was for the better, she was cunning, ruthless and sometimes cruel. I actually expected this change, in order for Mare to go up against Maven and his mother she needed to evolve and look at her past mistakes. However, Mare became my biggest problem, she lost the fire she had in Red Queen and instead became this husk of herself. I think she also suffered from a huge case of delusions of grandeur; her powers became somewhat god-like in Glass Sword and instead of giving of the impression of \u2018Mare, Queen of Reds\u2019, there was a lot of cringing and eye-rolling and just get on with it moments!So, I think everyone knew my opinions on the romance of RQ and I can happily say this love-square is over! There are no new love interests for Mare, thank god but the romance for Glass Sword is pretty much a giant question mark, it changes depending on Mare\u2019s moods, I\u2019d like to think I know what\u2019s going to happen but honestly Glass Swords feels like a completely different book at this point, so anything is possible\u2026. I guess.There was a lot of adventure in this book, I loved being able to explore Norta more and in addition to adventure we got heaps of action. Speaking of action, can I just take a moment to fully appreciate our exiled Price of fire, Cal? WHOA, my only complaint is I wanted, needed more of him and if I\u2019m honest, a lot less Mare ha! Okay, not my only complaint, basically my biggest one is with a certain action scene, basically someone died but it wasn\u2019t explained at all. The whole chapter was a mess and wasn't until the next chapter that you realise 'said character' died? Huh! *sigh*Overall Glass Sword is somewhere between a 3-4 star read, it just wasn\u2019t able to grip me in the way RQ did and sometimes it was a struggle to carry on reading. The cliffhanger was so shocking, heartbreaking and fantastic but it didn\u2019t really make up for everything else. As much as I would like to blame the hype with this one, I really must blame myself, I was expecting A LOT more, Glass Sword is a good book but in order to follow Red Queen, I think it needed to be a great book and sadly it just wasn\u2019t.Literary-ly Obsessed (Blog) | Twitter | Instagram Updates, before readingCOVER REVEAL: GLASS SWORDI LOVE IT!TITLE REVEAL: GLASS SWORDPlease tell me I'm not the only one still rooting for Cal & Mare?

That last chapter. That last sentence.Glass Sword was one of my most anticipated 2016 reads and it completely lived up to the hype, making it a fantastic sequel to Red Queen.Without giving away spoilers, Glass Sword started right in the action, basically right where Red Queen left off. The main focus of Glass Sword is to search for and recruit others like Mare Barrow for the uprising against Silver Royalty.After reading Red Queen almost a year ago, I impatiently awaited the sequel, but I was also apprehensive. Would it live up to the first book? It most certainly did! The entire story was like watching an action movie. No boring lulls in the middle of the story, no dull scenes slowing the narrative down.Mare develops as a character\u2014she becomes harder, colder, and it\u2019s completely understandable and justifiable. Ironically, I like her because I don\u2019t like her as a person. She makes mistakes, she makes bad decisions, and she\u2019s selfish. It was wonderful to see her change from a scared and unconfident girl in Red Queen to a bold and powerful woman in Glass Sword.My only criticism is at around the halfway point, we saw a whole group of new characters introduced in the span of just a few chapters, which made it a bit difficult to remember who is who and who has what powers.Glass Sword ended on such a high note. I think Victoria Aveyard is becoming the queen of plot twists! The set up for the next book looks ridiculously exciting.Thanks to Orion Publishing Group for providing me with an ARC of Glass Sword from NetGalley!"}, {"userName": "Dorreh", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22599584-dorreh", "userReview": "It's actually more of a 3.5. I just can't make up my mind about how I feel.Warning: review must be read till the ending to understand the stars...........I'm not sure what made me feel negative towards this book from the beginning. I guess you really shouldn't read the reviews for a book before you've read it yourself, especially if you're planning on reading the book either way. Since I opened the first page I had a sense of distaste towards it, that continued until page 200 or so. To be very honest my bias wasn't entirely unjustified. The first half was bad, and I don't mean to be crude, but it just wasn't entertaining or even truly bearable. Maybe it was the fact that I loved red queen so much, so the disappointment hit me harder than it should have. The first and biggest flaw was the dramatic monologues. The way mare kept overestimating and underestimating herself at the same time. Yes I know monologues are a vital part of characters and their personalities, but I found them more annoying than anything. It wasn't just the self pity, it was like she couldn't decide who she is. A self centered egotistical killer, a breakable weapon, or smitten heartbroken puppy. Honestly thats how it went, from conflict to confused to self assured to messy goo and the cycle would start again. So mare annoyed the living crap out of me for about 200 pages to be exact. Then there was a turn of events.The pace started to pick up, and the storyline started to change all together. It went from the repetitive revolution theme to something more creative and interesting. Honestly I thought this would be like MOKINGJAY, a book which I was also terribly disappointed with. Simply because nothing happens until the last 20 pages or so. Then everything in the span of the next 10 years, revolting included occurs in the last few chapters. But thankfully it wasn't the case here. Things began to pick up pace then got better and better. I think it was mostly that the book stopped revolving around mare entirely. And towards the end I was reminded why I loved red queen so damn much.The ending was the worlds most dramatic cliff hanger. And shade was probably my most adored character, so I'll probably be in this emotional wreckage for the next few days. I'm so incredibly sorry that such a wonderful ending had to be tainted by that beginning. But I think the struggle of the begging was worth it once I got to the second half. It was truly an excellent second half. So the stars are purely for the second half, the first half is a zero from me. There's no doubt that Victoria Aveyard is a talented author, albeit an inconsistent one. The story telling and characterization of red queen are proof of this. So I'll give the next book the benefit of the doubt.Let's see how the third book will make me feel."}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "[Edit: I'm lowering my rating, because the more I learn about this series, the angrier it makes me. New developments assure me that this book, and this series in fact, deserve no stars, and I'm not sorry for that. I'm only extremely pissed off because this book is the definition of taking advantage in a very, very unpleasant way.]This book is 400 pages of nothing.I could tell you that this book is about Mare and Co. travelling all over the country to find newbloods, building a resistance, and performing a heist, and when you hear it described that way, it sounds like it has a plot, right? Well, it doesn't. Somehow, this book still manages to be about nothing. Mare's gone dark; I can't tell if I'm supposed to sympathize with her, because I don't, not in the slightest. I can't tell if this is a smart move by the author, or if this whole book is just an amoral mess (though I suspect the latter. The odds are stacked against the former, because there's nothing smart about this book. There's nothing book about this book. It's like a really long Reddit post). I try not to look for morality in books, but with dystopia? Meh. It's a genre built on morality and revolution. Dystopia naturally raises moral questions and this book does not have the wherewithal to deal with them. It just flounders. There are some decent setups for discourse but it's all glossed over in favour of Mare's wretched internal monologue. She goes through the mangle, and I respect that. Totally. I think it's brave to create a character who's flawed and a total grey area. But this book doesn't have the sophistication to deal with that in any way beyond, \"I hurt inside, ouch, I am a pit of despair, that violin isn't big enough, play me a cello!\". There aren't layers here. Me and Ally laughed about this because it's like those 2007 emo kids, when Mare mopes around internally thrashing herself and saying shit like, \"I'm so alone\" and \"they all fear me\" and \"I let the shadows engulf me\" every second paragraph. It's like in high school when we used to smoosh our undyed hair over one eye (I wasn't allowed to dye mine) and wore two studded belts and yelled, \"It's not a phase, Mum!\" Mare may as well slouch around in holey jeans and black lacy shirts and fingerless gloves screaming, \"Nobody understands me!\" and \"You're all posers!\" It's like in the Grisha series (LOL, in more ways than one) where the characters seem deep but they aren't. Where are the moral questions? Why aren't they being asked? At one point there was a great opportunity for some serious, heavyweight, important discussion surrounding the hollowness and pointlessness of revenge and enduring hatred, but god, this book won't flex its muscles except to talk about the darkness of Mare's soul. The author may as well have quoted My Chemical Romance lyrics as an introduction.In all seriousness, there is no seriousness. Instead, all of these 400 pages are distracted by Mare's moaning, Mare's thirst for revenge, Mare learning nothing despite everything she's been through. I have no qualms about her becoming a monster - I'll continue this series if she turns into a villain - but this book just completely missed the point and busied itself with crap. The title of this book should have been WON'T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN? because this book is obsessed with kids, and how kid deaths are so much sadder than adult deaths, because apparently adults deserve to die more? I never understand the idea that throwing kids into the mix makes a situation more pathetic and heart wrenching. It's like when, just to solidify their evilness, a bad guy kicks the dog. It's just using the age-old emotionally manipulative clich\u00e9 of sad cute things to try and get a rise out of readers. Suzanne Collins was one who treated this with far more finesse: Rue was a kid and her death was part of a narrative that explored specifically the weaponization of children, the culling of future generations to protect an outdated and brutal regime, and that very issue of using children to manipulate adults. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but it really, really called to me throughout this book, and it feels like a supremely cheap way to create your Big Bad Dystopia. Cal was the most interesting part of this book for me, probably because his struggle was the only marginally authentic part of it all: he's sort of like Akiva, where he knows his past actions can't be forgiven, but that there's a grey area of whose fault they were, and that he's the product of a morally violent and prejudiced upbringing. He knows that that prejudice can't be unravelled overnight and he struggles with it. He's fully aware that there have been atrocities committed in his family name and that he has been complicit in those atrocities, but the past can't be undone; he has to move forward and deal with it in any way that he can. He has to pick up the scraps of who he is and try to find a future for himself. His interactions with Mare were frustrating, but I do feel like both characters were in their element when they sparked off one another. The rest of the cast were grey to me, totally lacking any sort of personality, save perhaps for Farley, who's been partially ruined since all of her honour and her brutality and intelligence is thrown away by making her into this sort of strange caricature who does nothing but throw up. Farley has lost her edge, and that was what made her semi-interesting in Red Queen (It's all relative. There are absolutely no interesting characters in this series. None whatsoever. I would rather rip out all of my piercings than read a turgid novella about any of them). But I can't say I'm really that upset. The secondary characters are all so woefully underdeveloped that I just cannot force myself to give a shit. Even Shade's death was a sort of \"Oh, okay.\" Like it's sad and everything, but Shade never felt real to me. He was just so obviously words on paper. There was nothing of that transformative energy that some books had, like when I cried over Illuminae and Dreams of Gods and Monsters and got all angry at The Order of the Phoenix when Umbridge fucked shit up at Hogwarts (and physically abused the students! Shouldn't she have been struck off? I'm still so fucking angry about it.)But Glass Sword's basic bare bones are showing their cracks, too, like with the writing. It barely holds together for the first three hundred pages, occasionally hitting the mark with certain pieces of dialogue and a bit of creepy Foe Yay with Mare and Maven, but it totally falls apart in the final act. It shreds itself like a boat approaching the Mountain of Adamant. Even the extremely basic technical aspects of it fail spectacularly. I don't know what happened at the three hundred page mark, but the interrobangs suddenly veer out of control and the run-on sentences are rampant. Look at this piece on page 398 of the paperback:'He reacts as I expect him to. \"You fool, you brought Silvers here?!\" he shouts, panicking. \"Ready guns!\"'What is that. Honest to god. Not only is there a run on sentence and a completely unnecessary dialogue tag, but that interrobang is like stepping on a lego. Interrobangs, in published works, just like caps lock, are unbelievably unpolished and unprofessional. They're just so messy and I can't believe so many editors and an agent allowed interrobangs to make it into the final finished manuscript. There's also this weird and extreme overuse of italics that I think might be trying to indicate Mare's inner thoughts, but it's redundant, since this book is written in first person. (I'm really starting to hate first person.) As with the first book, I had no expectations of this one - I read it because I found it in Waterstone's a week early, and I was curious. Everybody loved it, and I wondered if I wasn't just missing something. Maybe I just didn't get the first book. But this one was terrible, just 440 pages of filler. It's the embodiment of Middle Book Syndrome. And all of this - the abysmal writing, the shameful plot, the shite characters - pales in comparison to the morally reprehensible way that this series came about. It came about because a team of people said, \"Let's find a way to make a fuckton of money with as little effort as possible\". Well, congrats, guys. Good job, Victoria Aveyard. You just gave a case to every old elitist white man who claims that YA is just a trashy money machine. YA isn't anything like that, but you made it look like it is. And not only that, but you cut books, precious books, into nothing but huge gross dollar signs.

Thank you a lot! |Blurb: Mare Barrow\u2019s blood is red\u2014the color of common folk\u2014but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince\u2014the friend\u2014who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors. But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat. After a few days where I was supposed to make peace with certain things that happened in this book, I\u2019ve come with the following conclusion:I have no idea how the fuck I\u2019m supposed to feel about this story and I\u2019m this close to give up on the whole thing.I\u2019m utterly disappointed in Aveyard, to be quite honest. She had a chance to redeem herself with this book and she just threw it away. There were only two things I liked about this story and I\u2019ll talk about them later. Let me explain why this turned out a disaster for me.Alright, you may not remember but when I finished reading Red Queen I said I needed Mare to level up and start being a cunning girl. She has potential but when it comes to explore she either is afraid or messes it up.I could not stand her at all. She was low HIGH key in a never ending sorry fest that had me wanting to stab her for like 99% of the book. I just didn\u2019t get her! WHY WAS SHE MOPPING ABOUT? Oh, poor Mare, she was fooled by Maven. Oh, poor little girl, she was hurt. Sweet innocent child can\u2019t trust anyone\u2026 I had to put the book down more than 7 times just because of her and her effing whining attitude.Oh, when she tried to be \u201cbad-ass\u201d? Whining tough wannabe. Mare was such a great disappointment my brain cannot wrap about how stupid she was during the whole book. I\u2019m speechless.Now, I\u2019d like to say something nice about her but I did not find anything and I have no motivation to just go ahead and try to search for something decent to say. Nope, just no. It was plain stupid how she was pinning after Maven. She had to fucking move on but keeping those letters? Stupid ass decision. \nEVERYTHING ABOUT MARE WAS DUMB AND DISSAPOINTING.\n She was just a little girl trying to play the ruthless boss.If there was something I hated the same or even more than Mare dumb as fuck Barrow was those tag lines and nicknames. Oh my god, I could find the words Lightning girl, the shadow of the flame, the exiled prince, anyone can betray anyone\u2026 like 10 times in one single page and it made me want to punch someone. I kid you not, it was so repetitive and plain stupid. Aveyard tried so hard to make those names and quotes to work but they were way too much. It did not work.I missed Evangeline. She was such a threat and she was fun to read. I actually missed ALL THE VILLAINS. While our, uhm, heroes were traveling and recruiting people, they were facing problems BUT none of Maven\u2019s actions in this book were as bad as in book one. Same with the queen.Where did the evil masterminds go? And because we didn\u2019t have that fast-pacing-we\u2019re-going-to-die kind of thing, we got plenty of time to read all about Mare\u2019s breakdowns, yay.On that note, the queen was killed so fucking easily I totally missed it. Like??? Was that it? It was not only ridiculous but such a disrespect to the image I had of the queen. I just can\u2019t believe she was killed that easy, you know? I was waiting for her to get up and start making people kill each other on the plane but nope.And I was bored. Utterly bored during the whole book. Like I said, I put it down several times because I honestly didn\u2019t want to continue reading it. I felt like it was going nowhere and I hated that feeling. So, what I actually LIKED? Cal.I wanted Aveyard to explore him and let us know him better and she did. Thank you. He\u2019s quite great and he really does not deserve Mare whatsoever. He\u2019s so much more sensitive and strong than I thought he was and absolutely clever. He\u2019s got a really sweet heart and he\u2019s just so good. He could\u2019ve been an amazing king.If there was something done right in this book, that was Cal\u2019s characterization. I fell for the guy big time and I truly hope he gets to be happy in the end.The other thing I liked about this mess was Cameron, Shade and the very end. Yep, all that in one single category because the more I think about the book, the more pissed I get. I think that Cameron was, not only a strong addition, but also someone who gave a new purpose to the plotline. She was on point with a lot of things that Mare, selfish stupid Mare, could not see.Shade *sigh* I did not see it coming and I\u2019m not happy about it. Look, I\u2019m more than okay with deaths, seriously BUT his dead only served to what\u2026? So Mare could wake the fuck up and do some shit? That was\u2026 ugh, I have no words. I\u2019m just pissed.I appreciated what Shade added to the story and he was just a good guy. So no. I\u2019m not happy with what happened to him but at the same time I\u2019m happy I got to know him a bit more.Was it me or Fayre whatever her name is acted weird? I mean, I\u2019m not talking about Shade\u2019s death but I got the feeling she was hiding something. Is she pregnant? Are all the newbloods dying or something? Not only I don\u2019t know what was the answer to what the eye guy said to her but that fishy feeling is still there.The end was unexpected? I mean, I knew Mare was going to pull a Tris Prior but I guess I didn\u2019t expect Maven to treat her like a dog. I liked that. If Mare is stupid enough to suffer for that piece of shit, then she well deserves what\u2019s coming to her.I mean:\n \u201cI\u2019m not blind. I watched you take the notes off the bodies. I thought you\u2019d rip them up. But when you didn\u2019t\u2014I suppose I wanted to see what you were going to do. Burn them, throw them away, send them back dipped in Silver blood\u2014but not keep them. Not read them while I slept next to you.\u201d\u201cYou said you missed him too. You said so,\u201d I whisper. I have to refrain from stamping my foot like a frustrated child.\u201cHe\u2019s my brother. I miss him in a very different way.\u201d\nMare, I just\u2026Aveyard\u2019s storytelling did not improve either and I did not know if I was reading a sci-fi, paranormal or fantasy novel. I think it\u2019s an issue when an author doesn\u2019t have a particular style that fits with the genre they\u2019re writing so that was a disappointment as well.Will I read the last book? Yeah, probably. I\u2019m curious to see how this mess of a story is going to continue but for now I just want to forget about this book."}, {"userName": "Ally", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15655618-ally", "userReview": "[The only thing that I found mildly shocking was Mare's treatment of Queen Elana's body.

Yes, Mare is supposed to be a grey area character with questionable actions. But that is sub-human. An act like that is beyond wrong and was completely unnecessary.

In an effort to give some structure to my upcoming rant, I will limit myself to the things I disliked the most: The title, the writing and (of course) how our heroine is actually a terrible, horrible person.\nThe Title\nI literally \ncannot\n get over this title. Anything is better than a glass sword. A wooden one, a plastic one, heck...even a french bread one provides nourishment. One swing of the stupid glass thing and the sword's gone and splintered itself. Then you're left stepping on glass shards for the next few weeks...which is what it felt like to read this book. Actually, I guess the title works. Glass swords - cumbersome, annoying, useless...just like Mare.\nThe Writing\nFor the life of me, I honestly can't say what this book was about. It was so bland and repetitive  that I tuned out for great portions...yet, I don't think I missed a thing.The author would either A) say the same thing \nthree\n times per \nsentence\n or B) copy-paste the inane catchphrases (Red Dawn, Little Lightening Girl, Rise Red as the Dawn, etc). I wanted to shake her - I GET IT THE DAWN IS RED AND MARE HAS LIGHTENING POWERS. And yet, in another three paragraphs, we are reminded just how red that dawn was and how Mare still had lightening powers.The sheer laziness of the writing  really annoyed the living daylights out of me. Whenever things get the least bit tough, Mare conveniently finds just the perfect person with the exact right powers to achieve (insert plot point here). Then side-character dies. Rinse and Repeat.\nHow our heroine is actually a terrible, horrible person\nWe follow Mare and her rag-tag group of middle-aged superheros ran here and there as a giant X-men recruitment fest.She's so full of righteous anger and rebellious spirit that she never once thinks about the implications and consequences of her actions. Honestly, I couldn't be the only one who noticed how there must have been generations of powered Reds living out their lives in secrecy. Well, until Mare showed up and pressed them into her army...only to either A) ruin their lives or B) get them killed (depending on which was more convenient for the plot)To top it all, she has no feelings towards the dying people other than an initial shock/squeal of outrage. You think I'm kidding? Even the other characters noticed it. \n\"You [Mare] feel no remorse for the dead...you can't control yourself.\" \n and yet, everyone in the book admires her bravery and strength. They literally fawn over her like she's this amazing, self-sacrificing, pure-to-the-bone heroine. How (honestly, I want to know) does no one notice that all she does is A) murder people or B) force them into her army.In short, this is a half-star book. The half is because of the sheer effort it took to come up with over 400 pages starring Mare...I don't know how the author did it.Audiobook CommentsListening to the bland monotone a la Amanda Dolan did this book no favors."}, {"userName": "Cookie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7190378-cookie", "userReview": "I AM WAITING FOR THIS BOOK. Oh, and while Maven is interesting as a villain, he is no Darkling (my poor poor baby). With that said, I'm TEAM CAL ALL THE WAY BABY. YA GOTTA LOVE AN HONORABLE AND POWERFUL MAN IN UNIFORM.Edit:A little opinion of mine on why Maven will never be in the same category as the Darkling or Warner. The Darkling is a villain who believes with all his heart that he is saving the Grisha and freeing the population from a tyrant (sadly he doesn't see that he's become a tyrant himself in the process). While Maven is none of that. He has no charismatic appeal, is weak physically and mentally, and he cowardly hides behind his mother's skirts. Maven does the despicable things he does, knowing full well of their destruction, and he revels in it.  Warner might have killed, fully conscious of the immorality of the act, however, he takes no pleasure in killing. He does what has to be done, as he operates by his own code of justice, and [spoiler] to protect his mother. On the other hand, becoming a villain was Maven's grotesque version of being a petulant child: when he doesn't get what he wants, he lashes out at everyone. There is no noble goal, no disillusions about his actions. In fact, Cal, with his bloody acts and a stubborn mind on the righteousness of his philosophy, are much more Darkling-esque. So no, I wouldn't put Maven in the same category as those like Warner or the Darkling, because that would be grossly offensive to their amazing villain story."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68159473-jeff", "userReview": "@#%*$#@**!%#*$#*Ahem, thank you for bearing with me for that little intro.Now. Let me just get this straight.The first book was AMAZING. Superb even.But this book? What a bummer.You know when you have a balloon and it slowly loses it's air? The noise it makes? Like:pphlllllttttgggghhhhhhh....That was me this entire time. In the beginning, I was like \"OMG, this book is going to be great!\" But then, later on, I'm just kind of like \"meh.\"Anyway, back to what I was saying. The first book was great. The characters were in a fantasy/dystopian type of setting, there was a lot of action, two hot princes at Mare's side and a jealous woman. However, in this book, you're just straight up like, what the ef???This entire time, Mare just tries to recruit a few people to build a little gang. Seriously, Mare, that's great and all, but you're up against an empire. And..um...hello?One more question.Where's the romance?Throughout this entire book, there is nothing going on. Mare and Cal are always like, \"Oh, let's stay way from each other, I don't want any distractions.\" You obviously are attracted to each other, so what kind of shit are you pulling right now? Excuse me, but I ain't taking any of that.I'm speaking for all those suckers of romance like me. A message to you, Aveyard. Make them KISS.Besides the romance and the lack of action, there's still pages, words, and unneeded dialogue.What do you say readers?

Red Queen was far from original and I still had lots of X-Men and Hunger Game vibes while reading Glass Sword but I still enjoyed this book nonetheless and I'm really looking forward to seeing this series evolve even more as the later books come out.It took me awhile to get back into the story in the beginning because I couldn't remember certain details that happened in the last book so I strongly recommend rereading Red Queen before continuing onto Glass Sword. On top of that, it was a little slow at first but once the story picked up, I didn't have it in me to put the book down and I devoured it all in a matter hours.One thing I have to complain about was how often Victoria Aveyard was drilling \"anyone can betray anyone\" into our heads throughout the whole book. It got a bit annoying, really. I can understand mentioning it once or twice but we were constantly reminded in almost every chapter... Talk about overkill. We get it. Anyone can betray anyone. It took away the element of surprise for me because just like Mare, I doubted every single person. Maybe the author was trying to prove a point but if her goal was to pull some sort of reaction out of her readers like last time, it didn't really work out for me this time around because I was anticipating every little scenario possible.But other than that, I was fully immersed in the book.I was complaining that nothing was going on until it hit me in the face and now I'm suffering double time because I NEED MORE. This book wasn't enough.The characters in this book were awesome. Sometimes I wanted to slap some sense into some of them but I LOVED everyone and the new characters as well!SHADE.

WHY!!!!And oh um... Queen Elara. Was I the only one thinking WHEN???? I was literally like... \"Wait. What.\" *Flips back pages* WHAT. I might've missed when it happened or maybe I just got too excited but I just have one word to say about it: ANTICLIMACTIC.Now I have to wait another year. Sigh. I'm still torn on who I love more: Maven or Cal. I feel like it's The Grisha trilogy all over again except I actually love both male characters. I want Mare to end up with Maven but at the same time I want Maven to myself so Mare can end up with Cal. But I want the moody, misplaced prince too... I guess I'm fine with whoever she ends up with because I love them both!But anyways, I need the next book and I need it now. Please and thank you. So much happened. Maybe even too much, but at the same time not enough.

This sequel to the Red Queen is Victoria Aveyard at her very best!Sequels have always been very crucial in a series because they can either be a success, a failure, or in between. Thankfully, this sequel fell to the success side.Red Queen ended up with a promise. Glass Sword started off by fulfilling that promise.It's actually hard not to love this book because first and foremost, everything started with a BANG! Lots of actions were already happening even at the very first pages that I found myself gripping the edge of my seat.I was particularly amazed by how Victoria Aveyard weaved the plotline of this book with so much thrill and adventure. The searching for new bloods and the painful, action-packed experiences Mare and the gang experienced as they journeyed from places to places. The introduction of new characters that are so interesting and with unique traits and abilities. So exceptional!Yes, there were parts that are dragging, but who cares? They actually gave so much time to take it all in and anticipate what's about to come. Was I surprised? Hell, yes! There were so many shocking scenes and revelations here. Even heartbreaking ones that made me cry.\n\"I stare at the polished metal, examining my reflection. The girl I see is both familiar and foreign, Mare, Mareena, the lightning girl, the Red queen, and no one at all. She does not look afraid. She looks carved of stone, with severer features, hair braided tight to her head, and a tangle of scars on her neck. She is not seventeen, but ageless, Silver but not, Red but not, human--but not. A banner of the Scarlet Guard, a face on a wanted poster, a prince's downfall, a thief... a killer. A doll who can take any form but her own.\"\nMare's character development, I admit, was kind of an on-and-off here. Sometimes she was so weak and hopeless but most of the time her strength was the one that made sense to everything. On the other hand, Cal-- Holy freakin' Cal! This guy-- *sigh This brooding prince, ONCE AGAIN, swept me off my feet! His character development in this book amazed me to no end! Seriously, I love him even better here! He was indeed born a leader as the way he acted always had an air of command. And when he brought the \"That's my girl\" line to Mare.... *squeals! Who wouldn't swoon over?The romantic parts in this book was my most favorite, of course. I was so happy that there was a bit of a romantic development here between Mare and Cal! MY SHIP! It was certainly sailing in all its glory!!!The ending, however, made me flinch and cry and feel a bit of frustrated. WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED?

I just feel so let down by Glass Sword after Red Queen was so good. Understandably after the way things turned out in the first book, it had to change direction. But how much it did, I just wasn't impressed. This book had so much potential. It's taken me FIVE days to read nearly 300 pages. That isn't like me at all.My issues with this book are solely around Mare... I just didn't like her what so ever in this book, she is so self centred and seems to put herself before anyone else. I hated, literally hated how she treated Cal and Kilorn. Particularly that she underestimated Kilorn for not being \"special\". I mean come on up until a few months prior they were both from the Stilts as Reds with no known ability. It was just so infuriating. Not just that, but she always seemed to want to be right, like she doesn't listen to advice or offer support to anyone who she knows needs it. InfuriatingAs for the plot? It started off so strong, I can hold my hands up and say I was blown away by the first few chapters, I thought it was smart and it had so much potential. After that, for me personally it kind of dwindled. Personally I usually like some deceit it books, I mean who doesn't like a twist? But the fact is, I feel like it pushes you not to trust anyone in this book. Why would you not want to like anyone?! It seems that the book is full to the brim and the characters are constantly doing something, but my question is. What?! It just seems to me that it's a lot of walking around and searching with not much else.It also doesn't have a lot of character development. All we seem to get is Mare. You know what? I couldn't stand her. I know I've said this. But I honestly couldn't. All we see is her. I don't know how the book continues, but I would of loved to see more of Shade. He was one character that really stood out for me, and he was barely in it!Cal is literally thrown to the side and treated horrifically, even though time and time again he proves his worth. It's just so infuriating. His bright flame has grown dark indeed\" well of course it has you fool, look at how he's being treated!What did I like?- Shade and Cal were honestly the only redeeming features for me. - Maybe the first few chapters as well...Overall, it just got to the point where I was forcing myself to read it, simply for the fact I wanted to continue the series and find out what happens in King's Cage. I told myself at the start of the year, if I don't enjoy a book, don't finish it. So I'm sticking to that. Maybe in the future I will try again, but for now?

I liked Red Queen, I did, but there were flaws and holes, and between 'like' and 'love' is an abyss. Now listen, I loved Glass Sword. I didn't plan to, my heart was closed, but Victoria rose red as the dawn, and I fell in awe with an ache in my chest. If she would improve herself further, I don't know what we'll get with the last book in this series. A heart-attack, maybe?This installment picks up right there the previous one ended: we are underground and we try to escape Maven's evil grip. The first chapter (which you could already read) is a chaos, mist and what's-going-ons, but hold on tight, this is only the beginning. Glass Sword\u00a0would let us see more of Scarlet Guard, we'll fly, we'll meet newbloods with bad-ass powers, we'll fight, we'll win, we'll lose and so on. This book is an action and emotion-packed one. Yes, you've heard me right. Emotions. I hadn't any intention to shift at my seat or passing across the room, or screaming at characters, swoon over them, be afraid or happy, or sad. But Victoria wrote her book with so intense words... There's a soul between the pages.It's a shame I can't show you any quotes, rules are rules and I have to wait until February. Though maybe that's better this way, 'cause every page is a twist. Twist upon twist. Don't forget about anyone can betray anyone. Beware.We know that second books in series are often a bit of meh. I thought it would be the same with Glass Sword. Boring recruiting, games with Maven, ruined love-ship with Cal, Kilorn's presence, Guards... I considered these things boring. Boy was I wrong. Yes, this book is its genre's child and you can predict the plot's frame, but what lies in between is always an ocean of choices and possibilities. You would be soothed with delusory familiar passing, but this is what Victoria needs to clap her hands near your ear and make you jump when you least expect it. Anything can happen with anyone (yes, now I love to use such constructions, haha).Romantic line would be so subtle! But if you look closer, you'd get burned from the heat that is there. Everyone, who knows me well, is aware of which prince is my fav. It's Cal and there will be enough of this fire man in Glass Sword. His ship with Mare isn't that broken, but it's not a whole boat either. These two made me suffer and happy and crazy and so much more at the same time. The thing they shared is a beauty itself. They are my OTP and that's it.Mare have changed. Now she is strong, reasonable, ruthless and willing to do something, to help her nation, to avenge herself. Not at the start, but she would get how tangled life is, how hard to tell allies from enemies, how impossible to please everyone or to save every single person, how high the price of revolutions is. I'm not sure whether I like her or not. Yet. But I admire her sometimes. I see why she does what she does. The only thing I would never forgive her is Cal. One wrong word, one wrong move and I'm ready to smack this girl with a chair. All of us has some flaws, Mare's biggest one are double-standards. What is allowed to others isn't allowed to Cal. Until the end I was waiting for the tiniest sign, which could show me her true feelings for him, if there were some to begin with. I speak not about kisses or even words... I needed an act, a metaphor. Did I get one? Oh, you'll see.Cal... my beloved exiled prince. He was left with nothing. They took his past (mother, the way he saw things), his present (father, home, power), his future (throne, which would never be his even with Maven being defeated), but he didn't become weak or a rude bastard. Hated among Silvers, hated among Reds. They accused him in all the bad things Silvers made to Reads, they punched him with fists and words, but he stayed still, he didn't hurt them back, he didn't leave. Why? Oh, don't tell me you have no idea why. And after such acts of his... I fell for him so hard that I broke some bones of mine. He's a MAN. Even Mare was bitching him sometimes, but he never did the same in reward. People didn't get how he felt himself, what he had lost, that every war has both than one truth, both sides have their own versions of event, their own reasons. And he didn't press his vision on them, he was helping those people, he was grateful and nice. I can't tell you more without spoilers, I just wanna make you feel how I love this boy. If Maven is a man of his word, then Cal is man of his act.Well, Maven... our Darkling-ish little bitch. Forget the boy you may love in Red Queen and meet a new one: cold, calculating, merciless, cruel, obsessive. Yes, obsessive with Mare. He wanted her dead not a long time ago, but now he wants simply... her. And the throne, of course. Maven won't be an often guest on Glass Sword's pages but he would be always there. Nor Mare, neither Cal would be able to forget the boy they loved (or, in Mare's case, was ready to love) so soon. They would ache for Maven who wasn't exist to begin with. Thus he would remain in their thoughts, between their bodies, inside their hearts. While his physical self would try to hunt them down. Goosebumps... Other characters were great as well. I loved Mare's brothers, especially Shade. Loved even Farley, though I wasn't her fan before. It was good to see more people with different abilities, to see more of the world-building, to learn more secrets. Now I know how wide Victoria's plan is, how far her imagination is going to march. I would be there to touch it, to taste it and to enjoy.Again, I wanna praise the writing-style. At some moments I was weeping so hard... my mother, who set next to me, was shocked. Maybe it's me and my sensitive nature, but I think it's Victoria words and how she tells her story. I swear people, you have to be ready.The final had blown my mind. I didn't know I would give the book around 10 stars until the very last page. It was 8 then 9, then 8 or 9, and then BOOM 9.5 STARS. My heart was pounding, my mouth was open and my eyes were swollen from tears while I was suddenly sure what to do, how to rate and didn't know how to survive 'til the next book.

Which wouldn't be so bad if they were going to stay on the secured island they're hiding out at, courtesy of the Scarlet Guard, but alas there is the problem of the New Bloods. Mare and Cal must race against Maven to get to the New Bloods before he can kill them, as well as figure out a place to keep and train them. The two also must try to deal with the fall out from Maven's betrayal and their feelings for one another that played a part in causing their exile from the kingdom. I actually enjoyed this more than I did Red Queen, it was fun to read about the other powers that Reds could have. I still want a better idea for where this is coming from or what is happening but there was some progress on that front as well here so I'm satisfied for now. Farley and Kilorn were great, not that I didn't like them in the first one but this one only let me enjoy them much more and now I'm like completely attached to them. I wouldn't mind getting to have more plot line with the New Bloods though because as of right now I don't really care as much about them but that's a later problem. I see that people still hate Mare, the love of my life, but I still love her. Yeah she spent the whole first book whining but as a fellow whiner I think it was the appropriate course of action, especially considering how shit life was for her. Also I get that maybe her hero complex seems self centered but it feels slightly justified because she is the only New Blood people are familiar with already and the most powerful person as of this moment. Anyway Mare is still the best and as kayne once said I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her.I still think Cal is amazingly boring though and I couldn't care less about his romance with Mare. I feel like I should be swooning or something but I'm kind of just like why is Cal still around. Not that Maven is much better, please someone tell me he dies soon because I'm sick of him. I'm just going to go read the third one right now because I need to know what happened.

It doesn't take long for this story to get more complicated once they begin their missions to save the other \"new bloods\" and bring down the king.Although this time around Mare and Cal seemed to grow closer, there still wasn't enough romance for me. I enjoyed the action and adventure, but I craved a deeper, more emotional connection between these two. At times, they seemed to be getting closer. Then, they'd turn their backs on each other with little thought or consideration. That drove me crazy!I listened to the Audible version of this story and it continues to be well-narrated. There is a lot going on in this story, so I did find myself needing to rewind a few times to catch details that I missed. However, that was a result of my own distraction and not a failure of the narrators to engage me in the story.Overall, I think that this story continues to be good. It wasn't as good as the first book, for me, but I still liked it. I will continue the series when the next book is released.
