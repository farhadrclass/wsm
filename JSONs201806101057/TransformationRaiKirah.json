There's this guy, and he has wings, and he's been...sold into slavery? And this prince buys him? I can't really remember. But the one guy totally has wings. And lots of man-angst.My absolute biggest complaint about this book is that after hundreds of pages of foreplay, the prince and his slave do not actually confess their manly love for each other and get married. But they very nearly do, so maybe that'll be enough for the rest of you. The slave sleeps at the foot of the prince's bed! They have very strong feelings for each other! They fight demons and then have some sort of an Ezzarian mind meld! But no sex. It's possible they don't realize they're gay. Someone should really tell them.One star, because after all these years I can't remember what the book was about, but I still feel like it lead me on.

That first cover is ridiculous. And not in a good way. I mean, who looked at that image of a scantily glad gentlemen with enormous green wings on a cliff top and thought, \"yup, perfect.\" I mean, the covers for \"Revelation\" and \"Restoration\" aren't exactly awesome either, but compared to 'Transformation...' Yikes.Which sucks. Because I suspect that that cover is bad enough to stop people from reading this book. Lord knows it came within an inch of stopping me. Which would have been my loss, because crap-tastic packaging aside, these books are surprisingly good.Aleksander is the heir to an aggressive, conquering empire. Seyonne is a once proud warrior turned slave. Together, they fight crime! Ha, not really. Well, actually...Ok, so Seyonne's people were this tiny, insular culture who have spent centuries waging a secret war against demon kind. They were the one thing holding back the hoard until, whoops, Aleksander's people come along to butcher and enslave them all. Good going guys.Berg is skilled at presenting complicated things simply. She doesn't borrow any established mythology for her demons and demon hunters, everything is original to the books. And yet I never had any trouble following it or keeping things straight in my head. Plus, it was very cool, which always helps. I also felt that the various races in the books didn't model \"real\" cultures too heavily, which was a refreshing change from most fantasy novels I read.The premise is what grabbed me first though. As a slave Seyonne, who used to be the best demon killer, focuses solely on the present as a way of surviving his slavery. Then he ends up being purchased by Aleksander and noticing, against his better judgement, that Aleksander has some seriously bad ass demon out to get him.Does Seyonne remain true to the precepts he grew up following, or will his hate get in the way?The main thing that kept striking me over and over as I read these books is how well done the friendship between Aleksander and Seyonne is. All too often in books if a relationship between two characters is focused on it will inevitably become romantic in nature. True friendship is a rarer best, and I think one harder to pull off. But Carol Berg does it in this trilogy and I was mightily impressed.Both characters change considerably over the course of three books, and for the most part Berg does not take any easy routes. It's not until we reach the very end of the trilogy that I felt things got a little too neat and rainbows, but I probably only noticed it because she'd been so unflinchingly realistic up until then. I mean, odds are a man enslaved for sixteen years is not going to able to fit neatly back into his old home. Odds are childhood sweethearts are not going to live happily ever after. There are certain things we're used to seeing in fantasy novels, certain ways that things tend to play out, but Berg rarely follows convention. Although please note that while she didn't pull any punches, these books by no means fall into the category of dark fantasy. I don't know how she pulled it off, but all those \"dark because dark equals reality yo\" authors might benefit from checking these books out.And there's one last things I want to give Berg props for. You might think as I've only mentioned Seyonne and Aleksander that these are dude heavy books. Not so! The supporting cast is large and populated with fleshed out three dimensional people (and demons) and her female characters in particular were very well done.Now all props aside I will say that as enjoyable as I found this trilogy, I felt there was a lot of potential that wasn't realised as well. By the end I felt there were just too many things going on at once, and some story lines were seriously neglected or too hastily wrapped up.But despite that, as embarrassing as it might be to be seen reading a book with such an awful cover, I really think you should give this trilogy a try."}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7061395-marilyn", "userReview": "Carol Berg has not yet written a book I didn't love. Her books are full of cruelly treated souls with ultimate deliverance. Although her books rarely end in tragedy (at least not universal tragedy), you cannot count on an entirely happy ending either. You can be reasonably sure your favorite people will survive, but they may sustain significant damage, mental and physical, on the way. The common denominator of her heroes and heroines is that they've suffered. Sometimes, they know why, sometimes not. Sometimes the real reason is cloaked and only discovered very late in the story. All of her primary male characters are unjustly persecuted. Injustice is a dominant part of the plot of the \"Rai-Kirah\" trilogy and also Ms. Berg's other series. In brief, there is a great wrong that must be made right and her hero(es) is (are) the man (men) to do it. Who must do it.In this series, the hero and his persecutor evolve. Each must learn to trust and forgive the other. In the process, both transform. They save each others' lives multiple times and their lives are intricately interwoven. The developing relationship is often deeply touching. Two people of the same sex who love one another are not necessarily homosexual. In my world, we call it \"friendship.\" The kind of friendship that lasts a lifetime and on which you can always depend. I know there are reviewers who seem to have a problem with this concept, so I advise them to cultivate some new and deeper relationships with members of their own sex. Drinking beer and watching a game is not necessarily the highest form of friendship.In this series, hatred, bigotry, ambition, politics, greed ... the traditional pantheon of human evils ... are the forces that destroys lives and nations. Characters endure the unendurable without explanation or comfort; one could easily draw an analogy to Job. Carol Berg never sets her stories in our \"real world,\" and no one belongs to any modern religion. But they are all believers; no atheists in her books. They believe in their Gods and within the limits of their devastating sufferings, they never question their deity's existence, only why they have been abandoned. A Carol Berg hero or heroine has suffered terribly, lost everything, but survived somehow and he, she or they will nonetheless, against all odds, save the world. This trilogy has two main characters who save each other as well as the world. Transformation turns a selfish, cruel monarchs into a compassionate human being. Fortunes reverse. The slave rises, the king falls, but all is redeemed. More or less.There's plenty of action. The writing is intelligent and the author doesn't take the cheap way out of situations. Plots are not afflicted by \"deus ex machina\" issues. While there is magic in the world, magic is not the all-powerful force it is in other fantasy worlds. Carol Berg's magic is powerful, but limited. It works, but so do weapons. The ability to wield magic never confers invulnerability. As often as not, whoever wields the magic pays dearly for it.I hope Ms. Berg will publish more very soon. I don't know why her books are not more popular. They are beautifully written, full of action, romance (think \"Dumas\" rather than \"Harlequin\"), nobility set in fantastical realms that have a surprisingly realistic feel. Note that if you are an audiobook reader, only \"Collegia Magica\" is available on Audible. You will have to read all of Berg's other books on paper or Kindle."}, {"userName": "Alissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24456819-alissa", "userReview": "[, friendship (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490110-mimi", "userReview": "Ten years ago I would have liked Transformation a lot more.

A friend recommended it to me, telling me to ignore the terrible cover, but I still let it sit on my virtual shelf for far too long. Thanks to my TBR challenge, I finally got around to it. I really loved it, and wish I\u2019d read it sooner! This is a book that deserves more attention, and I agree - ignore the cover!It\u2019s a Fantasy that takes place in a large, greedy empire that gobbles up its neighbors and uses wide scale slavery. The culture(s) and magic system are well developed, but are filled in gradually from one character's viewpoint so you don't get the whole picture at the beginning. This is not the type of Fantasy with a lot of action and battles. There\u2019s no revolution to take down the empire. The action is much more localized, but still engrossing - and there are still threats that become dire and affect the entire empire. It\u2019s just that the characters are really the driving force, and the world, conflicts, and intrigues are revealed through their interactions and through the ways they change.This method can only work if the characters are interesting enough, and it worked here because I liked the main character from page one, and was invested in what would happen to him immediately. He is an educated slave whose past is gradually revealed throughout the story, so I won\u2019t reveal it here. He gets purchased by the Emperor\u2019s son, a volatile, selfish, cruel man. As property that thinks too much, he is often punished brutally, but somehow manages to hold on to his sanity and his sense of right, even when he knows it will cost him dearly. Learning more and more about the background of the main character kept me hooked until I finally had a sense of an entire world and system and his place in it, and by then I was invested in the larger conflict and the outcome. I loved how the characters changed each other, and I believe there\u2019s potential for larger scale change in future books. I loved it. Recommended for those who enjoy something other than pure action and outright war in their Fantasy."}, {"userName": "Leah Petersen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1316379-leah-petersen", "userReview": "I was truly shocked to read the other reviews and realize that many perceived this as the-queer-book-that-didn't. I write gay fiction myself, and read tons of it. It never even occurred to me in reading this that they might be gay, or should be, for that matter.I think what makes this one of The. Best. Character/Relationship books I've ever read is that it doesn't muddle the issue with lust and sex. Bravo to Ms. Berg for accomplishing it because it's harder to pen such a poignant relationship when you don't have the catalyst and commonality of physical desire. That these two men could come from such different realities and the worst kind of power imbalance and forge such a deep, meaningful friendship is what I find so moving about them and the book. I had no complaints about the plot or worldbuilding. They could be better, I don't doubt, more impressive. Honestly, I'm glad they weren't. When I need a dose of sheer emotional connection, I come back to this book and read only the parts that show their developing relationship. I'd be sorry if that weren't so well developed, if there was less of it to enjoy. I think a physical relationship would have cheapened it. And removed some of the character depth that came from their relationships with others, specifically Aleksander's with the woman his father picked for him.This book is so very satisfying, both as a fantasy, and as a picture of what matters so much in life."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.0 stars.

I\u2019ve actually listened to an entire, full-length, 16.5-hour audiobook. Some of my followers may have seen me rant and rave about this at one point or another: I\u2019m not a good audiobook listener. My attention drifts and, even when I\u2019m paying complete attention, I feel like I don\u2019t absorb things as well as I do through the written word. On a more bizarre note, I get really annoyed when somebody talks non-stop for a lengthy period of time. I\u2019ve actually become irrationally annoyed at narrators of audiobooks because they just won\u2019t shut up, never mind the fact that they\u2019re only doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing and I'm the one who turned them on in the first place! Then I remember that I have the power to make them stop talking and I turn them off.To add perspective, I only made it a few hours into Neverwhere, narrated by Neil Gaiman. I\u2019d read it several years ago, I liked the story, and Gaiman is a great narrator, but I reached a point where I just couldn\u2019t listen to him anymore. I tried listening to The Android's Dream by John Scalzi during a road trip. After an hour, I was in genuine danger of falling asleep and I had to turn it off. (I\u2019ll have to try it again in print sometime.) I tried listening to Wool Omnibus, a book I really enjoyed a couple years ago. I can\u2019t remember if I even made it through the first 50-page part. I tried listening to The Way of Shadows, and I did make it several hours into that one, but eventually the melodramatic narration got on my last nerve. Ok, I guess you believe me now, I\u2019m not good at audiobooks. :)This book, Transformation, is the first book in Carol Berg\u2019s Rai-Kirah series. I\u2019d read the series in print five and a half years ago and really loved it. I had also read a couple duologies by the author earlier this year and I would now rank them among my all-time favorite books. Reading those made me want to re-read this series, but I hated to take precious reading time away from the many new-to-me books I want to read, so I thought I\u2019d make yet another attempt at an audiobook. It completely absorbed me; I was hooked on the story all over again. I started listening to it on a road trip, and then I continued listening during my normal commutes. For the first time since I moved to Atlanta, I found myself actually wanting to get stuck in traffic. :) The story is told from the first-person perspective of a slave named Seyonne. His people have been decimated by a war, most of them killed or captured by a race known as the Derzhi. Unknown to most of the world, Seyonne\u2019s people have devoted their lives to fighting demons so that the rest of the world can live free. Needless to say, the decimation of Seyonne\u2019s people does not bode well for the fate of the world. At the beginning of the story, Seyonne, who has already been in slavery for sixteen years, is sold to the Prince of the Derzhi people. Prince Aleksander is arrogant and selfish, and Seyonne is treated very poorly. However, when Aleksander falls prey to a demon enchantment, Seyonne is the only one who sees what\u2019s happening and has any idea what to do. It soon becomes clear that there is a deeper demon plot that goes far beyond this one incident. The story is absorbing, and the author really made me care about the main characters. The friendship that develops between Seyonne and Aleksander is one of the best parts of the book, and there are some other good relationships as well. The narrator, Kevin Stillwell, had a narration style that worked well for me. He distinguished between character voices well, but I think what helped the most was that he read the story in a more understated manner. I\u2019m starting to suspect that the more dramatic narrators are the ones most likely to get on my nerves, even the good ones like Neil Gaiman. That doesn\u2019t mean my listening was frustration-free. Listening to the story felt sort of like walking around without my contact lenses in: I can still see pretty well, but everything is just a bit hazy and I miss the greater sharpness I\u2019m accustomed to. Sometimes I just really wanted to see the words with my eyes, either to understand them better or to stare at my favorite passages and bask in the words a bit. Other times, I was too distracted to listen well and I would end up rewinding an entire commute\u2019s worth of listening so I could listen to that part again when I had better focus. In any case, I\u2019m really happy at how well this audiobook worked for me, and I\u2019m hopeful that the next two books in the series will work equally well. The commute is so much more pleasant when I can spend it wrapped up in a story, and it\u2019s also a nice way to re-read old favorites. Maybe I\u2019ll eventually build up a better tolerance for the narrators I find more grating and get better at focusing on the stories that don\u2019t hold my attention as completely as this one did."}, {"userName": "Lym", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3487663-lym", "userReview": "Note: Even though Transformation is the first book of a trilogy, it also works extremely well as a standalone. If I hadn't known before that it's part of a series, I probably wouldn't have gone looking for sequels.We begin our story, and please don't roll your eyes or run away yet, when our protagonist Seyonne is sold as a slave to our other protagonist, Aleksander, prince of the mighty Derzhi Empire. Zander is what you might expect: A spoiled, arrogant brat who doesn't value Seyonne as anything more than a tool bought mainly for one purpose: To write.The Derzhi are a warrior race who consider writing beneath them, who say it's a thing done only by barbarians or slaves (or ideally barbarian slaves). Doesn't mean that a scribe isn't useful every once in a while, and so Seyonne soon hears more about the going-ons in the realm than he wishes to know.Which isn't terribly difficult, one might add, because Seyonne is determined not to think beyond the moment, afraid of the ruins of his life that he might see if he does: He's been a slave for sixteen years - half his life - and it has damn near broken him. Robbed of his magic as well as his freedom and knowing his people dead or in chains, he has little reason left to live. Until...And you just knew there would be an \"until\". I don't want to go into any more detail, so let me just add that it's Aleksander whose life is suddenly endangered by something he doesn't even believe in, and there is but one person in the entire empire who has once held the power to save him. No, you're still not allowed to roll your eyes or run. I know it might sound clich\u00e9d and not as if this story has terribly much to offer. But it has.For one, the book offers one of the best uses of a first-person narrator (Seyonne) that I've ever seen: He has a way of imprinting his view of the world on the reader without us realising it until much later, and he is not always right. (No first-person narrator should be, of course, but I mention it here because in far too many books, everything such a narrator tells us is treated as fact by the rest of the story when it should be the most subjective kind of narration.) It also helps a lot that Seyonne, even as a severely abused slave, is never a character written to be pitied. We feel for him, sure, and cringe at what's being done to him, but it never comes across as authorial manipulation (like \"The poor, poor character, he suffers so much and therefore you must love him!\"); he has other characteristics that make him grow on the reader.The development of the major characters is extremely well-done: We know right from the start that Aleksander has a lot to learn, but so has Seyonne, and don't you forget that. The plot goes in quite a different direction after a while and could be divided into three \"parts\", but saying more would obviously be running straight into spoiler territory and I am trying to get you read the book yourself. ^.~Other strengths of the book include the world building (the two cultures that we hear most about, the Derzhi and the Ezzarians, are well done and believable, even if it takes a while to see that due to our obviously not terribly reliable (or impartial) narrator), the pacing and the language (Seyonne's narrative voice is quite distinctive).If I have to find something I disliked, well... There are \"demons\" (the titular Rai-Kirah) in this book who stay very one-dimensional, though I hear that gets better in later books. However, they do serve their purpose here and it never distracted me from the main plot: The story of two remarkable men and the transformations, both literally and figuratively speaking, they undergo to save themselves - and maybe more than that."}, {"userName": "Tamar", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40644464-tamar", "userReview": "For 16 years Seyonne is a slave, with no hope for the future and lives from day to day and from hour to hour, his motto is \"what come, comes\"He is beaten and constantly hungry, humiliated and always cold.One day Prince Alexander, the prince of the empire who conquered almost the entire continent and killed many of his people, acquires him because he can read and write.So when Akexander is possesed by demons only Seyonne can help him, for his people fauth for many years to defende humanaty from the demons. and together they run-away to the only people who can save the prince.A stunning story intertwined with it: betrayal, cruelty, a lot of heartache and true friendship"}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150287-louise", "userReview": "An interesting book, which has a very slashy master/slave set up.

Everyone is resolutely heterosexual, although homosexuality is mentioned, but only in terms of sexual abuse of the slaves. The slave half of the equation has a grim life. His master is an absolute brute and treats him horribly, but eventually they become something like equals, in a mystical sort of way.I found myself wanting some more details about the magic they used and where it came from. Some of the worldbuilding felt a bit generic and flat. The plotting was okay and kept me on my toes most of the time. I'm not incredibly tempted to get the next one, but I might.

Back when fantasy was tightly tucked into the category of science fiction. Back in the era of tribbles, red planets, flying saucers, time machines...and a much more methodical approach to the craft of storytelling. The cover of Transformation was actually a draw for me. A hope that the retro sensibility might extend beyond the casing. A hope well-placed, as things turned out.Seyonne was once a Warden, which in this realm is an exorcist of sorts. He would enter into an internal conflict with demons, defeat them and send them on their way. But that was long ago, before his people were conquered and enslaved. He no longer thinks of his old work or his gift for it. He's come to concentrate only on pleasing his current owners and getting through his day - until he's purchased by the heir to the empire and finds something in this reckless man that is worthy of note; worthy of guidance, sacrifice and protection.While it takes a great deal of foundation building to set her themes in motion, Berg has done some fine work here on the subject of denial; of painful truths that are kept at bay, the paralysis this causes - the hibernation of skills and abilities; the cost of dreams held in restraint. Seyonne's resistance to re-engage is palpable. His ordeal, through Berg's careful ministrations, is flush with an interior resonance few modern-day writers can achieve. The conclusion stumbles in places; this was her first novel and climactic actions scenes are tough to master. Yet it is a story thoughtfully structured by an author who earns her reader's trust.

Trying to think about it objectively, I don't think it was anywhere near a perfect book. The pacing was uneven, and the ancillary characters were no more than cardboard cutouts moving the plot along. Some of the more important ancillary characters' motivations were terribly unclear, and I didn't buy the small romance subplots for either Seyonne or Aleksander.But none of that matters to me, because the heart and soul of the novel is Seyonne and Aleksander's relationship, and that is realized pitch-perfectly. They are both complex men with everything in the world working against any potential relationship they might develop and the fate of the world resting on the fact that they must learn to trust each other and work together.

But *this* effort is superb.The narrator is believable as a male Ezzarian slave, trying to live in the moment and just survive, until he is forced by his own nature and long-ignored oaths to act in his master's best interest. We learn about his past only when he can't ignore it. We learn about his master only in ways that a slave would learn. We learn of the Empire he lives in and its political intrigues when he encounters them and they step in his way. It's a unique enough world to feel like something new, which is always nice in fantasy.

There's a journey, some magic, a few duels -- not exactly the stuff of groundbreaking fantasy.What Transformation does have, though -- and why I'm looking forward to reading the remaining volumes in the trilogy -- is a solid narrative voice (the slave's, carefully balanced between detached observation and ironic self-awareness); well-drawn supporting characters (Berg's men are better than her women, of whom there are very few); natural dialog (which allows the reader to appreciate nuances of character that the slave cannot); and an exquisite sense of dramatic timing that more than compensates for the relatively low number of surprises in the plot."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2169934-kelly", "userReview": "I could not put this book down and I had tears in my eyes before I had turned the hundredth page\u2014that\u2019s how compelling the characters were, right from the outset. Simply, Transformation is the story of two men separated by about a decade, age-wise, and a much greater gap in experience. Seyonne is a slave and Zander is his lord. Seyonne has been a slave for sixteen years, his people captured by Zander\u2019s. He is worn by time and experience, but is still himself\u2014to a degree. Beneath his apparent resignation, he has a core of strength one can only admire. Seyonne is also intelligent and canny, which isn\u2019t all unusual for a character in his role, but the reader gains the sense he was destined for greater things, even if he believes otherwise. The question is: will he go on to achieve a greater purpose, or remain a slave? Zander is Seyonne\u2019s opposite in every way. Prince and only heir to the emperor, he is young, spoilt, arrogant and cruel. He is smart, however, almost frighteningly so, and even without the clues given in the blurb, the reader quickly realizes there is more to him than a title and future crown. Zander has enormous depth and substance.Once introduced to Seyonne and Zander, this story could have taken me anywhere and I would have followed avidly. Both characters were so well drawn; more than caricatures of good and evil or \u2018opposites\u2019. When it became obvious their fates were entwined, I cheered for them both\u2014for Zander to discover himself, for Seyonne to rediscover himself.Less simply, Transformation is the story of a world at war with demons. Layered above and below the tale of Seyonne and Zander is one of political intrigue, ambition and the classic themes of good versus evil, might against right. Transformation does not read like a first novel. Carol Berg\u2019s writing is clear and the characters\u2019 voices well formed. I did not once frown at a description or scene. There is a great deal of emotion packed into the story, explored through varied and complicated relationships. As mentioned earlier, I came to care for the central characters\u2014even Zander\u2014rather quickly and they, themselves, kept me turning the pages. The plotting works from end to end and the pacing just right. All in all, this book was as close to perfect as I have read in a long time. Another aspect that pleased me greatly was the fact the story felt complete at the end. Transformation is the first novel of a trilogy, but though I am interested in continuing to follow the story of Seyonne and Zander and their world, I am content with the end of the first chapter. I hope the other books feel as complete. That being said, I have already ordered Revelation (Rai-Kirah, book two) and look forward to reading it."}, {"userName": "Elin the Lightship", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27441524-elin-the-lightship", "userReview": "\"You said it yourself, my lord. I am a slave, not a man. They'll not hear me when I speak.\"Seyonne has been a slave for the past 16 years and he has been broken in both body and soul. In the eyes of his people he is broken beyond all repair.For his knowledge in the art of reading and writing, he is introduced as the new scribe for the Prince - his new owner. His new Master.The Prince Aleksander is a cruel and unforgiving man who's used to get everything served on a silver platter. But demons have slowly taken root in the empire, weaving their ugly magic deeper in the hearts of men. Seyonne comes from a race of people very familiar with the ways of sorcery and demons and tries to warn his Master, despite the way he's being treated. He feels that it's his duty. But slaves aren't permitted to speak unless spoken too and he has to endure a lot to get through to the proud, stubborn man.Seyonne is such a loveable character. He is caring, loyal, forgiving and humble. Other characters making the same choices he did would be considered na\u00efve but not Seyonne. The Ezzarian, Seyonne's people, are such a gentle people, holding no grudges and who silently carries the weight of the world on their shoulder's, wanting no recognition or glory.Slowly we get to know more about Seyonne's history, a part of himself that he would like to forget, while following his horrible daily duties as a slave.It pained me so much to read about all the horrors he'd suffered and I came close to tears on more than one occasion. Once starting to cry when he went through one of my own worse nightmares. Not feeling like a person, not being able to exist in the eyes of the people you love. I had to put the book away.The slow building of Seyonne and Aleksander's friendship was wonderful to see unfold and the writing was beautiful. Though a bit slow from time to time, I loved Seyonne's voice so much I think I'd even enjoy reading about him eating an apple for two pages. I even think that's why I was so frustrated with the ending. I'm actually pretty angry. Now I got angry again just thinking about it. It was so close of being five stars for me.Now it just feels a bit pointless. I may or may not continue with the trilogy, it depends. I really liked this world but I can still leave it here as Transformation can be seen as a stand-alone novel.I just don't know.Feels."}, {"userName": "Aeslis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3882906-aeslis", "userReview": "I find myself disinclined to like books with characters who are perpetually in distress. Not that I don't like tortured characters--I do, very much so--but when it's constant and relentless, I get worn down. Unfortunately, our main character, Seyonne, has this problem. He can't catch a break. He doesn't do anything wrong and yet he's threatened, beaten, starved, and put in isolation, among other things. Apparently in this world slaves aren't even treated with the decency of animals. Even after his master (our other main character, Aleksander) develops grudging respect for his slave, the author finds plenty of other ways to beat Seyonne's spirit into the ground.The story itself is bumpy. The conspiracy that runs through it is interesting in premise, but I feel it was poorly executed. I would have preferred that the POV weren't first person, which limited a good deal of knowledge and confined the beginning of the story to a slow build-up while we went through Seyonne's slave life. The plot itself builds in scope towards the end, but I found some of the plot elements, like using portals to enter people's minds and fight demons on their mental landscape, sketchy at best. While Seyonne attempts to explain it, it takes a while to fathom what's really going on.The most interesting part of the story was the bond that formed between Seyonne and Aleksander. I would be willing to read the next book to see if there's development there, but if there isn't, I'd skip it."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry", "userReview": "ORIGINAL READ: 10/10 (18 September 2007 - 23 September 2007)Transformation - Carol Berg (10/10)Fantasy; book 1 of the Rai-Kirah.Another fantastic series. Carol Berg writes original fantasy that walks the line of dark fantasy with every tipping over. So we get a solid story with strong, deep worldbuilding and fascinating characters who are never simple and always flawed. The story follows both the complicated, building friendship between the slave, Seyonne and his princely owner, but their battle to save Zander's empire from being overtaken by demons. Seyonne, once trained to fight demons, finds himself caught between his loathing for the empire and his needs both to stop the demons and save Zander. There are two more books in the series - both of which promise to be equally complicated and fascinating - and I can't wait to find the time to read them.REREAD #1: 10/10 (7 February 2013 - 11 February 2013)This was equally amazing on a reread. Beyond Reality is reading it this month and I was going to let it slip by, but reading the comments in the spoilers thread reminded me just what a wonderful book this was. It also reminded me that while I have the next two books in the series (both in paper and as ebooks) I never quite got around to reading them. I did start the second one, but I don't think I got more than a chapter or two into it. I don't remember why now, but I think I found the two year time just to a different location difficult. I was also trying to read the paper book and even in 2007 I was probably finding that difficult.I'm ever so glad I did reread this. The developing friendship between Seyonne and Aleksander remains an amazing piece of writing, showing something strong and true and yet not sexual (and both men give every indication of being heterosexual) that develops between two people who should be deadly enemies and yet somehow, defying all sense, become as closer, or closer, than brothers.Outside of Seyonne and Aleksander, who are the heart and soul of the story (pun only slightly intended), the other characters are less well drawn, yet even then they are not cyphers, but instead people I would like to get to know better. I'm guessing it's likely I'll see more of Ysanne and Caitrin, but oh how I'd like to get a glimpse into the private life of Aleksander and Lydia. Those two could be the death of each other or totally magnificent. Personally, I vote for the latter.Right now I want to race through the next two books and find out what happens next. I don't want to stall out this time. Transformation could so easily be a complete book on its own, with the ends apparently tied up, that I actually find myself nervous to discover what Carol Berg is going to throw both at me and at her characters next. But this time, I'll stick with it and finish the series. Everything I've read of Berg's works and other people's reviews of her work assure me it will be worth it - if possibly a little stressful along the way."}, {"userName": "Sandra ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3080893-sandra", "userReview": "Well crafted, complex characters, suspense, tension, battles with demons, a truly mixed hero, a prince who is spoiled beyond redemption and yet has a spark of something humane in his soul.

WOW, Carol Berg, just\u2026 I have no words. Geez, it's like I have to drop every other book I've given 5 stars to down a notch just because they can't even come close to comparing to the power of this book...! I've just finished TRANSFORMATION and, as you can probably guess, was left utterly floored and overflowing with emotion. I don't think I've ever been so thoroughly transported by a book, and so *completely* too. Despite its length (not extreme, but it is substantial--and won't you be thankful there's plenty of it once you get a taste of how great it is!), Carol Berg's writing--no, Seyonne's writing (our main character/narrator--his voice is so solid, I can't believe anyone other than he wrote his tale!) is so solid, so transporting and flowing and filled with a unique and oddly likable blend of compassion, wry wit and the harsh bluntness necessary for conveying the horrors of his experiences, that I couldn't bear to be apart from the book for more than a few hours at a time while I was reading it. Even when I was stuck at work, I had to carry the book in with me and leave it in my desk. ^^ That's the kind of emotional death grip this book and its characters get on you. And speaking of our hero... seriously, what a hero! Seyonne, Seyonne... here's one \"old friend\" I'll never forget, that's for sure. Not only is his voice kind of indelibly etched in my head now, the mental/emotional journey he makes over the course of this book is just... I've never seen the equal of it. When I think back to where he was at the beginning of the story\u2014a numb, broken-spirited slave who\u2019d been all but destroyed in mind, spirit and body by the 16 years of cruel bondage he\u2019d endured\u2014and where he ends up at the end--and not only that, but how thoroughly and *believably* he made his metamorphosis\u2026 wow. I am just in awe that Carol Berg was able to fathom this story and bring it so believably to life. I don't think I've ever read such emotional truth and consistency in fictional characters before, especially when they grow and change *that much* over the course of the book. The same incredible feat of enormous yet completely authentic/believable character growth/change is worked on our other hero, Prince Aleksander, who goes the more classical way (from spoiled, tyrannical warlord to Awesome Good Guy), and all of that woven together with the unlikely (actually, it was down near \u201cunthinkable\u201d at the start) and breathtakingly moving friendship that grows between these two characters from diametrically opposed ends of the social ladder\u2014this is PURE LITERARY GOLD. You pray to experience a relationship like that, or at least, vicariously experience a relationship like through literature, etc, and so seldom does someone actually pull it off right, so that it rings completely true and lingers with you and utterly floors you with how unbelievably kind a small gesture or word can be. All this PLUS some truly rich, authentic-feeling world-building that is so complete you really understand *why* certain characters end up doing things no one in their right mind in such a situation would ever do\u2014that is some seriously powerful writing. Like, you can\u2019t just read this book, you kind of *live* it, it\u2019s so lush and visceral. The main appeal is definitely the human drama and the transformation of the two main characters and the against-all-odds trust and affection that slowly grows between them, but the world around it is solid and is the perfect framework for pushing these characters to the wild extremes the start in or must endure over the course of the story\u2014a truly excellent and luminous use of the \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d aspect of the SFF genre. This story could not have happened anywhere else\u2026 and I\u2019m so thankful to have read it. Sorry, this isn\u2019t the most coherent of reviews. I literally just finished the book before sitting down to write this, and I\u2019m sure not much is making sense from within this haze of wonderment and emotion I was left in. But I hope at least that I can convey how much this book affected me, how thorough the spell of story it wove was, and how dear these characters have become to me. As amazingly fleshed out as they are, as intimately as I\u2019ve been allowed to peep into their souls, I almost can\u2019t imagine that these people don\u2019t really exist, and that the extraordinary events I\u2019ve just read\u2014no, *experienced*\u2014aren\u2019t real. But that\u2019s the power of this book. Anyway, don\u2019t take my word for it\u2014read Transformation, give its extremely unusual but ultimately unendingly worthy main character a chance, and you WILL be glad you did. I especially recommend this book to fans of Patrick Rothfuss\u2019s THE NAME OF THE WIND\u2014if you liked Kvothe, you\u2019ll *never* forget Seyonne!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4488388-sarah", "userReview": "Given how much I loved this book when I first read it, I wonder why it's taken me until now to do another read of it. This book is essentially a fantasy version of Alexander the Great's life, told from his slave's perspective. In many ways, I wish that Berg had either deviated more from the Alexander story or made it even more apparent, rather than thinly veiling that it's Alexander's story.In Transformation, Seyonne battles his own hopeless situation-- his slavery, his people who wouldn't accept him even if he escaped, his loss of power, both metaphoric and magical-- but finds an unexpected ally in Aleksander, his own master. Anyone who's seen BBC Merlin: the dynamic between Seyonne and Alexsander is exactly the same as between Merlin and Arthur, to the extent that I wonder if someone in BBC read Carol Berg's series. Transformation is a compelling story, though why the author chose to take the fact that Alexander had male lovers from the story confuses me. Why take away a whole aspect of his personality? Just enough of that is left that it's clearly more a story between Seyonne and Aleksander than it is between Seyonne and Ysanne or Aleksander and Lydia. Additionally, I still find (and have found since my first reading) Ysanne an immensely irritating, semi-sketchy woman who I desperately want something bad to happen to. I can't understand why Seyonne loves her. Fortunately, if I remember correctly, she is phased out as a romantic interest in later books. Oddly, the author isn't very good at writing women. All of the women in the story are flat characters who rarely seem like good people, much less like real people. Where there are men who I find I can relate to in this story, there are no women. I also don't understand why the Ezzarian people have a strange blending of Welsh and Russian names. These are flaws that must be understood when reading Transformation. But overall, it's worth the flaws for the story: the winged Ezzarian battling demons in the souls of men."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1282558-rebecca", "userReview": "I'd say the best reason to read this is for its characters. The protagonist is Seyonne, a man who was once a magical-warrior prodigy and the shining star of his demon-hunting people before they got their butts kicked and he was captured on the battlefield, stripped of his magic, and sold into slavery for sixteen long years. Seyonne thinks that he's pretty much crushed all hope of being anything more than a slave and is just trying to survive as many days as he can, though he has a bare few points of pride left -- which is how he ends up on the auction block at the start of the book. Aleksander is the prince of the Empire that conquered Seyonne's people, and a mix of the most spoiled palace brat someone could come across and a damned clever, talented and adept person. He's the one who ends up buying Seyonne. Aleksander and Seyonne's relationship is interesting and complicated as Seyonne's limited senses pick up both that there are demons in the court and that Aleksander has some inner nobility that Seyonne could sense even beneath Zander's casual cruelty. Both of these start to stir Seyonne to bring out things he thought dead and buried, and this begins to influence Aleksander (and, for that matter, so does Seyonne's statement that he's known enough pain in his life that nothing Aleksander can do to him will make him frightened of him.) The book also has interesting female characters in the Lady Lydia, Aleksander's betrothed, and Caitrin, Seyonne's teacher's granddaughter. (We also see Seyonne's old fiancee, Ysanne, but don't get that much sense of her outside of Seyonne's point of view.) That's always a plus, though Lydia gets more development in the sequel and we also get more of a cast. Sorry, female characters doing interesting things is an important qualification for me. Unfortunately, the two of them and the other women don't get much screentime. Transforamtion is the start of a trilogy, but also stands alone, which is nice for re-reads."}, {"userName": "Kelley", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749115-kelley", "userReview": "It's been years since I read this book.
