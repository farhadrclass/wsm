It's a major award!\n\n\u201cEverything we say is a story. But nothing we say is just a story.\u201d\nWhat can I say about Juliet??????\nWell, yeah. That sums it up pretty precisely. Juliet begins with the MC Julie mourning the death of the aunt who raised her and the shocking discovery that said aunt left her estate to Julie\u2019s twin. The only thing left to Julie? A key to a safety deposit box in Siena, Italy. (Don't worry - Julie's not a total butthole. She's just always believed the estate would be divided 50/50 and this new revelation comes as a shock.) Left with no other option, Julie packs it up and heads off to claim her inheritance. Upon arriving in Italy, Julie discovers what she has really been left is something known as \u201cJuliet\u2019s Eyes\u201d and also discovers the classic tale of Romeo & Juliet might not have been fiction. It is up to Julie to unravel the mysteries of the past as well as her part in it.So like the gif above said, if you enjoyed The DaVinci Code . . . \nOh stop with the disappointed judgey face. The son-of-a-bitch didn\u2019t sell eleventy trillion copies by Dan Brown buying them all. Like I was saying, if you enjoy Brown\u2019s books, this one will be right up your alley. As you can tell by my rating, I liked it just fine and the blurb isn\u2019t lying when it says the writing is beautiful. The main problem I had was it was just soooooo long for not a whole lot of action. Yes, there was \u201cintrigue\u201d and the plot was \u201cintricately woven\u201d but (much like with Brown\u2019s works) sometimes it felt as though I was on a Tour of Italy . . . \nMmmmmmm Tour of Italy . . . . Where was I? Oh yeah, I sometimes wished the book would get to the point already. I guess I\u2019m just a dummkopf who likes more action with my historical intrigue . . . \n*shrug*This was the FINAL selection for the library Winter Reading Challenge. You can bet your ass I\u2019ll be floating this review once I pick up my awesome limited edition beer mug.\nIn the meantime, go read Shelby\u2019s review.

That's not an understatement, I would probably have picked it straight up and read it again but, I'm so behind schedule that it wasn't an option (although I might have to stick a post-it on the front to remind myself in future ;))I've always been the stereotypical woman who has swooned appropriately at Romeo & Juliet so I picked this book up thinking it would be a fun modern re-write that I could forget about soon after. Turns out though that this was so much more - it went beyond the Shakespeare tale (and was the better for it) and mingled pastlives, romance, destiny, soulmates, history, crime, mystery, adventure, betrayals and all the fun stuff to make a book that I want to re-read immediately. I'm a sucker for all that so it's like the book was written exactly to my own specifications, which I clearly cannot complain about at all. Also - added bonus, every chapter is prefaced with a R&J quote - how can you not appreciate that?It's set for the most part in Siena and the descriptions of the town makes the locales easy to imagine even for someone who has never been there and I almost want to go and book a holiday to Siena solely to experience some of it. The two tales - modern and past blend together beautifully and it says a lot about the author that I was equally invested in both stories, even though I knew that one was going to end tragically. The premise involved Julie travelling to Italy on a quest to get something her mother had bequeathed her after her aunt died, in the belief that it will be worth a lot of money and clear her debts after she was written out her aunt's will unexpectedly. In Italy, she travels under her real name, Giulieta Tolomei and discovers that her family is at the centre of an ancient feud with another family and that her name holds some medieval weight nowadays. Her inheritance turns out to be some books and a crucifix, and disappointed begins to read in the hope it explains where the treasure is and the book turns out to be a diary that talks about Giulieta and Romeo, her ancestor and her lover who were the inspiration for the early Italian tellings of Romeo & Juliet before Shakespeare got ahold of it.It was a wonderful book, and although I'm sure there were aspects of it that people could find fault with - the characterisation of Janice was maybe a little ott and a little out there, but I didn't really mind it that much tbh. I just didn't mind it that much, and I honestly didn't have any complaints. It checked every box that I could possibly want it to check and the balance just felt right.The film rights to this have been sold already. As a person who loved the book as completely as I did, I'm delighted to have another way to enjoy it but I just really hope they do it justice. No crappy casting choices just to have some big name in the role who is completely unsuitable, and although I love her, no Amanda Seyfried either. If they are going to botch up the casting, I'd rather they just left it personally.Now I'm just sad that this was a new release - it means I'm going to have years for the author's follow-up book."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2771351-kimberly", "userReview": "I saw great reviews about this book in several places, including at least two magazines. So I gave it a go. But now I'm left with the confusion that comes when you don't like something that everyone else seems to love.The story follows the modern-day ancestors of the real-life Romeo and Juliet, who believe themselves to be victims of a curse that has plagued the families for 600 years, ever since Romeo and Juliet were not allowed to be together. The book provides some insight into the historical family feud from the 14th century, on which Shakespeare based his play.However, there were things in the book that did not make it past my suspension of disbelief. I find it hard to believe that the Virgin Mary would curse a family for 600 years just because she didn't get her way with the original Romeo and Juliet. I also didn't like how the ancestors of Romeo and Juliet seemed to have this \"Well, you're named after Romeo and I'm named after Juliet, so we're supposed to be with each other and fall in love\" attitude. It was weird and I didn't find it to be the least-bit romantic. And I found it infuriating the way that none of the characters were ever straight with each other on anything until the very end. And while the climax of the book was satisfying, a great portion of the book left me rolling my eyes.If you have a deep love of Romeo and Juliet, can buy into the idea of your life being controlled by \"fate\" and curses, and have sappy notions about romance, then you might like this book. Otherwise, I recommend that you pass it up."}, {"userName": "Seda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59959710-seda", "userReview": "Shakespeare bu kitab\u0131 okusayd\u0131 hi\u00e7 mutlu olmazd\u0131, \u00e7\u00fcnk\u00fc kendi hikayesinden daha heyecanl\u0131, daha h\u00fcz\u00fcnl\u00fc ve daha ger\u00e7ek\u00e7iydi.

I thought, wow, this is going to be really wonderful. And I still love that first page, but the other 446 pages not so much. I wanted to love all of it, I really did. O, I am fortune\u2019s fool to have believed in you, first page!There are two main stories running throughout the book. The modern day one is about the search for a priceless treasure which will possibly lift the curse on the two houses, Shakespeare\u2019s Capulets and Montagues or the Salimbenis and the Tolomeis from the historical version. The other story is a re-telling of the story of Romeo and Juliet, supposedly the actual historical people and events. I don\u2019t know if it is the real story or not, but I do know it\u2019s far more entertaining than the modern story. I don\u2019t know if the real Juliet or Giulietta had a twin sister. I kind of hope that\u2019s historically accurate because the sister character in the modern parts was a huge problem for me and I\u2019d have preferred not to have her in the story. She didn\u2019t add anything, nor did she move the plot along. She seemed like a very cardboard character tossed in for no real reason. She is presented as this selfish, self-centered almost evil creature, always grasping and taking from her twin sister, very rapacious and greedy. Juliet doesn\u2019t like her or trust her or want her around, but she shows up in Italy anyway. Juliet is angry with her for a bit and then they work together. They are now just good buddies. Wait! What? WTH??? This person has made her life miserable, ruining everything all the time, making sure anything that Juliet dreamed of was put down, stomped on. There is not any resolution of this, other than Juliet thinks she actually looks contrite a time or two. Really? Really??? Someone has made your life a misery and you just shrug it off because she looks a bit sad or sincere? Hogwash! Poppycock! Balderdash!I didn\u2019t quite get into the character of Juliet, either. Her attitude toward men seemed odd. She behaves or thinks like an uptight spinster which seems somewhat odd for a woman of twenty-five. I get that she had to remain a virgin for the plot, but her attitude that all men are wanting her for some kind of prize made me think she thought pretty highly of herself while at the same time she would be remembering that people only ever noticed her sister. And while we\u2019re on that subject of the characters, how about describing the people just a bit? I\u2019ve finished this and I still have no idea what Juliet or Janice look like. I don\u2019t know their eye color, hair color, nothing. Oh, one has princess hair and one has bear hair; what the heck does that mean? I know Allesandro has green eyes and dark hair and a lean, muscled physique, I guess. I could understand the non-descriptions if everything was that way, but the buildings and places and scenery are almost overly described so I don\u2019t quite know why the main character still remains such a blank. There are descriptions of palazzos and towers and cathedrals and castellos and fields and alleys so I know the author does enjoy describing things; I guess just not people.The romance of historical Romeo and Juliet was beautifully told and that was what kept me reading. The twists and turns and the way the author wove in the Palio horse race and the conflicts between the powerful families was really well done. The historical part was page-turning and heartbreaking until toward the end when it becomes a bit too much telling and not enough showing, but there are centuries to be closed up so I understood that.The romance in the modern day, sorry to say, didn\u2019t work. I could feel the author pushing this romance forward, but it felt very forced. I think she was going for witty banter, but instead what appears is too many distrustful question and answer sessions and I didn\u2019t feel anything happening between them. Even the love scenes, if you can call them that, are very flat. I wasn\u2019t even sure what had happened when they finally got together in the physical sense. Not that I need a play by play, but I wasn\u2019t even sure it had taken place. Okay, rumpled sheets, did they sleep together or did they sleep together? If you\u2019re going to write something about Romeo and Juliet, then (although it\u2019s a tragedy, it\u2019s the romance that folks remember) or now, you need the story to be romantic. The romance is somewhat central to the story, both historical and modern, so it really needed to soar. I\u2019m sad that it didn\u2019t do that and sad that I felt somewhat blah about it. I really wanted the modern story to get out of the way so I could enjoy the historical one and since the majority of the story is the modern one, that isn't good.In the last chapters, there is tons of backstory which took away a lot of the urgency of the plot. I know there was a need for all the information, but I wish it had been presented in some different way. It\u2019s like the story suddenly got in the way of it\u2019s own plot. Yeah, I know that seems confusing, but it\u2019s the only way I can describe it.The ending was okay. However, there is something introduced on the last pages which leads me to believe there will be a sequel or related book at some point in the future. I don\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019d read it. This one was a bit of a slog to get through. The historical story was brilliant and full of emotion; the modern one, not so much."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "1.5 stars. This book has garnered a lot of hype. Many have called it a woman's DaVinci Code. I can somewhat buy the comparison but only a little bit. First of all, in DaVinci Code, the \"exposed secrets\" are much further reaching than the \"true story\" behind Romeo and Juliet. Many complained about the terrible writing in DaVinci Code but, to be honest, the story was intriguing enough that I didn't notice it too much. Such is not the case with \"Juliet.\" First of all, the author uses \"had\" before everything... had spoken, had said, had started. Why not \"the last time I saw you\" versus \"the last time I had seen you\"? There were some pages where had-something was used twenty times or more, so much so I couldn't even focus on the words between them. All I saw was had, had, had. For such an \"active\" book the writing was incredibly passive. I can't believe her editor, or her agent for that matter, let her get away with it.Also, the author over-explains everything. For example, one character clearly makes a sarcastic remark, which the author tags with, \"he said, meaning the opposite.\" Gee, thanks for dropping that mad knowledge, lady. And the dialogue? Atrocious, awful. People do not talk like the characters in this book. What bitchy, privileged twenty-five year old American woman exclaims (at a pivotal point), \"Creepers!\" Ack! Creepers, indeed. There is also holy cow and hates my guts and taking the love train to cherry town, to name a few. And the word friggin\u2019 is used way too friggin\u2019 much. The author lived in the US for many years but apparently didn\u2019t hang out with too many actual people. It\u2019s like some European teenager\u2019s idea of how Americans speak. Furthermore, the main character (e.g. modern day \"Juliet\"), is flat and not believable in the slightest. We know nothing about her other than she has credit card debt and is the \"nice sister,\" versus her twin who is the \"mean sister.\" I didn't care about her journey because she wasn't even a person to me, which was not helped by the aforementioned dialogue issues. Apparently I really disliked this book! I didn\u2019t even realize it until I started typing this review. I will give it points for concept and a fantastic setting (Siena). Also, the author clearly did a ton of research. I do think it will be a massive bestseller because it seems like the type of book a lot of people like. I imagine book clubs all over the world picking it.

But once the hero was introduced the dialogue got really, really corny. Like roll-my-eyes corny. And the heroine was TSTL in one of my pet peeve ways. She'd miss tons of tons of really obvious clues, and then think to herself, \"wow, I feel stupid. It would have been so much easier if I'd gotten all this in the first place.\" Yes. It would have. Especially since I figured it all out and kept wondering why you hadn't.Which leads to the next problem. Everything was SO contrived. That the heroine was TSTL and couldn't put two and two together allowed the plot to continue. Otherwise the book would have been must shorter.The ending was hugely disappointing. There was a big 'explanation' scene where all the bizarre happenings are explained by one character. Only it all felt so silly. Clearly the character behaved as he/she did to make the plot interesting and not because what he/she was doing made any sense whatsoever. (The happenings at the country estate were just bizarre.)Anyways, this book was hugely disappointing, especially since the author is a decent writer and she did a great job with the history and setting of Seina. It is the story and plot that need help."}, {"userName": "Maria Bikaki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16500960-maria-bikaki", "userReview":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7779792-gemma", "userReview": "This book started out with a good hook; the sad-sack Julie is viciously cut out of her dead Aunt\u2019s will and her sister gets everything. But Julie gets a key to a safety deposit box in Siena that will be\u2014in a completely obvious literal and metaphorical sense\u2014the key to her past. I was with Fortier at this point. I couldn\u2019t really get a handle on Julie yet as a character but there were still about 400 pages to go so I thought the book would get there. That\u2019s where the problems for me started. It seemed like I kept turning pages and nothing was happening that made me interested in Julie or her quest. I don\u2019t believe a main character has to be likable to make a story work. However they should be interesting in some way; intelligent, clever, tough, stubborn. Julie was nothing. I think Fortier wanted to create sympathy for Julie by making her the meek, lost counterpart to her outgoing, abrasive twin sister. But instead Julie was presented as someone with no personality who was just letting life carry her along; she has no career, massive debt, and her participation in war protests is only a result of her desire to prove to her sister she can do something. It just didn\u2019t work. There\u2019s no reason to care about Julie. The story is told through her point of view, and since Julie doesn\u2019t have a real point of view, or at least not one that she can\u2019t be talked out of in two sentences, it makes the book read flat. Her emotions toward the events in the story do not read true because Fortier never gives us a sense of what is driving them. At best she seems ambivalent toward discovering the truth about her past. She just doesn\u2019t have anything better to do. The twin sister is horribly characterized. If Fortier wanted to make her evil, she should have just gone for it. You can have a character who is a jerk and give them redeeming qualities. Janice seemed to have multiple personality disorder. I think Fortier was trying to create a character who was headstrong and street smart but also protective, but if this was the case it did not come off. She was very mean and blunt, and then suddenly she was loving and protective. It did not read like a true person. I found it unbelievable when she suddenly popped up in Siena. I also found her disguise hard to swallow. One of the few physical descriptions we get of a main character is that Janice is curvy; Julie asks her in the beginning of the book when she got her most recent addition, referring to her chest. So could a buxom woman put on a leather jacket and pass for a man? I\u2019m not so sure. I also don\u2019t buy into the idea that she knows how to drive a motorcycle. There is some mention of Janice being interested in cars, but how does that translate to riding a motorcycle? We are not in Janice\u2019s head, we are in Julie\u2019s, so Janice\u2019s true thoughts can only come out through her dialogue. And that was the biggest problem of the book for me.Janice\u2019s dialogue is so jarringly off base it made me wince. I\u2019m a 25 year old American woman, I\u2019m almost offended; creepers, Cocco-Nut, Womeo, driving the love bus into cheery town\u2014that last one was part of the most ridiculous sentence I\u2019ve ever heard. Many have pointed out that Fortier is not American, but I cannot let her off that easily. As an author, you should understand that your strength is not American slang, and don\u2019t use it. I think it would have been more successful if Fortier had written it as she would have said it in her native langue, and then strip it of any colloquialisms. But it\u2019s not just Janice. The modern day dialogue between all the characters was stilted and jarring and came off as very immature. Usually characters had no more than two or three lines of dialogue at a time, and it never carried the plot forward. The love story between Julie and Alessandro is laughable, or better yet, invisible. Fortier did a pretty decent job building a little tension between these two, but she gives no real reason why Julie, who never seems to have had a relationship in her life, suddenly falls in love with him. There\u2019s never a reason for him to fall for her either. She never shows any kind of pluck or intelligence or charm that would have attracted him to her. At least none that felt believable. And their strange marriage ceremony and wedding night was just bizarre. I think you can successfully write around a sex scene, but after so much was made of Julie being a virgin, and so many references to virginity throughout, it felt like that scene should have been given more weight. I also find it hard to believe that a woman of 25 wouldn\u2019t have a deep reaction to losing her virginity. The mystery part of the story was too drawn out and convoluted to really follow, as were some of the final \u201cwrap up\u201d conclusions. I found the historical parts of the novel to be the best written, however I did have issues. The 1340 is supposed to be a journal entry but it doesn\u2019t read like one. It seemed like omnipotent narration. I think she dwelled too much on them at the expense of characterizing her modern day characters. The \u201creal\u201d story of Romeo and Juliet is interesting, however the problem with spending so much time on it is we already know the end. Even if we don\u2019t know the details, we know more or less what happens. What we don\u2019t know is what will happen to the modern day characters. I found myself rushing through the historical parts in the hopes that something interesting would happen between the modern day characters. It never really did. The end was predictable and it did not feel very modern. Julie just drifts through life until a man saves her and marries her. One author once suggested to aspiring writers, don\u2019t be satisfied with using your first idea. Try to give it a little more of a twist. A lot of this novel, especially the end, felt like it was the first idea. I would warn people before they started this novel that it\u2019s not a very rewarding read."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108416-nancy", "userReview": "Skimming through the comments of other GoodReads reviewers, I am definitely voicing a minority opinion when I fail to wax enthusiastic about this \"cute\" book. And, I think that is my criticism of Fortier's re-telling of Shakespeare's story---she just strived too hard to make it readable and clever. And, she ended up with cute. What a shame.I hoped this would be an academic quest similar to A.S. Byatt's Posession, and Fortier's concept for the novel could have led to a much more interesting and sophisticated story. Either she or her editors opted to make the book so mainstream that it just didn't have any magic for me. The heroine's dialogue and musings were so self-consciously sassy that instead of making the heroine, Juliet, feel like a real, modern woman, she seemed like a character on a TV sit-com.A book doesn't have to be inaccessible to be smart. It was very disappointing to me that a good concept for a book was diminished in its execution by dumbing it down every step of the way: particularly the language and the characters."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "My goodreads challenge is making me feel guilty about all my unfinished books (how will I ever reach 100 books this year if I keep giving up on what I'm reading?); yet I've decided that it really doesn't pay to listen to an audiobook if turning it on is increasingly serving as a cue to space out with my own slightly less predictable thoughts. Because I just. Can't. Listen. To this any more.The rose on the cover of this book should have served as a cue that it wasn't for me, but it was available for free library download and had a high goodreads rating. And I was in the mood for something light. Within the first few minutes of listening, though, the problems began. I do try to suspend my judgmental tendencies when it comes to book characters. I never considered myself one of those people who has to like or admire the main character in order to enjoy the book; in fact, some of the best books I've read have had rather vicious main characters. But the problem with Julie, our heroine, is that while I think I was supposed to sympathize with her, I just couldn't. It stirs something up in me when a young woman never applies herself to anything or chooses a direction in life simply because she's expecting an inheritance when her great-aunt dies. I mean, I've known lots of people who weren't particularly ambitious or directed but that was usually because they were also not very materialistic, not because they were sure they'd inherit the old lady's fortune and therefore decided to be lazy and passive (writing 101: no one wants to read about lazy, passive characters). I probably could have made my peace with it had Julie been a charismatic Becky Sharp, but she was way too bland and boring for that. She was clearly meant to be the \"nice twin\" a la Sweet Valley High, but I didn't think it was very nice that her sorrow at her great-aunt's death appeared to revolve mostly around the loss of the inheritance. Equally boring was Julie's twin sister Janice, an over-the-top belle dame sans merci. Beautiful and nasty, Janice did not appear to have a single redeeming feature although a perusal of other goodreads reviews suggests that she does an abrupt 180 in the middle of the book. I guess when characterization is that thin and one-dimensional, anything's possible. I wasn't interested in sticking around for it.Apparently the book was going to develop into some kind of mystery around the original Romeo and Juliet story. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to motivate me when the characterization and dialogue were so utterly ridiculous. And other goodreads reviews have told me that a clicheed romance for Julie is in store as well. Oh, goody. Who'd have thunk?Goodreads challenge notwithstanding, this book is annoying me way too much to continue. Maybe I'd persist if it were shorter, but I really can't imagine listening to sixteen 75-minute segments of this."}, {"userName": "Milly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4000502-milly", "userReview": "MYSTERY. ROMANCE. HISTORICAL-FICTION. What's not to love? It has everything! It is a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, so rich in history, and laced with mystery and action in every page, that it becomes reminiscent of The DaVinci Code! This was a difficult book to put down and not devour in one sitting. I struggled to slow my pace and savor each line and page from the very start. Anne Fortier did a remarkable job in crafting this amazing book! One could tell how much research was done to capture the old and timeless tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet and to successfully infuse it with fictional characters and events that feel as antiquated and believable as the original players. So the book claims that the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet really happened in the 1340s, and that Romeo and Juliet were real people and that they lived in Siena under the names of Romeo Marescotti and Guilietta Tolomei. Just like Shakespeare's timeless love story, they died of a tragic death and that their love story was doomed from the very beginning. Awesome, right? I just love history, even if it's fictional in nature. Though the book is so rich in history, it is well-paced and the story building is well executed without it feeling overburdened with historical facts. I loved reading about the feuding families in Siena, Italy in the 14th century, about the different families/contradas, the Palio, and about the history of Siena itself and how it has worked its hardest to keep its integrity and to keep the infrastructure well-preserved to this day. Such a romantic setting to have! And so when we continue on with this book, we find that, the female protagonist, the 25-year old Julie Jacobs, is a descendant of Guilietta Tolomei, the real Juliet. Further in the book, we find that Julie's real name is Guiletta Tolomei. She finds this out after her great-aunt, Rose, who raised her and her twin sister, Janice, left her a letter and a key and nothing else while her sister inherits everything. The letter tells Juliet that her mother, who died when she was 3 years old, left her a most valuable treasure in Siena. With the letter came a key to a safety deposit box to a bank in Siena. Disappointed and feeling cheated, Julie leaves for Siena without telling her twin sister where she was headed. And so the mystery and action begins as Julie finds out who she really is and the history of her family, the Tolomeis. But as she searches for her and her family's identity, and the hidden treasure left by her mother, she finds that her father and mother could have been murdered and that who ever was after her parents were now after her and in search of the treasure. This book has kept me at the edge of my seat at the turn of every page! Mysteries unfolded over and over again! And when you thought you've had the story all figured out, Anne Fortier throws a curve ball at you and throws you back on that roller coaster ride of twists and turns! And what about that old tale of Romeo and Juliet? Anne's retelling and her sharing of what was found through research of the real Romeo and Juliet was by far a better story that the one retold by Shakespeare. It is definitely more romantic and horribly tragic. The Friar definitely played a bigger part in this retelling than in Shakespeare's. The fictional addition of the curse placed on the Tolomei's and the Salimbeni's (Paris' family in Shakespeare) as well as the sought-out treasure and where it was hidden were such intelligent and creative inventions!Anne Fortier did an amazing job moving back in time to tell the story of Romeo Marescotti and Guilietta Tolomei in 1340 and return back in the present time to weave the story of Julie Jacobs/21st century Guilietta. The movement of going back and forth and the dialogues were expertly done that I was not confused for once as the POVs changed in time. As for our present day Romeo and Juliet/Guilietta, I thought Romeo was swoon-worthy. But that Alessandro Salimbeni (Paris' counterpart)was definitely to die for! I almost hoped for him and Juliet to get together and forget about Romeo. Until of course, Maestro Lippi tells Juliet that there is a real Romeo and that he comes to his studio at night to look at the portrait of the original Juliet/Guilietta, do I start to wonder about this present-day-Romeo and how romantic he sounds! Swoon 3x! Lots of twists and turns happens before present-day-Juliet finds her present-day-Romeo and more twists and turns before we finally find out whether theirs have a happy ending or if it is another tragic one like their ancestors. Anne Fortier's writing was so awe-inspiring and believable! It has compelled me to want to visit Siena and visit all the places mentioned in this book. Her Romeo-and-Juliet has captivated and has definitely inspired me to add this book to my book shelf! If falling in love with a book is possible, then I'm madly in love with this one!

And I wonder even more at all those readers on GR who gave it more than 2--more than 3!--stars. Just goes to show: mediocrity is alive and well.I try to be fair when I review and give stars for every book based on its context. I would not, therefore, rate this silly book badly simply because it's not a Jane Austen or Ernest Hemingway one!Even so, I struggled from the first page, had to fight not to skip the historical chapters, which read like chick-lit posing as history, and almost bit my lips at the end.I won't go into the story, but here are some of the (many, many) problems as I see them:Characters are paper-thin and unbelievable, as if lifted right out of a corny (and not very good) 1930s or 50s British book for teen girls. Aunt Rose, the good twin (who always loses), bad twin (who\u2019s gorgeous and always wins), the inscrutable but fatherly man-servant with the European name, even the setting, Virginia (which not once seemed a real place). It was all so cardboard like that I didn\u2019t believe in the relationships between all these people for one instant. And the premise between the characters seemed incredible, too: I\u2019ve a hard time believing that two orphan girls\u2014twins!\u2014living with an elderly eccentric aunt and even more eccentric butler/nanny, two girls so obviously alone in the world would really grow up to be so different to the point of hating each others\u2019 guts. Unless the writing is strong enough to prove the motivations, I just don\u2019t buy it. Even less believable, then, is the bad twin's sudden appearance mid-way through the book to save her sister: a sister whom, it turns out, she actually loves very much. Really? All too Sweet Valley High for the 21st C chick lit crowd. Ah, the 21st C: it apparently doesn\u2019t exist in this mediocre author\u2019s head. Not once through all these adventures do we have any indication of, say, cell phones, i-Pads, computers, TV or the Internet\u2014not even a good old-fashioned phones! When exactly is this ridiculous story supposed to be set, anyway? I\u2019m pretty sure that even the most die-hard Italian mafia thug has an I-phone hiding somewhere! Don\u2019t you know, it\u2019s a lot easier to catch and kill your prey when you have the benefit of, say, a GPS? Which brings me to another problem: dialogue. It\u2019s so bad for most of the time that it presents a perfect illustration of why writing teachers everywhere, in all languages, tell us: \u201cwrite what you know\u201d! That\u2019s a major problem here, you see. Anne Fortier has decidedly not written what she knows. She grew up in Denmark and only moved to Canada, and then the US, as a full-fledged adult. Now, I\u2019ve been teaching ESL for years and I know perfectly well that Scandinavians\u2014as opposed to, say, Italians: but we\u2019ll get to that later\u2014are some of the best English-as-Second-Language speakers on the planet. They learn it, and learn it well, from an early age (as opposed to, for eg, in Germany, where I live now), read a lot directly in English and have no problems assimilating it. However, the fact remains that English is still only their second language\u2014and not at all the language of their thoughts, their feelings, how they see the world. Of course, once a writer emigrates to the US\u2014a true melting pot\u2014that in and of itself shouldn\u2019t be a major handicap (see Nabokov, who switched from Russian to English and thus penned the great \u201cLolita\u201d) when there\u2019s real talent and perception. Again, think of Nabokov. In Fortier\u2019s case, her written English would have been perfectly fine\u2014above average for a cheap popular novel such as this, really\u2014if she\u2019d stuck to writing what she knows. If, for example, her heroine had been Danish.Instead, she presents us with two 25-year-old post collegiate girls who not once sound like real American contemporaries. Her mistakes vary from Julie describing \u2018bins\u2019 everywhere (a \u2018bin\u2019 is the Brit term for a trashcan) which totally jolted my suspense of disbelief, to sister Janice crying out \u2018Creepers\u2019! Seriously! Has Fortier no 25 year old female friends she could have eavesdropped on? If she hasn\u2019t, she has no business writing these characters, since she herself has never been a 25-year-old American girl and has not enough talent to pretend in these pages.Then we get to Italy. Full disclosure: my paternal family is Italian and I know Italy\u2014especially Sienna and the Tuscany area\u2014very well indeed. I also know Italians very well. And I can safely say I\u2019ve never met one who 1) talked the way the \u2018Juliet\u2019 Italian characters talk and 2) behaved like this. Alessandro, for once, is completely unbelievable. Even that whole backstory sketch\u2014he fought in Iraq (talk about sniffing for points in Middle America!) and shared quarters with Americans, which is how he perfected his English, even this info isn\u2019t enough to redeem his essential non-Italianness. He actually comes off more like a chick-lit hero in Brit novels. Unsurprising, really, considering that in reality Anne Fortier is married to a Brit and knows very few real Italians intimately.Now we get to plot and story points. Here, there is so much awkwardness and so many holes that I\u2019ve no energy to go through them all, one by one. Suffice it to say that\u2014with a strong background in Shakespeare, in classic lit, in Italy and Italians\u2014I couldn\u2019t muster enough enthusiasm for the \u201cWow, did you know the REAL Rome and Juliet was set in Sienna, not Verona?\u201d! I just couldn\u2019t. All I kept thinking was: So what? The genius of Romeo and Juliet lies not in its history or geography or, even, in its star-crossed lovers\u2014it is the genius of Shakespeare which is, in essence, the genius of his language and the ideas about love, life, death and humanity expressed therein. Everything else is pretty much inconsequential. Sure, Sienna is a fascinating city with a fascinating history\u2014but this adds very little to the story of Romeo and Juliet. Even discovering that \u201cWow, did you know that there was an ORIGINAL Rome and Juliet\u201d is simply not half as earth-shattering as the author would like it to be. Again: So what? In the context of the time\u2014and the continent\u2019s\u2014history and society, why should this be that surprising? There were probably other fascinating star-crossed lovers, too, and so what? Rome and Juliet is what it is as a piece of literature because of Shakespeare, period. So finally we get to the weakest and most idiotic aspect of this essentially teen-romance novel: I found it really hard to care for modern-day Julie\u2019s quest. This is a girl presented to us as fickle and financially irresponsible because she\u2019d always reckoned on inheriting her aunt\u2019s fortune. And I\u2019m supposed to feel empathy? Worse, after her \u2018adventure\u2019 what has she really learned? Well, she may not have found her fortune but she sure found Prince Charming\u2014so who cares that she\u2019s never created a career for herself or is deep in debt, right? In the end, this is a conservative, superficial chick-lit tale written as if for an even younger audience\u2014those Twilight readers\u2014with a supposedly metaphysical sheen (a centuries-old family feud! A curse on the family! A heroine who apparently dies only to be revived, Sleeping Beauty style, by the true descendant of Romeo!).

I had an awful English teacher, we were all forced to pair up to read the play aloud, every class a new Romeo and Juliet were selected for the roles, and for some reason the woman had the insufferable need to make Romeo and Juliet kiss on every necessary scene.I\u2019m pretty sure that should\u2019ve been taken up with the principle by someone.Inappropriate teacher aside, I never liked the story. I found it overly dramatic and, in the end, completely stupid when you take the actions of two overly eager, stubborn, irrational teenagers surrounded by people who seemed in capable of seeing what was going on right under their noses.Therefore, the thing that drew me in with Juliet and made me want to read was the fact that the whole thing seemed to be set up as some sort of thrilling adventure through the streets of Siena meant for the sake of discovering a great treasure left behind by the legacy of the female lead in this famous tragedy.And it was. This was a non-stop adventure with so many plot twists that it left me reeling. Don\u2019t get me wrong, a few times I wondered when things would just settle down and surprises would stop knocking me upside the head when I finally thought I was getting to the end of things. However, it was such an exciting story to follow.And for ONCE\u2014finally!\u2014I was able to read a story about Romeo and Giulietta that, although still highly dramatic, had more of the realism that I initially craved in Shakespeare\u2019s play. There was real emotion and angst and true pain in this story that went so far beyond just two people in love in a time when marriages were arranged for political gain and families warred for the sake of honor.It was a lovely and passionate retelling of a classic."}, {"userName": "Fenia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18261002-fenia", "userReview": "Brilliant book!!

The scenery and the story that Anne built around it is so captivating..The story of Romeo and Juliet is one of the greatest love stories ever known, the fact that it could be true? MINDBLOWING!!!

But the shock goes even deeper when she learns that the woman who has been like a mother to her has left her entire estate to Julie\u2019s twin sister. The only thing Julie receives is a key\u2014one carried by her mother on the day she herself died\u2014to a safety-deposit box in Siena, Italy. This key sends Julie on a journey that will change her life forever\u2014a journey into the troubled past of her ancestor Giulietta Tolomei. In 1340, still reeling from the slaughter of her parents, Giulietta was smuggled into Siena, where she met a young man named Romeo. Their ill-fated love turned medieval Siena upside-down and went on to inspire generations of poets and artists, the story reaching its pinnacle in Shakespeare\u2019s famous tragedy. But six centuries have a way of catching up to the present, and Julie gradually begins to discover that here, in this ancient city, the past and present are hard to tell apart. The deeper she delves into the history of Romeo and Giulietta, and the closer she gets to the treasure they allegedly left behind, the greater the danger surrounding her\u2014superstitions, ancient hostilities, and personal vendettas. As Julie crosses paths with the descendants of the families involved in the unforgettable blood feud, she begins to fear that the notorious curse\u2014\u201cA plague on both your houses!\u201d\u2014is still at work, and that she is destined to be its next target. Only someone like Romeo, it seems, could save her from this dreaded fate, but his story ended long ago. Or did it? From Anne Fortier comes a sweeping, beautifully written novel of intrigue and identity, of love and legacy, as a young woman discovers that her own fate is irrevocably tied\u2014for better or worse\u2014to literature\u2019s greatest star-crossed lovers.", "title": "Juliet", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6718608-juliet", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366399299l/6718608.jpg", "reviews": 3647, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3024821.Anne_Fortier", "name": "Anne Fortier"}], "type": ["Historical", "Romance", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6718608-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8309056-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30178461-lanetler-ve-l-tuflar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15989457", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7978783-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10201477-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9986896-julieta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12849354-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077814-the-lost-sisterhood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12374779-hyrder-p-bjerget", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15919303-juliet-vol-2-of-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15919304-juliet-vol-1-of-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39003786-juliette", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11781578-lover-s-leap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable"]}
