One thing that struck me in \"Rolling Nowhere\" and also in reading about his work as a guard in Sing Sing, is his willingness to risk losing himself completely as he works to understand all the mechanisms at play in a given setting or situation. It is almost as if he is very lovingly taking apart a broken, yet magnificent watch, and crawling inside it and settling in with its gears until he can barely distinguish himself from the ongoing activity. He allows himself to feel the brokenness, camaraderie, pressure and desire of the investigated world, but never taking his eyes off the larger structures at work or his own privileged positioning. From what I can gather he tends to investigate extreme circumstances, and to really look for the driving social, emotional and economic forces at play. After diving (or hopping) into the world of the American hobo (whether or not citizenship is granted, all of the people he encounters in this book are living a hobo life in the U.S.), Conover finds communities of people and more solo fliers who don't fit into any kind of American mainstream. He values their incredible resourcefulness, knowledge and skill. They may not be living in a well-understood, or broadly-accepted way, but they have found some way to take care of themselves -- a way to live in a world that often doesn't have much to offer. It is painful to see Conover struggling with questions that go something like this: \"am I, could I become, a life-long hobo? Could I get lost in this world?\" He discovers that there is an almost mystical wall one crosses in order to live as a hobo. And when he crosses to the other side, he is no longer seen by \"outsiders\" as fully human. On the other hand, he finds that the people he once ignored or looked down upon or saw others look down upon and mistrust, are skilled survivors living in entirely different but overlapping cities and towns. And he finds pleasure in becoming skilled enough to survive in these \"other\" worlds. I am going end with a quote from Goodreads member Ron because he captures the spirit of the book so beautifully and succinctly.\"With little knowledge of real hobo life, Conover left college in the East, jumped a train in St. Louis and headed west. In the months that followed, he crossed and recrossed 14 states, meeting and traveling with a dozen or more modern-day hoboes. He learned from them how to survive, living off of handouts, sleeping rough, avoiding the railroad police. And he learned about loneliness and loss of identity.There are moments of pure pleasure, a tin cup of steaming coffee on a cold high plains morning, the unbroken landscape gliding by open boxcar doors.

In his travels, he discovered two itinerant worlds, sometimes overlapping, that are often misunderstood, and invisible to most Americans. In many ways na\u00efve and sometimes too trusting, Conover also discovered the limits of his middle class upbringing. His first two books, \"Rolling Nowhere\" and \"Coyotes\" were based on his experiences. Together they represent a kind of coming of age in America.With little knowledge of real hobo life, Conover left college in the East, jumped a train in St. Louis and headed west.

I greatly enjoyed this book and was often touched by Conover's youthful pursuit of independence and experience, often taking risks and crashing head-on into realities he does not anticipate. At the end, the romance of the rails has been pretty much stripped away; he's not sorry, but he's had enough.His book \"Coyotes\" is a great companion to this one, as it shows him a little older and somewhat wiser, on yet another risk-taking adventure that throws him into yet another marginal world."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135322-chris", "userReview": "What is most interesting about this book about riding freight trains with the tramps and hobos is that this is from the early 80s, not present day. I know lots of folks who ride freights and many of them have written zines about it. If this book was more present day, I might view it a bit different. Essentially Conover was an east coast college student who decided to experience tramp life riding the rails. He went about it as a bit of an anthropological study and gave himself to it 100%. His experiences are interesting and insightful and while ultimately his young white male middle class privledge gives him an \"out\" anytime he needs it, he tries not to and consequently learns quite a bit not only about getting around on the rails, but also on surviving in yard jungles amongst those who (mostly) have little or no choice in their circumstances. What is quite depressing is how hard it is to get up and out of the life for most and the drinking that ultimately consumes so many. While some drink their days away, others go for day labor, or welfare, or relief offered at the missions. Conover learns a lot and survives quite well to tell an interesting story. Many things have changed in 18+ years and many have not, just as though much has changed on the rails in 60 years and much has not. I'm curious to check out his other books about Coyotes on the border and working as a guard at Sing Sing."}, {"userName": "Jermajesty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131836-jermajesty", "userReview": "A worthy heir to Gonzo Journalism- \"Hell's Angels\" with hoboes.

He's a great storyteller with an ethnographer's flair and nowhere is this more evident than in this, his most 'gonzo' book, about riding the rails with hobos. Conover's book reads like an ethnography which perhaps isn't too surprising considering he first thought of it as an anthropology thesis, despite some criticism from his professors. It went on to become, at least in my opinion an american classic, giving us a snapshot of survival and freedom on the raggedy edge of society in the 80s.Enthralled by stories of hobo wanderers and folk songs Conover went out to seek the last few of these american legends in the 80s. What he found was amazing. A cadre of the last few hardened hoboes, a 'freegan' lifestyle out of necessity rather than hipsterdom and a society that likes the sin but hates the sinner, both in love with the hobo legend and offended by hoboes themselves.This is probably Conover's best work and I say this having loved Coyotes.Read it."}, {"userName": "D.

Conover captures some interesting details of the culture and customs of riding the rails, but the sense that \"if you called your dad, he could stop it all.\" I read the Rolling Nowhere because I was looking for an in-depth history of hobo culture in the U.S.--a book that does not appear to exist in any form--and looked at whatever I could find on the subject. Perhaps my problem with the book is with my own expectations; I thought it would chronicle a legitimately disaffected youth dropping out of society, experiencing the hobo life (and, more importantly, the hobo mindset), and returning to us to tell the tale.Instead, Conover readily admits in an updated introduction/reflection that he was little more than an average, well-adjusted college graduate looking to make a name for himself as a journalist. Rolling Nowhere depicts his travels in the form of personal essays, where he initially relates to what he experiences like an alien. He tries very hard, as the book progresses, to show that the experience transformed him, but I never got the sense that what got him through it was little more than survival instinct and the knowledge that the anecdotes would build his story to the proper crescendo. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that he played with the real chronology of events for maximum effect.The writing itself is good, engaging and at times poetic (sometimes self-consciously so), but I wanted at least one of two things from this book: background information on hobo history and the development of the subculture, and/or an experience of hobo life through the eyes of someone who really, truly belonged to that culture. Rolling Nowhere didn't have either, and Conover doesn't provide much insight into the personalities or psychology of the odd characters he meets in his travels. It's a dud, from that perspective."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5869004-adam", "userReview": "I read Ted Conover's second book \"Coyotes: A Journey Across Borders With America's Ilegal Migrants\" (1987) before I read \"Rolling Nowhere\" and think that \"Coyotes\" is a far better book if you are going to choose only one. It is more polished in prose and, I think, has a more interesting story to tell. Nevertheless, \"Rolling Nowhere\" is very good book and a recommended read to those who have ever wanted to hop a freight. Conover rode the rails in 1980 and the account of his journey gives depth of understanding to the world of hoboes and provides a glimpse into their pysche. Since he first published the book, I think that more info has come to light on homelessness, particularly with the increased problems of homelessness that came with Reagan-era budget cuts. Yet Conover, because of his lived experience with hoboes, offers an empathetic (though not glowing) description of a largely invisible world that goes beyond mere statistics. In the new edition of the book, however, Conover notes that the world of rails and \"jungles\" that he experienced differs from the experiences of the homeless today. Still, I think a number of themes and characteristics likely carryover. As mentioned, I read \"Coyotes\" before reading \"Rolling Nowhere.\" Hence, for me, the most interestings sections of \"Rolling Nowhere\" were his encounters with undocumented migrants from Mexico and his brief experience in the citrus orchards. His appreciation for the work ethic of undocumented migrants shows in these early encounters and undoubtedly planted the seed of interest that led him to travel, work, and live with undocumented workers. He then chronicled these experiences in \"Coyotes,\" a book that is a must read for anybody concerned with or interested in immigration issues."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279801-jill", "userReview": "I thought a book about hoboes would be more compelling, honestly. I liked the idea--a young, privileged, white college student takes to the rails to find out what it's really like to live this lifestyle. What's most compelling, to me, is that Conover didn't have a book deal or a travel stipend--he just wanted to do it, so he did it. The book came later. However, I was hoping for more analysis, more context. What I got was a day-by-day account of Conover's experiences on the rails. In the introduction, Conover says he was reluctant to publish his inner thoughts, so I was expecting more interiority, more rumination on what drove him to take this kind of trip.

The reality in nonfiction just isn't as appealing as the worlds of fantasy and imagination in fiction. But of course, there are exceptions. Rolling Nowhere Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes is an eye opening adventure that allows the reader to follow the author, Ted Conover, on his journey across the country as he rides the rails and lives the life of a tramp. Throughout the experience, he comes across unique people and situations that change his perspective on who tramps are and why they live the way they do. Conover starts the book off with his first time jumping onto the trains, but quickly rewinds back to the time before his journey. We are introduced to the reasons why he wanted to see what a tramp's life was like and his reflection on what kind of people they were. In the beginning of his trip, everything fascinates him and his endless curiosity. The life of a tramp was just like he thought it was: full of freedom and carelessness. He meets endlessly interesting tramps and gets himself into endlessly exciting circumstances that there is almost never a dull moment in the book. The vivid detail used to describe what he is seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, and feeling made me feel as though I was sitting right next to Conover as he was talking to the fellow tramp or riding in the box-cart. The second half of the book begins to explore deeper into the world of a tramp. As Conover continues riding the rails, he meets more and more radical people and is faced with more and more difficult encounters. Discrimination, sexual harassment, violence, betrayal, it's all there and really gives the reader a new insight on what hoboes truly feel. He realizes that being a tramp isn't just all fun and games and his own perspective changes as well. The characterization of the author himself is evident as he is a completely different person by the end of the book. His feelings of loneliness, hopelessness and fear are very down to earth and are portrayed with such vigor that I could feel it pounding in my chest. Conover exposes the reader to every aspect of his experiences with other tramps: their disgusting lifestyle, their mental scars, their disturbing reasons for becoming a tramp, he shows it all and I felt like my own insight was changing along with Conover's. By the end of the book, you are left questioning society and its treatment of tramps. The book Rolling Nowhere Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes is an invigorating rollercoaster ride that will leave you breathless at the end. It illustrates both the freedoms and the restrictions of being a tramp oh so vividly and reveals to the reader anything and everything about his experience, no matter how vile it is. At the end, you will emerge a different person with a different outlook on your life and I highly recommend this book to anyone willing to do so."}, {"userName": "Brook", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58498-brook", "userReview": "3.5 stars.C'mon, it's another \"rich kid rides the rails\" book, man. You just reviewed one of those in 2013, Riding Toward Everywhere. Why do this one, too?Well, for one, it was recommended to me. Two, Conover is not a one-off writer who just penned his experiences, like the above book and, say, A Walk Across America. He's an investigative journalist who \"goes deep,\" immersing himself in the environment he wishes to report on. This was his first effort, as a college student studying anthropology at small, liberal Amherst College in Massachusetts. The sincerity and naivete of the book is what sells it. As the author notes in the preface to the 2001 edition, it's really journal entries edited into a book, not a book based upon notes, so it reads very open. Conover does not dwell anywhere long, and takes \"breaks\" to get back to \"civilization\", staying with friends and friends of friends for short spells. The book is largely free of unnecessarily, overly-poetic passages like \"the sun shone over the fields like a golden ocean with tiny tractor ships sailing like lone pirates,\" etc, etc. There is some good imagery, but the reader is left to form his own impression of the trip and scenery. Most descriptions beyond \"it was very pretty\" are left out. This works well. It's not Kerouac, it's a guy who would become an anthropologist and serious journalist telling a story of people he meets on the road. Where I gave Riding Toward Everywhere 2 stars, this one is just better in every way, and provides a glimpse into the world of tramps and railroads at the start of the 80s. The preface, which I read after finishing the book (a neat way to read non-fiction accounts that works well), notes that pretty much everything he describes is gone now - and the 2001 edition was published just before 9/11 would further tighten down rail yards.This book definitely gave me a hankering to take a short trip myself (even as late as the 80s, students, workers, and vacationers saw riding the rails as a \"legitimate\", if not legal, way to travel, even for something as mundane as a school commute or football game). However, in today's world, with the brakemen and many sympathetic railroad and railyard workers gone, stepping into at train yard to catch a ride might be closer to stepping onto the grounds of a power plant than what is described here.Enjoyable, and fascinating from a sociological point of view.

In 1980 he took a break from his university to find out, and this is his story. Yes, hoboes still ride the rails west of the Mississippi. Black, White, Mexican, even a few (very few!) women. They own what they carry, their food is often scavenged from dumpsters, their clothes come from charities, many are addicted to cheap booze, and they are likely to spend their nights in makeshift tents in \"jungles\" by the railroad, or at the \"Sally\" (Salvation Army), and at times, in a local jail. Conover discovers these harsh realities and allows the reader to share his impressions. What sets those hoboes apart from (say) the homeless of New York is their close association with railroads. A hobo's schedule may involve avoiding rail yard guards (\"bulls\"), boarding trains already in motion, huddling beneath \"piggyback\" trailers tied to a flatcar which is rolling at high speed into pouring rain, and arriving at unexpected destinations. His geography of the United States differs from ours, focusing on large railroad yards--Havre, Montana; Wishram, Washington; Colton, California, etc. Cities are rated by the opportunities they offer a vagrant. Who are these people? Why do they put up with such a hard and dangerous life, even the many who are strong enough to earn a living conventionally? Some, in fact, do work, especially illegal Mexican immigrants, who form a class of their own--speaking Spanish, keeping their dignity and working diligently, but living in a legal limbo. Most hoboes however hit the road because they shun any long term commitment: they are loners, outcasts of society, rolling nowhere. As the author befriends them (the associations rarely last long), he listens to their stories, often laced with fantasy, and find finds a great diversity. Hoboes do not lack ability and most can be surprisingly generous to strangers. But each seems to have his trail of trouble, of broken marriages, alcoholism, uncontrolled temper or unreal dreams. This book tells an interesting story, but seems to offer little hope for those that still ride the rails, whose greatest handicap is usually within their own minds."}, {"userName": "Nathaniel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/266462-nathaniel", "userReview": "Conover wrote this book while he was still an undergraduate at Amherst; but it establishes his method as an author. He is a combination of cultural chameleon (spy), investigative journalist, anthropologist, autobiographer and social commentator. He pulls off this combination nicely. Paul Theroux, at his best and least obnoxious has a similar style of telling true stories; but Conover is more political and engaged--in his action and focus. I haven't read John Howard Griffin's \"Black Like Me\"--the story of Griffin's experiences as a white man, painted to look like a black man, in the American South of the early 20th century--but it seems that Griffin's book had the most profound impact on Conover's methodology and concerns.Conover's style has matured a great deal since \"Rolling Nowhere\", as has the sharpness of his perception and the importance of his research. It might grate some people when Conover's pampered background prances into the foreground, especially when he seems so pleased with himself for managing the transition from rich kid to railway tramp; but those moments do provide readers with a much clearer understanding of the nature and limitations of their narrator. I'm thinking about moments like, \"I had dismissed the church as simply the place in whose lot my dad used to park his sports car. Looking again, I saw a number of young men lounging around on the lawn outisde the place, and all of a sudden remembered similar scenes from days when I had passed the church with Dad. He worried about the safety of his car with guys like those around, and had intentionally looked away from them. That had frightened me. Tonight, though, I exchanged greetings with some.\" Balancing out some of the hokier, doctors in Aspen type references, is the perspective Conover develops of his own background. For instance, \"Being suddenly among the Stanford students was less a solace than a shock. Most of them were from wealthy backgrounds, had seen few hard times, and appeared to be suffering the maladies that an overdose of comfort can cause: self-indulgence, self-pity, self-absorption.\" It was a clear sign of the talented and significant author that Conover turned out to be, that he managed to write this book at the dawn of his twenties without being self-indulgent, self-pitying or self-absorbed."}, {"userName": "Joshua", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597996-joshua", "userReview": "I picked up Rolling Nowhere after rereading Ted Conover's ,cite>Coyotes, which is a really brilliant narrative of his immersion into the world of illegal migrant workers.

He does a good job reporting on the lifestyle, and for that the book is definitely worth reading. Where it falls a bit flat, though, is that it is definitely being told through the eyes of a 24 year-old grad student who is exploring a culture to which he doesn't really have a visceral connection nor the life experience to see the down and out existence of life on the road as more than a grand adventure. And while this attitude -- almost as though he is embarking on his journey into this subculture as a summer camp experience -- changes dramatically over the course of his adventures, Conover himself alludes in the book's forward to looking at this work with the benefit of twenty years of living under his belt and being amused by the obvious child he was when he wrote it.That aside this is a good read, not as good as Coyotes but worth checking out for anyone who is interested in the recounting of what I read as the last throes of the uniquely American hobo culture."}, {"userName": "David Ward", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/329996-david-ward", "userReview": "Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes by Ted Conover (Vintage Books 2001) (305.568).

When not scrounging hand outs Conover and his cohorts sleep in makeshift shelters of cardboard and junk in \"jungles\" on the outskirts of towns. Conover attempts earnestly to engage with these borderline personalities and ends up getting abruptly rebuffed or threatened with a bashing. Conover genuinely takes on the life of a tramp complete with eating food from dumpsters, contracting lice and being arrested. The context of the book stuck me as relentlessly grim and aside from the earnest freshman Conover, the characters in the book were all pretty much unpleasant. It would have been a better book had Conover described more about the US rail network or gave his impressions of the cities he visited or wrote more of the magnificent countryside he rode by.

If you've never read Conover, this is a good start -- he has some great books -- and I can't recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4084873-patricia", "userReview": "This is a very decent read, but I didn't give it more stars because I have the same discomfort with it that the author has when he rereads it after 20 years (it was republished--first time around was 1981): the lack of maturity and the pretense of vast experience that he had as a young man, just out of college. It also annoys me when people make a decision to put themselves in danger in order to experience \"the other side\" and then go on and on about how rough that life is for them, when we know full well that they could just walk away from it any time, unlike most of the other men he rides with. Those things aside, though, he writes well and many of the people he encounters are memorable. I once saw a hobo when we were eating by the side of some tracks and a train went slowly by. The guy was standing in the open door of a box car. I've thought of him many times, and this book helped me imagine his life a bit more fully."}, {"userName": "Jim Krotzman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8919972-jim-krotzman", "userReview": "I enjoyed the book, but it took the romanticism out of hopping trains. As a tramp one automatically becomes part of the under class. He relies on food stamps, missions, day labor. H works the system. He is worried about other tramps, bulls, railroad yards. People do not want to know tramps. One should realize that the hobo is not 'one of them;' he is one of us. I agree with the author that we can repeal victimless crimes like public intoxication and vagrancy, and that food, clothing, and shelter are basic human rights. I was interested in the way tramps treat other tramps. There are no good-byes, introductions, favors for one another, and names. This book took place in 1980, so the possibility of hopping trains in 2016 may be almost zero. I don't know. This is a quick read, but not empty-headed."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/620387-joanna", "userReview": "This book was read by the author, but read approximately 20 years after the book was first published. I thought he did a very nice job with the reading.The book itself is a wonderful combination of a memoir and a slice of history. As the author notes in the introduction that accompanies the re-release of the book, train-riding hoboes are pretty much gone now. Between a reduction in rail use, the conglomeration of rail companies into larger and more bureaucratic corporations, improved computer tracking across state lines of welfare benefits, and decreased availability of welfare, the type of free-traveling hobo that Conover encountered is probably hard to find today.I enjoyed seeing the author's own development over the course of his few months and watching as his own experience and attitude shifted. A fun read."}, {"userName": "Noah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2059153-noah", "userReview": "While studying anthropology at Amherst, Conover decided to take leave and live as a hobo for his research. Normally this is the sort of Ehrenreichian ploy I would roll my eyes at, but on the strength of Conover's other books, I was willing to make an exception. This book is a little rougher around the edges than Coyotes or Newjack, but when you consider that he was still basically a kid during the experience, his maturity and insight is startling. He paints a complex picture of life at the economic bottom, and it's hard to form any easy judgments. For every tramp he meets who seems pure of heart but snakebitten, there's another who continues to willfully make bad choices and exploit the system. It's hard to know how relevant his portrait of tramp culture is thirty years later, but even if it amounts to a historical artifact, it's still worth the read."}, {"userName": "Jesse Garza", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14143685-jesse-garza", "userReview": "I loved this book! While not glamorizing himself, the people he meets, the places, or life on the rails, the author does an excellent job of bringing to life the characters he meets as he rides the rails through middle American and the west. Although he does recognize some who go out of their way to help others, they're not all heroes, they're not all even marginally nice. His descriptions of the rules of hobo life and hard realities of survival and how it changes people were well written and woven into the story. From getting arrested in Denver to hurrying to the \"Sally\" (Salvation Army) in time to make breakfast, he subtly weaves the most intriguing part of the book, how his adventure changed him. You almost understand why he stomped on another tramp's hand when he tried to board \"his\" boxcar. Looking forward to reading his other books very soon."}, {"userName": "Shayne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7453859-shayne", "userReview": "Couldn't decide whether to go with \"honest but infuriatingly naive\" or \"infuriatingly naive but honest\"; it's both, and neither wins out. The author was obviously young at the time of writing, and that is just part of the book. Still, it is a story of his adventure, told from his immature point of view. He mentions John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me along the way, but the big difference between these is that Griffin brings along a lifetime of perspective and wisdom to his work that unites the tale into more than a picaresque series of episodes; Conover's feels more disjointed, almost a series of vignettes. Also, he's constantly unsure of who he is in relation to the tramps with whom he lives, invoking a familiar \"mid-twenties existential quandary\" motif. I'm not sure that this is a coming of age story, but it certainly is a young man's adventure."}], "description": "In Ted Conover's first book, now back in print, he enters a segment of humanity outside society and reports back on a world few of us would chose to enter but about which we are all curious.Hoboes fascinated Conover, but he had only encountered them in literature and folksongs. So, he decided to take a year off and ride the rails. Equipped with rummage-store clothing, a bedroll, and a few other belongings, he hops a freight train in St. Louis, becoming a tramp in order to discover their peculiar culture. The men and women he meets along the way are by turns generous and mistrusting, resourceful and desperate, philosophical and profoundly cynical. And the narrative he creates of his travels with them is unforgettable and moving.", "title": "Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54961.Rolling_Nowhere_Riding_the_Rails_with_America_s_Hoboes", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403187878l/54961.jpg", "reviews": 78, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30092.Ted_Conover", "name": "Ted Conover"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Travel", "Autobiography", "History", "Biography Memoir"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54961.Rolling_Nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4931017-rolling-nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2445346.Rolling_Nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53225.Newjack", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119980.Coyotes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6681558-the-routes-of-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119979.Whiteout", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12786060-the-fair-ophelia"]}
