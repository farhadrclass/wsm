I have to commend the authors for taking to heart the realities of modern life. While still keeping the stories clean, most of these stories have at least one main character with a difficult past, including divorce, a childhood in multiple foster families, crime, difficulties in school, past promiscuity, and so forth. It's one of the more realistic clean romance reads that I've come across. There are the usual issues with some of the stories being not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked, due to their length, but I noticed it here less than I did in A Timeless Romance Anthology: Mail Order Bride Collection. Otherwise I think this is an unusually good read for its genre. Romance readers who like meet-cute (or meet-again-cute) will be pleased.I'm not going to bother with a summary of each of the six novellas, since they're so short and the Goodreads blurb does an unusually good job of summarizing them. I have to say that I got a good chuckle out of the blurb writer using almost the identical set of adjectives for these stories that they used for the Mail Order Bride collection: each novella is described as \"sweet,\" \"charming,\" \"captivating,\" \"endearing,\" \"delightful\" or \"enchanting/engaging.\" D'aww!I'm curious whether any thought was put into which adjective to attach to which story, or whether it was luck of the draw?"}, {"userName": "Kathy * Bookworm Nation", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075341-kathy-bookworm-nation", "userReview": "I had to grab this one the day it released. It was another fun collection of short stories. There were a few I wish were full-length novels, but overall they were all a fun mini escape. This is one of my favorite from the Timeless Romance Anthologies. Too Good To Be True by Heather MooreThis ended up being one of my favorite of the bunch and one that I think would make a good full-length novel. I wouldn't mind spending more time with Jack and Gwen! Gwen and Jack come from totally different backgrounds, but find love in each other. I really enjoyed this one!Gone Fishing by Kaylee BaldwinMs. Baldwin is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. This was a really cute story and I was quickly sucked in and sad when it ended. Great characters and a fun plot. The Pier Changes Everything by Annette LyonThis was a sweet story about long-lost love and finding peace. Alex and Michael meet at the Pier, both going there to try and find closure on their painful pasts. They realize they have chemistry right away and take a chance on each other. Cute story.A Hero's Song by Jennifer MooreI've really enjoyed Ms. Moore's historicals and was curious what one of her contemporaries would be like. I was not disappointed, it was great! I hope she continues writing historicals and throws in some contemporaries while she's at it! One of my favorites of the collection!Stay With Me by Shannon GuymonI knew this one would be good, I love all of Guymon's books and this was a fun treat while waiting for her next book to come out. I thought this had a fun plot and likable characters. A Place to Call Home by Sarah EdenWhy doesn't Eden write contemporaries more? I LOVE her regencies, but I have really enjoyed reading her contemporaries through this Timeless collection. She really has a knack for writing, no matter what the setting. This was another hit, I really enjoyed it!Overall, this was a fun collection. I lived in San Diego for a few years and it was fun to revisit some of the places I used to go. California is a great setting for books and for falling in love. If you enjoy contemporary romance you need to check these out.

My favorite authors all combined with my favorite setting in the world. California. Yes, I'm biased. I grew up in California, my family is in California and even though I'm not living there now, bits of my heart are scattered all over that state.These romance novellas are all sweet and clean. They made my romantic heart flutter and brought a smile to my face. I really loved all of them. As per usual, I plowed right through them all, one right after the other.

They are each sweet, lighthearted, clean, contemporary romances, based in California. (Hence the title:) My favorite thing about these anthologies is that you can read one of the stories easily in one setting, rather than having to set it aside repeatedly or loose tons of sleep to finish it. As a busy mom that comes in very handy! It's also a great way to be introduced to new amazing authors that you might not be familiar with and therefore search out some of their other work. The only thing I struggle with them is that, because they are so short, I find myself at times wishing for more depth. I will get so lost in some of the stories and enjoying the characters so much that it makes you want more. :)....and wish that they were full novels. Having said that, I would still definitely recommend them to anyone looking for just a fun, sweet, quick read that will leave you smiling. :)"}, {"userName": "Jessie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1365304-jessie", "userReview": "It's for sale on Amazon now, and there's a story by Shannon Guymon in it! I'm in \"instalove\" already!I love the Timeless Romance Anthologies, and California Dreamin' did not disappoint! When I first saw that it would be a collection about California I pictured Hollywood. I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the novellas. Granted all of the stories took place on or near the beach, but I met a photographer, fishermen, old friends reunited, an author, a musician, a nanny, and a realtor. The novellas are the perfect length for reading in one sitting, yet developed enough that they don't feel rushed or abrupt. I enjoyed all of the stories, and am having a hard time trying to decide which was my favorite (Shannon Guymon's, Sarah Eden's, or Kaylee Baldwin's).If you're looking for a clean set of romances that will leave you smiling, this is the book for you!Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book through the publisher, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Heidi Robbins (Heidi Reads...)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/966933-heidi-robbins-heidi-reads", "userReview": "I'm seriously addicted to these novella collections. I love reading them in between longer books and especially on busy days to get a quick fix. I enjoyed all these stories equally and the California setting was definitely close to home! The first one by Heather Moore was even set at a beach we go to frequently throughout the year and especially in the summer. It is impressive that the characters and plot are introduced quickly but in a way that doesn't feel rushed.

I love the way each story had a similar thread, yet were each so different. And oh, so good! I loved meeting each of these couples and wished each and every story could be full-length, as I was completely enamored with every single one of them. This is one of my favorite anthologies to date and my heart was pounding with romantic anticipation throughout the whole thing. This is perfect for fans of sweet and clean romances, with nothing more than kissing, and each story can be read in a sitting. I always plan on savoring them, but end up devouring the whole book. I love these authors!Too Good To Be True by Heather B. MooreI love it when a normal, everyday girl meets a dream guy and doesn't even know it! Gwen is very down to earth and focused on her photography business, but she can't help but notice good looking Jack. He's charming and everything about him really does seem too good to be true, but he's only human. The way the interest in each other builds is utterly delightful. I loved his adorable sister almost as much as I loved Jack and Gwen is just as sweet as can be! This is a darling story set in a fun setting.Gone Fishing by Kaylee BaldwinI love the ocean and a story with a strong presence on a boat was just perfect for me! Claire needs her dad to come home, but is surprised to meet his partner, who knows a lot about her. First meetings aren't also a good indicator of how a relationship will be because things sure didn't start out on a great foot for Claire and Miguel! Another charming story is found in this one and I devoured every minute of it.The Pier Changes Everything by Annette LyonSecond chances are so romantic. Michael and Alexandria both have pasts to recover from and after spending a day together, find comfort in each other and in a surprise revelation. This story is filled with nostalgic moments, as well as hope for the future and really tugged on my heartstrings.A Hero's Song by Jennifer MooreOnce again, I love a good second chance story and this one fit the bill perfectly! AnneMarie, a romance novelist, reconnects with her former love, guitar player, Lance, on a talk show. Can you say sparks?! I love the way he tries to win her over with music and the journey they take to find reconciliation.Stay With Me by Shannon GuymonI've always wondered what it would be like to go out of state to nanny and felt that the experience Jolie had was so romantic--and scary! I was living vicariously through her. I would hate to work for someone as mean as Mrs. James, but to have a fun, flirtatious fling with the chauffeur would make it totally worth it. Fitz is darling and I loved the way Jolie worms her way into the hearts of her charges in a snap.A Place to Call Home by Sarah M. EdenI need a friend like Ada in my life! She's a dream realtor and such a sweet person and friend. Craig hires her to find the perfect place for him and his son, but she doesn't count on finding a place in her heart for this incredible duo. I loved these characters and their fun personalities. I think these kind of people totally make a story that much more enjoyable.*I received a copy from an author in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9294551-christy", "userReview": "This review first appeared on my blog Christy's Cozy Corners. You all know by now that I love clean romance books. This collection is full of more winners. These are really short little novellas that will capture your heart and imagination. The entire compilation is only 350 pages, so this is a book you can finish quickly. Each of these stories grabbed my attention right away and kept me reading straight through to the ends. I found myself wishing that these were full sized novels. The characters are charming and the romance is sweet and clean. Each story is unique, yet they all are set in California on the beach which makes this the perfect book to pick up for the summer. Summer just makes me want to read beach themed books. I can\u2019t say that one story stood out as my favorite, but I think that Stay with Me\u2019s characters gripped my heart the most. The little ones that Jolie was hired to watch only want love and attention, and they don\u2019t get a lot of it from their famous parents. The way the story plays out is very cute. I highly recommend this to all of you who want a quick, sweet romance to read whether you\u2019re on the beach or not!"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6916123-sharon", "userReview": "This book is written by some of my favorite authors.

They have turned out another fun and sweet collection. I loved all the stories in this collection. In Too Good to be True, by Heather B. Moore, Gwen is a wedding photographer still smarting from her divorce. She has a hard time believing something good can come her way. Jack, on the other hand, is disillusioned by his money and not knowing if the girls he dates like him for his money or for himself. Besides the fact that he's too busy to date anyway. This is a cute story of girl meets rich, famous guy but doesn't recognize him, so she gets to know him for who he really is. Jack enjoys the fact that she doesn't recognize him and takes advantage of it for a day or two. Jacks sister is a hoot and just fun to watch. I liked the story about learning to love again and accepting the good things that come your way. Gone Fishing, by Kaylee Baldwin it a fun story. It is also a great story about second chances and looking past the exterior and finding the good inside someone. The story starts out with a splash (pun intended) and goes from there. Claire has to remember her dreams and Miguel is just the person to help her. I thought the story was fun and had a great lesson. Annette Lyon\u2019s The Pier Changes Everything, fate brings Alex and Michael together on the pier. I liked how they both ended up there at just the right time. This is another sweet story about changing and learning about yourself and looking beyond the outer shell to see what's beneath. Alex and Michael are on a journey of love and discovery. Michael has to overcome his fear of dating and realize that all women aren't shallow. I thought the fun scrapes they got into while re,e,Bering who hey really were, made the story believable and made me cheer for them. A Hero\u2019s Song, by Jennifer Moore made me want to jump up and cheer. There was deception and maneuvering to get the two of the together that made me just laugh and cry at the same time. This was another story of forgiveness and change, looking beyond the past mistakes and realizing that people can change and that there are two sides to every story. AnneMarie and Lance have to dig deep inside themselves to see if they can make it work this time around. In Stay With Me, by Dhannon Guymon, you will find a fun, sweet romance that warms your heart and makes you want to fall in love again. Jolie must step outside her comfort zone and reach out for love. I liked the realness of this story and how she not only fell in love with the good guy, but fell in love with her life and the people around here especially the kids. Sarah M. Eden does not dissapoint in her story, A Place to Call Home. As usual, she draws you in and brings her characters to life. I love the attention to detail and the realness of the characters. Ada and Craig are real and believable. Of course they have their trials. I especially laughed at Craig and his inept attempts to ask Ada out and actually go on a date. The \u2018proposal\u2019 was the best!The timeless romance collections are the best and this one is right up there with the rest. You will laugh and cry and cheer!

I always jump at a chance to get a book from this series. They are always clean and sweet. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE by Heather B. MooreI enjoyed this sweet novella about a wedding photographer and a business tycoon who meet on the beach and, despite their different backgrounds and some family opposition, start to fall in love. Is he too good to be true and can she get over her broken heart?GONE FISHING by Kaylee BaldwinI really liked this charming novella about Claire, a website designer, and Miguel, her father's partner on his deep-sea fishing tourist business. There are definitely some chuckles as this rough around the edges man with a past tangles with the city girl with a barracuda mother. =)THE PIER CHANGES EVERYTHING by Annette LyonI loved this enchanting novella about Alexandria and Michael. They meet on the beach where she is performing one last task for her deceased husband, who died much too young, and he is trying to finally put a past relationship to rest. As they grab lunch and then proceed to spend the rest of the day together, they began to believe they just might be able to find love again.HERO'S SONG by Jennifer MooreWhen AnneMarie, a romance novelist, admits on a late night talk show that she was in love once with a guitar player, she has no clue that that very man, Lance Holden, is booked on the same show to perform his newest song. AnneMarie hasn't seen Lance since he broke her heart ten years ago. As Lance tries to reconcile with AnneMarie, she finds herself taking a second chance. I didn't like this novella as much. I think because this one has more anger and angst in it than the others which are sweeter and fun.STAY WITH ME by Shannon GuymonI really liked this endearing novella about Jolie, an art major who moves to L.A. to take on a nanny position just for the summer, and Fitz, the family's chauffeur. With a model-gorgeous chauffeur and two adorable and needy charges, Jolie might just be persuaded to stay in L.A.A PLACE TO CALL HOME by Sarah M. EdenIt's pretty much a given that I'm going to like a Sarah M. Eden story! I loved this captivating novella about Ada, the best realtor around, and Craig, an accountant. He's looking for the perfect condo to buy for him and his son. What they weren't prepared for was their unforeseen attraction to each other and the immediate attachment between Ada and Craig's adorable son.

I love this and definitely recommend it to any reader that loves clean romances. *I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*Too Good to Be True By Heather B. MooreThis was a very fun and quick read. Gwen must fight her feelings and fears after a broken marriage to move forward with a man she meets on the beach, who definitely seems too good to be true. Sometimes it is hard to develop characters in such a short time but Heather B. Moore mastered it. The characters are strong, the story is fun, and the romance is sweet.Gone Fishing by Kaylee BaldwinLiving with an overbearing mom was getting too much, and an unexpected proposal from a man her mom had chosen for her was too much. It was time for Claire to find her dad and bring him back home, so he could talk some sense into the woman. However, talking her father into quitting his dream job was going to take more than just a little convincing. I loved Kaylee Baldwin\u2019s writing; this story had my complete attention the whole time. I was cheering for Claire and hating her mom.The Pier Changes Everything by Annette LyonA woman widowed at a young age and a brokenhearted man meet on a pier only to find that life isn\u2019t as bad as it seems. This was the quickest story yet, but the only complaint I have, is that I feel like it went too fast. The storyline could be expanded on. The writing was good and the characters were likable. I enjoyed this short romance.A Hero\u2019s Song by Jennifer MooreI have found my favorite quote inside this story: \u201c\u2026.villain remains a villain until he cares about a woman enough to become a hero. She has to know there\u2019s nothing he wouldn\u2019t give up for her, nothing he wouldn\u2019t change.\u201d AnneMarie is a bestselling author and is invited onstage to discuss her new book; she is surprised that also invited onstage is her long lost first love: Lance. Lance is a famous musician who has been through the rounds with life. Having fought off addiction in rehab and going through his fair share of women, Lance has finally figured out that the one thing he wants more than life is to have AnneMarie back, but he must prove to her that he has changed, and he will be happy with her quiet life. A very well written story that shows how we must find forgiveness but also learn to be happy with ourselves.Stay With Me by Shannon GuymonThis was my favorite read by far. Jo finds herself with graduated with a degree, but finds there\u2019s no jobs available for her area of expertise. In order to make ends meet and pay college loans, Jo takes a job in California replacing her friend as a nanny to two adorable children. Life there is hard, dealing with a very spoiled man who is protected by his overprotective sister and trying to keep the real boss, a movie producer, happy. Life is made a little easier by the family\u2019s driver, Fitz. Falling in love with the kids and falling in love with Fitz has made a life mean so much more to Jo. A Place to Call Home by Sarah M. EdenAda Canton is a top Realtor, she is good at what she does and her reputation precedes her. Looking for a new home to start his life with his son, Craig Adamson comes to the best and it just happens to be a great coincidence that they are both single and not necessarily looking for love. With a little determination and patience, Ada teaches Craig that is okay to trust and to fall in love again.

I always have the thought in the back of my mind that I\u2019m only going to read one story a day and not neglect my family. This never happens, but I like that the option is there. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to connect to any of these stories because I\u2019m not really a \u201cCalifornia Girl\u201d but I really liked all of these stories! I\u2019ll even go out on a limb and say it was one of my favorite collections. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE by Heather B. MooreOh, Gwen. Your poor broken heart. I worried she was over-reacting, but no. She wasn\u2019t. I liked how these characters complimented each other. Opposite worlds, yes but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. I feel like the characters had enough maturity to deal with the relationship situation together. Secondary characters were also very likable. GONE FISHING by Kaylee BaldwinNot to start at the end, but can I just tell you how much I love a little epilogue at the end of a good short story? Well, I do. Very different story for me. Really liked the characters. I didn\u2019t see the appeal at first. Come on now, egg beard? Nope. Just nope. Patient and understanding characters with a nut bar for a mom? I\u2019m in. THE PIER CHANGES EVERYTHING by Annette LyonThis one was a little much for me. I can get on board with coincidence and kismet and all that but this one had just a bit too much of that for me. I did like the characters and the idea behind the story is good. Just a tad cheesy for me. I feel like there was more to develop with this story that would have made it less so. Being a short story, it really wasn\u2019t possible. And seriously, Alex, I know you hate the lady but you\u2019ve got to check your voicemail and text before I go nuts. A HERO\u2019S SONG by Jennifer MooreA redemptive hero? A shy, small-town writer? A late-night show?? This story had it all. And I loved it. I read it twice. Likeable characters and situations that really probably only go down in California (or maybe just in novels set in California) made for a very fun read. I would have liked an epilogue on this one (or all of them.) I really wanted to see how things worked out for these guys. STAY WITH ME by Shannon GuymonWhy is there always a nanny story? I will admit that this one was better than most, but still. I thought the addition of the brother as the \u201cbad guy\u201d instead of the love interest was a refreshing twist. I liked that this covered a more significant period of time and that she DIDN\u2019T fall for the dad. But really, these stories just make me feel bad for the kids. A PLACE TO CALL HOME by Sarah M. EdenIt\u2019s not secret I love Sarah Eden\u2019s books/stories. This one really played to the little older crowd, which I liked. Life gets real and I\u2019m glad she showcased that. The characters were all very realistic, as was the situation.

I sat down thinking I would just read one of the novellas, but found myself putting off dishes/laundry/etc because I was loving the stories so much! I was a little skeptical because I really don't like California that much, but these stories could have taken place anywhere. I have read (and loved!) books by 5 of the 6 authors in this collection & wasn't disappointed! Each story I finished I would think the next couldn't be as good, but they were all good! I LOVE that they all have a great happy ending to the story! I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a little blurb about each book on the web, so here is a little about each story:Heather Moore's Too Good to Be True is about a photographer who has been burned by love in the past & is trying to find her way. Gorgeous millionaire Jack is intrigued by the laid back photographer he met on the beach--but they come from such different worlds, do they have anything in common to build a relationship on? In Gone Fishing, Claire goes to California to talk her dad into moving home. What sane man leaves his home to open a deep sea fishing tour? He needs to come home and be near the family and help her stand up to her controlling mother!The Pier Changes Everything is about a young lady named Alex. She heads to the Pier to spread the ashes of her husband in the Pacific Ocean--one of his dying wishes. Struggling with the grief she feels she is shocked to meet a friend she hasn't seen in years. Mikey is dealing with his own pain, but maybe together they can find closure for their pain.Sarah Eden's story reminded me of one of my favorite Shannon Guymon books--both have great Realtors as the main character who find themselves dating a client. Jack (the little boy in the story) really stole the show. His character was great! Jennifer Moore's Hero's song was swoon worthy--LOVED it!

The stories were all based in California but all very different so it did not feel like I was reading the same thing over and over. I loved that the stories were short so I could read them when I only had a short amount of time. I also felt like they were long enough to give me enough of the story that I did not feel cheated. There were a few that I wish had an epilogue or more to the story.The first story Too Good To Be True is about a photographer whose marriage is annulled after 2 months because the groom was still in love with his ex girlfriend. Jack is a successful and rich businessman but tired of the demands and people only liking him for his money. I would have liked an epilogue for this story.The next story Gone Fishing is a story about a young women who is running from a controlling mother to a father that she felt has left her to follow his dreams. She is hurt that he left her behind. Miguel works with her father and is not what she first thought.The Pier Changes Everything is a story of healing from past pain. Alexandria is fulfilling her dead husbands last wish by spreading his ashes in the Pacific Ocean. Mike is trying to get over that his fianc\u00e9 left him for another. The two knew each other years ago at a Camp for overweight teenagers.A Hero Song is about a successful romance author and a rock star. They knew each other years before and fell in love but AnneMarie was afraid of the spotlight that anyone is Rockstar Jack's life would have to deal with and ran away from it all back to safe Idaho. They are reunited in a late night talk show. I would have also liked an epilogue for this one.Stay with Me is about Jolie an artist who can't find a job so she becomes a nanny to 2 children after her cousin leaves the job to get married. Fitz is the man of all trades for the family Jo is being a nanny for. Jo likes him right at first but is afraid that he would not like an ordinary girl like her. She learns to dearly loves Truman and Nellie her 2 charges.A Place to call Home is about a realtor named Ada who is good at finding the perfect home for her clients. Craig Adamson is looking for a condo for him and his son Jack. The conversations between Craig and Ada are witty and funny.

They made me really want to go to the beach, though.Too Good to be True:This was a cute short story. Given Gwen's past, I was quickly invested in her getting a happily ever after. I liked seeing the relationship between Gwen and Jack grow, but it still felt fast based on the information we learn about them. I liked how the author hyphenated the possible names of a person when Gwen couldn't remember their name.

I would have liked this story to have an epilogue. Content: 1 swear wordRating: 4 starsA Hero's Song:I liked this story of second chances. I quickly grew to root for the characters as their weaknesses as well as hopes and dreams were revealed. I especially liked Lance's manager. She was a great down-to-earth character.Content: 2 swear wordsRating: 4 starsStay With Me:I liked the dynamics between the characters in this book, but I feel the story would have been more powerful if it had been longer, allowing the reader to get to know the characters much better. The scenes that were described really endeared the main characters to me, but I think it would not have felt so rushed at the end if some of the experiences that were mentioned had been shown. But, I still really liked this story.Content: CleanRating: 4 starsA Place to Call Home:This story was my favorite of this collection. It made me laugh. My husband kept asking what I was laughing at, and I kept explaining it was the story I was reading. I liked that the main characters made mistakes and weren't perfect.

The California Dreamin' Collection was another compilation of sweet romantic novellas that I enjoyed from beginning to end with several that I would read again. Here are my thoughts on each one:TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE by Heather B. Moore. This was one of my favorites from this collection. It was sweet while having some definite swoon-worthy moments. It also had fantastic characters and a plot that felt authentic.GONE FISHING by Kaylee Baldwin. This was another favorite. I loved the whole damsel-in-distress and the pirate saving the day, in a way. It was fun and sassy, with a few laughs and plenty of romance.In THE PIER CHANGES EVERYTHING by Annette Lyon. This was just an all around sweet story. I thought that some of the focus being on food addictions and child obesity was interesting as was two characters who made a bond when children at camp finding each other years later.A HERO\u2019S SONG by Jennifer Moore. This was another story that I really enjoyed. I think every girl has had a crush on a rock star or a guy in a band at some point in their lives. I loved that the author let things evolve realistically - as in things aren't easy for these characters. At all. Great characters as well.In STAY WITH ME by Shannon Guymon. I really liked the setting for this one. Jolie and the kids were my favorite characters by far with Fitz coming in next. There was some drama and maybe a little too much romantic fluff in this one that went over the top for me, but otherwise a cute romance.A PLACE TO CALL HOME by Sarah M. Eden. This story felt like it easily could have morphed into a full novel in the romance or women's fiction genre. I loved the depth of the characters, that they have a rough kind of start and go, that they felt authentic, and I practically melted towards the end when Craig goes to visit Ada's book club. Seriously the sweetest, most down-to-earth guy ever! I didn't even talk about the sweet moments at the end...

I LOVED each and every one of the stories in this book. I was amazed to discover that Jennifer Moore is able to write contemporary romance just as well as she writes Regency romance. I love that this book was written by some of my very favorite romance authors. These books are so much fun because you get six cute, clean, well-written novellas in one book. I warn you that you won't want to stop reading when you get to the end of one of them though!Each one of these books had a great female lead character. They each were set in California and had something to do with the beach, but that's pretty much where the similarities ended. I loved each of the characters for a different reason. I loved Ada because she went out of her way to respect Craig's wishes when it came to his son. Jolie because she was able to love her two charges and fight for them, even though she was working in a hostile environment, and she had planned to leave at the end of the summer. I loved AnneMarie because she's from a small town in Idaho close to where I grew up. She wants to stay out of the spotlight, but risks the spotlight for the love of her life. I loved Alexandria because she gets another chance for a happily ever after, and it's a surprise to her with just who. Claire for wanting to help her dad have a better life, but realizing that his idea of a good life and hers were not as different as she supposed at first. And Gwen for being willing to take a chance on love when she was scared.Make sure you pick up this fun book, you won't regret it!"}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36233354-kathy", "userReview": "Review for California Dreamin\u2019This book is a delightful collection of short stories by many of my favorite authors. There was a new author to me and I was pleasantly surprised. Kaylee Baldwin scored a hit with me. Gone Fishing was heartwarming and I found myself cheering when Claire stands up to her overbearing mother. In Heather B Moore\u2019s story, Gwen is a photographer who ran away to California to escape a failed marriage. When a kind stranger helps her with her equipment after a beach wedding, Gwen is frightened and standoffish. But lonely millionaire, Jack, sees past her fears and a sweet friendship develops. Annette Lyon\u2019s story, The Pier Changes everything, was a sweet story of two hurt people running into one another under miraculous circumstances. Sarah M Eden\u2019s story, A Place to Call Home is about a California realtor who is fantastic at her job and gains more than a client in a family she finds a home for. Shannon Guymon\u2019s story, Stay With Me, is a story about a graphic artist who takes a summer job as a nanny for a top Hollywood producer and not only falls for the children she cares for but the handsome, kind chauffer. In Jennifer Moore\u2019s story, A Hero\u2019s Song, romance author, AnneMarie runs into an old flame on a late night talk show appearance and old sparks begin to fly anew. All stories were heart- warming, clean, and had sweet good endings.

The length of the novellas were great, even though I wanted some to be longer I loved being able to squeeze in one or two in my schedule (especially since I was on vacation and trying to read a couple other books too).

I guess I could wait to use both hands at my computer instead of typing with my thumb but I've read through lots of books that I have several reviews to write, so..........it's one thumb typing. ;-)Now onto my next book (it's a long drive home and I can get some more reading in so I can add one more book to my long list of writing reviews when I get home)!All the stories were clean with some kissing and hand holding. :-) Language was clean...that's definitely one of my favorite things about these collections, they're all clean and I never have to wonder.

They were all a great mix of looks, personality, and trying to become better. I don't blame a single one of the leading gals in the stories for falling for them. The stories were quick, easy, enjoyable reads. Novellas inherently have potential pitfalls; their length makes them not really great for character or plot development. It's a tradeoff I'm willing to make for the quick reads that don't require much investment from me as a reader. I enjoyed most of them just fine, which is about what I expect from them, in general. But sometimes an author is able to create characters that I love and give them a story that fits and everything gels together just right for me. \"Gone Fishing\" and \"A Place to Call Home\" both did that for me. \"Gone Fishing\" was a nice, breezy escape in a dream come true, while \"A Place to Call Home\" was more practical and realistic. In spite of being so opposite from each other, both had that \"just right\" feeling for me.

The things, like overeating, that they\u2019d both had to work so hard to overcome made them feel real.
