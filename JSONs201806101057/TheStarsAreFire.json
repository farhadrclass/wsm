This is the first book I've read by this author. I listened to this on audible and enjoyed the narrator, Suzanne Elite Freeman.May contain a mild spoiler...The main character, Grace Holland, is suffering with a less than mediocre marriage with little to no attention from her husband, Gene. She enjoys her children, but really craves love and desire. A blazing fire heads toward the town and she must escape the area with her two children. All she has is her best friend as her husband Gene has left with the fire brigade to help control the fires. As time moves on, Grace's husband is still missing and she must make a new life to care for her kids. She moves into her mother-in-laws house and finds some belongings to help get her feet on the ground and enjoys a new found job. Her mom is there and other characters come into the story, including a new love, but the story still remains quite bland. I appreciated that Grace was making a new life and enjoying new freedoms, but there wasn't enough going on to keep me interested and engaged. Even with the added twists, I found my mind wondering throughout the story. It's possible the main issue with the book for me were the characters. All of them were flat and never really developed which made the story uninteresting for me. I really wanted more development with Aiden and less information about Graces job with the doc. It seems like a good story, but just wasn't a fave and wound up in the okay range for me.I do think the author writes very well and I'm still looking forward to reading some of her other books. 3***"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "I always look forward to novels by this author, and this time it has felt like a very long wait. She writes such good stories about women, hemmed in by the expectations of their time periods, but women that find and harbor an inner strength that allows them to supersede and rise above their circumstances. Grace, the young wife and mother in this story is no exception. The largest fire in Maine's history, October 1946, a fire that raged from Bar Harbor to Kittery. Grace, five months pregnant and her two children under three, are on their own. Her husband is fire fighting with a crew, and as the fire approaches she must save herself and her children. Parts of this novel were predictable but the history and the time period made this much more than just a predictable read. As always her characterizations are amazing, one pulls for Grace, suffers along with her and wishes her better things and an easier way than that which she faces. Her mother and her friend are also great characters.This was an enjoyable read from an accomplished writer. A sentimental read on my part but I find that it is refreshing to read a novel that is set in only one time period and that doesn't go back and forth, just presented as we live life, in a forward manner. I look forward to the next strong woman this author will present to her readers.ARC from publisher.Publishes April 18th from Knopf."}, {"userName": "Brenda - Traveling Sister ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10841164-brenda---traveling-sister", "userReview": "I started off giving The Stars are Fire 4 stars, however while writing my review I realized that there was a few things that were missing for me or did not really work for me.When we first meet Grace Holland she is in a dutiful and loveless marriage to sour Gene who is a man of few words. The setting is based on the real life fires from October 1947 that raged in Maine following months of severe drought. I thought Anita Shreve gave me a good feel of the daily life in 1947 and the impact the fires had on Grace\u2019s life. The fires left quiet and meek Grace Holland alone with her children and homeless. She becomes brave, resilient, and resourceful as she rewrites her life for herself and her family. I found myself rooting for Grace as she discovers new freedom and finds joy in her life.All the other characters all seemed like an uninteresting \u201ctype\u201d to me with no depth or development. I wanted to learn, understand and have some more insight to why Gene was so sour and angry with little words to share. Even though Gene was a menacing character, I found I had no emotions towards him whether it be dislike, sympathy or anger. I wanted more from his character. I enjoyed Shreve\u2019s writing and Grace\u2019s story as she goes through the devastation and finds the courage to create a new life. It was not an absorbing read for me but a comfort read with a satisfying ending.

I must confess, I had this book sitting on my TBR pile for a while, not in any big hurry to read it, until I heard the news of Anita Shreve\u2019s passing. I decided to do a blog post in her honor and wanted to include the first book I\u2019d read of hers- \u201cThe Pilot\u2019s Wife\u201d and thought it would be fitting, in a way, to feature the last book she published. So, I while I was re-reading TPW, I slowly worked my way through this one, as well. What captured my interest about this book, initially, was that it is centered around true events. In 1947 a massive fire in Maine burned over a quarter of a million acres of land, and destroyed many homes in its wake, leaving sixteen dead. I\u2019d never heard about this fire until I read the synopsis of this book. After doing a few Google searches I was interested to see how Shreve would weave a story around such a monumental occurrence. Grace Holland is in an unhappy marriage, the mother of two small children, with another one on the way, when her husband, Gene, volunteers to help fight the fire. He goes missing, presumed dead, leaving Grace, her children, and her mother to find a way to survive on their own. Just when Grace is hitting stride, feeling more confident, enjoying the relief and release she feels without Gene, life throws Grace a curve ball she never saw coming. \u201cDoubt thou the stars are fire; / Doubt thou the sun doth move; / Doubt truth to be a liar; / But never doubt I love.\u201d - HamletThis story is not incredibly long, but due to its bleakness, which depicted the hardships that resulted from a horrific disaster, while detailing the limited options women had in the forties, it often felt like the story was moving at the speed of molasses.However, I would advise readers to stick it out, because this is not a book that is meant to be a fast-paced novel of suspense or action. It\u2019s beautifully written piece and an amazing character study, focused on Grace Holland. Grace will go from being at the will and mercy of a cold, bitter husband, to finding the strength and courage to search for inner peace, and maybe even happiness, against all odds. Women, especially, stayed in miserable marriages to avoid the stigma associated with divorce, and because of the lack of career opportunities. But, for Grace, duty and responsibility figure into things, as well. But, the book also points to how rigid, assigned roles, and duties also impacted men. Gene might have felt trapped, and certainly felt intense pressure to provide for his family, which began to change him from a rather amiable sort, to a resentful, cold, and very bitter man. His anger soon manifests itself in very dangerous ways, which is where the marital tensions often become so taut, and so intense, it is nearly unbearable. Yet out of the dust and burnt ash, this story emerges into one of great resilience and courage. Grace does the best she can, takes risks, capitalizes on advantageous situations and is helped by good people and wonderful friends along the way. Even when she seems to hit rock bottom, with no way out of her misery, she rises to the occasion, determined to escape her phyical and metaphorical incarceration. While this book is mostly well-received, it did have a few mixed reviews, which gave me pause, but as is often the case, a book will speak to one in a very different way than it speaks to someone else, if at all. For me, I was very impressed with Shreve\u2019s portrait of marriage during a time when people were basically forced to remain in an untenable relationship. I was in awe of her in depth creation of Grace Holland, who is ultimately a survivor, a person who is inspirational, determined to live life on her own terms and refuses to allow convention to dictate her destiny. Her journey is a long, labored trip, and is not going to end all wrapped up in a nice, neat package. This may bother some readers, but, I thought it was fitting and, did justice to Grace\u2019s character. Having said that, one can\u2019t avoid the impression that Grace will reinvent herself, will be in control of her own destiny, embarking on a whole new adventure in life, no matter which path she winds up on or how things turn out. In all honesty, based on the books I\u2019ve read by this author, this one was not my all -time favorite, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s Shreve\u2019s best effort, but it is still a very solid, atmospheric and compelling novel. I really enjoyed the history, the writing, and the deep character study, and how the tragedy of the fire, ultimately provided a way for Grace to experience freedom and forge a new life for herself. Overall, I thought this book was very thought provoking and would make a very good book club selection. This may be our last novel by Anita Shreve, and if that is the case, I\u2019d say she left us with a very positive impression of her and her books. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Dorie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie", "userReview": "Wow this is one special book! I was excited to read it so I had to jump ahead even though the pub date isn\u2019t until May.This is by far the best book that Ms. Shreve has ever penned. The characters are so well developed and the story simply brilliant and believable, the factual part based on a true story of the worst fire ever to occur in coastal Maine. Time frame is Maine in 1947. Grace is a young woman with two small children in an unhappy marriage. She is young and doesn\u2019t really understand her husband and why he treats her with so little love but she has her children and her best friend.After an agonizing Spring of continued rain the rest of the summer is hot and very dry, drought conditions. A wildfire starts on the coast of Maine and becomes all consuming. The town where Grace lives is at first thought to be far enough away from the fire and isn\u2019t evacuated. Grace\u2019s husband is fighting the fire along with most of the men in the town. Grace uses all of her strength and intelligence to save herself and her children.After the fire Grace and her children and mother have survived and relocate to her mother in law\u2019s house. There is a romantic encounter with another man who makes Grace realize all that she has been missing in her marriage. There of course is a lot more to this wonderful story but I won\u2019t give away the plot. What I loved about this story was how the character grew, learned how to survive, what was important to her, how strong she really was!! The ending was a great one with some answers about Grace\u2019s husband, his character and why he behaves the way he does. No,you won't even come close to guessing, so don't even try! Well you can try if you want to but it's a great REVEAL.I read this book in two sittings, only because I had to go to bed. I recommend this book to everyone, read it, you won\u2019t be disappointed.

One of my favorite women\u2019s fiction writers is back. Grace is in an unhappy, controlling marriage with two toddlers and one on the way. A fire breaks out and Gene, her husband, volunteers to help in the effort to get it under control. This was less about the Great Fires of 1947 and more about the resilience of a woman in 1947. 1947 is important because women weren\u2019t seen as independent and capable.

I'm afraid I'm just the wrong audience for this book. After a strong beginning, it devolved into just another romantic fairy tale. Its strengths lay in the depiction of the devastating coastal fires that ravaged a drought-ridden Maine in 1947.

The scene where she saves her children's lives by holding them in the sea as a huge wildfire burns down the town is amazing, as is the way she builds herself back up after the fire.

This events in this book unfold as a result of what has become know as the Great Fires of 1947, a series of forest fires that devastated hundreds of thousands of acres in Maine.Grace Holland is five months pregnant when the fires rip through her neighborhood, destroying everything in their wake. Grace is smart and resourceful. She manages to save herself, her two small children, her best friend, Rosie, and Rosie's children. Her husband, Gene, with whom she shares a dispassionate though not horrible marriage, has been called to help the men of the town build a fire wall. But as the other men begin to return home, Gene remains missing. Finally, homeless and destitute, Grace is forced to consider moving into her recently deceased mother-in-law's home. As she arrives to check out the condition of the home, she is greeted by beautiful piano music. Enter Aiden, the handsome, educated, piano-playing squatter.Things go along just swimmingly for a time. Grace gets a job at the local physician's office. Her mother, now living with her, cares for the house and the children. Grace and Aiden seem to be growing closer together. When Aiden leaves for a job in Boston, they are both hopeful that it won't be the end. Unfortunately, a sudden (and somewhat expected, if I'm honest) plot twist occurs. You can probably see where this is going but I do not wish to add any spoilers.Overall, I enjoyed the book quite a lot. This wasn't an edge-of-the seat book for me but I found the pacing to be steady and enjoyable. My rating is a reflection of the balance between fabulous writing and character development and a somewhat clich\u00e9d and predictable story. Though this wasn't a five star read for me, I can certainly understand why Anita Shreve has such a devoted following and I would be open to reading her past or future titles.3.75/5 starsThanks to the publisher, Alfred A.

It is that good. I enjoyed Grace's story tremendously.Grace is a thoughtful young woman feeling confused and trapped in what I would call an odd marriage, when the Maine coast is set ablaze one particularly dry autumn. Wildfires wreak devastation for miles. Everyone Grace knows is affected by the fires, by the huge losses, and by the kindness of strangers. This is how she survives and comes into her own. Her husband is missing and it gives her time to consider a different kind of future for herself and her children.Wonderful female characters make up most of the cast -- women you just want to cheer on or give them a hug.

The story is based on the true story of the 1947 fire that burned a significant portion of Maine\u2019s coastal towns. As the book opens, Grace and her family live in a small coastal town that is in the midst of a drought. Grace struggles with the discontent she feels with her life and her husband. As the drought continues, the land becomes so dry that fire becomes a giant fear for Maine\u2019s residents. The fire begins fairly far away from Grace\u2019s town and skeptical that the fire will reach their town, residents are unprepared when the fire rapidly sweeps through and devastates the community. Grace saves herself, her children, her neighbor Rosie and her children but is left homeless and without a husband (Glen disappeared the night of the fire when he went to fight the fire). Brave and resilient, Grace builds a life for her family and spreads her wings as she was unable to do while Glen was around. When she finally feels that her life is on track, Grace is faced with yet another stumbling block and must force herself to survive. Grace is a fantastic protagonist; she is intelligent, quick thinking, proactive and loyal. Trapped in a situation beyond her control, she manages to overcome the obstacles and persevere. The world could use more people like Grace.My favorite thing by far about this book is Shreve\u2019s prose. Her writing is both elegant and stark. Shreve provides a fascinating window into Grace\u2019s mind; Grace is constantly wanting to know more than she learns from the news and her neighbors and frequently questioning why things are the way they are. Her constant questioning and thoughtful pondering added a different dimension to the novel and provoked a similar response from me as I view the incidents happening in my world. I also learned so much about Maine during that era and about the horrific fire that destroyed so many coastal towns. I like that Shreve provided that historical context for the story.I definitely recommend The Stars Are Fire and love that the cover is so perfect for the story.

With this as backdrop, Anita Shreve has crafted her story of Grace Holland, a wife and mother of two, caught up in the fires and spat out to reinvent herself in the aftermath. Before the fires, Grace was a typical woman of her times, rearing her children in a tiny cottage, cooking and washing for her husband in a loveless marriage. Her best friend Rosie lived next door and each day they would take time out to enjoy each others company while their children played together. After the horrendous day of the fire when Grace and Rosie were forced to take their children into the ocean to survive, Grace waits for her husband to return from fire fighting and wonders how they will cope now that they are homeless and penniless.Anita Shreve has painted Grace as a fierce survivor, a women who will adapt and cope with whatever adversity life throws in her way to keep her children safe. Along the way she discovers her own strength and bravery and learns what it is to really love another.

Some are happy and some severely unhappy, but the journey remains engaging through its entirety.

All summer there has been a drought and now wildfires are raging across the state. Grace and Rosie\u2019s husbands have gone to fight the fire and left the women and children at home.

Not all authors who can write are. And this tale is exceptionally well done.The window into the time is nearly perfect for the \"eyes\" and the context characters. So is the language, especially within its cliches. Such as \"you made your bed, now you have to lie in it.\" It's also quite spot on for larger catastrophe, in this case a wide spread coastal area wild fire. All changes of such dire nature (tornado was ours), and individual importance becomes differently relative. As does \"stuff\" or \"luck\" or \"safety\". It does and I know it. Quickly relative. So quickly it is hard to convey and yet Shreve does that here. Well. She's also nailed personality dynamics that are far more common than the psychopathic neighbor or serial killer or obsessive stalker fare. But in real life, far more dangerous.She's also captures here an authentic maturing of identity that centered much of the feminine journey through the 2nd half of the last century. Not just in the USA either. Place of wife and role of self-identity - the pivotal adjustments. Times have and had changed. Gene's detailing was also top notch. This particular slant of personality and mindset is not one that is easily captured in print. Because much of what IS- IS in the major sense an absence. An absence of context that in myriad ways is not translatable as overt actions and vicious words could more easily capture. She captured both the Gene before and after superbly. Our heroine is just that. But the connection with Rosie and their duo force- much more than either alone. Too much more would give you spoilers. But if you don't want any, stop reading here.This is a book that also held an avenues of \"doors\" open to Grace's escape that, for me anyway, were too rare and often so overly lucky that they became contrived. Would we all have had such luck after life changing disaster to find such worth replenished. So that office needing an organizer, that jewelry perk, that Aiden would squat just there etc.?? And the ending was pure chick lit. too. But DESPITE all of those variables being not quite common real life? She still nailed the characters. Marjorie not the least. But Rosie to a ten. But all of that is forgiven for the \"mother thought\" and the growth Anita Shreve completely captured in this woman's story of refusing to be used. That's where the bed becomes not one you made at all. 4.5 stars rounded up. Hers are often a favorite, but this one is cream of the crop."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10281457-laura", "userReview": "Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.com The Stars Are Fire is a wonderfully written, touching story of life during the post-war 1940's, and how traumatic events can either make or break someone.I really liked the main character, Grace, who is a strong and likeable woman. Her married life is not unhappy, as such, but she feels like something is missing between them. She's not completely happy, but happy enough, until...The fire that rips through their house (and almost kills her and her children) seems to have taken husband Gene with it, in some way. His absence (or perhaps death?) leaves Grace without a husband and her children without a father, but without the ability to properly grieve for him, because his body is missing.Gene can be mean, spiteful and quite nasty at times - but he has been through hell, and Grace herself wrestles with feeling hatred towards him and pity for what he has - and is - going through. Grace is such a great character and I really enjoyed reading about her, willing her to stand up to her husband.The story is not action-packed; I'd describe it as a bit of a slow burner but without leaving me feeling bored or uninterested. It's a story that feels real, and could be someone's life. There's no unnecessary drama or ridiculous occurrences - what happens no doubt reflects life for many women at that time, plus the fire in Maine did really happen. You feel as if you're really getting a glimpse into women's lives during that time, and the constraints and expectations they faced from all angles.The Stars Are Fire is sad and poignant at times, whilst at others there are real hints of hope and optimism - mirroring the ups and downs that many feel in their lives. This is definitely a story more about characters and their feats of strength or despair, rather than just about a chain of events.There's a strong element of love - and at times, a lack of love - to the story, which I really enjoyed reading about - romance is not a single genre I read a lot of, but Anita Shreve has created something touching and really absorbing here without any of the cheesiness that I sometimes expect from the genre. The descriptions are vivid and the writing is beautiful, making this a slow but satisfying story.- and something a little different for me.[Rating: 3.5/5 bumped to 4/5]Many thanks to Little Brown UK for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46121294-sam", "userReview": "Well this was a surprise of a book. I'm not normally one for a love story but this has additional elements that draw you in. This was my first Anita Shreve book and my can she write: the story moves along seamlessly like liquid gold. The setting is Maine and the impact of the great fire on those living there. The main character Grace, is a young married woman, with a young family. I don't want to give the plot away because i read a review for this book when mid way through and hit a spoiler which gave away the second half of the book. Anita Shreve has created a truly likeable character in Grace, she is well written: I felt her misery and her joy. Gene (the husband) is a truly dreadful man and the author has completely captured his arrogance, cruelty and dismissiveness. The settings and historical event brought the book to life for me and gave it added interest. My only criticism is that the second half of the book and run up to the ending was quick. However; that spoiler meant that I knew what was coming, and it's true that I was so enthralled by this author style that i didn't realise i was approaching the end of the book. So perhaps that is the opposite of a criticism. This is not one of those books where you repeatedly check the kindle percentage to see how long is left. This book gets a solid 4 stars from me. Many thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56245060-janet", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "The Star are fire did not set my interest on fire.Grace Hollond is living a less than exciting life in Maine during 1947. She is in a strained marriage with a less than stellar sex life. She has two young children, and becomes pregnant with her third child and has resigned herself to that fact that this is how her life is going to be. Her happiness comes form her children and her best friend who lives next door. Her husband is a volunteer firefighter who gets called into action when a fire breaks out along the Maine Coast from Bar Harbor to Kittery. The area has seen a drought and everything is dry and burns out of control.During the fire, Grace is helpless to save her home. She and her friend watch as their homes are burned to the ground. They must flee into the Ocean to save their own lives. The next morning they are all lucky to be alive but what remains of their lives is in turmoil. Both women are now homeless, do not know the location of their husbands, if their spouses are even alive and where they will go from here.Grace eventually goes to her deceased Mother in law's home where she finds a new freedom. She can now do what she WANTS. She can get a job, own a car and begin to carve out a future for her and her children. The reader sees Grace grown and come into her own if you will. She shows strength and resiliency. She also gets a hint at romance which is then dashed when her burned and injured husband returns home. Her happiness is dashed when her controlling husband is back home. Sounds great, right? I can't quite put my finger on why, but this book really failed to grab me. I know what I didn't like. I did not care for Grace's husband, Gene. I did like Grace's strength and determination. But overall this book failed to WOW me. I thought it was good and not great. I did not connect with the story or the characters. This was a book that I thought I would enjoy a lot more than I did. The description sounded great - interesting in fact.

She's a well known name and author of many brilliant books. The first book of her's I've read was The Pilot's Wife and it was kind of love at first sight moment for me. Naturally I was so excited to hear she's got a new book coming out and I couldn't wait to read it. While it's classic Anita Shreve that we know, I think this certainly is her best yet. The book is based on real life events, a terrible fire that caught Maine in 1947. This dreadful event is the frame for the main story, a story of loss, hope, survival and new beginnings. The story is centered around Grace, a young woman in her early 20s, wife of Gene and mother of two young children under the age of 2. She's the pillar of the family, running errands, taking care of the house, making sure everyone is pleased and taken care of. However, her marriage is not the happiest. It takes her a lot of time to realize this. Gene is rude, secretive and treats her unkindly. She hardly sees him or makes love to him. For a woman of that age, naturally this is a problem. While her friend, Rosie is having the best marriage with loads of passion, it seems Grace will never get to have it. But she's not jealous, it's more like she's not even aware of what she's missing until she sees the life her friend, Rosie leads. But one dreadful event, the fire that rages through Maine, a fire which will burn down her and many other houses, will be the event that will change her life forever. Gene is out to help out with the fire spreading and she's left alone to take care of her children, saving not only theirs but also the lives of Rosie and her kids. At such a difficult time she discovers her own strength and strong desire for survival. She's 5 months pregnant, unfortunately loses her kid. However, that doesn't stop her, she's got two little children to take care of.Gene is missing and Grace moves in her deceased mother-in-laws house. And that's where everything starts really changing. Though she's got no time to mourn her lost child or house, Grace is certain she wants to move on. I absolutely enjoyed this book! Many times I was close to tears, especially when the fire was raging and Grace was fighting for her life and the life of her kids. The strong mother's love was so well described, I even started imagining what I would do if I were in that horrible situation. What I loved the most is how Grace transforms, how she grows from the gullible 23 year old to strong, confident woman making some excellent choices.The book delivers so many great messages, like the importance of understanding in a marriage, the need to rely on each other in times of a disaster or how one grows in most difficult of times. I love the fact Grace rose literally from her ashes, creating a new and better life than the one she had. But the thing that I felt missing (and which is the reason I can't give it 5*) is the fact I wish I saw more of Gene's reasons for his behavior. I know there are a lot of mean people in the world, however I couldn't understand why he was treating Grace so badly or why she put up with that. I guess one of the reasons is that back in the 40s divorce was not an acceptable thing. Still, I wish I knew why Gene was so bitter, it would help me get a clearer picture of him as a character.While there's some romance, it was gradually built and I absolutely love Ms Shreve's gentle approach thus showing a nice, American, family woman from the 40s. Overall, this was truly an enjoyable read. It's short so I read it in about three hours and I absolutely loved the ending. Speaking of the ending, some things might be rushed by the ending but it all fit in perfectly. If you're looking for a great women's fiction/historical fiction to devour over the weekend, no need to look any further. Warm, emotional and carrying many strong messages, The Stars Are Fire is definitely a treat."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12227138-jenny", "userReview": "The Stars Are Fire is about how a woman survived after a bush fire that destroyed everything. Grace Holland was unhappy with her life in small Maine village, with an abusive and controlling husband and two small children. However, Grace Holland did not know how to change or fix her miserable life. However, this changed for Grace when a bush fire destroyed her home and left her husband in hospital with severe burns. The readers of The Stars Are Fire will follow Graces journey to find freedom and happiness. The Stars Are Fire is the first book I have read by Anita Shreve, and I did not engage with the story. I do not enjoy Anita Shreve writing style or the way she portrays her characters. I was very disappointed in this book. Anita Shreve did highlight the resilience of Grace to change her life after the fire. I believe The Stars Are Fire is about domestic violence because Gene Holland is a violent and controlling man. I do not think that Anita Shreve highlights this issue very well in The Stars Are Fire. Readers of The Stars Are Fire will learn about another way to handle an unhappy marriage without fighting. Also, The Stars Are Fire highlights the dangers that bush fires have on a community, and we should be more careful in the summer months.I will not recommend this book. However, I will leave it up to the readers if they like to read The Stars Are Fire."}, {"userName": "Mainlinebooker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/600545-mainlinebooker", "userReview": "Anita Shreve has done it again, giving us an absorbing story that I would have finished in one night but decided that sleep needed to become a priority.The setting is Maine, during the late 40's when Grace Holland, a young mother in a loveless marriage, tries to rescue her two young children when a huge forest fire breaks out. Homes are burnt to the ground as she struggles to the ocean, burying them in the sand to try to help them stay alive. Meanwhile her husband has gone to the front to try to keep the flames from spreading. Time goes by without any word from him. Ever the dutiful wife who feels she can't break her marriage vows, she is torn between wanting him dead and chastising herself for those immoral thoughts. As she develops a inner strength from taking care of the family and trying to support herself, circumstances arise that turn the novel on its head. The novel's descriptive setting with Shreve's signature crisp style, transported me in time while simultaneously made me ache with both loneliness and delight for Grace. I was smitten by Grace's inner life, her complex and dissonant feelings and her growth as a strong character. Based on historical facts makes this book all the more authoritative.

She has a way of putting her characters into unusual situations and having them react just the way you think a person would. In this case, there is a serious fire that burns out much of Maine (based on an actual event in the 1930s), and a young mother\u2019s life is turned upside down. Amid all this loss, Grace finds herself, and finds a kind of strength of character that she would never have suspected she possessed.This novel was pure pleasure to read, because Anita Shreve knows how to write in a way that makes you feel you are in this woman\u2019s skin and experiencing her travails right along with her. If you have ever felt trapped by life or imprisoned by a situation you cannot control, you will relate to Grace and feel the pressure she is under. There is little more I can say without giving away some detail of the plot, and that would be to ruin this for other readers. If you have enjoyed Anita Shreve in the past, you will not be disappointed by this release. It is not my favorite of her works, there are several that could make my short-list of books you cannot miss, but it has that flavor that is uniquely her own.

In both cases drought and high winds caused fires to spread out of control.Grace Holland is a twenty-four-year-old mother of two small children. Her difficult husband has gone off to help fight the fire in a neighboring town. When flames engulf their town she and her best friend head to the beach in the hope of saving their children. Grace's husband is reported missing, and Grace must find a way to provide for her children.The book shows a young woman who is tested by life, and finds a well of inner strength. It also asks how much one should sacrifice herself for another person out of a sense of obligation. A sensual theme of music (and romance) also threads through the story. Interactions with interesting secondary characters kept the story moving at a fast pace.

She has the gift of creating a backdrop of a given era and situation that sets the stage for a tragic love story. The emotions that she is able to conjure in the reader is truly an art. The Stars Are Fire takes place in the late 40's just after the war. We meet Grace and Gene. A couple who are in a loveless marriage but make do with the situation. Grace knows there is something wrong in her marriage yet she stays because of their two young children and that is what is expected of her. Good wives keep their husband happy and their children fed. When a fire consumes the whole town, including Grace and Gene's house, and Gene doesn't return and is feared dead, Grace makes the decision to move her family into her mother-in- law's house that Gene recently inherited. While living there, she transforms into a woman with purpose, independence and passion. She meets a man and the sparks fly. There is more to come but I will stop there to avoid giving away too much plot. As always with Ms. Shreve's books, the prose is beautifully written and the characters brought to life. This is a deeply character driven story with a focus on the humanness of people and the decisions one makes based on the self-imposed constraints of society. It is both absorbing and inspiring. As with all of her stories, there is also the element of unrequited love.Although this is not my favorite book of hers, I enjoyed listening to the audiobook and found myself captivated.

Shreve has an amazing ability to create totally real characters & environments. Although the situations Grace finds herself in here are almost impossibly hard it is a very positive read & as a reader you feel yourself immersed in her struggle. Grace and her husband Gene find themselves caught up in their own individual hells and the depiction of their personal battles are difficult to read in places.
