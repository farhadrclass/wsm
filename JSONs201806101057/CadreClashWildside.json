There was no real big surprises and the ending was a little anti-climatic but it was entertaining.

It\u2019s cast is a mercenary team of supers who are neither good nor evil. The tale isn\u2019t particularly epic, nor was it intended to be. It\u2019s mystery was fun to follow with and ending that leaves possibilities for future books in the series. What I like about this relatively new author based on the 2 books I\u2019ve read (see In My Brother's Name ) is his ability to present an ensemble cast effectively and to cut scenes in a way that keeps the action of his books flowing at a pace that does not bore. I will gladly read more of his work when it gets written."}, {"userName": "Wayland Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith", "userReview": "Bias warning: I rated it highly because I wrote it. ;)"}], "description": "Super-villains want to take over the world. The heroes want to stop them and save everyone. But what\u2019s the matter with using your powers to just make a buck? Wildside, Inc. is a (mostly) legitimate team of super-powered mercenaries. When they take on a missing persons case for a wealthy family, things rapidly go from finding Tony Sinclair to a rash of missing scientists and a mysterious super-powered group opposing Wildside\u2019s investigation. The team has to find out what\u2019s behind the disappearances and some high-tech break-ins, before things spread further than they even remotely imagined.", "title": "Cadre Clash (Wildside, #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39861995-cadre-clash", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523883131l/39861995.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6571201.Wayland_Smith", "name": "Wayland Smith"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39861995-cadre-clash", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16125989-in-my-brother-s-name", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21958859-heronet-files-book-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39884435-wildside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36154230-the-machine-stops", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22591815-friend-of-outlaws"]}
