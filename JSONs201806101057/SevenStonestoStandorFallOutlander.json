There are a couple that I liked. I think for me, it would be good to do re-reads with the actual novella read after the book it goes with. There are two new short stories in this book as well. Most of them seem to revolve around John Grey, but there are some with Jamie, Ian (the dad), Roger, Frank and a few others. Either way, it's just another Outlander book to add to my collection and hopefully I will be able to read them in order with the book someday. I did recognize some of the people the stories were about but I wasn't too sure where they all fit into the books. Anyhoo, enough babbling. Enjoy the book you Outlandish fans. Of course, you have all probably read the novella's when they were out accept for the two new ones. So there =)"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "With the release of this recent collection of novellas, Gabaldon seeks to pull together a number of her shorter pieces for the reader\u2019s enjoyment. With some mention of Jamie Fraser, a peppering of Roger, and even the elder Fraser, the vast number of stories have some Lord John Grey connection. When I undertook my Diana Gabaldon binge in the summer of 2015, I sought to read her entire collection in chronological order, which sandwiched Outlander novels with a number of the Lord John pieces. A number of the novella found within this collection were included in this binge. I have chosen to resurrect these reviews for those stories I have already read in this collection, so some of the comments might seem out of place in 2017. The latter two pieces are those I have never read and so their reviews are brand new to me and those who follow my postings. I hope you will enjoy my summaries and encourage anyone with a massive amount of patience to tackle the larger Outlander/Lord John collection. The Custom of the Army:It all begins with an electric eel party and a duel that goes horribly wrong. A night of apparent debauchery leads our famed Gabaldon character in a heap of trouble everywhere he turns. In an attempt to hide himself while he is persona non grata, Grey agrees to act as a character witness for a friend facing court martial, in CANADA. With an additional familial matter to handle while he is away, Grey embarks on an adventure to the New World and mixes it up with the British Army (currently at war with France in Quebec), while he hunts down a man keen on abandoning his duties. Gabaldon shows the reader another humorous side of Grey who, without Jamie Fraser around, is quite a civilised gentleman.Gabaldon does a great job in keeping the LJG series moving forward. With some great storytelling, time appropriate characters and wonderful narration, anyone who is a fan of the Outlander series or the full-length Lord John Grey books will not be disappointed. This book sits nicely as a stand-alone, hence its unofficial non-labelled nature between many of the other pieces of writing in the series.The Space Between:In this novella, Gabaldon chooses two lesser characters and send them on a journey mentioned towards the end of An Echo in the Bone. Young Joan MacKimmie, step-daughter of our beloved Jamie Fraser, heads to Paris to answer her calling and train to become a nun. Sent on her way with Jamie's nephew, Michael, they travel through the streets of Paris in a short and jam-packed story. While Joan seeks to make herself a bride of Christ, she wrestles with voices only she can hear, which offer both advice and glimpses into the future. As she prepares for her entry into the convent, she begins to question everything she has come to believe, which led her to this point. Michael, who may have been sent as a bodyguard, fights his own inner demons on the trip, part related to his growing feelings for this young woman as well as the knowledge his Aunt Claire gave him about the not too distant civil uprising in France, with Paris at its heart. Michael and Joan struggle to balance their responsibilities with what the heart desires, creating a space between logic and emotion. They must also fend off the plans of a sinister man who seeks revenge for Claire Fraser's antics when last she spent time in Paris. Learning of the connection Joan and Michael possess to La Dame Blanche, they are spun into a web of deceit and potential disaster. With a sprinkling of time travel discussion (of course, no Outlander story can ignore the Stones), Gabaldon moves her major sub-story forward while keeping a little more of the full time movement situation for the final novel. Brilliantly composed with just enough to keep the reader wanting more.As the number of remaining Outlander stories dwindle, I am left to pay special attention to these tales. Having taken the time to re-read the entire collection, I have taken away so much and learned a great deal, both about the history of the time as well as the intricacies of the characters Gabaldon has set before the reader. As mentioned many times in previous novels, Gabaldon may introduce minor characters throughout, whose importance is only known much later. This novella is a wonderful case in point, where the likes of Joan and Michael receive only passing mention in earlier stories, but now play central roles. One could say the same for Comte St. Germain, who acts as a Stephen Bonnet or Black Jack Randall of sorts. Wonderfully spun in such a way to entertain and intrigue simultaneously.The Plague of Zombies:In Gabaldon's final piece (to date) of Lord John-centred writing, she succeeds in weaving another great tale with her ever-resourceful Lord John Grey at the helm. In Jamaica on official business, Lord John is soon drawn into a phenomena new to him; the emergence of zombies. Waking one night by a visitor whose human form is questionable, Grey wonders if there is more to this myth than strict lore. When the Governor is found murdered, the scene leads many to believe a pack of zombies may be behind the crime. However, Grey is not so sure and mounts clues to turn the investigation in another direction. With many wishing him gone (from office as well as from the earth), the Governor's demise leaves many suspects for Grey to ponder. That said, the power of zombies appears stronger than even and Grey seeks to learn more about them if for no other reason than to quench his curiosity. Another great novella by Gabaldon to keep the reader on the edge of their seat and with an eye on packs of unknowns lurking the streets at night.Gabaldon's OUTLANDER series is one of my great guilty pleasures. Her plethora of characters leaves a great opening for many interesting branch-off stories or novellas. That said, her character Lord John Grey, whose role in the Outlander series is minor in the first three novels, is one perfectly suited for a series of novels. An 18th century Sherlock Holmes on one hand and a tyrannical man whose lust for Jamie Fraser fuels a powerful hatred in the main novel series cannot be discounted. Gabaldon has done a masterful job of painting a calmer and more likeable side to Grey in this series, as well as jumping on the 'zombie' bandwagon made overly popular by THE WALKING DEAD. A great novella for fans of the series or newbies alike, it makes for a highly entertaining read for the curious reader.A Leaf of the Wind of All Hallows:What ever happened to Jerry MacKenzie, father of Roger, whose plane went down during the War effort? As Gabaldon mentions in the story's preface, discussion of Jerry opened in An Echo in the Bone, where Claire admitted that the story Roger knew was not entirely true. With Roger finally encountering Jerry in 1739, something must have happened related to the Stones, but the story is again not flushed out. Gabaldon chooses this point to offer a real account of events, just in time as Outlander fans are surely tearing their hair out with wonder, as the cliffhanger found no resolution within Written in My Own Heart's Blood. Spitfire pilot Jerry MacKenzie is approached by MI6 (and Frank Randall no less) to help in the execution of a covert mission behind the Iron Curtain. While out on reconnaissance, Jerry develops engine trouble and crash lands somewhere in Northumbria. As Jerry seeks to get his bearings, he discovers that he's been propelled into the past, but has no explanation for events. When he comes across a mysterious character, a little is revealed, including how to get back, but no clear understanding of the Stones is made known. Returning to modern times, Jerry comes across his wife, Marjorie, but is not in a position to reach her to discuss his revelations. Filling a few cracks in the Outlander storylines, this short story fits nicely, yet leaves much to the imagination. Virgins:VIRGINS, a novella penned by Gabaldon years after she made Jamie Fraser a successful protagonist in the Outlander series, opens the collection nicely. In it, Fraser and his friend, Ian Duncan, embark on the life of young mercenaries, well away from Scotland. It's 1740 and the boys, aged nineteen and twenty respectfully, find themselves out in the world, experiencing all that it has to offer. While Duncan sees that his friend is holding onto a secret, nothing prepares him when he learns the truth. Captain Jack Randall came to Lallybroch and embarrassed Fraser, along with his entire family, leaving Jamie banished from his own estate. Jamie uses the attack and belittling to fuel his fire to become a man in a hard-knock world. Along the way, Jame and Ian learn about fighting, sex, and what it means to be independent, all while crossing paths with many a clan unlike themselves. These 'life virgins' soon learn the ways of the world while vowing to protect one another. The novella opens the door to what is sure to be a wonderful series, at least for Jamie, as he hones his skills and returns to face Randall in the years to come. The awkwardness that he will encounter (as Outlander fans know all too well) should make for an ever-changing flood of sentiment in the man's brain...but we have many many pages to learn all about that.A Fugitive Green:In a story set around 1744, Minerva \u2018Minnie\u2019 Rennie is living in Paris with her father. They run a somewhat successful bookselling business, but it is merely a front for some of their more deceptive work: espionage, blackmail, and a little robbery. At seventeen, Minnie is ready to find herself a husband, but has been kept shielded from men by her overprotective father. However, an Englishman is said to make the best husband, so she is sent off to London to find a man and help her father with an especially interesting assignment. Meanwhile, the Duke of Pardloe, Harold (Hal), brother of the popular Lord John Grey, is still mourning the death of his wife and infant. They both perished after the onset of premature labour occurred when Hal engaged in a duel with his wife\u2019s lover, Nathaniel Twelvetrees. The fallout of that duel and the death of his wife has kept Hal trying to justify his actions, though he has no firm proof of the affair. After Minnie arrives in London and is given the task of securing the collection of letters between Esme and Twelvetrees. Sly as she might be, even Minnie is sure to find this task somewhat difficult. Minnie is also left to discover a family secret that will shock her to the core, burning in a nunnery. While Minnie tries to secure copies of the letters, she encounters Hal and is somewhat besotted with him. This chance encounter turns somewhat steamy after she is caught red-handed trying to locate the letters. Returning to Paris, Minnie recounts her story to a curious father, who can see he has a well-trained daughter on his hands. However, when she reveals two secrets, all bets are off. A wonderful story that even allows the beloved Jamie Fraser to make a cameo appearance. Gabaldon is able to tie off a few threads left dangling in past stories as she adds to the Outlander/Lord John Grey chronology.Besieged:In the waning days of his military governorship in Jamaica, Lord John Grey is preparing to head to the America Colonies, not yet in full insurrection mode. The year is 1762 and life has been decent for this man of many adventures. He receives his step-father, who passes along a message that Lord John\u2019s mother, the Dowager Duchess of Pardloe, is in Havana and may need to be collected. While this seems like a lovely side journey, news that the British Navy is on its way to seize the territory in its ongoing battles with Spain, leaves Lord John a little less at ease. Gathering his retinue, they make their way to Cuba and soon learn that the Dowager has made her way into the rural areas, alongside some other members of Grey\u2019s extended family. Added to the upcoming siege is news of yellow fever, which has been making its way around the region. Choosing to arm himself with a few Spanish-speaking individuals, Lord John ventures far from the beaten path and encounters some less than pleasurable individuals who seek to form their own slave insurrection. What follows will test Lord John to his core and may put a significant flavour to the intended mission. Another great story that shows the softer and more compassionate side of Lord John Grey during his continued missions around the New World.While not entirely full of new stories, the collection is well worth the time invested by the reader. Gabaldon is not only the master of the genre, but finds new and exciting ways to link passing mentions in some of her larger pieces with novellas that explain or further the already-developed piece. History is, at times, fluid when Gabaldon is at the helm, but it is the intricacies of the narrative that makes this collection a stunning compendium. Many will know of Lord John and Jamie, but it's these minor characters who are given some centre stage time that enriches the experience for all. Kudos, Madam Gabaldon for this lovely collection. Please allow me to speak for your entire fan base when I say, \u2018we thank you for these short stories\u2026 but when can we dive into BOOK NINE?\u2019. There, I said it!Love/hate the review?

A Fugitive Green stars Lord John Grey's older brother, Hal and his wife, Minnie(Jamie makes a cameo in this one). A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows is about Roger Mackenzie 's parents during WWII, Frank Randall makes a brief cameo in this one. The Space Between features Jamie Fraser 's nephew Michael Murray, his stepdaughter, Joan, and the Comte St.Germain and Master Raymond. Lastly, there is \"Virgins\" which features Jamie and Ian, three years before the events of Outlander takes place. If I had to choose one or two favorites, Fugitive Green and The Space Between would definitely be up there in the gold and silver positions. Honestly, I have been a member of the Outlander universe since I was 19 so I am always eager to get lost in DG's world. (whispers)Although I am definitely starting to plead with her to wrap it up soon. (looks around frantically)  If you're an Outlander or maybe just a Lord John Grey fan, great reading awaits you."}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "Too many Lord John stories, why keep writing about one of the most boring characters in the series? I mean, he already has his own series, so why not write about the dozens of other characters that we've not heard much from? Anything would be more interesting than what we get with John. Lord John's stories are always the same, him being put in some war/battle type situation and then him ultimately saving the day, interspersed with him lusting after some random guy and generally being a racist git. No thanks.I thought I would like Jamie/Ian's story but it didn't work for me at all, Jamie was a totally forgettable character without Claire, and Ian turned me right off with his sleazy ways, it really cheapened his supposed love for Jenny. Worst of all though was Jamie and Ian watching a rape and then blaming the victim and later glossing over the whole thing. The fuckers.The two stories that were most enjoyable were Minnie/Hal's and the one with Roger's dad, their back stories actually added some depth and intrigue to the series. It's a shame Diana Gabaldon couldn't be bothered to write more stories for the minor characters, instead of focusing mainly on her favourites (Lord John and Jamie), who have only become more and more dull and tiresome with each book."}, {"userName": "Olivia Mason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55644906-olivia-mason", "userReview": "Seven Stones to Stand or Fall contains seven Outlander stories, two of which are new. Since the others have been out for some time and I was already familiar with them, I\u2019ll leave them be\u2014but the only reason Seven Stones gets 4 STARS is because I love \u201cThe Space Between\u201d and \u201cA Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows.\u201d As for the two new stories, \u201cFugitive Green\u201d and \u201cBesieged\u201d: \u201cFugitive Green\u201d (3 STARS) has its moments, and teenage Minnie\u2019s take-no-shit spunk might fill the Claire-shaped hole in your heart (though to me, she feels like a less compelling, second-rate version). The story was interesting enough to keep my attention, but I was ultimately disappointed\u2014especially given that I enjoy Hal and Minnie in the main series.The lightning speed progression of their relationship was barely believable. Without my knowledge of their marriage from the main books, my eyes would still be in the back of my head. They have one very uneventful conversation (which Hal essentially wheezes through), and then they\u2019re suddenly jumping each other\u2019s bones at their next encounter. Jamie and Claire had a whirlwind courtship, but sheesh. There\u2019s a lot of over-the-top outrageousness in this universe, but the relationships between the characters are always spot on. Gabs is way better than this.Sadly, my one I-can\u2019t-put-it-down moment was due to wishful thinking, as I'd suspected Minnie\u2019s estranged mother\u2014described as a German-speaking nun from a convent in Paris\u2014might actually be a certain character whom I ADORE. Alas, this was not the case, and the Mommy Issues subplot reached an anticlimactic conclusion. (You\u2019ll read the story and probably think, \u201cHow could Liv think she was Mother H's daughter?\u201d but then remember that Claire once saw Nessie and also killed a wolf with her bare hands. YOU NEVER KNOW.)Lastly, because you\u2019re probably wondering: yes, Jamie does make a brief appearance. Other familiar faces with significant roles: Harry Quarry, the Twelvetrees brothers, and Hal\u2019s late wife. That being said, I enjoyed \u201cFugitive Green\u201d more than I liked \u201cBesieged\" (a very generous 2 STARS). This was to be expected, as I don\u2019t find Lord John Grey interesting unless he\u2019s getting emo with Jamie or he\u2019s bickering with/marrying Claire. There isn\u2019t much to say about \u201cBesieged\u201d other than that it\u2019s your typical \u201cWar! Bad guys! Adventure!\u201d story, with a side of \u201czombie\u201d. It\u2019s set in Jamaica/Havana 1762, and there are no appearances from major main series characters, though Jamie is mentioned.***It\u2019s interesting to see which ancillary characters DG thinks deserve short stories or novellas. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy Hal and Minnie\u2014or even John to some degree\u2014but there are so many other minor characters I\u2019d rather read about? Jocasta? Uncle Lamb? Jamie\u2019s parents? Claire\u2019s parents? CLAIRE IN GENERAL? (Okay, not a minor character, but really. I find it so odd that DG is reluctant to flesh out Claire\u2019s early life, when she\u2019s done so much with Jamie\u2019s.) I don\u2019t know, man. Seven Stones was a good way to pass the time, but the two new stories were not DG's best.

I've been on the waiting list for months. Woohoo! My turn!This is an anthology, but instead of reviewing thoroughly all the stories in it, I'm going to focus on the three that I have previously not read and reviewed. Though, yes, I couldn't help myself and re-read all the ones I've read from prior releases.And, that reminds me, speaking of prior releases, this collection is seven novellas, but only two were brand new when it released.

A fifth, Virgins, was released separately and in the Dangerous Women anthology. The only two new ones are: A Beautiful Green and Besieged, both from the Lord John side of the Outlander universe.For reference, here are the ones included showing series/time order:\u201cA Fugitive Green\" (Lord John #0.25, Outlander #2.5; 1744) Hal Grey and Minnie\u201cThe Custom of the Army\" (Lord John #2.75; 1759) John Grey\u201cA Plague of Zombies\" (Lord John #3.5; 1761) John Grey\u201cBesieged\" (Lord John #3.75; 1762) John Grey\"Virgins\" (Outlander #0.5; 1740) Jamie Fraser, Ian Murray\"The Space Between\" (Outlander #07.5; 1778) Michael Murray, Joan MacKimmie, Master Raymond\u201cA Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows\" (Outlander #8.5) Jerry and Dolly MacKenzieHere are my thoughts on the three, I had not read to this point:VirginsAn Outlander prequel adventure for a young Jamie Fraser and Ian MurrayJust after Jamie's lashing at Ft. William and the death of his father, Jamie escapes with the help of Dougal and Murtagh to join Ian in France for mercenary work protecting valuables being shipped from place to place. They encounter exiled Jews and a coming of age adventure. Both Ian and Jamie learn a thing or two about women.My heart went out to Jamie as he grieves and tries to work through his guilt, but I also was highly amused to see this pair of young men come of again with curiosity about being with a woman. Jamie and Ian's brotherhood was a heartwarming best part.A Fugitive GreenI always wanted to get Hal and Minnie's story after all the hints in the Lord John and the Outlander series books.I wasn't disappointed with what I got. I enjoyed getting Minnie's early history and being alongside as she displayed her amazing brains and talent. My heart nearly broke for Hal when the situation with Nathaniel Twelvetrees, Hal's first wife Esme, the affair, and Hal's grief after. The excitement of seeing the conniving Reginald Twelvetrees going against this younger Hal and the raw time after Hal's father's death, his wife's death, and the duel. So much! Wanted a little more of Hal and Minnie at the end, but that was just me being greedy. I was definitely riveted.BeseigedA John Grey novellaLord John is finishing up his stint as military governor of Jamaica when his step-father, General Stanley arrives to solicit his help in retrieving his mother and his cousin's family from Cuba since the British are planning to attack Havana Harbor and the Spanish would likely take prisoner any British subject still on the island when that happened. Naturally, difficult becomes even more complicated when he finds himself in the midst of a slave revolt, yellow fever, and some luck to keep his family safe.This one needs to be read after A Plague of Zombies for some elements to make sense, and it also has strong connections to A Custom of the Army, as well because of the return of Malcolm Stubbs. I loved the update on the Azeel and Rodrigo (might have the name wrong, there) as well as seeing Tom Bird assisting Lord John to rescue his mother and his cousin, Olivia's family.It was exciting and poignant and left things with strings still dangling for what is to come in the rest of the Outlander world.All in all, this collection was just what I wanted it to be. Those looking for updates on Jamie and Claire between larger novels might be disappointed, but those looking for any part of the Outlander world particularly Lord John Grey's adventures and those of his family and friends will see more to love. The rereads of novellas I got before was fun, but the three new to me stories were amazing and will become their own re-reads in time. Definitely worth it for fans though probably not a good place to start for new Outlander world readers.Book Thoughts as I read A collection of seven novellas from the Outlander universe with five previously published and two unpublished. I'm eager to read this one for the unpublished and Virgins, the only published one I've missed 'til now.For reference, here are the ones included in series/time order:The Series\u201cA Fugitive Green\" (Lord John #0.25, Outlander #0.75; 1744)\u201cThe Custom of the Army\" (Lord John #2.75; 1759)\u201cA Plague of Zombies\" (Lord John #3.5; 1761)\u201cBesieged\" (Lord John #3.75; 1762)\"Virgins\" (Outlander #0.5; 1740)\"The Space Between\" (Outlander #07.5; 1778)\u201cA Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows\" (Outlander #8.5)And here are my thoughts for the novellas in order that they appear in the book:The Custom of the Army 5 starsReread. The first sentence cracks me up yet again, \"All things considered, it was probably the fault of the electric eel. John Grey could- and for a time, did- blame the Honorable Caroline Woodford, as well. And the surgeon. And certainly that blasted poet. Still... no, it was the eel's fault.\"I always find John's books just as fascinating as the larger stories of Jamie and Claire, I know, astounding, but there you have it. I totally enjoyed immersing myself back in this John Grey adventure where he ends up in The Battle for Quebec fighting with Highlanders on the Plains of Abraham, encountering his cousin's husband, Malcolm Stubbs, Manoka, Charlie Carruthers, and a certain Major Snively with repercussions and the rest of the story for the last two in The Scottish Prisoner.The Space Between 4 starsA mysterious Raymond story and the Comte St. Germaine introduced in Dragonfly in Amber, yes!Joan MacKimmie (Laoghaire's daughter) and Michael Murray (Ian and Jennie's son).Just after Ian's death, Michael escorts Joan to Paris to be a nun and to get away from the 'voices'. The Comte encounters Master Raymond with a burning need to understand more about traveling through the stones. Two threads left dangling. A Plague of Zomibies 5 starsLord John Grey in JamaicaFaced with loa, Maroons, Mrs. Abernathy, murder, zombies, and a slave rising, John has his hands ful in this deadly island paradise.A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows 4 stars The story of Roger Mackenzie's parents, Jerry and Dolly, during WWII and a chance encounter with Captain Frank Randall showing how tough the war was on everyone.Such a poignant and bittersweet tale. I loved learning the fate of this lovely couple.Virgins 4 starsAn Outlander prequel adventure for a young Jamie Fraser and Ian MurrayJust after Jamie's lashing at Ft. William and the death of his father, Jamie escapes with the help of Dougal and joins Ian in Fran for mercenary work protecting valuables being shipped from place to place. He encounters exiled Jews and a coming of age adventure. Both Ian and Jamie learn a thing or two about women.A Fugitive Green 5 starsI always wanted to get Hal and Minnie's story after all the hints in the Lord John and the Outlander series books.Loved getting this one. It's possible it will be my favorite of the collection just because I've been wanting this story fleshed out for so long and I wasn't disappointed with what I got. I enjoyed getting Minnie's early history and being alongside as she displayed her amazing brains and talent. My heart nearly broke when the situation with Nathaniel Twelvetrees, Hal's first wife Esme, the affair, and Hal's grief after. The excitement of seeing the conniving Reginald Twelvetrees going against this younger Hal and the raw time after Hal's father's death, his wife's death, and the duel. So much! Wanted a little more at the end, but that was just me being greedy. I was definitely riveted.BeseigedA never before released John Grey novellaLord John is finishing up his stint as governor of Jamaica when his step-father, General Stanley arrives to solicit his help in retrieving his mother and his cousin's family from Cuba since the British are planning to attack Havana Harbor.

I\u2019ve listened to every book more than once. I own many of them in paper and all of them as ebooks and audiobooks.. I read her blog. ( I haven\u2019t watched the current mini- series, but then, I don\u2019t watch any television.) There were only two stories in this collection that I had not read. The entries that I had read, I mostly owned already. So was it worth it to buy them again as part of a collection? Yes, it was. I\u2019ve already admitted that I\u2019m an addict.The two stories that are original to this book (I think they have not been published elsewhere.) are close to 200 pages long and are equal to about 9 hours of listening time. More important, they were very good stories about characters that I like. I\u2019m a happy customer. From beginning to end the audiobook is a little over 24 hours long. There are four different voice artists, and Diana Gabaldon reading author\u2019s notes herself. ( I do wish she hadn\u2019t. Her voice sounds damaged from overuse and she read too fast. I enjoy her notes and comments very much, but they are better in written form.)Now, my comments on the stories, briefly as possible:The Custom of the Army - a Lord John Gray novella, audio performance by Jeff Woodman. I like this character.(I can do without intimate details of his love life.) Only Diana Gabaldon would begin a story with an electric eel party, followed by a duel, with a notorious anatomist serving as the attending physician. Her rendition of the Battle of Quebec is excellent historical fiction.The Space Between- an Outlander novella, audio performance by Davina Porter. This story is an aside from A Breath of Snow and Ashes set in Paris in 1778. It\u2019s a sweet story involving Jamie Fraser\u2019s nephew and his step daughter. A Plague of Zombies - a Lord John novella, audio performance by Jeff Woodman. Lord John is in Jamaica in 1761. Why not? And yes, there are zombies. Only Gabaldon can do this.A Leaf on the Wind of All Hollows - Audio performance by Robert Ian MacKenzie - An Outlander story; it actually is a short story. Set during WW2 and the early 18th century, this one solves the mystery of what actually happened to Roger Mackenzie\u2019s father, from Jerry Mackenzie\u2019s perspective. Roger\u2019s part if the story is in Written in My Own Heart's Blood. There is no end to how far this woman can spin a story. Virgins - audio performance by Allan Scott-Douglas - a prequel to the first Outlander book. Jamie Fraser and his future brother-in-law, Ian Murray are fighting in France. This was probably my least favorite story in the book, but that may have been that I couldn\u2019t adjust to the reader. It was an overly convoluted story involving the marriage of a Jewish girl to a gentile. A Fugitive Green - audio performance by Jeff Woodman. This is the story I needed to read. It begins in Paris in 1744 with a cameo appearance by Jamie Fraser and a hissing cockroach (again,only Gabaldon), but it\u2019s really about Minerva Cunnegunda Wattiswade and her eventual marriage to Harold Patricius Gerard Blecker Grey, the Duke of Pardloe. I loved Minnie. Could we have an entire series about her?Besieged  - A Lord John Gray novella, audio performance by Jeff Woodman. Lord John has vanquished the zombies and he\u2019s anxious to get out of Jamaica. Sadly, he must detour to Havana to evacuate his mother, his pregnant cousin, and her children, before the British invade Cuba to take it from the Spanish. Naturally, he doesn\u2019t avoid the invasion and finds himself involved with the British manipulation of a slave uprising. Not a cheerful story, but I like John\u2019s mother, the Dowager Duchess of Pardloe."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22237394-annie", "userReview": "New stories A Fugitive Green and Besieged deserve 5 stars.

If you're interested, there is a chronological listing of the Outlander and Lord John Grey books on my website.On the whole, they\u2019re excellent stories with a few niggles here and there.The Series\u201cA Fugitive Green\" (Lord John #0.25, Outlander #0.75; 1744)\u201cThe Custom of the Army\" (Lord John #2.75; 1759)\u201cA Plague of Zombies\" (Lord John #3.5; 1761)\u201cBesieged\" (Lord John #3.75; 1762)\"Virgins\" (Outlander #0.5; 1740)\"The Space Between\" (Outlander #07.5; 1778)\u201cA Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows\" (Outlander #8.5)The Stories\"The Custom of the Army\" is an excellent mini-adventure for Lord John Grey from the electric eel attack to his brief Indian affair to General Wolfe's successful attack on Quebec, all with the purpose of upholding his old friend\u2019s, Charlie Carruther's, honor when he is accused of not preventing a mutiny\u2026with cause.My one niggle with this is the duel that takes place immediately after the party AND in London. From everything I\u2019ve read, this simply wasn\u2019t on. Take note of Malcolm Stubbs in this, as he appears again in \"Besieged\". This short story can also be found in George R.R. Martin & Gardner Dozois' \nWarriors\n.\"The Space Between\" was a curious (and excellent!) peek into what Joan MacKimmie, Jamie\u2019s stepdaughter, is off to, joining a nunnery in Paris, and how it collides with Michael Murray, Jamie\u2019s nephew; the Comte St. Germain; and, Ma\u00eetre Raymond. There\u2019s an interesting historical bit about the cemeteries around Paris in this. Niggle-wise, I wish we\u2019d learned more about Raymond\u2019s and the comte\u2019s plans as well as what the comte had intended with Joan.This short story can also be found in John Joseph Adams\u2019 \nThe Mad Scientist's Guide to World Domination: Original Short Fiction for the Modern Evil Genius\n.\"A Plague of Zombies\" is another exciting tale with the horrible truth about making zombies and how corruption can steal one\u2019s soul when Lieutenant Colonel Lord John Grey is sent to Jamaica to quell a maroon uprising. I absolutely adored how unusual Grey was/is in this compared to his compatriots' usual behavior.Originally titled \u201cLord John and the Plague of Zombies\" in George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois\u2019 \nDown These Strange Streets\n.\"A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows\" will make you cry in this encounter with Roger MacKenzie Wakefield\u2019s father, Jerry, a fighter pilot in World War II when Captain Frank Randall volunteers him for a secret mission. Finally, we learn why Roger\u2019s father wasn\u2019t there for him.This short story can be found as a standalone or in George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois' \nSongs of Love and Death: All-Original Tales of Star-Crossed Love\n.\"Virgins\" is both sad and rather funny when Jamie Fraser is sent to France to join up with the mercenary group of which Ian Murray, his best friend, is a member. Yep, it\u2019s all about two virgins, and how they deal.This short story can also be found in George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois\u2019 \nDangerous Women\n.\"A Fugitive Green\", a new story, starts out so horribly sad and then turns sweet. It\u2019s Hal, John\u2019s older brother, who is struggling to survive events in his life that have destroyed him emotionally. Enter Minnie, the young French spy, hired to finish the job, who turns out to have compassion galore.I love how supportive her odd father is at the end, although Hal and Harry\u2019s luck seems pretty amazing. As for the library floor action, how does this prove her as a good guy?\"Besieged\", a new story, follows on from Lord John\u2019s adventures in \u201cA Plague of Zombies\" when his stepfather shows up and begs John to rescue Benedicta, John\u2019s mother, before she\u2019s taken hostage.This includes previous characters: Azeel and Rodrigo (\u201cA Plague of Zombies\") and Malcolm Stubbs (\u201cThe Custom of the Army\").The Cover and TitleThe cover has a golden yellow background with a slight radial gradient. A deep gold banner spans the top with a note that this is a collection from the Outlander series. The author\u2019s name is directly below it in an embossed metallic red and her New York Times status. The title is in a deeper embossed red and takes up the whole bottom half.

I like these stories and they are a fun glimpse into mostly side stories in the Outlander world. They fill in gaps or give backstory, but still are loads of fun. My only criticism is that I would have preferred that these stories would have been put in chronological order. It would have made more sense to read them that way. That said, here\u2019s my take on the stories themselves:The Custom of the Army - I liked this side trip into the LJG world. The author takes us to Canada for a court-martial involving a friend of LJG. Prior to the Canadian adventure, there's an electric eel party, a duel, and threatened marriage. Once in Canada, LJG is drawn into\u00a0the Battle of Quebec. I like Gabaldon's attention to detail and this short novella is a nice interlude in the Outlander/Lord John Grey world.The Space Between - This novella was an interesting side trip in the Outlander world. It is not necessary to the Jamie/ Claire storyline, but it does enhance the enjoyment. DG takes us to Paris before the Revolution - Michael Murray is returning from his father's (Ian's) funeral and is escorting Joan MacKimmie (Laogherie's daughter) to a convent. Michael is still mourning the loss of his wife and child, but is attracted to Joan despite knowing that she's about to become a novice at the convent. The story brings back a few characters from\u00a0Dragonfly in Amber\u00a0- Comte St Germain, Monsieur Raymond, Mother Hildegarde - and it's good to see them again. This is a fun side trip.A Plague of Zombies - LJG is sent to Jamaica to quell the slave rebellion and is drawn into intrigue involving, among other things, corrupt officials, slaves, snakes, cockroaches, and zombies. It brings a few characters into the mix who are also found in Voyager (but, alas, only very peripherally Jamie). I enjoy DG's smaller novellas involving LJG - the flavor is different, and much less sweeping, than the\u00a0Outlander\u00a0novels but they are fun nevertheless and whet your appetite for more.A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows - A short sidetrip in the Outlander world - it can be read as a standalone but if you're doing the entire series, it would fall either before or after Written in My Own Heart's Blood. This little gem is a glimpse into Roger MacKenzie's parent's lives in the time just after he was born. The reader sees more of their relationship and learns that all is not as it seemed as far as their deaths in the war. There are a few cameos by some Outlander characters. A bittersweet vignette.Virgins - A fun glimpse of Jamie and Ian as young men. This takes place not long after Jamie was flogged by Blackjack Randall and he is still dealing with his wounds - physical and mental, primarily the death of his father and worry over the plight of Jenny. Ian is his steady right-hand man and together they hire out as mercenaries in France. The pre-Claire Jamie is not as mature, but the seeds are there for the man he'll become.A Fugitive Green - An interesting look at Minnie before she became Hal\u2019s wife. This gives us the backstory of how she came to England from France and the intrigue surrounding her actions. It is a side trip - there is little of the main Outlander characters besides Minnie and Hal (and of course Twelvetrees\u2026he is intimately wrapped up in this storyline), but it was fun to see them meet and there\u2019s an exciting scene in library that was hot and humorous. This was one of the two new stories in the collection.Besieged - The other new story in the collection is a new LJG story. The one finds LJG packing up in Jamaica and getting ready to leave when he finds out that his mother is in Cuba (along with a few other British women and children he\u2019s concerned about) and war is about to be declared and they must be removed from there at once. He and his valet Tom make their way there only to find a few other impediments - like yellow fever and slave revolts - and must navigate their way with only a smattering of Spanish. It again is a delightful side trip - not integral to the Outlander story but a fun look at LJG and his story in the Outlander world.Quotes to remember:In this instance, the \u201cstand or fall\u201d has to do with people\u2019s response to grief and adversity: to wit, if you aren\u2019t killed outright by whatever happened, you have a choice in how the rest of your life is lived - you keep standing, though battered and worn by time and elements, still a buttress and a signpost - or you fall and return quietly to the earth from which you sprang, your elements giving succor to those who come after you. (Intro)But after a time, ye find ye're in a different place than ye were. A different person than ye were. And then ye look about and see what's there with ye. Ye'll maybe find a use for yourself. That helps. (SB)Yet it seems that I lost her between one heartbeat and the next. And I - I keep looking for her there, in that space between.
