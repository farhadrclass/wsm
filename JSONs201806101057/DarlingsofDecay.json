Every now and then you get lucky and an author comes along with a different take or perspective and breathes new life into a stale story. If we're really lucky, the author delivers a great story via that new perspective. This anthology had a few stories that had us looking at zombies and the apocalypse in a new light. Which I think is to be expected when you gather up these many writers because - virus, outbreak, head to the mall to gather supplies would get tiring very quickly. Sadly the majority of the stories failed at delivering a great story. First off, some of these were short stories and others were just ads to get you to buy the full novel (not cool). Some of the unique perspectives were wasted while a couple could easily be full novels. Some characters were flat and unremarkable and the stories followed suit. Some authors tried too hard - to be funny and I don't know the writing felt, off. I enjoyed a handful - the ones I remember:What Zombies Fear by Laura BretzBob by Tonia BrownEva Wilde Vs The Zombie Apocalypse* by Jen Marie Wilde *nothing unique here but a nice book to end the anthology.There was least one more that I enjoyed but the title escapes me. I hate DNFing books and I didn't come close with this one, but man I had to turn the \"time left to finish book\" counter on the bottom of my Kindle Fire off because it was depressing me. There was a chapter that was going to take me over three hours to finish, wait, what? Three hours?!? You'd think I was reading backwards.After all this mudslinging I still recommend this if you love the genre. I mean, we're talking zombies here :) Read one story a week in between books or when you're in a slump. Some of these stories will have you running to a good novel in a heartbeat."}, {"userName": "Joline Novy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16944122-joline-novy", "userReview": "Wow! Wow! WOW!! This was an absolutely FANTASTIC anthology!! I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading books about zombies and/or the zombie apocalypse! There are many many great stories in this book. Some are as short as 2 pages while some are full length first installments. While I do have my favorites, there's no way I could pick one story I liked the most. When I heard about this project and saw some of the authors that were submitting stories, I was so excited about this coming out. Not only did I really enjoy what I read by the familiar writers, I found some new wonderful authors to follow as well!! I am not disappointed at all with this anthology!!

Paradigms be damned, this isn't a book of good zombie stories by women; this is a perspicaciously engaging and original collection of stories by great authors, regardless of gender. \"What zombies fear\" was my favorite, incase anyone is wondering, but the entire book is not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3330845-monica", "userReview": "Love zombies!"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "A pre-warning, the blurb for this says \"stories & excerpts\" maybe I missed the excerpts bit because quite a few of these chapters were just lumps of other stories, enticements into buying the full story from the author. Not sure I like that style of anthology.What Zombies Fear by Laura Bretz: it all started with a weird phone call, then a mad bite laden drive through country lanes, as the main character (Ryan) struggles to get home to his beloved wife - LB really ratcheted up the tension and the emotions felt by this perfect couple. She also gave a great sense of despair and there was a real element of spook. Ryan's \"journey\" did make me smile a few times. The ingenious use of duct tape - its a fix-all!! I didn't really understand the end but thought the premise would make a great full length novel. I also want their house! great load of links at the end of the story, and I look forward to her first novel.Bob by Tonia Brown: a humorous, zen thinking zombie but with no set un-life desire to reach the top of the munching pile, until poor work shy Bob finds his true calling. brilliant! TB really manages to inject some humour into the grotesque.Just Another Day by Chantal Boudreau: supermum in the ZomPoc, its a hardship juggling so much, but Margot does well. CB really draws you into this little family unit and then does a big WooHoo at the end. Very enjoyable.Mr Romero's Warriors by Catt Cahman: very short but also very haunting, I was left with an \"omg what did I just read\" feeling. Descent by Mia Darian: a very strange little tale of Gods, zombies and sacrifice. I did not really get into this story as felt the \"telling\" of the story odd and the mix of genres too weird; for me!Flesh Seekers by CM Doporto: I loved the clever way that CMD conveyed information without long spiels, just little infobombs. The dystopian world that she depicts is filled with horrors, and her gore descriptions were grossly wonderful. I felt a bit cheated on this one though as it ends with an advert for the continuing of the story. meh, not good, IMO if I want to like the authors work and buy it I will do but not because I was lured in during an anthology. Zombie Battle by Jacqueline Druga: another temptation piece to get you hooked on the author, without a complete story. Not impressed. Although I was with the story and the writing. You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again by Dana Fredsti: lots of film references, which if you like movies you will enjoy. The blas\u00e9 way the zombie issue is dealt with is hysterical and the \"show must go on\". I really enjoyed this.Payback by Belinda Frisch: again, this is merely a little stuffed in short to entice you (the reader) to buy the bigger novel. Sorry, I already paid for an anthology and I expect full stories. I'll Love You Forever, But... by April Grey: I had to snort when its the slimey mud covered socks that really miff our Lady regarding her zombie husband and that is only the start of this brilliant short story. I will definitely be on the look out for more. MY favourite.Excerpts... Michelle Kilmer & Rebecca Hansen: NOPE! I wont half read a story, sorry.The Fruit of Thy Womb by Lori R. Lopez: I'm glad this lovely, well known to me, author came next or I would have given up on this book. However the story is not lovely, the world has gone to poop and poor Ziggy has had a tough time, the dejection and gloom in his world so delicately chronicled by LRL. Flies with teeth, aaah thats almost as bad as spiders with wings! As the story flits back and forth in time zones and the stories of the three main characters revolve, it really gives you a sense of what has occurred as the horror unfolds. Its certainly a unique take on the zompoc!Scarred by Suzi M: short and snappy! thankfully I have read ALL the stories by this author so feel I know her well, this was a very short show of her talent.The One in the Basement by Tara Maya: Marlie is the Queen of Kitsch. I was in giggleheaven with PooTube & Twatter. A \"lovely\" little story of family love - really enjoyed this. Sundered by Shannon Mayer: another advert, and SO much of a story to end nowhere.Zombified by Lyra Mcken: aw what a sad little zombie tale of two children slowly turning into zombies, very clever writing shows off the confusion and emotion. The prologue was inspired.Zombie Awakening by Cynthia Melton, Hope for A Happy ending by by Kristen Middleton, The Zombie Chroncicles by Chrissy Peebles & The Sickness by Jeannie Rae: more short stories enticing to you buy the novel - I bought this one, this function of testing a book is available via Amazon.At this point I am NOT wasting any more of time reading. I am sorry to the remaining authors who contributed.In future I will be a little more careful in what anthologies I buy and not just go on the few names that I recognise."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline Loudan weister", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19250345-jacqueline-loudan-weister", "userReview": "Awesome book!

This is not the case here - nearly all the included works have been published before, so there's nothing new for fans of he genre who read it all.There are some great stories/novels here (like Annie Walls' companion story to her Famished series) and some outright bad ones (e.g. the paranormal romance with part werewolf part zombie part wampire with healing blood and a part demonspawn on top of that protagonist - damn! 8-/ ), overall the whole selection is quite good. I have one serious criticism though - including samples of novels which are cut at some point with a message \"buy the book to read more\" is really a no-go for me. I mean, seriously, this is an anthology of complete works, not a sales catalogue - sadly there are a couple (~5?) of works included this way inside :-(.Overall I recommend this book, though it might be a bit too much zombies for some people if read in one go.

Many of the \"short stories\" in here aren't really stand alone shorts, they are teasers.

Some of them did seem interesting but I think several smaller bundles with slightly more story would have done better for getting the authors visibility."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Darlings of Decay is an anthology of zombie shorts and novellas written by female authors. Often, the standard point made in a review of an anthology is that it is a mixed bag; good, bad, and so-so tales populate a book filled with a wide assortment of authors, whether the theme is specific or open ended. Such is the case with this book, though for not entirely for the standard reasons. This isn\u2019t a book filled with short stories that are all within a certain size range or even stories that are all complete. Instead, it is a mix of shorts, novellas, and primers, for lack of a better term, from an assortment of authors offering up their take on the zombie apocalypse. It wouldn\u2019t be altogether fair to be critical of an author whose contribution is more of a primer rather than a whole story. Unfortunately, stunted tales like those do leave something to be desired. Granted, it is an attempt to lure the reader to the author\u2019s completed work outside of the anthology, but they left me a bit frustrated at the sudden start and abrupt endings. There were also a small group of novellas that felt rather expansive for such a book. They were not necessarily primers, but were parts of larger works with bigger tales to tale, thus once again leaving things open ended unless the reader chooses to seek out the rest of the author\u2019s work. Darlings of Decay did offer up quite a few short stories that were not hints at bigger tales and some were noteworthy. Chantal Boudreau, Tonia Brown, Catt Dahman, Lori R. Lopez, and Suzanne Robb all contributed some very entertaining short stories to this work. As to whetting my appetite for something beyond the pages of this book, Jackie Druga\u2019s \u201cZombie Battle\u201d had a world building, epic quality to it that made me curious to see where the story would be heading after it cut off here. Focusing on the quality of the stories, it was indeed a mix of well written, sharply creative tales and dull plodders that were predictable from start to finish. It was clear that each author had to be responsible for their own editing, as there was no uniformity to each story on that score. Some were clean while quite a few were clogged with obvious typos and awkward phrasing that could have been addressed with a uniform editorial sweep. Treat this book as a sample platter and you will likely not be disappointed in what it has to offer. Nibble here and there-try the short stories and perhaps take a peek at the longer tales and decide whether what they have to offer are worth some bigger bites. Keep that in mind and you should come away satisfied that you have discovered a few new talented voices in the zombie genre that are worth seeking out further works from."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3561547-rebecca", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the snippets, chapters, and full blown novellas included in this anthology.
