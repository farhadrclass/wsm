Which essentially means that - by default - I'm not the target audience for the whole chick-lit vertical that Cancel the Wedding is supposed to fit into. I mean, this is the kind of thing my eye automatically tends to skim past in bookstores: a novel about daughters and their mothers and hidden secrets from the past coming to light and maybe a possible love interest and everyone involved has all of these feeeeeeelings that they need to express and... well, it's really not my thing.Except.Carolyn Dingman? She's a really gifted writer, blending the ability to develop realistic and memorable characters with a sharp and truly wicked sense of humor. With Cancel the Wedding, she applies these skills to take what could have easily been a pretty cut-and-dried genre exercise and transforms it into something totally enjoyable -- the kind of thing you actively want to come back to after you put it down, simply because you're having so much fun reading it.I know -- it surprised the hell out of me, too. I won't try to describe what happens in the novel plot-wise, because a lot of the other reviewers here have already done that better than I could. Instead, I'll throw an RIYL at you, and let that tell the story: Cancel the Wedding, to me, came off as a kind of hybrid of the early Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum novels and that Reese Witherspoon movie \"Sweet Home Alabama\" -- 400ish pages of totally charming, engaging and often very, very funny writing that, in the end, is almost impossible not to like. Recommended, without reservation."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/672625-susan", "userReview": "I still can't believe CANCEL THE WEDDING is a debut novel by Carolyn. She pulled me right in from the very beginning and never let me go. Even after I was finished reading, I found myself thinking of Georgia and her mom.

On the one hand, I enjoyed following Olivia and her niece Logan as they try to unearth the mystery of Olivia's mother, who had requested that her ashes be scattered in a lake in Huntley GA. I did liked Olivia's journey of self discovery as she sought to uncover her mothers secrets.On the other hand, I thought there was quite a couple of story lines that were not pertinent to the story and could have been left out of the book altogether.I thought this was just an \"ok\" read; parts of it were extremely predictable, but there was 1 surprise I did not see coming. I was tempted a few times to put it aside, but it did keep me interested enough to read to the end to see the final results.

One of the daughters is unsettled in her career and her relationship so she goes to the town to try and figure out why their mother left those specific wishes.

The expected publication date is August 5, 2014. This is the type of read that is right up my alley. A mystery from the past being solved in the present day. This book is slightly different than most of this genre that I have read that with the exception of the first chapter it is told entirely in the present day and the story is unraveled through clues found in the present. I am a sucker for a tragic love story and this book delivers. As we learn more about Janie's past I became more hooked. I could not wait to find out what happened with George and Oliver even though I knew the outcome could not be good. Another strength in this book was the story-line and relationships in the present day. I really enjoyed the interactions between Olivia and her fourteen year old niece. It added an additional element that kept the story ticking. And then there is Elliot. I could write forever about him but I won't. He had me at hello and I just loved him. The additional conflict that he created by his presence in Olivia's life as she was dealing with her current issues added another layer to the story. Did I mention that he was totally dreamy? Not necessarily in the physical aspect but his personality. He was the perfect male. I fell in love with him. Overall I really liked this story. I found myself ignoring all the things on my to do list in order to finish this book. Before starting this story I had pre-judged it to be a fluff story but it had so much more to it. I will be recommending this to everyone."}, {"userName": "Kim Howard", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12077154-kim-howard", "userReview": "Easy Going Story With a Touch of MysteryThis book has an easygoing flow to it. The storytelling has a touch of whimsy, humor, romance, heartbreak, and a mystery too. The characters are well defined and you grow to like them. The humor and the mystery are the glue of the story. I enjoyed a lot about the book except for the title. It has such little significance to the story and really doesn't define the meaning of the book. It a story of discovery and 'cancelling a wedding' is a byproduct. Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it."}, {"userName": "Alaina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6624019-alaina", "userReview": "My only criticism about this book is the title! It leads you to believe this is a light chick-lit read only good for the beach, but it's so much more than that! I haven't felt this emotionally connected to a novel in a long time. The book follows Olivia on a quest through small-town Georgia to uncover many secrets her mother never revealed during her lifetime. You meet several amazing characters that truly bring this book to life.It's hard to believe this is Carolyn Dingman's debut novel. She had me laughing and crying. This book pulled at my heartstrings and had me so engaged that I was reading as quickly as I could so I could uncover the next twist. Carolyn wrote so beautifully and wove a wonderful tale of love, loss, and love again. She gave you little details to lead you in the right direction, but you never knew how all of the piece would come together or how they story would end. It offers the perfect amount of romance, friendship, and mystery to hold your interest. I was hooked until the very last page. I highly recommend this book - I can't believe more people aren't reading it!"}, {"userName": "Lesa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1366422-lesa", "userReview": "I hope the title of Carolyn T. Dingman's debut novel, Cancel the Wedding, didn't immediately turn you off. There's nothing wrong with chick lit or the cover of this book, but neither the title nor the cover art succeed in illustrating the serious tone of this book. The publisher chose to play up \"the runaway bride\" aspect. I prefer to see the story as a well-written, fascinating search for family secrets. It's a mystery about one woman's past so much more than a story of a runaway bride.At thirty-two, Olivia Hughes seems to have it all, a well-paying job in Washington, D.C., and a successful lawyer fiance. But, her father died of heart disease, her mother died almost a year earlier of cancer, and Olivia really is uncomfortable with the direction her life is taking. When Leo announces at a family dinner that he has a surprise, the date and site for their wedding is now available, Olivia panics. She, too, announces a surprise. She's ready to go to Huntley, Georgia, with her mother's ashes, to honor her wishes. What's it matter that Olivia and her older sister, Georgia, have no idea why her mother wanted her ashes scattered there? Jane Rutledge Hughes never talked about her past.Along with her fourteen-year-old niece, Logan, Olivia sets out for Huntley, Georgia, only to discover the town is no longer there. The town had been flooded out when the TVA created a man-made lake. And, her mother's past seems to have vanished as well, although a few people remember \"the Huntley Rutledges\". It isn't long before Olivia finds an ally in the local newspaper owner. Elliott sees it as a local human interest story. Olivia sees it as a search for her mother's past, a mother she discovers she never really knew. And, while she's in Georgia, maybe she'll find answers to her own uncertain future.The characters of Olivia, Logan, and Elliott are wonderful. It's soon obvious why Olivia is unsuited for life with a high-powered lawyer, with her lack of filter when she speaks, and her klutziness. It's those qualities, though, that make her likable. And, it's obvious she loved her mother, and doesn't understand why there were secrets. Even so, Olivia is determined to find why her mother wanted to return home.Carolyn T. Dingman's first novel is a riveting story of the search for answers. She manages to make one woman's hunt spellbinding, incorporating personal elements as well as historical elements to bring to life the search and story of one town and a small group of people. I wish I could tell you more about Jane Rutledge Hughes' own story, but you'll have to uncover it step-by-step with Olivia, Logan, and Elliott. It's a puzzle, a treasure hunt through old newspaper files, library books, and people's memories. And, I found myself as moved by Jane's story as Olivia was.Move beyond the title and the cover of this book. Yes, there is a reason the book is called Cancel the Wedding. But, as I said, Dingman's outstanding debut is about one woman's hunt for her mother's past and her own future. It's so much more than the story of a runaway bride.Carolyn T.

Because Liv was especially eager to escape her own romantic issues she spent a month in the small town she'd never heard of digging into her mothers past. Her niece Logan tagged along and also helped with the search. After Liv met Elliot she seriously began to reconsider her engagement to Leo back home. Elliot's feelings for Liv promoted him to help her with the search and also gave her access to the local townspeople. Their relationship developed really well and was more involved than what could be expected from a cheesy romance novel. Much of the plot revolved around Liv digging into her mother's past and dodging Leo's calls.Liv was an okay character, but she wasn't someone I especially liked. She knew she wasn't in love with Leo yet was unable to break off the engagement. I thought that was very unfair to both Leo and Elliot, although I suppose that was the point. Her indecision created a pivotal point in the plot.Some of the elements in the towns history were rather odd, a flooded town, a fire, mysterious deaths, and grave robbing. The search into Liv's mother's past life went on bit too long and then turned into scenes straight out of a horror movie. Liv's mother was given several chapters where she was the focus. Those helped to explain her youth and her burial request but I didn't think that story was all that strong.Overall, this was a good chick lit beach read. It was pure entertainment with characters who were passionate and realistic."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/358463-cynthia", "userReview": "This is what it is, an entertaining novel that is perfect for a summer time read.
