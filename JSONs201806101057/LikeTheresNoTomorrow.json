(a lot)I cried. (a little)I swooned. (a little) \u2026 (yeah. ok. a lot)In short, I fell in love. With the book. With the characters. With the settings. And especially with the message of letting go \u2013 of fear, bitterness, and burdens we were never meant to carry.Let\u2019s talk about the characters for a moment. We\u2019ll get to Ian and Emily in a bit, but I absolutely have to focus on Maggie and Grace first. These two elderly Scottish sisters were a handful! And a hoot! They were the main source of my giggles throughout Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow, and I confess that I wondered there for a while if Camille had based these riotous octogenarians on my grandmothers :) Between Grace\u2019s precious confusion and Maggie\u2019s rebellious determination to steal the keys and drive off into the sunset, there was never a dull moment on the page!And now for Ian. Oh girls! You will LOVE Ian! That is, as long as you go for the brooding, tender, passionate guys with a sense of humor. Who also happen to be SCOTTISH. That\u2019s right \u2013 he comes with a brogue and a kilt and a nicely sculpted chest thanks to chopping wood. Swoon over that for a moment and then come back here so we can talk about what really matters. (No\u2026 not his kisses. Although those seemed quite delicious!) As yummy as all of that is, the thing I appreciated most about Ian is the change that goes on within his heart. Camille Eide does an exquisite job of capturing his completely-reasonable anger as well as the gradual healing that takes place over the course of the story. And watching that man fall in love was truly a pleasure.Which brings us to Emily. Because, you see, Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow is so much more than a love story. I would almost say that the romance is only a small part in the overall story, but that\u2019s not exactly true either. The romance becomes the backdrop onto which Camille Eide paints a beautiful landscape of truth and hope and most especially courage. Bottom Line: Camille Eide has a way with characters. They get into your heart and set up camp, and you are all the better for having spent time with them. She also has a great talent for creating a scene that appears one way at face value but in fact can be immensely symbolic as well. Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow will linger with me for many reasons \u2013 the characters, the setting, the romance. But especially the message of courage \u2013 of living life in spite of your fears \u2013 and of cherishing each day as though it\u2019s all we\u2019re to be given. If you love to become emotionally invested in the books you read, I highly suggest you try one by Camille Eide!(I received a copy of this book in exchange for only my honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "What an uplifting story!

Like There's No Tomorrow deals quite a bit with selfishness through Ian and Emily's story. I loved how the meaning of the title became clear as the novel progressed. The character development was well done and realistic. Secondary characters Maggie, Grace and Claire added to the novel. Maggie and Claire had strong personalities in different ways. Humor delivered by Maggie was delightful.Like There's No Tomorrow is an enjoyable novel and recommended for fans of contemporary romance."}, {"userName": "Carissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9102458-carissa", "userReview": "To read my full review, please visit Bookshelves and Daydreams.My Official Take in 3 PartsThe ThemeIt's always hard to let people go, even when it's best for them. In Emily's case, she loves her Aunt Grace with every fiber of her being, to the point where it's hard for her to imagine a life without her. But what if Grace's place isn't in Oregon, but back home, in Scotland, with her sister Maggie?For Ian, his letting go involves something quite different. Stagnating hatred and grief have crippled him emotionally for years due to a personal loss, and it's impacted his relationship with God, the God he once loved deeply and who took away his anger before. Ian must discover that some things, like his faith, are worth fighting for while others, like his bitterness, must be turned over to God.I love this theme, the idea of releasing control into bigger, more capable Hands than our own. Loving doesn't always mean keeping, and the sooner we learn that the better. And then with Ian, he must release his anger in order to become whole again, to trust again. And I especially love how prayer plays such a huge factor in Ian's healing. Not prayer for himself, but a prayer of blessing for the person he hates. That type of prayer brings about healing every time.The CharactersI thought I would struggle with Emily because she deliberately holds back information from her Aunt Grace. But I couldn't dislike her because I can see her point of view. When you want to protect people, the last thing you want to do is tell them something that could potentially lead to their harm, like elderly Aunt Grace making a trip to Scotland in her frail condition. So Emily hides information, all out of the sincere belief that she's protecting others, but she does reach the point of giving God the reins and it all works out for the best. She learns to trust, and I love that.Ian I liked from the first, partly because he's Scottish, but also because he's a gentleman, through and through. He's considerate of the people around him, loves his family, and when he and Emily fall in love, he doesn't do it by halves. Plus, he's constructive in his anger. I would say that he manages the \"be angry and sin not\" instruction pretty well.Ahhhh, the sisters. Grace and Maggie (the sister who Ian takes care of) are quite the pair. Both of them struggle with mental frailty, and Maggie's going blind to boot, but they're stronger together. I love that. It reminds me of my sister and our relationship and how I always feel that we're stronger together rather than apart. Grace and Maggie have it down. And while Maggie is far spunkier than Grace, she did a little bit of learning of her own this story, very important learning. Sometimes it's harder to accept help than to give it, and she finds that out.The WritingI do believe Camille Eide has a gift with character development. Her story is about real people with real problems and fears, and yet all of the characters felt relatable in some way. I could like each of them for their own strengths, because those strengths far outweighed any weaknesses. Yep, there's romance and gushing and all of that good stuff, but it's tastefully written and tender rather than coarse. Ms. Eide has a good handle on how far is just far enough with the physical attraction thing. Well done."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39656967-jane", "userReview": "[Scottish bridegroom in a kilt = automatic 4.5 star rating (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52248038-lisa", "userReview": "This is such a heart warming story that goes straight to the heart!"}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1757831-helen", "userReview": "A well written and very enjoyable read!

I knew when I read the synopsis for this book that I was in for a treat. One, it involved a visit to Scotland! Two, it involved 2 older, somewhat frail ladies under the care of their individual family members. The situations this puts our two main caretakers in were sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes wonderfully touching. Ian MacLean is anxious to get out from under the \"burden\" of having to be on constant watch and care of his grannie, Maggie. He sees no reason that her sister, Grace, who is living in America, shouldn't move to Scotland and take over the primary care. After all, the letters that he's been reading to Maggie from Grace (and Emily) indicate she is doing great and, in his mind, well able to care for them both. However, what he doesn't know is that the letters from Grace (written by Emily) do not reveal the whole picture.Emily Chapman has been lovingly caring for her Aunt Grace for many years and knows that Grace is not well enough to travel to Scotland by herself to see her sister. And it definitely wouldn't be safe to leave her in charge of another elderly lady. So when she gets a letter from Maggie (written by Ian) indicating that they want Grace to move to Scotland, Emily writes back a quick refusal.When Ian comes to America on business and shows up at Emily's work, the battle lines are drawn. But Ian didn't know that Emily was a young woman and Emily didn't know that Ian could be such a charmer and so persuasive. As they spend time together sparks began to fly. But Ian and Emily both have serious wounds from their pasts. Can they work through these issues and find another chance at happiness?This a very well written book with a lot of well developed characters and in depth emotions. You'll laugh and cry as you follow Ian and Emily's journey to God and to healing, hope, and true love.*Thanks to Singing Librarian Books & the author for a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.

While set in both Oregon and Scotland, I was particularly drawn to the Scottish setting which gave me a longing to visit those rambling hills and sit at a table over shortbread and tea and listen to the brogue that Camille so aptly brings to the page.

There was not one character that didn't have a message to share, whether obvious or delicately woven around Ian and Emily's central story. Along with a heart-tugging romance and subtle humor, there was also a potent and life-affirming faith thread. Ian's faith journey was especially moving. You cannot finish this book without falling in love with the Godly man Ian becomes. I'm thrilled to have found this little gem and look forward to reading more from Camille Eide.Although I'm sorry that I didn't read this book sooner, at the same time I probably wouldn't have been encouraged to listen to the audio - and it was fantastic! Dialects, inflections, and character voice can make or break an audio listen. For me, there's no recovery from a poor audio even if I switch to solely reading. In addition to her own collection of authored books and unbeknownst to me, Becky Doughty is also an amazing narrator (and singer!) I usually only listen to audio when I can't physically be reading, but this was one of the rare instances where I just wanted to keep listening."}, {"userName": "Just Commonly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19895197-just-commonly", "userReview": "Who doesn't love a good love story? What about a seemingly love that's doomed from the start? With obstacles emotionally and literally that separates what love that could flourish between our two main characters, the least being that they live on two different countries on different continents, what else can go wrong? Apparently more than meets the eye. Don't fret, this is not one story that focuses on tragedy after tragedy to draw readers in. This is one sweet romantic story that taps your tender heart into a benevolent display of cherishing each day.Honestly, I was a tad bit put off my our main character, Ian. Right off the bat, his selfishness to \"get Maggie off his hands\" rubbed me the wrong way. Him being our main character surprised me as \"why would the author want me to dislike the main character?\" However, his attitude changed as the story progressed and both his and Emily's development in character and in faith redeemed all displeasure I felt for either of them.\"Dear God, I thought I was being strong, but maybe I've just been afraid. I haven't been listening to You or depending on You at all. I've been trying to take care of everything and everyone on my own. I haven't been trusting You.\" (Loc 6116)A story of family, faith, forgiveness, treasuring each day and the courage to love. This will have you moved to tears, resonated with sighs and maybe encouraged you to live each day to its fullest, undaunted and trust in Him.QUOTABLE QUOTES\"Faith believes God is good, not just when things are going your way, but in the midst of tragedy.\" (Loc 4154) \"I know how hard it can be to forgive those who hurt us. Remember looking at the ocean? I am amazed that the God who created all that power and beauty also cares about each of us. I don't know why He does. All I know is His love is immense and unfailing, and has the power to do the impossible. he loves each one of us, though we don't deserve it.\" (Loc 3014) \"...having family who loves you is a rare gift. Only a fool would waste it.\" (Loc 2444) \"It's easy to stand there and do your part when times are good and everyone's pleased with you. But it takes real courage to stand up and do the right thing when it will cost something. Like your pride.\" (Loc 6049) O, there are so more, but in the end, take courage, and live each day like there's no tomorrow.Thank you, Camille.
