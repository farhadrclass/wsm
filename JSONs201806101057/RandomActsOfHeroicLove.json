This book was one of them and the other was Dave Eggars' A Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius . I have lately concluded that this power is directly linked to titles which bellow \"over exaggerated human greatness and endeavour contained within!\" and thus confer upon me a sort of delusional wistfulness which confuses my girl brain and makes me be all soppy around the edges like a marshmallow held too close to the fire. So far both books have failed to deliver. I am not soppy round the edges, or weeping into my lo-cal hot chocolate while delving into a box of mansize tissues. This is therefore an epic fail because what else should I expect from something with a title like this?The story itself is nice but nice is just a polite way of saying meh, it was ok. Two men in parallel stories set in different historic periods are struggling on with their lives because they are motivated by love. Leo is struggling to get by after his girlfriend is killed in a bus crash while they're on holiday together. His historic counterpart is Moritz, a man who escaped a POW camp in coldest Siberia and sets out to walk thousands of miles back to Central Europe to see his heart girl, Lotte. Moritz has to make a physical journey while Leo is making a more spiritual journey to deal with his loss. Then there is a twist, although I say twist when what I mean is linear and somewhat predictable conjoining of the two stories. I say, \"Go Moritz - you hada long walk!\" and really I didn't give a monkey's chuff about Leo's story - sorry Leo but your stubby mits failed to tug at my heart strings.I would read this again but only if I was waiting in the Dentist's waiting room and this was the only thing available to read."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1941285-lucy", "userReview": "This book is about love, from a Male perspective. It is not about being with your loved one but rather about loving whilst apart and the trials/torments yet also joys and illuminations of that. Set in two different time frames and circumstances. One man tells of his being torn from the girl he loved when the War started in 1912 and his hope and determination to come home and to find her when he eventually breaks free from a POW camp and treks thousands of miles across Siberia and Europe. The other man, awoken in hosiptal in 1992 to discover his dearly loved girlfriend has died in a bus accident. It is about griefing love, holding onto love, needing love...love, love, love. The story of Moritz treking across Europe is fascinating, a little brutal at times. As other reviewers have said initially you are introduced to Leo and you just want to remain with him, not get into Moritzs story, however soon it is Moritzs tale that is compelling you to read on. Leos tale is so raw and touching because you are taken through his terrible discovery of loss with him...it made me cry, just try reading it and not imagining your own worse fears about your loved ones.My favourite thing about the book was the searching. Physics is used to discuss nature and the way we are drawn to each other. The story for me is a journey of discovery, about hope and faith and human connection, about the perspective in which we view the world.I highly recommend reading this book, it is a magnificent first novel by Scheinmann. The only thing i disagree with from the majority of reviewers is the 'twist' near the end. Thought that it was highly evident and logical from some way into the novel that the outcome would be such (difficult to talk specifically without spoiling it!)Would have preferred it if the book cover hadn't mentioned this 'twist' because then i would not have been anticipating it beforehand! But as i say, highly readable."}, {"userName": "Ashley Alphey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1263173-ashley-alphey", "userReview": "Two tales of love and loss set 75 years apart.

It focusses on two people affected by grief and their ways of coping. One story follows a young man, Leo, at the end of the nineties who has lost his girlfriend in a tragic accident, it explores his recovery over the following year. Unfortunately the characters in this part of the tale are unconvincing and underdeveloped - the perfect hospital orderly, the Greek consul in Equador, the friend Hannah, his father, his room-mate, the grief counsellor, the landlady and, worst of all, the quantum physicist who explains human emotions, love and grief in terms of colliding electrons (seriously). The relationship Leo had with his dead girlfriend was too perfect and unrealistic although I did feel for Leo's pain, but that was the only part of this storyline that held my attention.The second story line follows a soldier in the first world war who is taken to a POW camp in Siberia and embarks on a long journey back to Poland to find his childhood sweetheart - this seems to be based on the Author's Grandfather. It is by far the more gripping story, but the dying man's recounting of it to his 6 year old son is not very convincing.Inevitably, the two stories collide and connect, but the connection is very predictable - It is not the stunning climax promised.I found the book patronising - I get annoyed when novellists try to educate us - and I am afraid that is what happens here - from history in the first world war, the Russian revolution, quantum physics (the spiritual aspect thereof(?)), the mating habits of many species and so on.If you like Romantic fiction you will like this book. Personnally, I would still recommend you get it from the library or borrow it before you buy...."}, {"userName": "Araz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652200-araz", "userReview": "This is definitely one of the cannot-put-down type of books. From the moment I got it I couldn't stop reading it and I'm sure I'll keep going back to read it again. A couple of things I really liked about the book:- It has several pictures of animals showing affection towards each other i.e. polar bears hugging. - The story of his grandfather painted a picture to me that was different of WWI. Most of what I was taught about the war spoke about the western front and not so much about what was happening in the east. It was very interesting to read about a man's journey from Siberia back to what is now Poland and along the way experiencing the rise of the Bolsheviks. - The story telling is very vivid. Every emotion you can feel as if it is your own. What was especially interesting was that I could even feel the physical experience i.e. of someone being very sick, or frost-bitten, or scared. The emotions weren't just in the head and heart, but very much in the body and I found that quite unique to Danny's storytelling abilities.I highly encourage everyone to read it!

Moritz Daniecki is a Austro-Hungarian soldier who is captured as a Prisoner of War in the First World War and sentenced to prison. He breaks free and walks for years to reach his childhood love. Leo Dankin loses the love of his life in a bus accident and struggles hard to continue with his life without his sweetheart.The book starts with Leo waking up in a hospital room to realize his girlfriend Eleni\u2019s death in the bus crash while he survived. This incident in his life continues to haunt him and leaves a strong impact where Leo finds himself unable to continue with his life. He is constantly reminded of his girlfriend\u2019s memories and he finds himself blaming for her death. He escapes into a world of his own where he finds Eleni at every walk of life. He meets a physics lecturer, Roberto Panconesi, who tries to explain the connection between our feelings and the physics around. He suggests Leo keep a note of anything that catches his interest. These notes, a hand drawn sketch and a scribbled note underneath, form a very interesting part of the book. Here are some on the author\u2019s website.Moritz is head over heels in love with Lotte. He is forced to fight in the First World War and is captured bu Russians and is sent to a prisoner camp. He spends two years of his life in the filthy camp and escapes with the determination to meet Lotte and ask her hand in marriage. The journey back home is filled with the dread of being caught and the hope of meeting his love. He fights enemies and makes friends on the way. There are a few things in Moritz\u2019s journey which touched my heart. The one in which his comrade Frantz takes away others\u2019 blankets and shoes thinking they are dead, but Moritz discovers that one of his comrades is not dead after all. The conversation that follows is touching. Similarly, when enemies ask Moritz to kill a man to save his own life \u2013 the dilemma that goes on in Moritz\u2019s head makes one think about moral issues.Leo and Moritz are connected through an unknown strand and this is revealed to the reader only in the end. The book was a wonderful read until we get to this point. After this, I found it to be too melodramatic. The book had a great start with Leo\u2019s beautifully etched tragic incident and Moritz\u2019s crazy love for Lotte. I wish the author had handled the connection a bit more maturely and not let it become cheesy.The characters are so well formed and memorable. The vivacious Eleni, the eccentric Robert, the always brooding Leo, the epitome of hope Moritz \u2013 every character is well thought of and given enough meat to evoke deep emotions in the reader\u2019s heart. The language is beautiful and draws the reader in.I have labeled this book as semi-fiction (my own term) because it is based on the true story of Danny who lost his girlfriend in a bus crash and his grandfather Moshe, who was a prisoner of war. While the book\u2019s story is drawn from real life, there are some fictional parts too and hence the label of semi-fiction.The author\u2019s website says the book will be made into a movie soon. I am not too keen on watching movies adapted from books, but I am eager to watch this one. If not movie, I will definitely revisit the novel sometime later in my life.Even though the book lost its charm in the later chapters, I still had a great time reading this book. The initial part of the book was too good to be shadowed and let down by the latter part."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7800917-marina", "userReview": "This book was given to me as a present by a fellow bookcrosser two years ago, but I hesitated until now in reading it because I thought it would be oversentimental and ultimately not my cup of tea. As a rule, I don't really like love stories, although there's been exceptions. This is one of those.There's no denying this novel is oversentimental, but it is so in a good way. It is of course a love story, or rather, two love stories, so there's bound to be sentimentality in it. But it is also a story of war, because one of the two main characters, Moritz Daniecki, is a survivor of WWI, so he recounts his experiences in the war.This is a novel on love, or better on the loss thereof. Leo loses his girlfriend in a terrible coach crash, while Moritz loses his sweetheart when he's forced to go to war. There's a lot of absences in this novel. That's what makes it so tear-jerking. (There's no denying it is tear-jerking. I weeped my heart out while reading.)I can definitely recommend this novel.If you want to know more and you can read Italian, please visit my blog for a full review: https://sonnenbarke.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8315623-rachel", "userReview": "Didn't get past page 29, not for me."}, {"userName": "S\u00edlvia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25218693-s-lvia", "userReview": "Senti-me imediatamente absorvida pela narrativa.

In 1992, Leo Deakin loses his girlfriend in a bus accident in South America and struggles to get over her death, wondering how he could ever possibly move on. He sees Eleni in everything he does, yet her continued presence in his life causes him to fall into a spiral of depression. Meanwhile, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire on the outbreak of WWI, Moritz Daniecki leaves his beloved Lotte to fight the Russians. He ends up captured and placed in a Siberian POW camp, and it will take him years to trek back to Lotte after he escapes. The memory of her brief kiss keeps him going through the cold winter and the harsh life of Revolution-era Russia, but will she still be waiting for him when he makes it back to their village? And what is the link between Leo and Moritz's tales of enduring love?I've had my eye on this book for a while but I never got around to reading it until I was lent a copy. I really enjoyed reading about the \"other side\" of WWI. While everyone knows about what went on in Britain, the USA, Germany and even France, Russia and other Eastern European countries often get forgotten. Moritz's story was tough and truly heartbreaking, as he devoted himself to travelling across Russia despite not knowing whether Lotte would wait for him. The descriptions of the state of the Austro-Hungarian army and the POW camp were rather horrific, and not for the faint-hearted! There were some scenes that made me feel a bit sick, but you truly understand what the soldiers experienced. Even those who have never studied this period in history will be able to appreciate this book as it gives you a flavour of the Eastern front of WWI without expecting any prior knowledge. I also loved the way that Moritz's story was told, in his death-bed speech to his oldest son during WWII. I could almost hear his voice as I read the story.Leo's story, on the other hand, was told in third-person and I felt rather detached from it. While I was intrigued with the premise - a man waking up in a hospital in South America and having no idea how he got there - the mystery of his accident and Eleni's death was solved very quickly, and I found it difficult to connect with him. I sympathised with his plight at having lost his love, but the way that he dealt with it didn't sit well with me. Despite claiming that he was mourning Eleni, he got involved with a couple of women who he didn't care about and it made me feel rather uncomfortable. I explained the situation to my fiancee and even he thought it made Leo an unlikable character. Leo also makes friends with Roberto, a physics lecturer, and makes connections between physics and love. These were kind of interesting, but didn't mean a lot to an Arts student like myself! I was happy with the conclusion to Leo's story and I warmed up to him a lot more in the last few chapters, but overall he was difficult to connect with.This novel is worth reading just for Moritz's story - it truly is a tale of heroic love. Leo's is heartbreaking in its own way, even if I didn't always agree with his actions. Don't read this if you're feeling sad, as the plight of Mortiz and Leo will probably just make you feel worse! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dual-time narratives (I suspected the connection early on but it's still worth reading to uncover it!), unusual tales of love or historical fiction. And it's completely possible to read this without knowing anything about WWI, the Russian Revolution, South America or physics! I would caution that some of the war details are a bit graphic, and cursing and crude references to sex are made at several points throughout the novel. 7/10"}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18181601-richard", "userReview": "Random Acts of Heroic Love is in the top 10 books I have ever read.

Or at least they used to. Since switching to a digital channel last fall, the British talk show hosts have seen their viewership ratings plummet from more than 2 million to just 12,000. Richard and Judy's sudden invisibility could have a negative effect on publishing because for the past four years this shiny married couple has moved more books that any other force in England. Last summer, the (London) Sunday Times estimated that the R&J Book Club accounted for 26 percent of the sales of the top 100 books in the UK.I've just finished reading two of their recommended titles -- recently released in the United States -- and I'm not convinced that the demise of the R&J Book Club would be an altogether bad development for the British reading public. Toni Jordan's Addition, reviewed in this space last week, is a slickly witty romance about obsessive compulsive disorder that concludes with a trite celebration of mental illness. And now comes Danny Scheinmann's muddled Random Acts of Heroic Love, which, with Richard and Judy's imprimatur, has sold 200,000 copies in England.The title of Random Acts of Heroic Love is a fair indication of its overwrought content as it moves back and forth between two doomed love stories. The first one opens in 1992, when a grad student named Leo Deakin wakes up in an Ecuadorian hospital and discovers that he has survived a bus accident that killed his girlfriend, Eleni. He's uncontrollably distraught at her loss, and for the next few hundred pages we follow his descent into a fit of sorrow that all but immobilizes him -- and the novel.Grief is hard to endure, maybe even harder to read about. It's static and repetitive and (sorry) dull for outsiders. Elizabeth Strout's Abide With Me is the best novel about grief that I've read recently, and of course Joan Didion's memoir, A Year of Magical Thinking, conveys the gripping intensity of staring into the abyss. But Scheinmann's hero lacks the emotional depth of Didion or of Strout's protagonist. Instead, Leo grieves in the way a young man would: in a long, mawkish wail of self-pity tinged with guilt and New Age goo: \"They clung on to each other across the frontier of death, magically transcending all that is intangible, invisible, unknown.\" For all its ardor, that sentence can't endure even a moment's serious consideration. And there are so many more sentences like it: At Eleni's gravesite, Leo thinks, \"Their adventure had separated them, but she was still ploughing on, travelling through the hidden world, deeper than he could go, a forester into the unknown. Now they were like the sea and the moon, far apart but still in harmony. When his life was done their time would come again and when it did there would be no more hurdles between them, they would dance as one for ever. What is life but a holiday sandwiched by eternity?\" Don't answer that.Leo grows more tiresome when he gets back home to England and mopes around, trying to restart his graduate research on ants. \"Hovering in a void,\" facing \"an eternity of emptiness,\" he's drawn to the spacey ideas of a charismatic physics professor who pronounces diluted principles of quantum mechanics like a series of self-help affirmations: \"You are literally made of stardust,\" the professor tells his students. \"If you see yourself as a vital part of a holistic universe then any battle is ultimately against yourself. . . . We are each a small piece of infinity and in some form or other we will live for eternity.\"Sprinkled throughout the book are pages from Leo's diary, containing his reflections on eternal love, lost and found, the kind of private gems you would rather die than have anyone else read, e.g.: \"I love you my sweety,/From your head to your feety,/From here to Haiti.\" Fortunately, he also includes a number of photographs of animals mating, which at least provides the novel with a little authentic passion.Far better is the other, older story that repeatedly interrupts Leo's but, alas, never overtakes it. On his deathbed in 1938 a Polish Jew named Moritz Daniecki describes the epic journey he took during World War I. Soon after falling in love with Lotte, a wealthy girl in his town, Moritz was drafted and dispatched to fight the Russians, who quickly captured him and sent him to Siberia. That's just the start of a five-year ordeal that involved shockingly bloody battles and walking thousands of miles, frequently alone, usually sick, always cold and hungry, as Moritz was buffeted about by the map-changing conflicts of world war and then the Russian revolution. Only his love for Lotte kept him alive during this harrowing adventure, but through it all he didn't even know if she had survived or remembered him. The brutality he endured makes Leo's whininess seem all the more tedious by comparison.In the last pages of the novel, a deus ex machina finally announces the connection between these two love stories and spells out the moral for us, but sadly the journey is not worth the destination. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Joanne Dendle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70717036-joanne-dendle", "userReview": "A beautifully cinematic novel.
