It's an either you love it or you hate it type of book. Unfiltered review... https://wp.me/p7ZSCH-4cd 5 Minute Book Review Podcast... https://wp.me/p7ZSCH-4cjSol\u00e8ne is beautiful, smart, and sexy. She is also 39 years old and someone most 20 year old pop stars are quick to look past. Except for Hayes, a sexy British boy band member who finds himself gravitating to Sol\u00e8ne.They say opposites attract and if we are going by age differences here Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes are complete opposites. Plus, Sol\u00e8ne has a 12 year old daughter who happens to believe she is in love with Hayes herself, as many other young girls around the world.So, what\u2019s a woman to do when she finds herself in that situation? Of course. . . sleep with him \u2013 too bad that decision was going to change to course of their lives that no one could have predicted. The real question here was, how much would that decision affect those they loved as well?\n\n\u201cYou afraid?\u201d He asked.I nodded.\u201cSo am I. But I\u2019m all right with that. If I get hurt, I get hurt. It happens, right? Someone always gets hurt. But I don\u2019t want to miss out on us because I was afraid.\u201d \u2013 Hayes\n\nI can\u2019t remember the last book I read that made me want to find a way for two people to be together when the odds were stacked against them so much. The author does such an amazing job of creating the world of Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes. I honestly felt like I was there with them as they traveled throughout the world getting lost in themselves together \u2013 or at the idea of each other.But sometimes age isn\u2019t just a number, sometimes it\u2019s just a life fact. That same life fact caused a lot of hurt and turmoil for the ones around Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes. . . and each other. At times, The Idea Of You was so painful to read. I shed real tears.\n\n\u201cHow did we get here? This was only supposed to be lunch, remember? This was only ever supposed to be lunch.\u201d\u201cYou,\u201d he said, his voice frayed, foreign.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYou. You let me unfold you.\u201d \u2013 Sol\u00e8ne/Hayes\"\n\nAt some point, this story stopped being cliche or taboo and became a pure love story. The author takes us on the same path as Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes as though we were living it right along with them. Their love, their passion, their pain, their heartbreak becomes the readers same love, passion, pain, and heartbreak. This story goes far beyond the stigma of age, it\u2019s a true and pure love story. It just happens to be a love story of an older woman and younger man. When an older man becomes involved with a younger woman, it\u2019s accepted. When an older woman becomes involved with a younger man, it\u2019s frowned upon.Do I recommend this book? Yes, I do. Just know that this book isn't for everyone. You have to go into it with an open mind.Will I read another book by this author? Yes. If she decides to make this one into a duet, I will scream will joy.Follow all things messy. . .\n \n \n \nSubscribe to Pretty Mess Reading Podcast: Where Romance Gets Messy"}, {"userName": "Patty Belongs To Kellan~Jesse~Lautner~Miller~Jack~Racer~Rafe~Liam~Prince Nicholas~Hayes~Simon~Gianluca & Archer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302918-patty-belongs-to-kellan-jesse-lautner-miller-jack-racer-rafe-liam-prince", "userReview": "*****FIVE+++++++++ STARS*****{Book Gifted to me by my Bestie Boo}He leaned into me then, his mouth near my ear, his breath hot on my neck. The thought occurred that I would miss this when he moved on. When he was with someone ten years my junior, and I was somewhere invisible. I was going to miss his hands. This.\nI had seen this book starting to generate a buzz on Goodreads and I have to say that my interest was piqued as I\u2019m always in search of a good romance between an older woman and younger man. I want to say a huge THANK YOU to my Bestie Boo for gifting this book and urging me to drop everything and read it. She was right! This book was captivating! The romance was breathtaking and oh so very heartbreaking. I know this story is going to haunt me for quite some time. It felt so real! For just a little while it was wonderful to live in the world of these two beautiful characters whose love for each other was beyond magical.Sol\u00e9ne Marchand is a single mother of a beautiful thirteen-year-old girl. At nearly forty, her life is pretty fulfilling and rewarding. She owns a successful art gallery with her best friend. It brings her great joy but it is one of the reasons why her marriage ended a few years back. Her husband was not supportive of her need to have a career. Her love life has been non-existent since her divorce but that's all about to change drastically when she ends up chaperoning her daughter and a few of her friends to an \u201cAugust Moon\u201d concert in Las Vegas. The girls all had backstage passes and during a meet and greet Sol\u00e9ne comes face to face with the extremely beautiful lead singer, Hayes Campbell. Sparks fly right from the start between them. Sol\u00e9ne is just a little thrown off kilter when she learns he\u2019s twenty\u2014nearly half her age! \nThe two manage to find time here and there when Hayes is able to be in Los Angeles during breaks in their world tour. Hayes and Sol\u00e9ne have an undeniably intense chemistry but neither of them could have anticipated that what was building between them was like nothing else they had ever experienced before. Their passion for each other was bordering on obsession and out of that came a love that was so overwhelming and ultimately they were consumed by it.They travel to some of the most beautiful and romantic destinations across the world during August Moon\u2019s tour and while they\u2019re able to spend some stolen moments enjoying each other\u2019s bodies and getting lost in their passionate affair, things are far from perfect. Sol\u00e9ne is constantly reminded of their age difference and having to deal with many obsessed fans, and also the horrible backlash via social media. She\u2019s also been keeping her relationship with Haye\u2019s a secret from her daughter because her little girl has quite the teenaged crush on Hayes.While Sol\u00e9ne has been keeping in the back of her mind the knowledge that their time together will ultimately come to an end, Hayes has been falling just as hopelessly in love with her as she has been with him. He sees Sol\u00e9ne as his FOREVER. At times I felt that he was so much wiser than his years and then on other occasions, he was very much a young boy with a romanticized view of life.This story was incredible and I enjoyed the hours I spent getting swept away by this captivating romance. I wished for rainbows and unicorns. I was left in tears. The author did an outstanding job with this book. I love it when a book can make me feel so intensely and I know in my heart that this is one I will read time and time again.\nEXQUISITE! I will always love Hayes but I will also always admire Sol\u00e9ne for her extraordinary strength of character and selflessness. I HIGHLY recommend this one!"}, {"userName": "\u2730 Bianca \u2730 BJ's Book Blog \u2730 ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3243151-bianca-bj-s-book-blog", "userReview": "[ The end. Yeah. We do not get a happily ever after for Hayes and Sol\u00e8ne. Nope. I cried sooo hard while reading - especially the end! I so wanted them to work out. I think the message about the book was that you should not be sexist, racist nor ageist. But then Robinne goes and sends Hayes off into the world to live the life of a young guy. Which I totally understand, but I sooo wanted it to be different. With a little baby Hayes and a wedding and Hayes driving his step-daughter to school. But I can still keep on hoping that Robinne will write another book for them! An epilogue novella! I also think that the book could've been made into a 2-book thing. There was so much in here that was only touched briefly, and with two books this could've been a huge thing. Maybe even three books!! And maybe we could've made Hayes 23 and Sol\u00e8ne 34 and bam - not as bad anymore! Yes, I will keep on dreaming that there will be such a trilogy one day.Another tiny little thing that bothered me a bit. Those 'serious' parts that were talked about a lot - about how women stop being seen once they're over 40 and all the artists of color stuff in the gallery. I know that it's a huge thing, especially in America, but it was a tiny little bit too preachy for such an amazing romance. But that's the only thing I didn't love-love. Oh, yeah - and the end! \u263a But I still loooooved the book. I totally understand the end. Sol\u00e8ne didn't want to keep on hurting her daughter and she didn't want to burden Hayes with an old wife. But I'm still heartbroken over it - even days later!

She being a 39 year-old mother who happened to be French-American, who also owned a successful art gallery who fell helplessly in love with a 20 year old pop star. You know what? It was all just too much.

I'm usually never eager to pick up a book with an older heroine but something about this called to me and I couldn't stay away. I loved the emotions that this book brought out in me. A woman nearing her 40's and a Rockstar half her age? You can only imagine the skeptics that were there and ready to criticize them. But I loved how they handled it and the strength that they showed with their relationship. I really liked reading about both of these characters, no matter their ages, and I'm glad I didn't let the age-gap stop me from picking this one up. My 3 Star rating comes from the ending and I just wasn't satisfied with it so it made my rating go down some. I wish I could have rated it higher since I liked these characters so much, but the overall happy feeling of the book lessened at the end.

Because it tells a story so compelling, so thought provoking, so emotional and so exquisitely written that you are left reeling. For DAYS after you've finished. 'The Idea of You' by Robinne Lee is one of those books.To say I was blown away by EVERYTHING about this story would be an understatement. It checked off every single box I need for a book to be an exceptional read. Angst. Humor. Amazing dialogue. Unique subject matter. Pop culture. Love story. Depth. Amazing leads and phenomenal supporting cast. But most of all, it brought on the feels. So many feels. I don't think I've even been this anxious reading a book ... ever. And I say this in the most flattering way possible. The story kept me on the edge of my seat till the very last page. A roller-coaster of emotions only added to an already amazing reading experience. This is one of those stories that offers so much food for thought that one can't simply review it and move on. Or maybe it's just me. I finished this days ago and I am still thinking about. Thinking about how, in this day and age, the doubles standards are alive and well. Thinking about how people will always have an opinion and how everyone is always so quick to judge you without having walked a mile in your shoes. Thinking about how much we, mothers, sacrifice for our kids. I think it's safe to say I won't be getting over this read any time soon. It's just one of those stories that makes it's way into your heart and stays there. Permanently. Whether you like it or not. I urge everyone, especially everyone in their late 30s and on, to read this book with an open mind. If nothing else, you'll enjoy the scenery. And in conclusion I want to say that, even though it's only July, 'The Idea of You' is my pick for BOOK OF THE YEAR 2017. That's all.Till next time ..."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "The audio version of this book was great.

A tumultuous rock star romance, with an age gap is exactly the type of read we devour and wow! We were completely floored by this story; easily becoming swept up in its honesty and raw emotion and by the striking prose of first time author, Robinne Lee. It\u2019s hard to believe this is her first published novel, because Robinne Lee, delivered it all in The Idea of You. We swooned, we laughed, loved and oh boy did we cry! We felt everything and found Solene and Hayes story to be captivating, incredibly heartfelt, moving, candid, unique and sincere. This author writes with a knowledgeable and beautiful prose that encapsulated everything we love, but rarely find in this trope. Impressive to say the least.\n\u201cYou. Are fucking everything to me, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\nThe synopsis tells you all you need to know to decide if this books piques your interest, but we promise you, what you\u2019ll find between the pages is so much more than a rock star meets girl story. So much more and we feel the best way to experience it is spoiler free. We urge you to simply allow Hayes and Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s love story to unravel before your eyes and experience the truthfulness and emotion as the story slowly builds, holding you captive until the very last page, as Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes\u2019 love story climbs to its crescendo.\u2018The thought crossed my mind that this could be dangerous. Not the ill-advised sex with the just out of his teens pop star, but the cuddling. The lying there, drinking in his scent, watching his chest rise and fall, allowing myself to bask in my own happiness. I could fall in love this way.\u2019Their initial attraction is physical, a chemistry that ignites when they meet backstage after an August Moon concert, Sol\u00e8ne attended with her daughter and 2 of her friends. We did, at first, wonder what so enamoured the sweet, wise beyond his years, Hayes to pursue the somewhat aloof Sol\u00e8ne so vigorously, but we trusted the author to slowly reveal all. Of course, Sol\u00e8ne oozed beauty, poise and confidence, but what did Hayes see behind Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s facade that made him so desperate to woo her? Despite the obvious physical connection, we knew there was more, and as we delved deeper into Hayes persona, it all became clear. Hayes\u2019 emotional maturity belied his cheekiness and his 20 years. Hayes was an old soul and this young man matched Sol\u00e8ne emotionally, intellectually and physically. Their building relationship was a thing of beauty setting the foundation of friendship to lovers and beyond. It was quite simply, breathtaking, passionate and heartfelt.\n\u201cHow did we get here? This was only supposed to be lunch, remember? This was only supposed to be lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d\n he said, his voice frayed, foreign.\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. You let me unfold you.\u201d\nWhilst we may not have completely warmed to Sol\u00e8ne, we absolutely related to her feelings, and the way in which Robinne Lee identified this character; her struggles, her insecurities, her torment, her sacrifices and the vilification she received because of the age difference between her and Hayes, was exceptional. We understood it all completely and perceived the reason we found her to be aloof was her upbringing and the fact that Hayes was such a beautiful, warm, sensitive and honest character who wore his heart on his sleeve. He was something else, this man!\n\u201cThis is insane. You realize that, right?\u201d \u201cOnly if someone gets hurt.\u201d\u201cSomeone always gets hurt, Hayes.\u201d\nAs the story drew to a close, we reflected on what we\u2019d read wanting to give this author a standing ovation for many reasons. For delivering believable characters, for not succumbing to standard story clich\u00e9s, for having the ingenuity to deliver this story honestly, warts and all. We really couldn\u2019t have asked for more. The banter between Hayes and Sol\u00e8ne was witty, naughty and sincere making us grin from ear to ear. The passion was explosive, sensual, hot and thankfully not always over descriptive yet always moving, passionate and sexy as hell; not once did we feel inclined skim the intimate scenes as we\u2019ve found ourselves doing recently. And the emotion\u2026oh God the emotion, well, tears fell freely that\u2019s for sure. At times uplifting, painful and certainly worth every tear.

It was far from it, instead it was a genuine, raw and honest look at a \u201ctaboo\u201d relationship that explored some really cool themes and smashed some well known stereotypes, especially ones towards women. I liked the structure of this, it was divided into sections based on where Hayes and Solene were traveling at the time and they visited some really amazing and exotic locales as he toured with his band and she raced off to meet him whenever she could. This definitely isn\u2019t a typical romance novel, besides the obvious age difference between the two leads, there was more intelligence and sophistication here, both in the authors writing style and in the characters themselves. Both Solene and Hayes were complicated characters individually and their relationship itself was complex as well. She\u2019s a divorced mother to a teenaged girl and when the media gets wind of their romance, their lives are effected in a deep and profound way. Hayes was a really mature guy for a twenty year old and there was much more substance to him than I was expecting there to be. I can totally see why Solene was charmed by him! This was definitely an alluring and risqu\u00e9 read, there are some steamy and passionate love scenes and Hayes and Solene\u2019s chemistry was smoking hot. Watching her transformation throughout the book was a beautiful thing to witness, when it starts she\u2019s a strong, independent business woman, but she\u2019s lost a vital piece of herself along the way. By the end, she had embraced her sexuality as a middle aged woman and found a new type of self confidence she was lacking before. Lee also explored some common stereotypes that most women face at some point in their lives and she really focused on the age old double standard where older men date much younger women and no one bats an eye while an older woman dating a younger man is frowned upon and judged harshly. This was one of those books that just begs to be made into a movie, I can only imagine that it would be stunning! The ending was really bittersweet and emotional and I\u2019m not sure whether I loved it or hated it to be completely honest. But the book itself was great and I\u2019m extremely impressed this is Lee\u2019s debut, I think she has a juicy, sexy hit on her hands."}, {"userName": "Dee Montoya", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11880024-dee-montoya", "userReview": "FIVE PERFECT STARS*****There's so many great things I could say about this book, and I will, believe me. But I'm going to start with;  SPEND THE $9.99 AND BUY THIS BOOK. TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY! In fact I think it should cost more, is that good. This book is the sexy fantasy all of us women dream about. And with the help of this author's poignant writing style you will be the protagonist of this story. You will forget that you are reading, you will be part of the romance, the passion and the heartbreak, you will become Sol\u00e8ne. \nSol\u00e8ne Merchant is a thirty nine year old divorced woman, she has a twelve year old daughter, and owns an art gallery with her best friend. She married young, and being a wife and a mother as much as she loved her family, stripped her of her own identity. Ever since the divorce happened she's being looking to find herself again. She loves her job, her home and her life but she has a hard time putting her own needs first. Her daughter had concert tickets to go see the successful boy band all girls were crazy about and Sol\u00e8ne got roped into taking her and her friends. They also had meet and greet tickets so they could meet the dreamy members of this band. All the boys were very cute and charming but there was one that stood up from the others, Hayes Campbell. After meeting them, Hayes offered them back-stage passes, where he proceeded to let his interest in Sol\u00e8ne very obvious. Weeks later he called her at work to invite her to lunch. She was hesitant because even though she wasn't amune to this guy's charm, she couldn't possibly even fathom that she could be attracted to a twenty year old. But it is just lunch, he offered, and that is how this passionate and forbidden affair started. It was supposed to be, just lunch. Sol\u00e8ne had always been responsible and sensible to other peoples feelings, but this time around she wanted to bask in the passion this man was offering. She felt alive, she felt sexy and beautiful in the arms of this boy who could offer her everything except a future. This story had the most beautiful settings, and amazing characters. The words so vivid, made me truly believe I was inside the story. The passion and the angst made me me feel euphoric, and I couldn't get enough.

Two days later and I'm still mad about it!Hayes is in a boy band called August Moon and he meets Sol\u00e8ne when she brings her daughter to see his concert. It's not hard to tell he wants her but I really loved how much he had to pursue her. Hayes is super yummy even though he came across as Harry Styles (which I'm not a huge fan). He was just so sweet, romantic and wise beyond his years. And such a great match for Sol\u00e8ne. It was interesting to see how they maneuvered each other in their complicated lives not to mention their almost twenty year age difference. I did think the story got bogged down with all the name and brand dropping. It was just too much and I really don't care whose dress or shoes she was wearing. And since she's an artist/art dealer, we get inundated with all the artist's names as well. The book kept me on my toes hoping and wishing things would work out for these two. I seriously could not put the book down and I was heartbroken at the end...not just with that ending but with Hayes' reactions. Sooo sad. The only saving grace...and what kept this book at a much higher star rating than I would have given it...is that I heard the author is considering a second book.

I love taboo books and an older woman/mother dating her daughter\u2019s beloved pop star crush was just right up my alley. You know when it should be wrong... because the age difference in this book was big\u2014but how could it be wrong, when for me, everything about them felt so damn right! The Idea of You is sexy and sinful yet fun and completely romantic. It was nothing that I expected it to be. At 20 years old, Hayes is wise for his years...he is relentless in his pursuit but not only that... his maturity, his knowing what he wants, his passion, his swagger, and ultimately his love and his heart stole my heart big time. \u201cI\u2019m a person. First and foremost. And I have feelings. And I know this career comes with a lot of baggage, but don\u2019t write me off just because I\u2019m in a fucking band. It\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s not who I am. It doesn\u2019t\u2014what is it you say?\u2014it doesn\u2019t define me.\u201dSolene is a good mother and at 39 years old and divorced, it\u2019s her turn to find love and to not be alone. She is a good person, friend, and businesswoman. She is fiercely strong, and independent and everything she does are for those around her. Who could really blame her for going for it all when Hayes\u2019 attention was all on her and it just felt so real...because it really was real and true... in my eyes, it was EVERYTHING <3 Watching their life together unfold was simply magical. I was addicted to them, their every interaction and every word. I just could not stop reading. This book was just so damn sexy.Of course there were moments of poor torture\u2014coming upon the age of 40 myself, I understood Solene's life\u2014the insecurities, the difference in their age, watching how social media wrecked havoc on Solene's life and how their love was made to be so ugly by the public eye was so painful to watch.The ending crushed me... I had tears in my eyes from all the pain and agony. I guess I had hoped it would end a different way though Solene did the right thing\u2014always the selfless thing... it still broke my heart nonetheless. As I closed the book, I realized how I wasn't ready to let go... I fell in complete and utter love with these characters.Robinne Lee wrote a well written book that romance readers will simply love. Beyond that she wrote a book showcasing how double standards and biases still exist and this book will really make readers think. I am in complete awe that this is a debut novel... I can not say enough good things about this book.So I borrowed this book from the library because this was a new-to-me author and I wasn\u2019t sure that I would like the book. It ended up being the complete opposite. I now plan on buying it today because this is a must read re-read. I read though again to see the things that I may have missed and because quite honestly, I want more time with them.Though this is January and very early on in the year, I feel like this will be a top read of 2018 for me... simply put\u2014this book was just WOW! Unforgettable! SO FREAKIN ADDICTING!!! SO GOOD that I am not sure how I can even move on...

I\u2019m a rock star. We don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a boy band member.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I guess all bets are off then.\u201d\nRock stars \u2013 we can\u2019t help but fall in love with them, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a man as soulful and beautiful as Hayes Campbell, the twenty year old singer with boy band, August Moon as he falls for 39 year old divorcee, and mother of a 12 year old daughter, Sol\u00e8ne Marchand.\n\u201cWhat is it you want from me, then?\u201d \nSol\u00e8ne\n\u201cEverything.\u201d\n HayesAs soon as this book hit our radar, we knew we had to read it! A tumultuous rock star romance, with an age gap is exactly the type of read we devour and wow! We were completely floored by this story; easily becoming swept up in its honesty and raw emotion and by the striking prose of first time author, Robinne Lee. It\u2019s hard to believe this is her first published novel, because Robinne Lee, delivered it all in The Idea of You. We swooned, we laughed, loved and oh boy did we cry! We felt everything and found Solene and Hayes story to be captivating, incredibly heartfelt, moving, candid, unique and sincere. This author writes with a knowledgeable and beautiful prose that encapsulated everything we love, but rarely find in this trope. Impressive to say the least.\n\u201cYou. Are fucking everything to me, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\nThe synopsis tells you all you need to know to decide if this books piques your interest, but we promise you, what you\u2019ll find between the pages is so much more than a rock star meets girl story. So much more and we feel the best way to experience it is spoiler free. We urge you to simply allow Hayes and Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s love story to unravel before your eyes and experience the truthfulness and emotion as the story slowly builds, holding you captive until the very last page, as Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes\u2019 love story climbs to its crescendo.\u2018The thought crossed my mind that this could be dangerous. Not the ill-advised sex with the just out of his teens pop star, but the cuddling. The lying there, drinking in his scent, watching his chest rise and fall, allowing myself to bask in my own happiness. I could fall in love this way.\u2019Their initial attraction is physical, a chemistry that ignites when they meet backstage after an August Moon concert, Sol\u00e8ne attended with her daughter and 2 of her friends. We did, at first, wonder what so enamoured the sweet, wise beyond his years, Hayes to pursue the somewhat aloof Sol\u00e8ne so vigorously, but we trusted the author to slowly reveal all. Of course, Sol\u00e8ne oozed beauty, poise and confidence, but what did Hayes see behind Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s facade that made him so desperate to woo her? Despite the obvious physical connection, we knew there was more, and as we delved deeper into Hayes persona, it all became clear. Hayes\u2019 emotional maturity belied his cheekiness and his 20 years. Hayes was an old soul and this young man matched Sol\u00e8ne emotionally, intellectually and physically. Their building relationship was a thing of beauty setting the foundation of friendship to lovers and beyond. It was quite simply, breathtaking, passionate and heartfelt.\n\u201cHow did we get here? This was only supposed to be lunch, remember? This was only supposed to be lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d\n he said, his voice frayed, foreign.\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. You let me unfold you.\u201d\nWhilst we may not have completely warmed to Sol\u00e8ne, we absolutely related to her feelings, and the way in which Robinne Lee identified this character; her struggles, her insecurities, her torment, her sacrifices and the vilification she received because of the age difference between her and Hayes, was exceptional. We understood it all completely and perceived the reason we found her to be aloof was her upbringing and the fact that Hayes was such a beautiful, warm, sensitive and honest character who wore his heart on his sleeve. He was something else, this man!\u2018There had probably been many before me, and there would be many after, but in that moment, it was just me.\u2019Hayes Campbell, where do we begin to express our feelings about him? Hayes is up there as one of the most arresting, charming, engaging, sweet and genuine characters we\u2019ve read. This man had us sobbing buckets! Oh and our (and we think the authors) muse, Harry Styles, certainly helped as well!\n\u201cLook at me. Look at me. It\u2019s just us. It\u2019s just you and me in this relationship. Fuck everything else.\u201d\nRobinne Lee nailed this story in every way. The emotion of both characters was spot on, the rock star feel we crave in these themes was paramount, but delivered so uniquely as this author put her own stamp, her knowledge and her awe inspiring talent on this trope. Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes were two opposites, leading two completely different lifestyles who just seemed to fit but time would tell if Sol\u00e8ne could live in Hayes\u2019 chaotic world.\n\u201cThis is insane. You realize that, right?\u201d \u201cOnly if someone gets hurt.\u201d\u201cSomeone always gets hurt, Hayes.\u201d\nAs the story drew to a close, we reflected on what we\u2019d read wanting to give this author a standing ovation for many reasons. For delivering believable characters, for not succumbing to standard story clich\u00e9s, for having the ingenuity to deliver this story honestly, warts and all. We really couldn\u2019t have asked for more. The banter between Hayes and Sol\u00e8ne was witty, naughty and sincere making us grin from ear to ear. The passion was explosive, sensual, hot and thankfully not always over descriptive yet always moving, passionate and sexy as hell; not once did we feel inclined skim the intimate scenes as we\u2019ve found ourselves doing recently. And the emotion\u2026oh God the emotion, well, tears fell freely that\u2019s for sure. At times uplifting, painful and certainly worth every tear.\n\u201cYou want to be kissed, Solene? You think you can handle that?\u201d\nSo\u2026standing ovation to you, Robinne Lee! Bravo! Thank you for your bravery in delivering this story your way and for giving us a backstage pass and an almost voyeuristic look into the world of the rich and famous with Hayes, Sol\u00e8ne and the other four cheeky lads of August Moon; Rory, Oliver, Simon and Liam. We were drawn into a life we can only fantasise about, the reality of which is a far cry from the romantic notion we dream up. We\u2019re not sure if you plan to write more about the band but we\u2019re not opposed to begging you to do so. One things for sure, we would love more! \u2018He was such a vision of virility, it almost felt dirty to watch.\u2019THE IDEA OF YOU is available to purchase below:Amazon USAmazon UKCome visit and follow us at:\u2732 TotallybookedBlog\u2732 TB on Facebook\u2732 TB on Twitter\u2732 TB on Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9501896-jen", "userReview": "Top read of 2017.

But when it descended upon you, there was no controlling it.\u201d\n\nDamn, Robinne Lee absolutely killed me with The Idea of You. This trope is hard to come by and when they do come along they are very hit or miss, older woman and younger man\u2026the trope that romance novels are made of. Seriously though, I adored this authors writing style, her thought provoking prose never failed to pull at every heart string and evoke every single, possible emotion I possess. Robinne Lee delivers a story that was honest, her characters were believable and she didn\u2019t tread the clich\u00e9 board, no, Robinne Lee made this trope her own and delivered a story that certainly left its mark and will be one I read time and time again. These characters have stayed with me, my notes have haunted me and it is only now I feel able to try and put together a review that will do this book justice. This review is spoiler free and that is how you need to go into this book, read it as the author intended, experience all those firsts for yourself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not too young,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\n\nSol\u00e8ne Marchand is a thirty-nine-year-old divorcee and mum to a twelve-year-old daughter. Sol\u00e8ne owns an art gallery with her best friend and is successful and extremely knowledgeable in her field. Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s ex-husband has moved on, whereas Sol\u00e8ne has not. While Sol\u00e8ne was hard to warm up to in the first instance I could appreciate all her fears and insecurities. Robinne Lee did an amazing job in portraying Sol\u00e8ne, before and during her time with Hayes.\n\n\u201cThere had probably been many before me, and there would be many after, but in that moment, it was just me. And for whatever reason I was plucked from the sea of nameless, faceless women who would have willingly shared Hayes Campbell\u2019s bed, and brought to this place, to this precise instant, to engage in this act.\u201d\n\nHayes Campbell was a twenty-year-old pop sensation in the biggest teen band to hit the current charts. Every girl had their poster on her walls, every teen loved him and his band mates and their songs were on every radio station, you had to live under a rock to have never heard of Hayes Campbell. While Hayes was only twenty, he was an old soul, wise and mature beyond his years with a penchant for dating older women. Hayes was not a one-night stand kind of guy, he was full of the deep and meaningfuls that bled into his music as well as his love life. Hayes was the lovable idol on the stage but behind the scenes was an extremely intelligent, sensitive, quiet, reflective man with a huge heart. There was nothing I disliked about him, he was simply adorable and he made and stole this book for me.\n\n\u201cYou afraid?\u201d he asked. I nodded.\u201cSo am I. But I\u2019m all right with that. If I get hurt, I get hurt. It happens, right? Someone always gets hurt. But I don\u2019t want to miss out on us because I was afraid.\u201d\n\nThe age gap in this book is huge, however, it was believable and that was all I could ask of the author. On the outside, it seemed inconceivable but the way that Robinne Lee revealed these characters, peeling back the layers one by one you suddenly understand, you believe and most of all you love and you want these two to survive, to come out the other side as one, but the hurdles are many and some are extremely high and seemingly insurmountable.\n\n\u201cYou are like the poster woman for reclaiming one\u2019s sexuality.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with fame and fortune is that it comes with a public following and Robinne Lee demonstrated with honesty the pitfalls when living in the public eye. The paparazzi, the media, the fans all have voices, many a keyboard warrior who spite with barbs without a single thought to the reader and the person that they are attacking. To them it is just words, to Sol\u00e8ne it was her life, her reputation and that of her daughter. This was brutal, but it was this brutality that hooks the reader and invests them in the centre of this tumultuous, addictive love story. The sex scenes held their own, but it was the dialogue and banter that made this book for me. Everything about this book was perfect.\n\n\u201cFull disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should probably know\u2026\u201d I braced for the worst. HIV, herpes \u2026 \u201c\u2026 I brought my toothbrush.\u201d He smiled, coy. \u201cBut I\u2019d let you fuck me even if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThese are two characters that I was desperate to not leave behind. The tears were plentiful, I seriously cried a river reading this book, but when I cannot leave a book behind, when I am still thinking about it weeks later, when I have already re-read it, I know that it was a fantastic book. I have told all my friends to read it and I cannot emphasise enough just how bloody brilliant this book was. I applaud Robinne Lee for her integrity, for keeping to the story that her characters demanded to be told. It wasn\u2019t all hearts and flowers, but it was honest, brutally so. This was a one-sitting book for me, I couldn\u2019t put it down and when that last sentence was read it was one of those OMG moments. One where you turn your head and look at the people around you and say\u2026why are you not emotional, why are you just watching TV, can\u2019t you see that my life will never be the same. Seriously, no joke, I adored this book, every single part of it. This is one author that has firmly planted herself on my radar and one that I cannot wait to read more from. Seriously, READ THIS BOOK!!\n\n\u201cYou.

As a result, though, those expectations were still there and I kept waiting to be blown away.While I might not have found that same all-encompassing sweet spot, I instead found myself reading a really really well written, well emoted, complex, love story between an older woman -- complete with an ex-husband, a teenage daughter, and a career -- and a popstar almost half her age.It's smart, it's sexy af, it's compelling. It's a little bit repetitive. You definitely see the writing on the wall. There are a lot of unresolved bits I have questions about. And you don't necessarily expect the ending. Oh, and also, it is heartbreaking. \"Love is this very precious thing. It's this precious, magical thing. But it's not finite. There's not a limited amount of it out there.

Robinne Lee has created two interesting characters who are almost twenty years apart in age. Sol\u00e8ne is thirty nine, she is recently divorced and the mother of a teenage daughter. Hayes is twenty and a member of a world famous boys band. They meet during a fan meet-and-greet session organized after a concert. What starts as a harmless flirtation quickly becomes a passionate love affair. Their journey is a bittersweet one, there are a lot of circumstances that pull them apart, despite their intense chemistry.Hayes is a hottie with millions of fans. His life is consumed by touring, writing music and recording it. He has developed a kind of character-splitting between his celebrity self and his authentic self as a survival technique. With Sol\u00e8ne, Hayes is sweet and open with his feelings, he knows what he wants. Sol\u00e8ne can\u2019t ignore his celebrity, she isn\u2019t prepared for the side effects of fame, the media frenzy and the lack of personal privacy. She feels uncomfortable being seen with him and wants to keep their relationship a secret as long as possible. Her story with Hayes should be a meaningless fling, a way to move on after her divorce. But she is falling hard for the real guy behind the star.What transpires between them was brilliantly written. Right from the first page, I was fully invested in their poignant story. I was transfixed by their dilemma, their intense chemistry and their heartbreak. I rooted for them and I hurt for them. I recommend this book, even though I didn't get the ending I wanted.

A difficult book to rate. All the way through, I felt uncomfortable with the basic premise. I've enjoyed books with older woman/ younger man before, although it's not my fav trope. e.g. I really liked Nia Forrester's The Fall, but in that one the age difference wasn't so great, and the H, though younger, was a still mature man who knew himself. And there you have it - that's what my problem boils down to - the HUGE age difference. The h in this book is LITERALLY well and truly old enough to be the H's mother. She's about to turn forty (but luckily still extraordinarily beautiful....). And the H is 20! Yep - not even old enough to legally drink. Hmmmmm. I think I would have liked this book a whole lot more if the age difference wasn't so vast. I kept bumping into it all the way through, and I kept thinking, no, that's just wrong. Ewww. No!!! I know it's part of what creates the basic tension of this book, but for me it was too much.Hayes is gorgeous. He's in a hugely successful British boy band, and is hot, sexy, clever and arty. And he is attracted to older women. Mommy issues maybe? This is kinda hinted at but never really explored. Solene is divorced and has a 13-year-old daughter who happens to have a crush on Hayes. Oh yeah, it's gonna get messy. Thinking about it, Solene was one of my problems with this book too. Because she did not much have personal strength, a quality that I admire. Having just reread Mariana Zapata's Kulti which has one of the best h's in Sal Cassilis, who is full of inner strength and integrity, Solene in contrast seemed weak and self-indulgent. She was the mature one in this relationship, but she didn't step back when she should have. It was going to blow up in everyone's faces. She knew that all along, but did nothing to stop the train wreck that was coming. And the feeble excuses she kept making as to why it wasn't the right time to tell her daughter about the relationship. Weak.The writer did a decent job of moving the story along, although I did get a bit sick of the sex scenes (Weird, IKR?). Yeah, Hayes is 20 and has a high sex drive, but some of the semi-public scenes etc. Really guys? You couldn't wait, even though you'd been together for months? Hmmmmm. And he's 'ready for action' again after 3 minutes? *cue eyeroll* And he gave Solene eight orgasms one night? *cue eyeroll* And promised her nine the next night? Riiigghhhtttt. As a reader, I don't need that kind of crap. I was convinced he was sexy. No need to go OTT.By about 2/3 of the way through it was starting to drag a little, and yes, I did do a bit of skimming. But the ending was a reasonable one for the story, although it did feel a bit rushed.But I'm afraid I just couldn't get over that age difference. It didn't work for me. Inconsistent of me maybe, as I would possibly find an older man/ younger woman easier to accept? But with this age difference? It would have to be a pretty great writer to make it not seem creepy.I just kept wishing Solene wasn't quite that much older than Hayes. Yeah, she was supposed to be so beautiful, but Hayes needed someone a good ten (or more) years younger. I understand his character's frustration with the young models and groupies he had previously hooked up with. He was too mature for their obsessions with Instagram etc. But Solene could have been his mom...... just no. So, if you can deal with the age difference (which plainly I couldn't), it's not a bad book. Not brilliant, but reasonable. And yeah, Hayes is a super hottie, so there is that. And there have been lots of rave reviews. But it just wasn't for me.* Extra comments added on 12 Jan 2018 after thinking about the book some more. (One day after originally writing the review)."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12415745-emily", "userReview": "I had the opportunity to read a draft of The Idea of You when I was desperate for a read that I could dive into. I was in need of something momentous. I was hungry for gourmet, not fast-food literature. I'll start by telling you what Lee\u2019s book isn't.....which is what we\u2019ve become accustomed to: a heroine with what is assumed to be relatable characteristics to most modern-day, average women. The formula seems to be that of an average achiever, who is struggling to reach her average dreams. That is, if she has them, and if not she grows into them. She will typically have a cute flaw or two, and unbeknownst to her, she\u2019s beautiful underneath goofy clothes etc,\u2026 And then, there's of course the gorgeous guy who falls madly in love after a game of cat and mouse. Because she is just too damned special to let go\u2026.. Blah\u2026. The Idea of You takes a refreshing turn from this tired formula. On the surface, the protagonist is someone with whom most of us wouldn\u2019t have much in common. She has an amazing job, a gorgeous house with a view of the Pacific, is model gorgeous, brilliant and wears high fashion that I confess, I had to google twice. Yet, the unfolding of her experience is so true and universal that I was quickly on a visceral journey of a high-stakes love affair. This romance wouldn't let me go when I put the book down. Lee's language is rhythmic and gorgeous. Her characters are quickly defined in such an elusive and well-crafted way that suddenly you see them and you aren't sure how. The connections are seamless and the characters and story are alive. There are a few moments of \"danger\" that are so subtle that you suddenly feel your hair stand on end. You discover these moments as the protagonist does, and the emotional connection you feel is undeniable. Finally, a writer who holds her readers in high regard and writes at a level worthy of us all."}], "description": "When Sol\u00e8ne Marchand, the thirty-nine-year-old owner of a prestigious art gallery in Los Angeles, takes her daughter, Isabelle, to meet her favorite boy band, she does so reluctantly and at her ex-husband\u2019s request. The last thing she expects is to make a connection with one of the members of the world-famous August Moon. But Hayes Campbell is clever, winning, confident, and posh, and the attraction is immediate. That he is all of twenty years old further complicates things.What begins as a series of clandestine trysts quickly evolves into a passionate relationship. It is a journey that spans continents as Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes navigate each other\u2019s disparate worlds: from stadium tours to international art fairs to secluded hideaways. And for Sol\u00e8ne, it is as much a reclaiming of self, as it is a rediscovery of happiness and love. When their romance becomes a viral sensation, and both she and her daughter become the target of rabid fans and an insatiable media, Sol\u00e8ne must face how her new status has impacted not only her life, but the lives of those closest to her.", "title": "The Idea of You", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450913-the-idea-of-you", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497332059l/31450913.jpg", "reviews": 758, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15613183.Robinne_Lee", "name": "Robinne Lee"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Romance", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450913-the-idea-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34836966-the-idea-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35506554-the-idea-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33519233-spring-summer-2017-st-martin-s-first-sampler"]}
