Kear. Fresh into adulthood, Nicole was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease. In her book, she discusses life, work, love, motherhood, and her emotional journey in general since receiving her prognosis of blindness within ten years\u2019 time. One thing I loved about Nicole\u2019s story is the humor she adds while discussing random experiences that people with healthy vision often take for granted. Although humor is likely her own personal coping mechanism, it reminded me that it\u2019s OK to not take life so seriously all the time. If Nicole can laugh at this very scary time in her life, then I sure as hell can let go of some of the anxiety I experience from mundane things I probably won\u2019t even remember next year. I listened to the audio book which was narrated by Nicole herself, and knowing she was sharing her own story with her own voice added a level of intimacy to the experience. I enjoyed Now I See You, but if I\u2019m being honest, I found myself tuning out during a few latter portions (BTW I feel very guilty saying that). Maybe that was my mind\u2019s way of separating my emotions from some non-humor related parts or maybe the book really did take a turn in writing style/content/flow, I\u2019m not sure. Regardless, I rated Now I See You 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. I liked it overall, and the humor itself was incentive enough to bump the rating up half a star. If you enjoy memoirs and can appreciate humor added to an otherwise dreary topic, then make sure to check out this title!My favorite quote:\u201dAs a rule of thumb, the secretly blind should avoid all activities in which they\u2019re required to glue objects onto their face. This includes the application of fake eyelashes. At best, you\u2019ll stick the lashes on asymmetrically; making it look like one side of your face has melted. At worst, the black feathery clump will land in the area between your lid and your brow, causing people to think you are under attack by mutant spiders. Should fake lashes be an occupational necessity, as is the case with celebrity impersonators and actors specializing in mid-twentieth century farce, simply enlist the aid of a colleague. This can be achieved by batting your real lashes and blaming your abysmal fine motor skills. Then try to find an office job. You have enough problems without worrying about this shit.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "I could only imagine what I would do if I was ever given the same diagnosis Kear was given.

Given a life-changing diagnosis and told that she is ineluctably going blind, a kick-ass and gritty nineteen-year-old decides to literally \"rage, rage against the dying of the light\" and fight the odds with all that she can muster. An incredible story of stubbornness, na\u00efvet\u00e9, courage and hedonism, \"Now I See You\" is a colorful and witty book about what it means to lose your vision when your dreams involve making it in Hollywood and becoming a mother. Suffused with a desire to live as big a life as she can before her world narrows down, Nicole C. Kear's story is an ode to the millions of acts and scenes that we all take for granted because they are there for the taking as soon as we open our eyes in the morning. A defiant lesson in wisdom and self-acceptance, this was a wildly endearing story that will make you look around you a little more closely once you finish the last page.

At the age of 19, Nicole Kear found out she had retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease where she would first lose her peripheral vision, and eventually be blind in 10-15 years. With a \"seize the day\" attitude, she decided to travel, have a series of one-night stands, finish a degree in drama at Yale, and search for acting jobs in California and New York. She only told her family and a few close friends about her diagnosis. She pretended to be ditzy or drunk when she walked into glass doors or tripped over things she did not see. It was especially challenging to see at night, and she had some hilarious stories about attending parties to network in California which were often held around the host's swimming pool, a dangerous spot for Kear. I would not have wanted to be on the road when she was driving.Eventually she fell in love and had children. Keeping track of toddlers is challenging enough for people with good sight. She had a terrible scare when she couldn't find her daughter, but the little girl was just sitting on a nearby bench, out of Kear's range of vision. She realized she could no longer be in a state of denial, and needed to ask for help from her family, her friends, and a state training program. Her children would be safer if people knew her secret.I enjoyed the author's exuberance, and her irreverent, self-deprecating sense of humor. Kear also included times of fear, as well as tender moments, in her book. This was a well-written memoir that kept my interest."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301501-erin", "userReview": "ARC for review. Blindness. A fascinating topic. However until I read the incredible [book: Blindness} by Jose Saramago (which was more dystopian versus blindness-centered) my experiences with blindness in literature were pretty much limited to Mary Ingalls and the Helen Keller biography that I believe every 1970s female elementary student used for a book report (I swear the only biographies with female subjects in my elementary library were that one and one on Amelia Earhart, so I'm definitely going to choose the one about badly-behaving Helen every time). When Nicole Kear was nineteen she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and her doctor told her she might be completely blind within ten years. Kear is oh-so-human as she talks about her various responses, her evolving life (both the deterioration of her sight and the normal trials and tribulations of dating/families/children...very little about work, though, and I would like to have read more about that) and, poignantly, the humiliation and shame she felt - a response that will speak to so many readers. Here's a book that found me at the best possible time. I've recently been diagnosed with a progressive illness so Kear's story about her life definitely spoke to me, but, separate from my own connection this book is incredibly interesting and well-written and Kear is someone I would love to know. Here's hoping this book finds the wide audience it deserves."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8788453-denise", "userReview": "Now I See You: A Memoir is the story of a young woman who is diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease that causes her to slowly go blind.

I am really more of a fiction reader because my reading goal is simply to be entertained. Every once in a while a book outside of my usual fiction reading catches my attention as this book did. A book that tells the story not of someone who suddenly goes blind and must adapt but of someone who is told at a very young age that she has only a few years of sight left. This is Nicole's story. Nicole is diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at age 19. She is told that she will be blind in a decade or so. Nicole shares her diagnosis with her family but otherwise keeps her declining vision to herself. As a result of her lack of sight, she does have a few close calls but few know about her problem. Nicole eventually marries and becomes a mother which bring on more challenges. The author is a remarkable story teller and I found myself pulled into her story. I will admit that I did not understand why keeping her diagnosis secret was so important to her. I would recommend this book. It was a quick read and told an interesting story. I found myself wondering what I would have done had I found myself in Nicole's place. I could not even imagine what I would attempt to do if I learned that I only had a limited time to see the world.

This book is full of it. It makes me completely non-sympathetic and negative towards the author, who obviously had a very difficult medical diagnosis thrust on her at a very young age. There was a ton of repetition in the book of her being afraid to face her diagnosis and to DO anything positive about it and her fear to talk about it with others and to even let those she was around actually KNOW that she was legally blind. I was frustrated with the fact that she basically wasted time when she was more sighted to do things that would prepare her for when she no longer was able to see. This is more a how not-to book than a how-to book. It doesn't profess to be a how-to deal with going blind book, but I can't even suggest it as a read to someone, other than to use it as an example of learning by doing the opposite of what the author does. I know, I know, I wasn't in that situation, I can't say with 100% surety what I would have done if I was in her shoes, but I can make an educated guess and it wasn't what the author did, other than to travel to see the things she would't be able to see in the future. This book was not my cup of tea. Too much repetitive whining about the situation and avoiding the problem instead of tackling it head-on annoyed me. It may have made for a shorter and less \"entertaining\" work if she adjusted earlier and dealt with the problems instead of running from them, but I think I would have enjoyed it more than this work.I know I sound like a heartless person by saying these things. I'm not unsympathetic to the situation, but I just don't agree with how she handled things. It's her life and it is always an honor when someone shares their life with you, whether you agree or disagree with how they lived it. She had the right to do what she did. I am not disputing that. I am sure there are those out there who disagree with how I live my life. She is free to live as she chooses, without explanation or apology, as she is not hurting anyone else or breaking any laws.

Kear's NOW I SEE YOU is a funny, sad, terrifying, and uplifting memoir about her very personal battle with a degenerative eye disease. Nicole was nineteen when a doctor diagnosed her with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an untreatable genetic condition that would render her blind within fifteen years. She went from being a normal college student fretting over things like boyfriends and disappointing jobs to worrying about what would happen to the rest of her life - would her condition mean she couldn't be an actress, couldn't get married, couldn't have children, couldn't function in the world like everyone else? For the first few years after her diagnosis, Nicole did the best she could to hide her deteriorating vision, even going so far as to pretend intoxication to cover up all-too-frequent clumsiness. NOW I SEE YOU explores Nicole's journey from denial to acceptance, from fear to affirmation that truly living requires courage, honesty, and a willingness to embrace the challenges we face.Much of Nicole's story is very familiar and recognizable - my guess is just about every woman on the face of the earth can identify with her boyfriend issues, her sexual exploration, her hysterical Italian family, her marriage, and her pregnancies. Her first labor (with son Lorenzo) was so like my own (including the prolonged contractions and the eventual epidural) that as I was reading I forgot all about her slowly failing vision. This was a young woman who reminded me of myself - albeit thirty-five years ago! And in many ways, that's the heart of this story. Nicole has an incurable disease and she will be blind by the time she herself is thirty-five, but she's also a woman with a world of things to experience. Her decision to live in that world - including having children, raising them, and watching them grow - is what transforms her from the victim of a disease to a woman with a mission.This is a very funny book, told with brilliant directness and unfettered honesty. Nicole's greatest challenge from the start was accepting her advancing condition and the limitations that came along with it. She couldn't stand the idea of people knowing she was losing her eyesight, whether because of vanity, pride, or just fear. What she finally realized is, \"Vanity, pride, and fear were formidable opponents but my sense of maternal duty was stronger.\" She used the words \"maternal duty,\" but she could just as easily have said \"passion to live,\" because it's not just her children who benefitted from her will to persevere. She's a loving wife to husband David and a wonderful daughter, sister, and granddaughter to her family. That's what impressed me so much about Nicole's story - it's more the story of everyone who comes to know her, including those of us who share in it through this book.At the end of NOW I SEE YOU, as Nicole Kear was faced with the reality of being legally blind, she had to also face the fact that \"You CANNOT do this ALONE!\" That's an important realization for any of us. For years, Nicole hid from the truth about her battle with RP, but through her loving relationships (especially with her three children), she stepped out from the shadows and embraced all that life had to offer. This is a book all of us can relate to, whether we're facing a debilitating disease or just life's ordinary everyday slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. I recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys life-affirming true stories that celebrate the positive. Great story about a woman who has a lot to teach us all about living life.[Please note: I was provided a copy of this novel for review; the opinions expressed here are my own.]"}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "A special thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

She wants to enjoy her life and indulges herself (you will laugh out at some of the things she says and does).Bouncing from New York City to California and back, Kear surged forward, hiding her increasing disability from her family and friends.

If asked today, I'd give the same answer I did then: I'd rather be deaf. Since I was born deaf, I don't know any different, but that could be a blessing. In Nicole Kear's case, she was born with sight, so she knew what she would be missing. But I can't imagine being in this world never having seen any of it. And if I had been born hearing and lost it later in life, that would be a tough adjustment, as it would if I had Usher's like several of my friends (who lose both their sight and hearing). So I can understand why Nicole has a hard time dealing with her diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, even though it was frustrating reading about her stubbornness in hiding it. I wish her family had talked about her disease and not made it feel like a secret. I'm lucky that I was taught to advocate for myself and be open about my disability.Nicole writes about her RP and journey to independence with humor. I also really liked this description about books:\"Sticking your nose in a book might seem like the very opposite of grabbing life by the balls, but reading had always been one of my great loves, and it was one of the things I was most terrified to lose. Sure, there were always audiobooks, but the holy communion of bringing your eyes to paper and sweeping them across the page, left to right, left to right, left to right, the rhythm of that dance, the quiet of it, the sound of the page turning, the look of crinkled covers stained with the coffee you were drinking when you read that chapter that changed your life - you didn't get any of that when listening to an audiobook, and I wanted as much of that as I could get, while I still could.\"Thankfully Helen Keller's purported statement that \"Blindness cuts us off from things, but deafness cuts us off from people,\" is no longer true either way."}, {"userName": "Iris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1440073-iris", "userReview": "I'm so glad I read this! It's a funny, fresh and frank memoir of self-acceptance-- in Nicole Kear's case, accepting and navigating vision loss. At 19, she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited eye disease causing gradual retinal degeneration, eventually leading to blindness. She takes the news as a shameful secret to hide, and also as a personal dare: seize the day! Forget her doctor's exhortations: don't drink, don't smoke, stay close to home. She travels, studies at clown college, tends bar, indulges in flings, graduates from Yale and Columbia, all the while being reckless while she loses her peripheral vision. Walking down the street, she's liable to fall over a fire hydrant, careen into walls, and trip over dogs and toddlers. What changes her life is her decision to have children, whom she loves deeply, but this love also terrifies her: her vision is diminishing, yet there is so much more she wants to see, do, and give. Motherhood compels her to seek support groups and orientation & mobility training with a white cane.If you've ever had anything to overcome -- any kind of disability, surely, but also any personal hangup that prevented you from living a full life -- you'll be touched by her fearlessness.

In fact, a coworker brought it to my attention and suggested we purchase it for the library (I am responsible for purchasing books for our local library). Anyway, reading this book was like looking at my life experiences in may ways. One of the things about slowly losing your vision is that you adapt to the unnoticeable changes along the way so there really is no reason to tell anyone - you just do things a little different but no one notices or cares. Some of the fakes Nicole did I also did - like dealing with not seeing in the dark you just fake having one too many drinks - even if you have held the same drink for hours! Don't drive at night and you are out with friends, you just catch a ride or have to leave at sunset to pick up your kid. No one is the wiser. There is a point that comes when you simply can't fake things anymore and you have to have some help....with a deep breath and a lot of quiet meditation you come out of the closet and ask for help. With the many great staff at the Florida Division of Blind Services I was able to receive technology that allows me to be \"normal\" again and use a computer with technology that enlarges the screen, provides color contrast so it is easier to read with less glare, and even with audio options that reads EVERYTHING on the scree TO YOU. In fact you can take the written page and capture the images on your computer screen which will read the page to you. Amazing! I also have to thank the very kind staff at Lighthouse of the Palm Beaches for their support and training for home safety and mobility training.

At first, she responds the way you might expect a nineteen-year-old to respond: by living it up, determined to experience as much as she can while she can. As she's closing in on her 30th birthday, Nicole is a new mom with a significantly decreased field of vision. She's trying to teach her kids to read words that she herself can not see. At a certain point, she has to come clean and admit to others -- and to herself -- just how bad her vision is. She even has to recruit help from a social worker who will teach her how to use a blindness cane. This is ultimately a story about self-acceptance and honesty, and it's very well-written. My only complaint is a personal one that definitely will not apply to many readers and it's that I was disappointed with the mommy bent of the book. Nicole spends so much more of the book talking about how her impending blindness affects her life as a mother -- and that's totally fair. It's an important part of her identity. But it's not an important part of mine, and I don't find a lot to enjoy in parenting narratives.

In the book she repeatedly beats herself up about her secrecy, her shame about her condition, but yet she doesn't change. For a long time. It's tough to read, it's tough to have empathy for someone who seems to be making her own life, and the lives of the ones she loves most, more difficult than it needs to be. She's also tough to empathize with since her anecdotes and stories are told with a bawdry humor - as if she's still trying to skim over the seriousness of her condition.I'm sort of hoping she'll write again in 10 years or so, when her children are older and she's lived with her near-blindness/blindness for longer, and perhaps has more to say about the experience than jokes and self-recriminations."}, {"userName": "Jamie McQuiggan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3045589-jamie-mcquiggan", "userReview": "I liked her writing style and voice - it was interesting and light and touching. It's a quick read and I enjoyed it... mostly. I had some serious problems with HER (like her handling of her disability, and her family's too... honestly.) and I'm not sure how that should impact the star rating. I am horrified when I think about how her denial impacted the safety of others... not just her kids and herself but society at large as she was driving at night to avoid having to admit she couldn't see at night. I was also super irritated with her at the end. I don't know how her husband can leave her alone with the kids all day, or her parents? Like when she demanded the car to drive to California? WTF? The way she and all those around her handled the diagnosis was totally unrelateable to me. (Or was that just written in a sensationalized way to be funny? I dunno...) There's a lot to recommend here and I did enjoy MOST of it but it's hard for me to separate out the really annoying and irresponsible parts. I'm not sure what to rate it because I'm so conflicted, lol, so going with at 3 for now."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27906577-karen", "userReview": "A two star rating for \"Now I See You: A Memoir\" is a gift. I know that the author, Nicole, is a real person who got a bad break in life. But frankly, her whining coupled with her refusal to ask for help got tiresome. Everyone struggles - honestly, I have depression that makes it challenging to get out of bed each and everyday - but I power on and have become a very accomplished person with many successes in my life. It seems like Nicole spent wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much time crying into her coffee cup - I don't see how her husband put up with it. She had tons of help offered to her that she could access with her fingertips but, instead of taking advantage of this, she wasted her time feeling sorry for herself. Nicole seemed to be very self-indulgent. She didn't consider - or at least she didn't write much about how her disease affected her family or her husband. I expect books like this to be inspirational or at least offer some tips for dealing with adversity. This book does not."}, {"userName": "Gisselle Malespin Estevez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45964087-gisselle-malespin-estevez", "userReview": "I decided to read this book because it's a memoir of a girl name Nicole that is diagnosed with and eye desease called Retinitis Pigmentosa, a desease that causes people to loose their ability to see. It is a desease that runs in my father's side. I wanted to know more of this and how this girl's life is changed when she was diagnosed at the age of 19. Its incredible how her life changes and how she starts to view life in a different way, living it like it was the last time she could see. It's amazing how it makes you value so many things that we take for granted. This story makes you think about the things that matter. We sometimes complain about things so stupid and don't stop to look at all the wordfull things we have and how lucky we are to be able to see, to see our kids, our families and to see everything around us. It's and example for us to apreciate our sight and never take it for granted.\"You can only hope that you live with the right regrets\""}, {"userName": "Aizel (One Page at a Time) Macaldo", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5330677-aizel-one-page-at-a-time-macaldo", "userReview": "I read an ARC. :)I loved it! I don't read memoirs much because I'm afraid I might find them boring and dragging, but not Nicole's memoir, Now I See You. I really liked her style of writing. I did not find any boring parts at all. Despite her RP and inner struggles, she was hopeful. Yes she was in denial for a long time, but her love for her children won. The fact that she was able to write her story in a light manner made me admire her. She's humorous and very inspiring. :) I also liked her grandma and mother. They're funny! Haha! And of course, David is so sweet and supportive. I do wish them the best! :)What Nicole's life taught me was to never let fear interfere, (It rhymes! Haha!) to make memories while I still can. And most of all, it taught me to trust others, especially the ones closest to me. :)So, will I recommend this book? Yes!

She discusses her almost pathological resistance to her illness and much of the book details how she refuses to come to terms with her impending blindness. Even as a young mother, Kear is still unable to share her misfortune and ask for much needed help, often putting herself and her children in danger. This was where the book became difficult for me.

I found the writing easy to read, and the humor made the topic very approachable. I was at 3 stars, but I got frustrated reading over and over about how she wouldn't share her diagnosis of eventual blindness with anyone other than a handful of people thereby bringing on so much extra drama and hardship. It got old. The humor failed to cover for the tedium of reading, yet again, that she hadn't told so and so that she was quite literally almost blind and therefore '______' meant she would need help."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4285107-kathy", "userReview": "This memoir was honest, funny and so thought provoking.

This woman finds out late in high school that she is going blind from retinitis pigmentosa. She behaves in similar fashion as my mom did. - floating down the river of denial for years as her vision fades. She shares her path of motherhood as her vision continues to fade. Hit home!"}], "description": "At nineteen years old, Nicole C. Kear's biggest concern is choosing a major--until she walks into a doctor's office in midtown Manhattan and gets a life-changing diagnosis. She is going blind, courtesy of an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa, and has only a decade or so before Lights Out. Instead of making preparations as the doctor suggests, Kear decides to carpe diem and make the most of the vision she has left. She joins circus school, tears through boyfriends, travels the world, and through all these hi-jinks, she keeps her vision loss a secret.When Kear becomes a mother, just a few years shy of her vision's expiration date, she amends her carpe diem strategy, giving up recklessness in order to relish every moment with her kids. Her secret, though, is harder to surrender - and as her vision deteriorates, harder to keep hidden. As her world grows blurred, one thing becomes clear: no matter how hard she fights, she won't win the battle against blindness. But if she comes clean with her secret, and comes to terms with the loss, she can still win her happy ending.Told with humor and irreverence, Now I See You is an uplifting story about refusing to cower at life's curveballs, about the power of love to triumph over fear. But, at its core, it's a story about acceptance: facing the truths that just won't go away, and facing yourself, broken parts and all.", "title": "Now I See You: A Memoir", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18404311-now-i-see-you", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382758546l/18404311.jpg", "reviews": 282, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7246416.Nicole_C_Kear", "name": "Nicole C.
