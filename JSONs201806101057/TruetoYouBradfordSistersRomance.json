It totally made me cry... and that's a good thing. By the end of the book I felt so much compassion for John and his struggle to accept and overcome some pretty tough things. As a mother who adopted her children, I completely related to the theme of adoption and was fascinated by Nora and John's search for his biological parents. The contrasts between Nora and John were stark, but their differences complemented each other and the chemistry between them was awesome. I loved the emotional journey they went on as they learned to trust God and rely on Him for peace and resolution. Nora's sisters were a fun and integral presence and I can't wait to read their stories! Some scenes were written from Willow's perspective so I wonder if her book is coming next... I highly recommend reading the prequel novella for details about Nora's parents which influenced her in this story.

In fairness, I haven\u2019t read all of them yet, but so far, Nora is the character that I\u2019ve connected to the most. It didn\u2019t take much more than the first chapter before I found myself loving her quirkiness. There were so many things I found endearing about her \u2013 the fact that she is a librarian, her bookish-ness, her love for British television shows and her love of genealogy. I was expecting Nora\u2019s story to be sweet, but I was not expecting the major plot twists as well as some of the heavy-hitting revelations for the characters. Nora is all aflutter when she meets John, making one think that a typical romance is about to begin. However, soon after they start looking into John\u2019s birth family, the story takes a deeper turn, ending in a way that neither of them could have ever expected.John is one of the strongest male leads I\u2019ve read about in a good while, but also one of the most vulnerable. His struggles feel so genuine and realistic, and I truly empathizes with the life-altering information that he finds through Nora\u2019s genealogical search. I really appreciated how the author goes straight to the point and doesn\u2019t shy away from temptations that arise in real-life situations, and the complexities that come along with that. It just felt very human and honest. Nora and John have amazing chemistry, yes, but also just respect each other as people and as children of God.And, oh, the plot twists! One is a bit cutesy, but also really fun. It falls more along the lines of something I might expect from a romance novel, and I actually had a feeling it might happen, I just wasn\u2019t sure how it would all go down. Then, what I would consider the real plot twist happens, and I was honestly floored. It transformed an already engaging, romantic story into a complex and layered story about individual trials as well as the breaking point of John and Nora\u2019s relationship.I found the relationship between Nora and her sisters completely endearing, and I\u2019m so eager to read Willow\u2019s story. The snippets that were from her perspective had me intrigued, and I also thought it was fun that there is a connection in her story to the last book in the Porter family series. I also thought the adoption thread was handled with sensitivity. My husband was adopted, and if he hadn\u2019t been, his life would have been drastically different, so different that he and I likely would have never met if he hadn\u2019t been. I know that God took a situation that could have been bad for him and used it for good. John\u2019s parents are so gracious and loving towards him; their reaction toward him was heartwarming.There is such a strong redemptive note throughout this entire story, and the culmination of it was beautiful. Becky Wade doesn\u2019t shy away from temptations and suffering, but she also portrays grace in a moving, authentic way. Trusting God didn\u2019t mean their problems went away, but it did ensure that they had peace even in the midst of trials.True to You is one of my favorite reads of 2017 for sure. It was a stellar start to a new series, and I\u2019m giddy thinking about how there are at least two more books to come after this!I received a complimentary copy of this novel, which I chose to review. This review is my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste", "userReview": "Full review now posted!I took a couple of days to try to gather my thoughts on this book, so that I could maybe do a little more than blather and gush. But, nope. Pretty sure this review is going to pretty much be blathering and gushing. Those who follow my reviews know that fantasy is my favorite genre. I can get behind a good romance now and again, but romance novels very rarely make it onto my favorites shelf. Especially Christian romances, as they tend to lean towards cheesiness and, though that can be fun, they don\u2019t tend to stick with me. But in this book, the first I\u2019ve read from Becky Wade, I found an exception. When the story first started, it was just cute. A nerdy genealogy librarian falls for the hot former Navy SEAL who seeks out her help to find his birth mother. Nora is sweet and old-fashioned and awkward and a fangirl after my own heart. John is her opposite in every way except for the faith they share. I assumed that their love story was going to be adorable and they would find John\u2019s mom, but that would be all there was to the story.Man, was I wrong.There were a couple of pretty major plot twists that took me off guard. In the last hundred or so pages especially, the book took on a depth that I just wasn\u2019t expecting. And the spiritual component that came with that depth was phenomenal. Something I really loved about this story was the fact that, when the characters gave everything completely over to God and trusted Him with every aspect of their lives, everything didn\u2019t just immediately get better. There wasn\u2019t miraculous healing. God is of course completely capable of miracles, but I think the church has a bad habit of promising miracles when they might not be a part of God\u2019s plan. I love God with all of my heart, and I trust Him with every aspect of my life. The fact that He didn\u2019t heal my infertility and give me a biological child doesn\u2019t change or cheapen that faith in any way for me. I had people tell me that if I would just pray harder, God would take away my physical pain and give me a child. That\u2019s not how faith works. It\u2019s not a cure-all. Christians are still going to have problems and sorrow and brokenness. I have faith because I love Jesus and am astounded by what He\u2019s already done for me. But, God has healed my physical pain; through surgery. And I believe that I\u2019ll adopt someday. In the meantime, I have a niece to look forward to meeting in August! All of that to say, I really appreciated how Wade handled the issues her characters had, and how faith impacted their views of those issues instead of doing away with the issues themselves. This book was just so beautiful to me. It was funny and sweet and heartbreaking and moving. It was incredibly uplifting. And I can\u2019t wait to read more about the Bradford sisters. Here\u2019s to hoping book two is published quickly!For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "I discovered Becky Wade had free novella available\u2014Then Came You\u2014the prequel to her new series. I downloaded it, and read it, and discovered my review copy of the first book in the series was already sitting on my Kindle. So I read that as well, and now I have to wait months for the next in the series. Yes, True to You was good. Excellent. The best romance I\u2019ve read so far in 2017. True to You is Nora\u2019s story. She\u2019s a bookish librarian-researcher-genealogist who is a devotee of a certain British period drama, and one of the minor actors (the way she describes him, I see him as a slightly more foppish version of Benedict Cumberbatch). Nora also happens to own a historic village (as you do). She meets the handsome John Lawson when her sister volunteers her as a hostage for a training exercise run by John\u2019s company, and the attraction would have been immediate if it wasn\u2019t for the existence of Allie, John\u2019s perfect girlfriend.John is adopted and wants to find his birth parents. Nora seems the perfect person to help him. Only she\u2019s too perfect \u2026 and he\u2019s too much of a Christian and a gentleman to be able to do anything with that perfection when he already has the perfect girlfriend in Allie. Allie, who knows his secret and still wants him.The plot was excellent, with the perfect (!) combination of predictable and surprising. There were several plot points that I didn\u2019t see coming, but which made perfect sense. The characters were excellent\u2014intelligent, funny, and quirky, and I\u2019m already looking forward to the next two books in the series, to find out how Willow and Britt get their happy-ever-afters (the who has been pretty well identified already. The how \u2026 that\u2019s going to be fun to watch. And I don\u2019t know which I want to read more\u2014the story of the ex who\u2019s back in town, or the story of the boy next door who\u2019s been in love with her forever).The writing was outstanding. There were so many great lines, but I can\u2019t quote most of them because *spoilers*. I especially loved the faith thread. Both Nora and John are Christians, and while the plot never makes a big deal about it, it is central to both their characters and both their stories. It comes across as entirely natural, and that\u2019s tough to pull off.I think you\u2019ve figured by now that I loved this book.

Since her childhood, she has felt that she didn't have the beauty or the creativity of her older and younger sisters. She's created her own niche, and is quite content in her existence. Or so it appears. American hero, John Lawson is quite the opposite from those Nora would consider 'her' people. She is a local genealogist who runs the local historical village. He is an ex-Navy SEAL, who has received the prestigious Medal of Honor. He has started a security training company, and their paths cross as she volunteers as a hostage in one of his exercises. Star struck and swept away in her crush, she secretly dreams of what it would be like to be noticed by him. John, recently diagnosed with a debilitating disease that he discovers is hereditary, needs to find his birth mother and the family he knows nothing of. Adopted as a baby, he has no medical history and desperately needs help to find his genetic family roots. Its a search he can't do alone. When he finds out that Nora has the resources to help, he makes her an offer she cannot refuse. Alas, John has a girlfriend and all dreams of an idyllic future with him must come to a screeching halt. Neither one of them expect chemistry. Neither one of them want to become the stereotypical 'cheating' partner. Nora has suffered heartbreak like this before, and she has no desire to become the other woman. Similarly John has held fast to his standards his entire life, and is not about to change them now. Their journey for answers, though slow at first leads along a path neither of them expected. Will they be able to handle what is coming? There is a free ebook novella prequel 'Then Came You', to this brand new series from Becky Wade. If you read it, it will give you plenty of back story behind the Bradford family. However, Becky does a great job of explaining the necessary parts as she goes through 'True to You'. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Nora is so relatable as a character. I'd guess many of us feel the commonly felt feeling of being 'overlooked' by society. Nothing special, or stand out from the crowd personality. Those that truly know her, see that there is far more to her than she sees in herself. I loved the relationship of the three sisters, who share the same father, but each have a different mother (that is explained in 'Then Came You'). They are close and treasure each other in a way that I also can relate to with my own sisters. I'm really excited to read Willow & Britt's stories, which we have been given a sneak peek into, cleverly weaved into the pages here. I also noticed the cameo appearance of Gray, from 'Her One and Only'. Awesome!The cover - is exactly how I would picture Bradfordwood, and the dress, perfect for Nora's appearance at her Grandmothers birthday party. Well done for getting it spot on. Thank you to Netgalley & Bethany House for the eARC.

After the heartbreak of her last relationship, Nora has barricaded herself behind a facade of dowdy clothing, old fashioned hairstyles, and her work as a genealogist and the owner of a historical village. Who better to break through this barricade than a Navy SEAL?! With his gruff gentleness and his forced need to dig into his past, John breaks through those defenses quickly. Nora's character was so much fun. The first scene with her had me laughing and I thoroughly enjoyed her transformation throughout the book as she comes out of her self-imposed shell and let's herself fall in love and trust again. I loved how sure she was of herself when she is engaged in her work of genealogy and how she turns to books, period TV dramas, and hot tea when she needs comfort. :) By the end of the book, Nora learns some important lessons in love, faith, and self-worth.John's character grabbed my attention from the beginning with the whole macho Navy SEAL exterior and hurting, uncertain of his future, inner man. His world is in a tail-spin since being diagnosed with an inherited condition that will affect him the rest of his life. When he first meets Nora, he's not immediately attracted to her but as he spends more time with her, he starts to see beneath the surface to the wonderful young lady behind the facade. He also has a girlfriend so when he starts feeling attracted to Nora, he has to decide if he wants a \"safe\" girlfriend or if he wants to risk a deeper relationship. John also learns some important lessons in faith and trusting God with his future and his past.I loved Nora's interactions with her sisters and look forward to reading their stories in future books. I also enjoyed the scenes with her employees (a ROFL moment when one employee in particular meets John!) and the teenager she has taken under her wing.This is a light-hearted, funny, but also deeply emotional story with some swoony romance and a twist that made me gasp! You'll want to read this book! :) Although I believe this book can be read as a stand alone, you'll get a better grasp of the three sisters background if you read the novella, Then Came You, first.*Thanks to Litfuse for a complimentary copy of this book.

I've always enjoyed the 'person-searching-for-their-biological-mother/father/parents' storyline, and this one certainly did not disappoint. After reading the prequel novella to the Bradford Sisters Romance series (Then Came You), I knew I would want to read the rest of the series. So when True to You came available through Bethany House, I grabbed it. I didn't get to read it right away, but when I did, I was immediately pulled into the story. Nora and John were both unique characters. It wasn't like \"oh, they're like so-and-so from that other book\". They were their own people. Nora is a genealogist and historical village owner (how cool is that, y'all?) who spends her free time watching her favorite British TV series, reading books, and consuming cartons of ice cream. She 'dresses like a librarian', steers clear of her ex-fianc\u00e9, and tells herself she's content with her life as it is... But she's not. John is a retired Navy SEAL, who now owns his own business. He's serious and focused, knowing exactly how his life will play out. Until...he gets a startling diagnosis that rocks his world. Now on the search for his biological mother, he enlists the help of one Ms. Nora Bradford...and things pick up speed from there. So, yup. *nods* This book was amazing. Aside from the main characters, I LOVED the relationships between Nora and her sisters, and John and his adoptive parents. Also the grandmother...in her mink coat. She was hilarious. ;) There was a few things in the book that I didn't care for, resulting in the dropping of one star. *minor spoilers throughout* First, all the kissing. mean, they kissed...multiple times...on their first date? Really?! Yeah, I didn't really care for that. Not okay. Also, the character of Nora's employee Nikki. She flirted shamelessly with any man she happened to meet...which really annoyed me. I think her character could have still had the same effect, even if that had been toned down a bit. I didn't particularly appreciate some of her remarks. Another thing. I wouldn't knock off a star for this, but it did make me go \"whaaaa?\" When their baking...and he smears sugar on her face...and then kisses it off. Am I the only one who was slightly grossed out by that? XD*end of spoilers* All the way around, I super enjoyed this story.

There is something fresh and yet familiar with her writing, and it was that juxtaposition that I loved! From the first pages this book reads unlike any other Wade book, and yet her voice is evident. Wade remains a master at believable chemistry and pacing between her characters. Her heroes have her signature voice all over them, and that remains true in True to You. She also maintains the beauty of family in her book, only this time it's with three sisters. While never perfect relationships, the bond of a family is something she keeps in tact, which is refreshing. And her faith element is woven in organically, another piece Wade seems to do effortlessly which can only stream from her own love of God. It's simply a part of her, so it's a part of her writing.What's new is her style of writing. She's introduced small snippets of emails and texts which allow us to see pieces of background information in unique ways that don't stall the progress of the story but rather enhance it. And even her wording and beats are different here, creating a unique flow to the story that completely suits these new characters Yes . And yet, it's still 100% a Wade novel. This, to me, is the mark of an amazing author, and Wade is most definitely one of those.As for the meat of the story itself, I thoroughly enjoyed Nora and John.

It\u2019s funny, charming, romantic, sexy, and it hits me in all the feels. And that\u2019s just John\u2019s character. Kidding. Kidding. (Mostly.)I\u2019ll get back to John in a minute but \u201cGreat Scott\u201d do I love Nora!! For starters, she is delightfully bookish and has a tendency to fall in love with fictional characters. She\u2019s a librarian, a historian and a genealogist. She uses words like \u201cindubitable\u201d and \u201ctout\u201d on a regular basis. She owns a historic village (because of course she does). Nora is just endearingly quirky, relatable and cute.And then there\u2019s John\u2026. blissful sigh. Former Navy-SEAL-hero John. He has a book and a movie based on his heroism (Hold your swooning until the end, please.) (Ok, who am I kidding? Go ahead. Start swooning.) Besides running his emergency/terrorism training company, he is searching for his birth family. John\u2019s understandably a little angsty and broody but he\u2019s also charming and sexy. (Seriously, keep a fan handy) And he finds Nora absolutely adorable. (Because she is.)What starts out as a cute and lighthearted romance \u2013 with perhaps a meaningful thread or two \u2013 takes some surprising turns that left me feeling as gut-punched as the characters. I even gasped out loud in horrified sympathy at one point, as though these are my real friends. (You see why I love Nora so much \u2026 she\u2019s not the only one who occasionally considers fictional characters to be as real as real people lol) Coating every word \u2013 of the hard and the sweet \u2013 is sincere grace wrapped in truth.Bottom Line: True to You is perhaps my favorite Becky Wade novel to date! And considering how much I love Meant to be Mine, this is saying quite a lot. Wade is not afraid to tackle real life through fiction, with messy, painful situations and characters who love Jesus but remain as flawed as you or me.

It has a really fresh feel to it, and yet it is still indubitably Becky Wade. (When you read the book, you\u2019ll see what I just did there!)I\u2019m not sure you could find two characters who are more different to the Porters and their wives than Nora Bradford and John Lawson. In Nora, Becky Wade has managed to capture all the endearing quirks you might expect from a genealogist/historian/bookish person without making her awkward or clich\u00e9d. And I loved her voice! So often when a character is remarkable for their use of \u2018big\u2019 words it comes across as though the author has simply dusted off their thesaurus, but with Nora it was done much more subtly and sounded completely authentic. It also added a nice dynamic to her relationship with John, but you\u2019ll have to read the book yourself to discover how!Speaking of John, I have to admit I\u2019m a sucker for the strong, silent type. He might be a Medal of Honor winner, but he doesn\u2019t give off the high-energy, alpha-male vibe that you often see in military characters. He\u2019s not a talker, he doesn\u2019t like to bring attention to himself, and throughout this novel his integrity and strength of character shines through. And oh, sweet mercy, those kisses! I loved the way he loves Nora!I will admit there were times when the first half of this novel dragged just a little for me\u2014times when I felt there was a lot of exposition that could have been trimmed down\u2014but there are some fabulous one- or two-liners all through this novel, and I loved the dynamic between Nora and her sisters. We also get a tantalizing glimpse of where the next two books in the series will be headed, and I like what I see!For all its strengths, where this book really excelled for me was in the last third, when John grapples with the discoveries his search has brought to light. He\u2019s got the answers he was looking for, but they really aren\u2019t the answers he was looking for! His anguish was so authentic, and I LOVED the way these characters worked through it all. Yes, there were a few tears!If this is what we have to look forward to in Becky Wade\u2019s new series, bring it on!I received a copy of this novel through Litfuse Blog Tours. This has not influenced the content of my review, which is my honest and unbiased opinion."}, {"userName": "Tima", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5300365-tima", "userReview": "Nora considers herself the smart sister. Her older sister Willow is the beauty, her younger sister Britt is the creative one. But Nora has wrapped herself up in her identity as a librarian even more since her fiance dumped her for another woman three years ago. She's sworn off dating and spends time working on her passion of genealogy. John, a former Navy SEAL is wanting to find his birth mother. So when he meets Nora at a training session put on by his company, he decides to enlist her services. He has a girlfriend, so Nora isn't an option and they both know it. But perhaps God has another plan for them.I've really been looking forward to this book since I read the prequel. It was everything I was expecting and a whole lot more. The characters are brought alive with the author's talented writing. I felt like I was living the story along side them. I lived on the west coast many years ago and I think the author did a great job of portraying the scenery and locations. There is humor, strong families, faith, and beauty in this story. But there is also heartache, pain, and brokenness. They were woven together so seamlessly that I thoroughly enjoyed the story as I rushed to read the ending, but after I put the book down I couldn't stop thinking about different aspects of it. The other sisters have major roles in this book that will make it easy to tie in to the next book in the series. If you love strong stories, with amazing characters who are flawed, but endearing then you need to read this book.I received a copy of this book.

Contemporary romance is not my favorite genre, but this captured my attention throughout for several reasons: wonderful characterization, a superb plot, and strong emotions. As a middle child, Nora Bradford felt like she didn't have the looks or talents of her older and younger sisters. So she immersed herself in learning, words, and genealogy particularly after the death of her parents when she was only a teen. I totally identified with her. Although not a middle child, I loved learning and was considered a \"nerd\" at school, loved words growing up with a cutthroat scrabble playing Grandma, and have been a genealogy addict for a good part of my adult life. But like the Pygmalion story, when Nora's older, beautiful, model sister does a makeover on her, a new Nora springs to life without losing the wonderful qualities she already has.Suave John Lawson, an ex-Navy seal, has discovered he has a serious health problem. As an adopted son, he wants to find his birth parents to see if this is a hereditary disease that might someday affect children he has. He turns to Nora for her genealogy expertise to try to locate his parents. Because she has never had much romance in her life, doesn't think that she's much to look at, and John is already involved in a relationship, romance is the furthest thing from either of their minds. As they journey together to find John's birth parents, they discover they have a lot more in common than they ever thought. As they begin to discover answers, they both find that their identities, their faith, and their relationship are challenged.This wasn't just a comfy, cozy, sweet romance. These characters were complex and faced difficult problems. Just when I thought the romance was going to have a nice, easy ending, Wade threw a powerful curveball just like what happens in real life. She didn't give John and Nora an easy way out, but rather had them find the strength within themselves and through God to deal with the heartbreak that life sometimes hands us. Definitely recommend this book and can't wait to read Willow and Brit's stories. Five star novel that made my 2018 favorites list.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"Who had time to watch football when there were so many fantastic books in the world yet unread?\" (Oh my, this is so true)\"What I've learned...is that the past might be challenging and the future might be unsure. And that's okay. The present is all we're give anyway. When we get to the future, God will be there. He'll supply whatever we need for each day.\"\"She couldn't continue managing five aspects of her life while delegating two to God. She couldn't continue managing even two aspects of her life while delegating five to God. It couldn't be Christ's will plus her will. It had to be Christ alone.\""}, {"userName": "Ronya", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7629781-ronya", "userReview": "Becky Wade pens contemporary Christian romance books. I have loved every one of her stories. I learn along with her characters, in each book, to trust God more in a variety of areas of life and through various situations.The cover of her newest novel, True to You \u2013 the first full-length novel in her Bradford Sister Romance Series \u2013 is beautiful. It sort of brings the past into the present with her family\u2019s gorgeous historical ancestral home.The Bradford sisters were a joy to get to know. The fascinating personality of Nora, the heroine, was refreshingly lovely and relatable. Her interest in genealogy was fun to read about since I am working on my own family history and her love of history was intriguing. Our hero, John, is a real-life hero although he would deny it. I love his commitment to his faith and the morals he demonstrated.The little town of Merryweather, and its residents are enchanting. I want to find a spot on a bench in front of the library and enjoy the ambiance. I am really looking forward to getting to know this town better in future books.Becky Wade wrote a prequel that is FREE (as of this writing) written in an epistolary style of writing. This means that the story is told via letters, emails, phone calls, etc. Then Came You set the stage beautifully for this new series.Whether you\u2019ve read all of Becky Wade\u2019s books and loved them or this is your first book by her, you will not be disappointed. Her books are entertaining, humorous, heart-touching and God-honoring. This one is not an exception. Enjoy!!"}, {"userName": "Kathy * Bookworm Nation", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075341-kathy-bookworm-nation", "userReview": "[talk of past abuse, rape (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Madison", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6951127-madison", "userReview": "True To You was part light and whimsical romance and partly a story of serious adversity and hard-hitting secrets that force the characters to be honest with themselves and God as they search for answers and love. Nora Bradford is a historian. A researcher. Someone who enjoys all things past. But her own past, particularly her romantic past, has left her slightly jaded, more than happy to remain safely single, and determined to rely on no one but herself for success. John Lawson knows what it's like to test himself and push himself to the very limits. Being a Navy SEAL ensured that. But a medical diagnosis has rocked him and driven him to uncover his own past and the story of his adoption. Nora and John are brought together by the past and enticed by a chance for the future. True To You was light and whimsical and fluffy. A delicious book to enjoy. It felt the littlest bit silly and wholly charming. And then, with a quarter of the book to go, a huge bombshell is landed. Wow!! I did not see that coming. Nor did the characters. But that's exactly when this book digs its heels in and becomes so much more than a fluffy romance - nothing wrong with those, of course - but with that twist this book looks deeper at God and accepting God's plans for one's life even when there seems to be only hurt and pain ahead.I really enjoyed True To You. I loved the way everything, from the romance to the family banter and secrets, is all handled. I was intrigued with the way the romance was developed and the choices the characters made. John is in a relationship when he meets Nora. Nora has been spurned by her fianc\u00e9 for another woman so both she and John know that their relationship is purely professional and that of friends. And that's the way they keep it. But neither can deny their chemistry or the brilliant joy that comes from spending time together - it just seeps from the pages. Both are human. Both are Christian. Both want desperately to do the right thing by all involved. That doesn't prevent them from wanting, and I liked how that part of their relationship was not ignored. The characters are realistic and flawed, right down to their mistakes, selfishness, and judgements.For readers who have already read the prequel novella, Then Came You, they will know a little about Nora's history and the story she shares with John as he shares with her his story of sacrifice while in the navy and his search for his birth family.True To You perfectly sets the scene for the next books in the Bradford Sisters Romance series. Both stories are poised and ready to go but I secretly hope that Britt's story will be first. I think her best friend has suffered in silence long enough. But then there is a certain NFL player who aggravates a certain other Bradford sister, so either way will be fine with me. One again, Becky Wade has crafted a story that is delicious to read, handles tough themes with grace and poise, and weaves God's love and truth together with scintillating romance. I can't wait to follow the Bradford Sister through the remainder of this series.The publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes.

In fact -- and this is totally a FIRST for me -- I actually read this book twice -- back to back. Literally reached the end and flipped it back open to the first chapter and started all over again. It tickled my fancy that much.Why you ask? I think because I totally connected with Nora. Maybe more than that -- she's kind of my clone in some ways. In fact I think the author has created the most relatable heroine in romantic comedy history. A bit nerdy, she spends her nights fangirling over a fictional character in a British drama. I was so convinced that Adolphus Brook and Northamptonshire were actually real that I spent quite a while googling both to see what all the fuss was about. :-) In short, Nora is just like us, ladies! Enjoying romance vicariously through the heroines in stories.And the whole thing starts off so snappy and funny and easy to read with plenty of laugh out loud moments. In fact the first time Nora meets John is sweet (and toe-curling) perfection. In fact she is so impressed with him that she uses her Ninja librarian skills to research him and then starts majorly crushing on him.For his part, John is oblivious. Nora is a means to an end and if he feels some unusual zings in the air when she's around, well, he's not going acknowledge it...much. He just finds her quirky and a little intense...and when there's a clash of opinions -- well, \"redheaded librarians who use big words didn't scare him.\" (p.33) Ha! Dream on, oh clueless hero. There is such great dialogue and almost-dialogue between these two. Especially with Nora. John will ask her a question or make a comment and we are privy to her outrageous love-lorn inner comebacks before she manages to vocalize something benignly appropriate. Honestly, those bits just stuffed me full of giddy.So there I am happily giggling my way through these pages when suddenly...shut the front door...what just happened? The author did not...she wouldn't...oh my goodness gracious, she did! Ms. Wade you have some explaining to do!!!!! And suddenly the romantic comedy has turned into something deep and desperate and achingly heart-wrenching and all I could do was silently (well, except for screaming insults at the author) watch helplessly on the sidelines.Seriously. My heart hurts. But it's grown some too because I've learned some important lessons right along with John and Nora. Like: \"...the past might be challenging and the future might be unsure. And that's okay. The present is all we're given anyway.When we get to the future, God will be there.\" (p 275)And did I mention that this is only the first of the Bradford Sisters Romance series? The author has done an excellent job of setting up the future books which will feature Britt and Willow.

I wasn't expecting that emotional punch when I first started reading the story, and I finished the book just feeling amazed by how good it was!Nora and John just clicked, to put it in Nora\u2019s words. They seemed like an unusual pairing for the first two seconds but then they seemed completely right together. I also liked Nora\u2019s sisters (can't wait to read their stories!) and the grandmother, with her glass-is-half-empty outlook, made me smile (though she probably would not have appreciated that). In addition, I completely relate to Nora\u2019s problem of figuring out where to make space for her books, haha. The little things the author added to these characters\u2019 personalities made them seem all the more realistic and relatable!I felt all the emotions in this story and loved everything about it.

Oh ya, because I used to think I didn't care for Contemporary Fiction...*hangs head in shame*...This book is so full of emotions, faith, heartbreak, and the most incredible romance. When Nora and John first meet, they think that is a coincidence. But as their story unfolds it becomes clear that God's hand was all over their relationship from the beginning...As in the VERY beginning. There were a few twists that took me by surprised. A few times that I literally laughed out loud, and I may have yelled at John...a couple times...But he figures it out eventually, thank goodness! Although I think my FAVORITE moment, was when I was reading and was still near the beginning of the book...I read the line that described Nora wearing her Hogwarts Alumni T-shirt...and I was wearing MY Hogwarts Alumni T-shirt! (Photo evidence below.) My nerd girl moment aside...True to You has many moments that speak to TRUTH and FAITH. Very well written with a unique style and new elements that I have not yet seen in a book. Behind the scenes look at our other characters and delves deeper into the thoughts and feelings of everyone involved. Becky Wade does not shy away from the difficult subjects that life throws at us. But she presents it in a way that glorifies the grace and mercy of God. An exciting story that will leave you filled with hope and encouragement that no matter where you came from, or what you have had to go through in life, that you are not alone.

In her wildest imagination, Nora would never have paired a bookish genealogist, who owns an entire historical village with a man who is an highly acclaimed national hero. Impossible! So imagine Nora's surprise when she receives a follow-up call from John, indicating that he would like her expertise in tracking down his birth mother. John Lawson can only afford to be mildly curious about the lovely understated Nora Bradford; after all, he is comfortably dating a beautiful woman, exclusively; but with no strings attached. Quite innocently, as he spends more time with Nora, following both legitimate leads and more than a few dead-ends, it becomes increasingly apparent that the chemistry between the two of them can hardly be ignored. Why now? Why her? Is it just meant to be, or will the truth that rises to the surface wound two tender hearts beyond repair? \"True to You\" streams a symphony of beautiful conversations; deep, genuine and satisfying, painting a lovely picture of the characters, while effectively moving the story line forward, as the author cleverly uses a variety of communication techniques to full advantage. Certainly intriguing, and quite romantic, Nora and John's story resonates with truth far deeper than the mystery of parentage, for two lonely souls must discover that their true identity lies within a relationship with their Creator, and He is always, without a doubt, totally enough.Becky Wade's \"Bradford Sisters Romance\" series has made an impressive debut!"}], "description": "After a devastating heartbreak three years ago, genealogist and historical village owner Nora Bradford decided that burying her nose in her work and her books is far safer than romance in the here and now.Unlike Nora, former Navy SEAL John Lawson is a modern-day man, usually 100 percent focused on the present.
