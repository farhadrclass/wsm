Joan Mulholland, a young white woman, joined the protest movement while in college and was present at every significant Civil Rights event. Joan was attacked and jailed for her conviction that \u201call men are created equal\u201d. Her story is one that should be shared with all children and her message is still pertinent in today's troubled society: \"Anyone can make a difference. It doesn't matter how old or young you are. Find a problem, get some friends together, and go fix it. Remember, you don't have to change the world ... just change your world.\"A terrific book for children Grade 2 and up, She Stood for Freedom is sure to generate worthwhile discussion with your children. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mississippi Library Commission", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6193041-mississippi-library-commission", "userReview": "Joan Trumpauer Mulholland was led by strong conviction to make a change in the world, and boy did she ever! This short biography, perfect for 3-5 grades, does an excellent job of detailing the Civil Rights Movement, especially in Mississippi where Mulholland spent a lot of time. Readers will learn about the historic Freedom Summer, true, but events like the Woolworth sit-in are also covered. The memorabilia and photographs were a great touch. Highly recommended, especially for Mississippi schools and libraries. Please note--there is also a picture book version of this title: She Stood for Freedom: The Untold Story of a Civil Rights Hero, Joan Trumpauer Mulholland"}, {"userName": "Kathleen Duffy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61742965-kathleen-duffy", "userReview": "I adore this woman!

Usually, we see really long nonfiction that may cover a person who made less than optimal life choices made into \"Young Readers Editions\" so we don't get all of the dirt on, say, Louis Zamperini's exploits in Unbroken. But to see a picture book version and one only 24 pages longer seems interesting. I ended up reading both, because our 7th grade is working to put together a Civil Rights unit and we were investigating biographies. I've included the ISBN numbers so if these look good, you get the right one for your library. Joan Trumpauer was raised in the South but felt from an early age that the way blacks were treated was unfair. Since she was a teenager when the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s was heating up, she got involved. Other white people gave her an especially hard time, and occasionally the blacks she was trying to help were wary of her, but she managed to be in a lot of important places with influential people. My school is predominately white, and there were some parents who complained that when we studied Civil Rights, there was no specific mention of \"good white people\". Interestingly enough, there are LOTS of fiction books from the point of view of white people who are sympathetic to the 1960s plight of black citizens. We need a LOT more books on various facets of the Civil Rights Movement. It was very difficult to find resources when we were doing the unit. I vastly preferred the 64 page version of this book, because it was easier to see the actual photographs and there was more information. I would have liked to have had some more information about Mulholland's life after the movement, or about the movement in general."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1095633-melanie", "userReview": "This story centers around Joan Mulholland, a white woman who grew up in Virginia in the 1950's who was passionate about the Civil Rights Movement. She was committed to do what she could and never backed down, whether her life was in danger or she wound up in jail.I read this book with my children and, even though it's not very long, it took us a while to read because we had some great discussions along the way. It's filled with short stories about some of Joan's experiences, with photos and typed or handwritten documents and letters to give a better feel for that time period. It was interesting to read about some of the historical events from her perspective. There were some stories that I wish had been a little longer.It's an inspiring read with a great message! Joan felt like an ordinary woman that saw a problem and decided to make a difference. I love her final line: \"Remember, you don't have to change the world...just change your world.\"I received a copy for an honest review. My opinion is 100% my own.Mel's Shelves"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1916952-barbara", "userReview": "This book is nice, but I'm not sure what the audience really is. Joan Trumpauer Mulholland was a young white woman who labored valliantly in the civil rights movement in the early 60s. In order to understand the import of her work, you really need to discuss white supremacy, which the book doesn't. I'm afraid that for kids the context would be unclear and the whole book might be puzzling. Maybe for white kids today it might be of interest because they may be hearing about Black Lives Matter and discussions of white allies need to do. But the answer today seems to be to change the minds of other whites about whether the work of dismantling white supremacy is done, and since the book doesn't touch those issues, it would be a stretch. Perhaps as a part of a bigger curriculum it could be useful. I don't see using it at School 22."}, {"userName": "Andrea Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33695634-andrea-williams", "userReview": "This a children's book written for little kids.

I had already burst into tears on the first page- actually, the introduction. I burst into tears at least 3 more times while reading. The story is just so powerful, and it was full of so many surprises. Spoiler: Joan is the girl in that famous lunch counter photo. She was at every big event in the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s: Freedom Rides, March on Washington, Sit-ins, Jail-ins. The full title of the book is: \u201cShe Stood for Freedom: The Untold Story of a Civil Rights Hero, Joan Trumpauer Mulholland.\u201d I\u2019m so glad I got this book from my school\u2019s media center, and I can\u2019t wait to give this book to every kid over age 8 (I\u2019ve decided this book is OK for ages 8 and over since no violence is shown, although some scary scenes are described\u2026 so maybe age 9). What sticks out to me the most about this book is how SHAMEFUL it is that such YOUNG people- 19 year olds!- had to fight for the freedom of American citizens to claim their basic rights of voting and safety. The Civil Rights Movement took at least ten years. Brown vs. Board of Ed was passed in 1954, yet schools were still segregated all over the south in 1964. The Civil Rights Act (outlawing discrimination? Really? How was that not already part of the law?!?) was passed in 1964, according to the helpful timeline in She Stood for Freedom. The Montgomery Bus Boycott started on December 1, 1955. Ten years later the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. We had to fight this hard to get people basic respect and rights? That was only 50 years ago. Only 52 years ago, the Civil Rights Act was passed. We SHOULD worry about if we are actually treating all Americans equally today. We SHOULD worry about how much racism still remains. This country was BORN with- it was built on- racism. If you read Cherow\u2019s bio of Hamilton, you know this. Jefferson could NOT agree to Hamilton\u2019s vision of a strong central government-- the one we have today-- because he had to protect Virginia\u2019s right (HA! A RIGHT!) to own slaves. I mean, I went to the dude\u2019s school, and did not fully realize what a total jerk he is until I read Hamilton. He looks vindictive in Hamilton: An American Musical, but in Chernow\u2019s book, he looks like a\u2026 hmm I don\u2019t want to say monster, since I walked his beautiful Academic Village for 5 years and learned so much there\u2026 but he looks like a\u2026 weak little jerk. But listen TJ, I love your school (let me guess- built by slaves) and pretty Monticello (let me guess- built by slaves) and I thank you for what I learned there and who I met there, and especially what I learned about African-American history there. You did a good thing by establishing a place to learn in that beautiful town. We learned ourselves right into our first black President, sucka! Anyway, I can\u2019t wait to work this book into my next unit, which is a research/writing unit on teen activists."}, {"userName": "Lauren Marlene Sanders-Jones", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7143093-lauren-marlene-sanders-jones", "userReview": "My sorority chapter read this book as part of our national reading incentive. Joan Trumpauer Mulholland, the subject of this book, was the first white woman to become a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated, my sorority. Her son Loki, the author, joined our virtual book club discussion of the book. We had a lively and enlightening discussion. Loki is an engaging book club meeting participant whose love for and pride in his mother are most evident and well-deserved. Joan Trumpauer Mulholland is a largely unsung hero of a time that was lethal for many of those who were brave enough to make a difference through the Civil Rights movement.

Books such as She Stood for Freedom help to meet this demand by combining a narrative with images of historic photographs, newspaper headlines, informational flyers, and even diary entries. The narrative is broken into easily readable chunks, which all have headings to make it easy to find what the reader needs. The description of what Joan and her fellow Civil Rights workers endured as they staged sit-ins, freedom rides, and other demonstrations is clearly told without dwelling on morbid details. The combination of straightforward description and visual images makes a book that can be used with middle grades and up to support lessons on the Civil Rights Era. The book also has a Civil Rights Timeline and original artwork by Charlotta Janssen.For those who have not heard of her, this is a wonderful introduction to the life and work of Joan Trumpauer Mulholland. The book covers everything from her childhood in Virginia and trips to visit relatives in Georgia, to her time working for Civil Rights and her later marriage and career. There are photos of Joan as a child, as a young adult during demonstrations, and even a mug shot from her arrest as a Freedom Rider. I particularly like the closing section, \"An Ordinary Hero.\" The explanation that Joan never saw herself as a hero, but only as someone doing the right thing is a great idea to leave young readers with as they finish the book. Her simple explanation, \"When something is the right thing to do, DO IT! It's that simple,\" can be used a starting point for meaningful discussions.Highly recommended for middle grades and up. I received an advance copy of the book for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372331-elisabeth", "userReview": "Wonky title aside, She Stood for Freedom is a strong nonfiction book for middle grade kids. It follows the life of Joan Trumpauer Mulholland, from the time when she was a young white girl growing up in segregated Virginia and Georgia in the 1950s, through her experiences during the Civil Rights Movement in Virginia and Mississippi in the 1960s, and ending in her adult years back in Virginia. The text is a fairly easy read and a lot of the potentially foreign concepts (sit-ins, jail-ins, freedom rides) are thoroughly explained. What fascinated me most were her recollections of her years spent in Mississippi and that is where the majority of the narrative lies. It gave me chills reading about events that took place in my state; I think this will make an excellent supplement to some Mississippi History classes. Mulholland's experiences at sit-ins, at Parchman (nearly as notorious today as it was 50 years ago), and during Freedom Summer were enthralling. The people with whom she rubbed shoulders read like a who's who of the CRM in my state: Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, Amzie Moore, Aaron Henry... There are a ton of pictures of memorabilia from the time period, as well as pictures of Joan and her friends/fellow activists. We're forever indebted to all of them for the progress that they forced into Mississippi.This is the very first ARC I've received from Edelweiss.

What did she do? \"Nothing. Nothing but act like an American.\" Joan stood and sat and spoke for freedom as a participant in some of the most iconic and important moments of the Civil Rights Movement. The book is written in a somewhat childlike tone -- it made sense when I realized the author is the son of Joan Trumpauer. Loki Mulholland recounts his mother's life and experiences with as they might have been told to him as a boy. In addition to various letters, cables, reports, photos, and other ephemera, the book has wonderful collage-like illustrations by Charlotta Janssen that expand Joan's story into the wider Civil Rights history. This would work well for readers of various ages -- a read-aloud for younger kids (8-12) and an independent read for teens and adults.

This book is for children in the middle grades, but can be of interest to both teens and adults, who want a simple and basic introduction to the Civil Right Movement. Being that this book was an ARC, an Advanced Reader Copy, this book had not yet been edited and the formatting was very much off. At times, it was a little difficult to follow since the text was on a different page, than the text underneath it on the same page. Most of the photographs, documents, and illustrations were either missing from the ARC or were unable top be read due to their size. Once this book is in its final stage though, it will be a good and informative book for middle grade children.

They faced many of the same challenges, but many also lost all their white friends.
