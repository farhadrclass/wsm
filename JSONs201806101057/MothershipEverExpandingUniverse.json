I can never resist a good pun. Plus I thought the bright, retro cover was super fun. (It's even cooler in person. The computer screen doesn't show how much the pink pops against the purple.)The reviewers were right: MOTHERSHIP is hilarious. Sixteen-year-old Elvie Nara's snarky, clever voice carries the novel. She's three months away from her due date when commandos invade the Hanover School for Expecting Teen Mothers (which is IN SPACE!) and tell the girls that their teachers are aliens. The chapters alternate between explaining how she got pregnant and the survivors' journey to get off the ship. (This journey is noticeably unimpeded by the pregnant girls needing to pee, having difficulty maneuvering, or any other issue you might expect to arise due to their physical condition.)But I couldn't quite gel myself to MOTHERSHIP's breezy tone. The trouble started when I realized Britta, another girl at the school, was pregnant by the same guy as Elvie. Naturally the girls hate each other more than Cheater McCan't-Keep-It-In-His-Pants. Lots of reviewers said sweet-but-dumb Cole grew on them as they read. But he didn't grow on me, particularly not as I realized exactly how bad of a position \"sweet\" Cole put Elvie in.Then there's the fact that the entire book is about young, pregnant women in danger and many of them die in horrible ways. I love black comedy, but I like my black comedy black. I don't like dead pregnant teenagers in my snarky one-liner comedy. Then there's the horrid awfulness that comes as more of the aliens' plans are revealed. It's invasive and gross and I can't believe none of the girls choose to terminate their pregnancies. MOTHERSHIP has a novel's worth of consent issues that are addressed for approximately three pages.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSPlus, why are all of them teenagers? What, the aliens can't impregnate grown women? It's particularly disturbing since the aliens are older than they look. Cole's only nineteen, but what if the other baby daddies are older?SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI absolutely loved Elvie and thought-her voice was spot-on. But she, her father, and best friend Duckie deserve a better plot than MOTHERSHIP offers them. Martin Leicht and Isla Neal have talent and humor, but the bright spots of MOTHERSHIP are offset by all the times I thought I was going to be sick."}, {"userName": "anilee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3833147-anilee", "userReview": "[the whole not-aging-aliens-impregnating-teenage-girls-without-telling-them-any-of-this-and-oh-by-the-way-delivering-this-parasite-will-render-you-sterile-but-we're-also-not-going-to-tell-you-that thing (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5388214-sophie", "userReview": "This is one of the most bonkers and OTT books I have ever read - and I really enjoyed it!

Turns out, I had a kidney stone. Regardless of that, when they admitted me I was given a nice and ugly wristband that declared me a \"fall risk.\" Why? Because a clumsy pregnant woman is not a safe place for a baby who's trying to grow.And even though I fell once during my pregnancy, it was once. Not enough to harm my baby. The amount of falls that these girls, particularly our main gal, take makes me question the safety of their babes. So unless these alien babies are super durable inside the womb, there's no way these teen moms can fall as much as they did without incurring some damage. I can force my imagination to reach pretty far, but some of this book is still grounded in realism and that's a fact I can't ignore. BUT, I know I'm being nitpicky.

Loved the characters, the whole plot; a creative idea!"}, {"userName": "Rashika (is tired)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8492956-rashika-is-tired", "userReview": "This book is exactly what the cover suggests it is. It\u2019s fluff. The question arises as to whether it\u2019s good or bad fluff and in my opinion, this book is fluff of the good variety. It didn\u2019t always feel that way though. The first 100 pages or so were incredibly painful. I kept questioning the sanity of our main character and my own sanity too for continuing to read a book I wasn't enjoying. The reason I read on, even though I wasn't having a swell time, was because the book was funny. I hoped that the book would get better as I went along and I was right, it did. It got insanely better and I started actually enjoying the book instead of just laughing at the funny parts.Elvie is our main character and happens to be knocked up. When I first found out about this series, I was intrigued by how the book would deal with teen pregnancy in a sci-fic setting. Worry not though, this book is not serious. It\u2019s pretty goshdarn funny and even if it makes you question whether the author is dealing with an important issue like this with the sensitivity it deserves. Sometimes, you don\u2019t want a deep and moving book! Sometimes you really just want some fluff.Going back to Elvie though. Elvie is snarky and obviously has mommy issues. This leads to her being detached from her pregnancy and the idea that she is actually having a kid.She calls her fetus goober from pete\u2019s sake. But Elvie is smart, and while she sometimes annoyed me with her slut shamming and her general outlook on some of her other peers, she still managed to be likeable because in spite of everything that had happened to her, she didn\u2019t spend a lot of time moping around. She took action!Cole on the other hand was an entirely questionable love interest. I despised him for the first 100 pages and questioned Elvie\u2019s sanity for being so head over heels for a doofus for whom she was the \u2018other\u2019 girl and who bailed the moment he found out about the baby. But we get explanations for his jerk behavior and while they aren\u2019t a 100% satisfying, they brought a much needed explanation as to how someone so smart as Elvie could love a dumbdumb like Cole.I guess the one thing Cole has going for him is that even though he may not be the brightest bulb, he is loyal and is definitely smarter than he is given credit for. Especially given the way his superiors discredited him. There were moments in their relationship that were adorable and I think what makes their relationship work is that Elvie isn\u2019t with him for his brains, she knows he isn\u2019t super smart, she\u2019s with him because he is sweet and caring (if dense at times).This book is very fast paced and if I remember correctly, a lot of it takes place over the course of 24 hours. It\u2019s got a lot of action and could be surprisingly brutal at times (meaning not everyone is alive at the end \u2026 including a character I had grown to love). I do like how the author paces the book though. It fits what the author is going and he does it just right so that the book never feels rushed. It feels exciting.This is a fun fluffy book and while it takes a bit to get used to, it is worth it since it\u2019s such a fast-paced cutesy read with a great futuristic setting and a bit of space opera (if it can be classified as such)."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928123-katie", "userReview": "I can already tell that Mothership is going to be one of those seriously underrated books. Before getting a copy for review I had heard nothing about it and honestly I probably wouldn\u2019t have purchased a copy at the bookstore just based on the summary and cover. Boy am I glad I gave this one a chance though. Mothership is a laugh-out-loud look at teen pregnancy in space. With aliens. Seriously, where could you go wrong?Elvie is one very unhappy pregnant teenager. When her dad found out she was pregnant he immediately enrolled her in the Hanover School for Expecting Teen Mothers. It seemed like a good plan and things were going okay at the school until the ship was hijacked by some dudes carrying ray guns. One of which just happened to be the father of Elvie\u2019s baby. Yeah, that\u2019s when things got really crazy. The dudes with ray guns have quite a few things to share with the mommies-to-be at the school and oh yeah they have to get off the ship before it crash lands to Earth. No problem, right? Wrong!Elvie was a total laugh. She is one of the craziest heroines you will ever read about. I mean, she\u2019s a crazy pregnant teenager trapped on a ship in space with the baby daddy who ditched her, some aliens, and her worst enemy. However she never once lets that bring her down. Instead she cracks jokes about everyone and everything. She has an amazing sense of humor and that\u2019s only one of the things I loved about her. She is also really brave (sometimes stupidly so), not afraid to speak her mind, a really good friend, and a good mommy-to-be to the Goober (as she calls the baby.)The rest of the cast was just as awesome. Britta was the perfect arch-nemesis. Cole was the lovable but totally stupid baby daddy. Ducky was the completely awesome best friend. Ramona was the cynical but lovable pregnant friend. Natty was the completely clueless but hysterical other pregnant friend. Really, the cast was a perfect mix of personalities and I couldn\u2019t help but love them all. Especially Cole. He was such a cute idiot. Even Elvie\u2019s dad was a pretty cool guy. The plot was edge-of-your-seat suspenseful! It doesn\u2019t take long for things to really take off (get it?) and it\u2019s a pretty non-stop action-packed book. There are explosions, tons of life-or-death situations, and even a few births. Throw in some flashbacks to before Elvie got pregnant and you\u2019ve got pretty much the perfect blend of action, romance, friendship, and suspense. It\u2019s definitely a one-sitting kind of read.Overall, Mothership is going right to the top of my recommendation list. Full of lovable characters, non-stop action, laugh-out-loud hilarity, and swoon-worthy romance, it\u2019s everything a reader could want in a book. Pick this one up now!"}, {"userName": "Lenore Appelhans", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613795-lenore-appelhans", "userReview": "This was such a nice surprise - a very funny sci-fi black comedy (I say black because there is a lot of death). Though Elvie's voice is sometimes a tad too snarky teen, I do have to admit she has some great one-liners. I love how smart and resourceful Elvie is no knocked-up damsel in distress here.

Sounds kind of crazy, right? Well, it is!What a treat! Wildly imaginative and inventive, with a smart, no-nonsense heroine with a wise-ass sense of humor. I grinned and chuckled through the whole thing. The story is super original and Elvie's voice is fresh and real. I was hooked from page one and blew through this in a day. This story takes a few teen cliches and dumps them on their ears. (And a few alien cliches, too!) The plot is tight and full of twists, and to top it all off is an \"oh, snap!\" ending I did not see coming, and that has me salivating for the sequel.I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, so I'm keeping it short and sweet. I pretty much loved it and I'm recommending it to all of my YA-reading friends. Worried about the teen pregnancy thing? Don't let it throw you off. This is a humorous alien adventure story, but it also has a healthy dose of \"See? This is what happens when you have unprotected premarital sex.\" And there are some more serious moments as Elvie contemplates her future and that of her child. Elvie and Cole make a great team of brains and brawn, but I am bumping down my rating a notch because I would have liked to see their backstory explored a bit more to make their feelings for one another more plausible. But can you really call it a complaint when your only issue is that you wanted more? If you're looking for something smart and sassy and totally new and different in YA, Mothership is it.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6338099-emily", "userReview": "I was not expecting to love this book as wholly, as passionately, as scream-from-rooftops ecstatically, as I do. I went in thinking it would just be a cute, goofy Teen Mom in space kinda adventure. Yes, it is all up in the teen-mom-in-space premise for the first 15 pages or so, until THE SPACESHIP IS INVADED BY HUNKY ALIENS. And it doesn't end there. There are multiple species of hunky aliens, potential alien-baby-daddies, at odds with each other, disparate groups of girls banding together and tapping into save-our-ass resources they didn't realize they possessed. I don't want to say much more, a) because so much happens in just a 24 hour period, it would take way too long to explain all the things that lead up to the BEST MOMENTS EVER that if you read this book yourself I could talk about with you, and b) all those things that happen, plot twists? Totally worth reading, and I don't want to spoil anything for you. And did I mention super hot aliens? Because this has them."}, {"userName": "Tabitha (Bows & Bullets Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840138-tabitha-bows-bullets-reviews", "userReview": "The review is also available on my blog, Bows & Bullets ReviewsI\u2019ll be totally honest, when I started this novel I didn\u2019t have a clue what it was about beyond the vague notion that it would involve aliens. I never read the synopsis. The thought process was simple, I just finished Second Chance Summer and while it was good, it was a bit of a downer and I wanted to read something uplifting and funny. I saw this little novel up on PulseIt and vaguely remember reading various reviews proclaiming it to be laugh out loud funny, so I thought I\u2019d read it while I had the chance. I\u2019m glad I did. The reviews were right, this book is one of the most original, funny stories I\u2019ve read in a while. Elvie Nara is in a fairly common situation, she\u2019s knocked up and the father disappeared right after hearing the news. She finally fesses up to her father (who I adore by the way) and she decides that the best thing for her is to enroll her in this new school for pregnant teens make on an abandon party cruiser that is orbiting the earth (which is possible because this book takes place in 2074). Perfect solution, right? WRONG. Everything goes rather smoothly for the first few months, or as smoothly as things can go for an expecting teen mother who\u2019s ex lover also happens to have father a kid with her archnemesis who is stuck in the same floating school and determined to make her life hell, until\u2026..Cue the dramatic music: ALIENS ATTACK! From that point on, Elvie\u2019s world gets turned upside down, which she didn\u2019t think was possible at this point. I can\u2019t really go into detail with the plot after this point because there are too many potential spoilers, but suffice to say that you\u2019ll never see a lot of it coming and you\u2019ll be rolling on the floor laughing if you figure it out. Everything that can go wrong does and Elvie ends up face to face with Cole (aka the father of \u201cGoober\u201d). I cannot say enough good things about this book. All the character\u2019s were completely perfect. Ducky is an amazing best friend and they could have easily pushed that into love triangle land but thankfully they don\u2019t. Instead of trying to be all Jacob and \u201cI love you and I\u2019m better for you\u201d, Ducky never confesses his love and just supports Elvie in every endeavor, no matter how deranged. Cole was the perfect leading man. He\u2019s hot and dimwitted and completely sincere in his affection for Elvie, though it\u2019s not apparent in the beginning. Then there is Elvie, who though I was irritated with in the beginning, turns out to be a completely badass lovable character. She\u2019s been dealt a shitty hand (though by her own admission, it\u2019s for choices she made) and instead of whining and moping about what could have been and how things should be, she just rolls with the punches makes sarcastic jokes as the goes. Thanks to all her younger years being raised by her father, she is a mechanical genius and that skill comes in rather useful for what\u2019s in store for her. Speaking of her dad, I love him. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a huge role in this novel, but the small amount you see of him makes me wanna give the guy a big hug. He\u2019s got a plan for any (well almost any) worst case scenario and when Elvie confesses that she is knocked up, his response isn\u2019t anger, but just acceptance and then he proudly digs out his \u201cteen pregnancy\u201d contingency plan and starts dealing with the current dilemma. The plot keeps you guessing until the end. Just when you think it\u2019s all over, something else happens. Just when you think they are all doomed, Elvie pulls a new plan out of her ass and saves the day. It\u2019s a delightful read and anyone looking for a kickass novel that will have you snorting for hours, this is your book!Quotes:\u201cDucky seems intent on working on a strictly psychological level. Like sneaking into Britta\u2019s house every morning to swap out her bra with a series of nearly identical brassieres with infinitesimally larger cup sizes, causing her to believe her boobs are shrinking.\u201d\u201cIf anyone can ever find a way to explain to me how carrying around a sack of flour with a diaper on it is supposed to prepare you for motherhood, I will personally bake that person a chocolate cake with my practice baby\u2019s insides.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nasty Lady MJ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026143-nasty-lady-mj", "userReview": "To see full review click here: http://yalbookbriefs.blogspot.com/201...Disclosure: I used to be a huge fan of Ancient Aliens (i.e. before I went to law school and had to allocate my TV time appropriately). The show was ridiculous on so many levels it was hilarious. Plus, some of the folklore they talked about was sort of cool. So I'm sort of into reading anything about aliens and boy does Mothership have them. I really, really liked this book. And admittedly it had some faults, but it brightened up what otherwise would've been a very dull week. I think the thing that made me smile about the book the most is it's originality. As previously mentioned I've always had a thing for aliens. Besides watching Ancient Aliens, I was very much into sci-fi when I was a kid. The thing is, usually sci fi takes on such a dark tone. I mean, haven't you seen Independence Day? Spoiler alert: the aliens try to kill all man kind. And while there were some dark parts to this book, there were other parts that just made you want to smile like Elvie. She was a hilarious and snarky main character. I really liked the fact that she was such an action oriented character and for that matter she knew how to fix things. While I might be your stereotypical girl who can't fix a car or tell you what sort of screwdriver to use, Elvie is brilliant when it comes to this sort of thing. And I really like the fact that she breaks these stereotypes.For that matter, I liked the other characters in the book as well. Nobody was perfect. Even the love interest-who FYI is dumb as a box of rocks. Usually I hate dumb characters, but there was something charming about Cole. Though I personally liked Elvie's best friend Ducky more. Yes, she has a friend named Ducky. And he's just as awesome if not more than his namesake.Mothership was also a quick read. The writing was clean and things happened throughout the book to keep the reader engaged. I never got bored with this book and that's a good thing. Besides the various maladies that happened on the spaceship, the tone of the book makes it engaging. Leicht and Neal don't take things seriously and that seems to help the book be a success. Honestly, if this book had more of a dramatic tone I wouldn't have liked it as much.Best Feature: Uniqueness: Lately I've been reading a lot of run of the mill YA books. May it be chick lit, dystopian fare, or a paranormal romance. Mothership is unique because it doesn't fit any of these genres and it doesn't take itself seriously. Plus, I really like the fact that this is a futuristic book but the future is not that different from the present. Okay, so there have been some advancements in technology but it's not like the Earth has transformed overnight like it would've in a lot of other YA futuristic books.Worst Feature: Science. Okay, as much as I loved this book the logical part of my brain was occasionally screaming at it for some scientific impossibilities. Case in point, running out of oxygen in space. First of all, most people can hold their breath for less than a minute. The whole holding your breath scene lasted about five and their were only two casualties that resulted. Plus, space's temperature is so cold that it would probably kill you within seconds.Appropriateness: This book deals with teen pregnancy, so if that's not a subject matter you like to read about then I would advise you not to read it. There is some cursing in this book, a very brief sex scene. But nothing extremely graphic."}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "Mothership came highly recommended from a number of highly trustworthy sources, but, I have to admit, I had a healthy dose of skepticism about me ever being able to appreciate it. I mean, it's a book about pregnant teens. I'm not a big fan of anything about pregnancy, let alone with a focus on teenagers. However, Leicht and Neal manage to craft a hilarious, albeit occasionally really gross, story out of the premise of pregnant teens in space.Though I try not to go too crazy comparing books to other books, since it doesn't tend to reflect well on either of them, I ust have to here. Mothership reminds me heavily of Libba Bray's Beauty Queens in the style of the humor, only, instead of beauty queens stuck on an island, we have pregnant teens on a spaceship. I didn't like this one quite so well, but I think that if you liked Beauty Queens, you will definitely appreciate this and vice versa.The best part of the book is definitely the humor, which Leicht and Neal keep up throughout. Elvie, the MC, has plenty of sarcasm and makes lots of hilarious observations. On top of that, the whole situation, and Elvie herself, are patently ridiculous, adding additional layers of laughs. There will definitely be a few moments that will make all but the most determinedly grim chuckle out loud. There's a wide variety of comedic styles, varying from potty humor to nerd jokes to irony, so Mothership is pretty much bound to tickle your funny bone one way or another.The whole pregnancy angle is handled quite well, I think. Though it's obviously a main theme and they do not gloss over it, there isn't so much focus on pregnancy that I couldn't handle it. I mean, there's discussion of birthing and the consideration of the baby bump, but the humor and Elvie's wandering mind keeps things from getting to bogged down in baby drama. Also, just because the girls are pregnant doesn't mean they're completely useless, which was nice.The reason I didn't like this book more than I did is the characters. They're funny and highly entertaining, sure, but I really don't like any of them. Elvie's probably the best of the lot, in that she's the only one to really have any depth of character, in that, despite the fact that she talks and acts like an airhead most of the time, she's really quite bright. Ducky and Ramona were my favorites, but they, like everyone else, really don't ever emerge from stereotype status. Britta was the worst by far, always remaining the classic mean girl airhead, and never showing the slightest glimmer of uniqueness. Cole, too, is completely unlikable to me, but he's not treated as such by the author, which is frustrating. This doesn't detract from the entertainment of the novel, but kept me from loving it.The ending sets up the next book nicely, but I do think it was a bit ridiculous, even within the context of this universe. While I cannot explain in detail because of spoilers, I think one of the twists at the end, regarding Elvie's baby, does not make any sense plotwise. There is absolutely no reason for things to have gone down the way they did, except to make things happier. If you're looking for a book to make you laugh, a nice break from dark contemporaries and dystopian drama, then Mothership is a perfect choice. I will definitely be reading the next book in the series, because you can always use more laughter in your life.3.5/5"}, {"userName": "StarMan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39901180-starman", "userReview": "[kill Cole horribly, painfully, and slowly) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Kavanand (Reading for Two)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3625197-kavanand-reading-for-two", "userReview": "Sixteen-year-old Elvie made a big mistake.

Things aren't too bad in outer space, if Elvie can ignore her late pregnancy discomfort and the presence of her nemesis (and rival for Cole's affection) Britta. Then one day, armed commandos storm the ship, and to Elvie's great surprise, Cole is one of them. He claims that her teachers are all aliens and that she and the other girls are in danger.

There are also a number of flashback chapters that explain how Elvie ended up in these circumstances. The best part of the flashbacks is the presence of Elvie's best friend Duckie, who is completely awesome.Elvie is a great character. She's tough, smart, and very sarcastic. Some girls would be overwhelmed at the thought of being 8 months pregnant, dealing with their ex, having to help save their fellow students, and avoiding the barbs of their nemesis, but Elvie takes it all in stride. She knows she made a big mistake in getting pregnant, but she's determined to get on with her life, which includes big plans to join NASA and help with terraforming new planets. Unfortunately, Elvie being so cool only highlighted Cole's shortcomings. He's the sort of hot but dumb guy that a smart girl might crush on in high school, but would probably be bored by once she got to college. He's sweet, but he just doesn't seem cool or interesting enough for Elvie, and he's nowhere near as entertaining as Duckie.Despite these shortcomings in the romantic lead, I really enjoyed Mothership.

Mothership is listed as YA but it is really for all ages. It is book One of the Ever Expanding Universe but what is expanding the most is the baby bumps each of the girls are sporting. So we have a Science Fiction book about pregnant teenagers. This should be a serious topic but the twist the authors put on why and how they ended up where they are is what is so unusual.There are serious moments and a lot of danger in the story. Elvie Nara is the main character in the book and she is a Jill of all trades. Her father made sure she knows how to fix almost anything and that skill is what saves lives when everything starts to go bad. Elvie reminds me a little of Kitty Katt, Gini Koch\u2019s character in her Alien books. Elvie has a solution for everything, is the leader when danger arrives and like Kitty has a very smart mouth. The two main males in her life are very different. Ducky has been her friend for most of her life and offers her as much support as he can when she is sent to school located in space and he is on Earth. Cole, father of her baby bump, is part of the rescue mission that arrives at the school (No one knew they needed rescuing). You don\u2019t want to like him but he does grow on you as the book progresses. There are some good secondary characters. Elvie\u2019s Father is wonderful and when you get to know him you understand how Elvie\u2019s mind works.The writing is great, the plot is fun and the characters are marvelous.

If the teen pregnancy story line makes you hesitant about it, let me tell you, there is so much more to the book than that.The science fiction aspect is engaging and readers will be fascinated by the concepts the authors introduce. So don't balk when you see pregnancy in the synopsis! Take a chance and I know you'll find yourself surprised by how much you love it.Our heroine Elvie will have you laughing so hard that you won't be able breathe! Her one liners are in abundance, and I loved her ability to make light of a situation, no matter how dreary. She has some serious spunk and doesn't let mean words phase her. Her ability to take charge in dire situations is enviable and I would definitely want to have her on my side if I got into trouble.The plot was definitely not at all what I was expecting, but in a good way. I thought it would focus on Elvie and her pregnancy woes in outer space, but it was so much more than that. It's about discovery, love, and learning to deal with some not-so-ideal situations. The sci-fi aspect was the best part and I was surprised to learn what I did. Readers won't expect what's coming!MOTHERSHIP is one of my most surprising reads of the year. I was intrigued by its plot from the beginning, but I wasn't expecting to love it near as much as I did. I can't believe there isn't more buzz around MOTHERSHIP because there definitely should be. I'm looking forward to more in this series and I have no doubt that the next books will be just as good!"}, {"userName": "Arminzerella", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella", "userReview": "Ok, here\u2019s a synopsis for you: Pregnant teens in space discover they\u2019re actually incubators for alien fetuses and the aliens are coming to claim them! Madness and mayhem ensue\u2026 Elvie decides to attend a special school/center for pregnant teens in space (technically, in orbit around Earth) when she discovers she is pregnant. And in the midst of pre-natal and high school classes, the center is attacked by aliens. Actually, the school is also run by aliens, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll discover along the way as the plot unfolds. Elvie is a smart, independent girl, and she has no intention of being bullied by a bunch of dreamy alien dudes. So, until she figures out exactly what\u2019s going on, she\u2019s going to look out for herself and the other girls.Funny and slightly off-color, with a gutsy, lovable heroine, this should tickle your funny bone \u2013 especially if you\u2019re a fan of Beauty Queens, by Libba Bray (this has a similar sense of humor and style). This is the first book in the new Ever-Expanding Universe series, and it\u2019s a great series opener \u2013 complete in and of itself, but with an intriguing hook that will leave readers eagerly anticipating the next volume. Some offensive language.Excerpt: As I hurdle down the garbage chute, a lot of things should be racing through my mind. Instead my only thought is, Way to go, Elvie.I am often incredibly sarcastic when addressing myself.Really, I try to reason, I had no alternative. I didn\u2019t want to knock poor Cole\u2019s stupid lights out, but neither could I sit idly by and let my destiny be decided by warring factions of extraterrestrial hotties.

This is what Beauty Queens should've been like--I respect Libba Bray, but why did she hafta go about trying to redeem her ridiculous characters one by one, in the most boring ways possible? The authors here instead just go for the laughs, and it delivers. Note to parents/teachers: there is some swearing in here, but it stops just short of printing the f-word. Potentially more sticky than the language is the issue of abortion/choice, although the fetuses in this case turn out to be alien parasites that only look like humans--not actually humans at all. Predictably, Elvie decides to keep hers, knowing full well that the baby will grow up to be extremely good-looking and talented as well (joining the ranks of other alien geniuses as Mozart and James Dean), even if (most likely) she'll be rendered infertile in the process of giving birth. My other issue with the story was that her love interest, Cole, is awfully skeezy (intentionally impregnating 2 teens girls with his alien spawn, knowing full well they're not wanting to be moms yet--Elvie, at least, is on the pill--and that they won't be able to have kids of their own afterward) and definitely not deserving to be forgiven so easily. But we'll have to see what happens to Elvie and Cole (and Britta) in the next book(s)."}, {"userName": "Austin Zook", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5610341-austin-zook", "userReview": "A novel with a fun premise and breezy prose. While I wasn't in love with it, mostly because I got tired of the protagonist and her teenage-isms after awhile, I did enjoy it--especially the latter half, which I felt moved along at a much more appropriate pace for a pulpy sci-fi novel about pregnant teens in space than the beginning.The characters are pretty cookie-cutter (bitchy cheerleaders, the weird art kid, and so on) and it read like a high school flick in space, which it is, so take that how you will. There's a blurb on the back calling this a mash-up of Juno and Alien, but in book form, which I think is going a little far, but it'll give you an idea of what you've got in your hands with this one.By far, the most impressive thing about this book was how well the authors layered their reveals. They played their cards just right, so that the plot continually thickened without giving the reader information overload at any point. I was impressed with the pacing of the revelations about the aliens.Less impressive were the aliens themselves, who go around impregnating and making barren human women to propagate their species, but justify it because the alien babies contribute to our society with art and politics. And those were the good ones.If you like quick, light sci-fi reads about pregnant teens in space and weird, morally-dubious aliens, this should be right up your alley. And if it turns out that I'm wrong, it shouldn't take you long to finish anyways."}, {"userName": "Stacey B.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2432267-stacey-b", "userReview": "OVERALL IMPRESSION: The book didn't pull me in as much as I wanted it to. I really like the idea of the story, as there aren't many YA books about aliens out on the market, but I had a hard time connecting with the plot and the characters. There is a little bit of humor added throughout the book which lightens the mood a little bit and the chapter titles are pretty entertaining. The ending -- AHH! I immedieatly checked online to see if/when the sequel is coming out. Good news -- there is a sequal, but no word that I could find on when it is coming out. I was leaning towards a 2.5/5 stars for this book, but the ending made me bump it up to 3 stars. I can't wait to see where the authors are going to go with the story.CHARACTERS: I didn't really feel a connection with any of the characters in the book. I feel like I didn't get to learn enough about them. I guess my favorite would be Ducky. He is Elvie's (the main character) best friend. He truely seems to care about Elvie and wants to protect her. Cole is the father of Elvie's baby. I didn't see the appeal that he had over Elvie. I just didn't care baout him. He tries to be sweet, but I don't see how any of the choices he makes are okay in Elvie's eyes.COVER: I love it! It doesn't get better than pink and purple! It's super vibrant and girly.*I received a copy of this book from Amazon Vine for review."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/918370-suzanne", "userReview": "When Elvie Nora finds herself knocked up at sixteen with an absent baby daddy she had a big decision to to make.

While orbiting the planet with forty-some-odd other pregnant teens, the school is raided by helmeted commandos and the teachers start trying to drown the girls in the school pool. Turns out the teachers are aliens with a nefarious plan for all those babies. To complicate matters, when the helmets come off of the would be rescuers, one turns out to be Elvie's missing baby daddy, and he got more that one bun in the over on the cruse ship.The novel, the first in the new Ever-Expanding Universe series, is both ridiculous and hilarious. It's the perfect combination of comedy, action, science-fiction, and romance; A true treat for young nerd girls everywhere. And as far as female heroins go, Elvie is a wonderful example for young girls. She is intelligent, cunning, brave, and decisive.

I asked for a recommendation and Mothership got handed to me. I don\u2019t think I ever would have picked it up myself. Neither the blurb or cover would have called to me but I enjoyed this \u2013 a lot.Elvie is stuck in a school for expectant teen mum along with the one girl she loathes, which is bad enough. They\u2019re in space, with a shoddy connection to Earth so Elvie doesn\u2019t get to talk to her best friend that much and then the ship gets boarded by aliens.Mothership is a lot of fun, basically because Elvie\u2019s narration is so brilliant. She\u2019s an excellent character. I was cheering her on from the moment she manipulated the vending machine into giving her that disgusting sounding pudding.If you\u2019re after a book to entertain you, makes you laugh, provides some good line-liners while ducking alien\u2019s then Mothership is for you.

I\u2019d just finished reading an intense dystopian and needed something to lighten my mood.

Despite my initial reservations, I decided to hold back all judgements until I actually read the book. Well, I\u2019m glad to announce \u201cMothership\u201d certainly manages to lighten the mood ;p. Parts of the book were definitely cheesy, but I really enjoyed Elvie\u2019s sarcasm. There were some great action-packed scenes, which was awesome.

It's nice to read a book about teen pregnancy that isn't all doom and gloom and depressing. There's nothing really WRONG with this book that brings it down from four stars -- it's just not really the kind of book I gravitate towards?
