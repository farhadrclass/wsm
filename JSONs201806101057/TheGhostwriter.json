That\u2019s the beauty of an Alessandra Torre novel though and exactly what sets her work apart, in my eyes. Every time I pick up one of her books, I know I\u2019m about to embark on a unique journey. Believe me when I say, a cookie cutter is not a tool you\u2019ll find in this author\u2019s arsenal. Whether it\u2019s romance, suspense or in this case, contemporary fiction, Alessandra Torre is a master at pulling-punches, knocking the reader off-kilter and delivering jaw-dropping twists. In those moments when she isn\u2019t using her words to pull the rug out from under you, she\u2019s dragging you through an array of emotions, making you feel exactly what her characters are experiencing\u2014be it the giddiness of love, the pain of losing it, utter heartbreak or even disgust. As a reader, is there anything better? It\u2019s hard to pinpoint Helena\u2019s redeeming qualities, especially when you first meet her. She comes off as cold and harsh, governed by endless amounts of self-imposed rules. Her grim outlook on life would never lead you to believe that she is in fact the author of fifteen love stories, earning her a prominent name in the industry. It\u2019s a major blow that gets her to ditch her latest work-in-progress and starts the countdown\u2014three short months to write the story of all stories . . . her truth. It\u2019s Helena's one chance to come clean and bring to light an alternative version of the events that took place four years earlier\u2014the day she lost everything.\n\u201cIf you lie enough times, no one believes your truth.\u201d\nFor this reader, the magic of the story was in Alessandra Torre\u2019s ability to taunt me with the shocking tidbits of truth she sprinkled throughout Helena\u2019s unburdening. A series of memories, flashbacks and scenes written in Helena\u2019s words were used to deliver the bombshells. Executed at just the right moments, I found myself seething with anticipation of what was to come next. Even though Helena isn\u2019t the most lovable character, you have to give her credit, she never once claimed to be anything other than who she was\u2014a woman driven by her need to put pen to paper, to have the freedom to breath life into the scenes that played out in her head\u2014everything and everyone else be damned. The one person that managed to bring out somewhat of a softer side of Helena, if you can even call it that, is actually quite surprising. It\u2019s the ghostwriter that adds some much needed heart and balance to the sea of grey. Keep the tissues handy because the ending is a doozy. It\u2019s soul-crushing in many aspects and highlights the fact that sometimes we get so wrapped up in our own heads, we\u2019re blind to what\u2019s really going on all around us. *Thank you to Alessandra Torre for a copy in exchange for an honest review and for keeping this reader on her toes, once again."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpress.com/Alessandra Torre has written many novels but this is the first I\u2019ve read.

I loved it!We are told right from the start that this isn\u2019t a romance novel.From the blurb: \nThis book is not a romance. It is contemporary fiction, but very suspenseful in nature. It is about a famous romance author and a dark secret she keeps.\nI realized early on that this book was going to break my heart. But it did it in the most incredible way. This is another book that is going to stay with me for a very long time.\n\"A perfect morning. A perfect husband. A perfect daughter. A perfect lie. \"\nHelena Ross is famous for telling stories. She has millions of fans and has sold over fifteen bestsellers. She\u2019s a difficult woman to like. A woman with many secrets. A woman who rarely smiles. In her house with so little furniture and locked rooms. What happened in that big rambling house four years ago?Helena receives some bleak news\u2026.But truthfully she had been waiting for something like this. Now she will write just one more book. This news comes as a huge shock to her agent, Kate. Helena has had tight deadlines before, but this will be the tightest. The story would normally take years to write. Will she be able to do it? Is it possible? She's written fifteen novels but this is the novel that terrifies her.\n\"I fear that I'll tell everything, and still no one will understand\"\nIt\u2019s easy to dislike Helena at first. To say Helena can be hard to work with is like saying\u2026..snow is cold. She has strict rules for her agent. Kate has been with Helena for thirteen years. Thirteen years of high maintenance and unpredictability.\n\"She'll rip your heart out, but she doesn't mean it\"\nHelena just wants the readers to understand how she felt, her emotions and why she made the decisions and mistakes that she made. She knows that many will judge her\u2026but she hopes at least a few will understand. She spent four years trying her best to forget everything. So can she do it? Can she pick up the pen and write down what happened that day?\n\"Soon\u2026 My final story will come out, and everyone will know the truth.\"\nThe story is told in the present tense, mixed with flashbacks and memories. Told from multiple perspectives, we are pulled along, not really knowing what has happened or what is going to happen. But the whole ride is captivating.\n\"Sometimes, it only takes an instant to understand a person\"\nAn excellent plot with fantastic characterization, this really was an incredible read. A well-written, well-paced novel about secrets, betrayal, guilt, lies, and confession. This is Alessandra Torre\u2019s fourteenth book and she says it was the hardest to write. Alessandra Torre says:\n\"I hope you felt the love, sweat, and emotions that went into each of these chapters\"\nI can say with complete honesty that I did.I read this book with some of the Traveling Sisters.

I should go to sleep as I have work tomorrow and an early start. Instead, I am sitting here and thinking back to my first Alessandra Torre experience. I was new to Goodreads, made a few friends and was somehow directed to a little series. The first entry was To Have, Part One of The Dumont Diaries.From the start, I was taken with it... So taken, I took it upon myself to reach out to the author and let her know. I wrote to her and surprisingly enough... She wrote back. From that first contact, I was lucky enough to get to know the person who was responsible for those words which captured my imagination.That was in August of 2013. Alessandra Torre has written a lot of books since then. She has done many different types of romance books. All of them crafted, focused and with a specific flavor. Some darker than others, some maybe more RomCom... but all of them clearly sit in the Romance category. This book... Not a Romance at All. But this Book...is the one where you get to say... You knew all about the author, Alessandra Torre, before everyone else did. Because this book is the kind where other readers of Women Fiction, Thrillers/Mysteries, Psychological Dramas... those readers are going to discover her and think they have found something special....But you will be able to say...Smugly...You knew she was special all along.....and it's nice to see others catching up.Now you might think, damn that is some praise...It must be a bit off... going on and on about this book to say all of this...and that could be true...But for me...this book struck a chord...The idea of it all and how it was done... The way we were led down a path we knew was going to be difficult... but didn't know why...The way all of the layers were stripped away and what was left was the raw, real experience...I am sorry I cannot tell you anything specific... I truly feel you need to go into this with just the blurb.

This final book?It's my confession.\"A perfect morning. A perfect husband. A perfect daughter. A perfect lie.\"The Ghostwriter is Alessandra Torre's latest, and greatest, new release. It's the kind of novel you go into blind and finish a changed person, pushing it on your fellow readers and trying desperately to not giveaway the story while still convincing them \"they have to read it now.\" Okay, maybe that's just me. It's an unpredictable novel, with the main character most kindly described as emotionally vacant and mean. The reader gets to know Helena's inner-most thoughts from first person point of view, while also seeing her from the outside perspective of a handful of secondary characters written in third person perspective. Alessandra Torre further adds to the novel by giving us a book within a book, the start of each chapter of Helena's novel providing us glimpses into her past and the events that left her closed off and aloof. We discover she isn't vacant of emotion, rather she's drowning in them and fully aware of the mistakes she's made as a wife and mother. \"Soulmates or Tragedy. And sometimes, both.\"I had tears in my eyes 20% in, I was exclaiming out loud by 40% that this was such an amazing book, and at 70% I tweeted that I suspected this had a chance of being my top read of 2017. I never could have predicted the ending, the twists, the past that had turned Helena into the witch the townsfolk never saw. Helena is difficult to like, but she's impossible not to feel for. My heart broke for her, I ached over the life lessons she never should have had to learn, and I hoped so dearly that something positive could come of her terrible prognosis. Helena is a fierce woman and it was incredible to read the book from her perspective. The secondary characters were phenomenal as well; I loved the little bits of gossip that made Helena real, the people who come to her side unwelcome, but necessary, and the constructive change they brought to her bleak world. I felt every emotion as I read The Ghostwriter and I slipped into this book like it was my life too, it was like being a writer myself. It was captivating, heartbreaking, and so profound.\"It's not hard to imagine a happier version of you.\"I am a massive fan of Alessandra Torre and I thought I knew what I would be getting out of The Ghostwriter, but it was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. It's a stunning novel that highlights Alessandra Torre's storytelling ability and her strength as a wordsmith. I was held captive by this book from beginning to end, not even tears and the suffocating emotions that the book brought on could stop me from reading. Though it is about a very challenging subject matter, I think the original story line and the pacing of the novel took it from uncomfortable to thought-provoking. The Ghostwriter doesn't read like previous novels from Alessandra Torre, it's an outstanding example of her versatility and will captivate fans of all genres. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would, because The Ghostwriter is absolutely my Top Read of 2017.\"We all have a Happily Ever After, each story just needs to pick the right time to claim it.\"ARC provided via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "SueBee\u2605bring me an alpha!\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15735368-suebee-bring-me-an-alpha", "userReview": "LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK | B&N | KOBO | iBOOKS |A MYSTERY.

She is a well known romance writer, and she has just had some terrible news. She has also had a horrible event in her life, with both things combined, she decides she needs to make her story known. Not sure she is capable of writing her story, doing it justice, she asks her agent to get her a ghostwriter. This book was utterly fantastic. So much more than a thriller, it is more like an inside view of the disintegration of a life, a person. Because Helena is no longer who she was, no longer has any control over what has happened, or is happening in her life. The story is told by Helena herself, alternating with that of her agent, and the person who becomes the chosen ghostwriter. Who this person is was a big surprise. It is wonderfully written, with bits and pieces revealed at a time, small clues strewn here and there, leading to many guesses by this reader. The story leads you where the author wants to take you, in her own time, and the big reveal, was just that, big. This is a book that sucks one in and doesn't let go, the tension, the suspense created, made this an a book that was for me impossible to put down.

The Ghostwriter is one of my top reads for 2017. Helena Ross has a story to tell. And oh my goodness what a heart crushing, dark, and deep story it is. Helena has written successful romance novels over the years...but this LAST novel is a story that is rooted personally with dark secrets oozing out. Helena instructs her agent Kate to hire a ghostwriter Marka Vantley to help her write her own story. Marka and Helena don't have the best relationship.. while Helena sends out harsh emails to Marka degrading the author's talent. Marka shows up to Helena's home with her ridiculous over the top \"lists\" and rules that she has for others to follow. Helena comes off as a harsh and cold woman... that has a serious hate to life. Alessandra Torre slowly reveals Helena's story alternating from the past and present. Torre's characterization is so amazing and the story is so beautifully written. Torres has such a perfect balance with showing the darkness that unfolds in her characters. The pacing was perfect and each layer was slowly revealed to the readers keeping you on edge! One of my favorite quotes in this book which I think sums up the book perfectly in so many ways \"That is how life is, it gives us burdens to carry and doesn't give a damn about the weight.

This is a contemporary suspense read with challenging subject matter but with the kind of writing that beautifully navigates you through the difficulties.There are three main characters in this story but Helena is at the helm. She's an author but this time she needs a ghostwriter to help her tell this story and it's her autobiography she's telling. Her husband Simon is at the fore, as is the ghostwriter Mark.\"I hate Simon with my entire soul, and I love him with every other inch of my body, and neither really matters.\"Helena is a character that is rather hard to like. She was a hermit to all intents and purposes. The why of this was a question I asked of the book all the way through. I felt compassion for her but the more I got to know of her behaviour to other human beings, of the realities of her parenting, the more I struggled with who she was. I questioned her mental health, diagnosing disorders but it didn't really matter. Over time, I came to an understanding of who she was, of her self awareness and her fight for others. I admired her.A lot of this story is about Helena and Simon, on the face of it their marriage was uncomplicated, underneath, it was so complicated that it took the whole book to fathom the depth of the secrets, lies and subversive deceit. I'm not even going to speak to my feelings regarding Simon but it felt 'off' early on.\"Maybe we're normal. Maybe every husband drives his wife crazy. Maybe every wife falls short. But it doesn't feel normal. It feels like we are at war. A war I am losing.\"As Mark helps Helena to tell her story, something special happens, a chink of light, of friendship. Mark was my ray of good in this book and I admired his friendship towards Helena, complex though it was. Mark was carrying all the same questions that I had as a reader, waiting and waiting for the answers.\"We are climbing the hill towards the climax, though Mark doesn't know that yet. He has no idea that all of these pieces, all of the stories, are blocks of dynamite, carefully placed and positioned for eventual explosion.\"The book started as hugely intriguing, even a little mellow. The suspense built and built to crescendo of need to know the answers and I blew through the last 30% to reach the conclusion. What happened was utterly unexpected, the whys, the how's and the tragedy. The context of the answers were difficult to read but ultimately fulfilling in what was a excellently developed story with characters that don't often come along. I am a fan of all the genres Alessandra Torre has written, I've read all of her books but I favoured the 6e series. THE GHOSTWRITER is her best work to date. I am emotionally drained and at a loss after reading this book because it was just that good.A copy of this book was provided by the author through netgalley in return for a honest review.Reviewed for Jo&IsaLoveBooks Blog."}, {"userName": "Theresa Alan", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan", "userReview": "This novel is dark and slightly depressing but good.

She\u2019s not just introverted, which many writers are, she\u2019s cantankerous and bitchy. She didn\u2019t initially want to have kids, but her husband Simon convinced her to. She also wasn\u2019t always the perfect mother, which her husband and mother used against her.

Phew....How can one love a book while simultaneously hating the main character? Huh?There's no doubt in my mind that Torre is one of the best authors of the contemporary fiction genre. And The Ghostwriter is a testament to how she's evolved as a writer. For one, the pacing manages to keep one engrossed from prologue to epilogue with \u0135ust enough back story to keep you wondering what was this damning secret.Weirdly, this story is reminiscent of Mud Vein because not only are both protagonists authors but they are, easily, the least likeable and monumentally selfish characters that I've read. Ever. But unlike Mud Vein, I actually loved this book although I absolutely disliked, Helena, our main protagonist. I mean, this was a woman who was dying from cancer yet I couldn't find a modicum of sympathy for her plight. But you know, I think Torre doesn't actually want us to like Helena. I think knowing what an awful person she was made the story infinitely more impactful so when we eventually get the big reveal, it feels authentic. Like, yes, I can see how she would be capable of doing what she did. As with most psychological thrillers, the journey and the whodunit are what keep the reader engaged which Torre parses in measured intervals and as we navigate Helena's past, she even succeeds in eliciting our empathy.Eventually, we get the big reveal and, OMG, it was tragic on too many levels. Too many."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "Pause for a moment......Pull up a chair and sit with me a while.The Ghostwriter beckons like a Shapeshifter in the darkest corner of the room. It transforms itself from one level of recognizable existence into the blurred, uncertain vision of the next. Elusive and quite daunting.Helena Ross has a story to tell. As a successful young author, her hand has rocked the cradle of many a romance novel. But there is a definite sense of urgency to this one. Life has given her a deadline unlike the ones demanded by her publishing company. Helena has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has only three months to live at best. Knowing that the writing process may exceed her own limitations, Helena instructs her agent, Kate, to contact a particular fellow author to ghostwrite parts of the book for her. Over the years, she has sent Marka Vantly snarky emails derailing this author's books. But Helena knows that no one else could possibly match her style like Marka.As Marka and Kate show up for their meeting at Helena's home, they are met with a venomous list of \"rules\" taped by the front door. It's evident that the entrance way bears no welcome mat. The chill that they feel doesn't come from the weather. It wafts from Helena herself who begrudgingly allows them to come in. The interior of the home is practically barren. It reflects the standoffish vibes coming from Helena herself. They arrive at a business deal and the writing will take place immediately.....no time to waste.Alessandra Torre, herself, is a gifted writer. She reveals \"the story\" in a then and now format with Helena slowly filling in the blanks of her past. Her highly guarded persona and her refusal to allow anyone to come close is extremely significant to this storyline. She spits out insults and sinister retorts like a gumball machine loaded with pennies. Helena covets this process of dying as the final culimnation of her life's darkest secret. She must purge herself of it before she breathes her last.The Ghostwriter must be experienced rather than just revealed. And Torre does an exceptional job with this. She is a wizard with portraying her characters with the focus of transparent light and the self-imposed barriers of one's own darkness. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and at times humorous. Believe me, this book will have you sitting in that pulled up chair lost in your own thoughts at the end. Speechless is about right.......I received a copy of The Ghostwriter through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to Alessandra Torre for the opportunity."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "5 Stunning Stars! \u00a0THE GHOSTWRITER was a spectacular read that left me absolutely speechless upon finishing it and was quickly placed into my favourite reads shelf for 2017! THE GHOSTWRITER by ALESSANDRA TORRE is a beautifully written novel that is so emotionally moving about a famous romance novelist Helena Ross that wasn\u2019t always the most likeable person but definitely the most interesting and in the end she totally captured my heart. \u00a0I have never been so moved and touched by a novel before like I was with this one. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ALESSANDRA TORRE delivers an extremely impressive, well-written, well-paced and touching story here with well-developed characters that was interesting, heartbreaking and captivating to read. \u00a0I was totally engrossed in this novel from start to finish and it was extremely hard for me to put down. The way that this story was written is one of my absolute favourite ways as I love books that are about writers and stories within stories as I find them so fascinating and so interesting to read. \u00a0I also really enjoy when an author drops little shocking tidbits of truth along the way for us to pick up on and chew over which always keeps me guessing and eagerly waiting in anticipation of what is coming next. \u00a0I like not knowing what is coming next until it is right upon us and then when the big reveal happens I am totally blown away.What an emotional and powerful end for a beautifully written book that I won't soon forget! \u00a0Would highly recommend!!This was an absolutely wonderful book to have shared and discussed with our Traveling Sisters and I thoroughly enjoyed the reading experience!

I read the book blurb and I made assumptions about what the book would be about based on what limited information I was given. I was wrong, and I loved it.Helena Ross is a successful Author who has quite a prickly personality. She lives by rules - just come to her house you will see some on her door! She is not the most likable character - she rarely smiles, is gruff, comes across as cold, likes to get to the point, and doesn't appear to have any friends.Helena makes an announcement to her agent, Kate, that she is going to write her last book. A book which she is not willing to divulge what the book is about. Kate decides to pay Helena a visit and is shocked at what she finds. While discussing the book, Helena informs Kate that she is going to require the assistance of a ghostwriter to help her complete the book in the tight deadline she has set. Kate helps her connect with the Ghostwriter and *BAM* this is where the magic happens.As Helena and the Ghostwriter begin writing the most important book of Helena's career, the reader is given glimpses into Helena's life, her past, why she lives the way she does and why this book is so important to her.This book is told through a past and present story-lines with various character's POV's. This book is well written, with a gripping story-line that sucks you in and won\u2019t let go. As the reader learns more and more about Helena and her Ghostwriter, both characters grow on the reader and each other. **This is not a romance ** Just good old fashioned storytelling with riveting characters. I especially enjoyed that I really had no idea what this book was about. It does have a twist which packs a nice little PUNCH. I also liked that as the book progresses the tension and suspense mounts- this is not your typical page turner - but gosh darn it I had to keep reading to learn why it was so important for Helena to write this book! There are not a lot of characters in this book and there doesn't need to be. I appreciated the character development and how this aided in the *impact* of the twist in this book. There will be that \"aha! now some things make sense!\" moment for the readers. This is both satisfying and heartbreaking. I thought this book was brilliantly told and loved how the plot unfolded.

It turned out to be so much more than I envisioned at the start. At first I thought we might be headed for a work of women's fiction, but instead found myself reading a gripping, well-plotted story with good characters, surprising twists and suspenseful pacing to the text.Not sure how I missed this one last year, but what a great addition to my January reads!

It can provoke you to tears, it can shock you, it can make you feel strong emotions. The Ghostwriter is a good read! It has a unique plot with one twist after another. It was hard to read some parts because their pain was real and gut wrenching. This story hits all the points required to warrant 5 stars. Helena, a famous young author, has a grave illness and does not have much time to live. Her final wish before she dies is to write a book confessing deep dark secrets from her past. Obviously it is a difficult topic but the author somehow created a story I wanted to read and not put down. The characters are well established and this makes the story realistic and believable. I felt that the book captured Helena's emotions well. She's very selfish at times, but then I suppose in this situation who wouldn't be at some point? I can't reveal special spoilers but this book takes a twist that it melted my heart, I felt everything with Helena. The ending was infinitely painful and heart-breaking. Books hardly ever make me actually that emotional so this was special.

I had no idea what to expect from this story and was surprised it turned out to be such an emotional journey. I found myself in a mess of tears a few times. I had a love/hate relationship with the main character, Helena Ross, an international bestselling author. Her personality was negative to the point that I found myself cringing while reading several of her inner thoughts and personal interactions with others. Yet, I found myself deeply sympathizing with her situation. I felt fully drawn into her world, feeling her emotions over her past and contemplating her life decisions.Overall, I enjoyed the writing and storyline, I just wished the pace was a bit quicker.

A perfect morning. A perfect husband. A perfect daughter. A perfect lie. This is a book that I devoured, hungrily, yet a book in which I savoured every word. It is a book in which I became completely absorbed. It is intense. It is vivid. In its own way, it is scary. It is painful. It is wonderful!

Only that it's the story of her life.And since she doesn't have enough energy to write a book she would normally have a year for, in three months - she hires a ghostwriter.

Please Netflix, come do this!!!Marka was also really great - a good friend to Helena in that last chapter of her life.What can I say without spoiling anything...Don't expect a romance.Don't expect a happy end.Expect a bit of crazy and weird.Expect to feel.Expect to be thoroughly entertained and left with a lot to think about.\nTHE GHOSTWRITER was such a heartbreakingly sad story.

I have been trying for two weeks to pick this back up, and I just can\u2019t motivate myself. I loved and gave five stars to both Black Lies and Sex Love Repeat by Alessandra, but this, unfortunately, just didn\u2019t work for me.This is also the first ARC I\u2019ve ever DNFed, so I kind of feel horrible. But life is too short to force yourself to read a book, ARC or not. This story is about an author who is dying, but before she passes away she wants to write one final story. And this final story will be about the truth of what happened to her husband, which no one else knows but her. Unfortunately, her illness is coming quicker than expected, so she is forced to hire a ghostwriter to help her. And dark secrets and mystery ensue. But, at 56% in, I just feel like nothing has happened. I\u2019m not hooked or invested in this grand mystery thriller, I am bored and just wanted it to be over. I think a mini romance is happening. Maybe? I don\u2019t even know. But I am so uninterested, I don\u2019t even care. And honestly, I\u2019m fine never knowing what happened to her family, too. I\u2019ve read and enjoyed a lot of Alessandra Torre\u2019s books, I also really love her as a person.

A perfect husband. A perfect daughter. A perfect lie.\nNow that we are approaching the end of 2017, I can easily say that this was the best book that I have read this year. I have actually read it about two months ago, but it was so overwhelming and heart breaking that I couldn't write a review straight away. Even now that I am trying to mutter a few words about my experience reading this book, I cannot stop my tears.Helena Ross is not an easy character. She is mean, annoying, coldhearted, rude, hateful, bitter. And she is almost ready to die. She just needs to write her final novel before she dies which will happen in three months. Not much time and she does not have much strength or a clear head. So she decides to hire a ghostwriter. Now, I didn't really know what a ghostwriter is before I read this book.A ghostwritter is someone whose job is to write material for someone else who is officially credited the book. I suppose it is something that happens often.Helena hires the least expected person and it is the best thing that has happened to her for the last 4 years.This book is focused around a secret that tortures Helen and around a truth that she cannot accept in order to find peace. Please when you start this book, don't read spoilers!
