In fact, I was sad I finished it and wanted to read more about the characters. I did think there were a few too many of them, some even had similar names so keeping track was a little hard, but I enjoyed the little view into people's lives that I wouldn't have had otherwise. It felt really authentic and I was surprised that it was written thirty years after it was set. For all the pregnancies for me it was obvious it was written by a man. The pregnancies were written from the outside in, by someone who had heard women speak about it but never really experienced it or anything. I haven't either, obviously, but it did make it harder to get into the head of some characters. I couldn't feel what they felt because the author only observed.The only other thing I felt was really annoying, even though I got used to it, was the complete lack of paragraphs.

It recounts a day in the life of an extended working class Montreal family during World War II as the matriarch, Victoire, leaves the apartment for her first walk in months (and possibly her last), her grandchildren spend a day in the park, two streetwalker neighbors flee some sailors one of them robbed, and an aging streetwalker related to one of the younger prostitutes decides to end it all. Through all this the unnamed fat woman (modeled on Tremblay's mother) tries to survive another day of confinement in the apartment during a difficult pregnancy. All of this is watched over by a ghostly family next door -- three spirits who could be the fates -- giving the novel an element of magical realism. It's an amazing juggling act that Tremblay will carry through five more novels, weaving a mosaic of life among working class French Canadians during the last years of the Duplessis era of oppression by church and state. If you wish to follow the family's history through the novels and related plays, you might want to read his play \"Past Imperfect\" first, another day in the family's life, years earlier, when Albertine, Victoire's daughter and an increasingly important part of the sexology, gives up all hope of happiness."}, {"userName": "Neil Mudde", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2034390-neil-mudde", "userReview": "In the 60's I used to watch \"The Plouffe Family\" on the CBC it gave me a small sense of Quebec, at that time as a recent immigrant to Canada made me understand that Quebec was a unique, and different . culture.There is a 16th century Dutch Painter called Jan Steen, who painted portraits of Dutch families their living quarters in total disarray, I used to be fascinated by all the details of absolute \"no no's\" in the family in which I was raised, there is a bit of similarity by reading this book.Reading \"The Fat Woman next door is pregnant\" was a wonderful daytrip into a rather unusual household/area in Montreal in the 40's.Far too many characters to write about,they are all unique and show their own quirks. Fathers of large families did not have to go to war, would or flat feet for that matter. .Gabriel is the fat women's husband, the fat women is 40 years old and expecting, which is being frowned upon, was this done in order to avoid the draft no says Gabrielle because he loved her, and wants another child. (no idea if they have other children) Gabriel would hold forth in the local bar usually ending up coming home drunk. It was the opinion of many people that France had turned its back on the Quebecois, in fact spit in their face, so why fight for them. there is the descriptive bustrip when some the ladies are going downtown, having a great old time, however when they get to the section were the furniture stores are,some of them need to duck down so that the owners of these stores wont see them, since they are behind on their monthly furniture payments. Getting into the narrative, there are so many characters, some even with similar names that at times it is difficult to keep track of who is who. Mercedes and Beatriz are the \"chippies\" of the neighbourhood,after having worked in the garment industries like slaves realize it is easier money to turn tricks, at one point they( or one of them) bring home three drunken sailors,who after passing out they go through their pockets and roll them find $52.00 off course they are filled with fear that they may return, and for that reason are looking for a place to stay overnight so the sailors wont find themTi-Lou,a seperate book could be written about her,she had been introduced to Sarah Bernardt! and some of the other characters.Duplessis surely my favourite character in the book, an arrogant cat, who's owner Marie-Sylvia ( who does not wear shoes as these could never be seen behind the counter!) treats him like a baby, but only when he allows her to do so, in fact he does not like her at all, and only gets on her lap, and purrs when he knows there will be some special food in it for him, he loves Marcel, who sometimes goes into the parc and playes, one day Duplessis is off to the park but meets the dog Godbout, who attacks him and battles him close to death, until he manages to get home crawl under the porch were he is found by Marcel who takes him to one of the knitting ladies, one floor up.Edouard with brylcreemed hair is a dapper if not gay character, with his flamboyant manners, at one point a child calls him \"Tante Edqouard\" There is a segment were Victoire his mother who limps on one leg decides she has had enough of laying around and demands being taken for a walk around the neighbourhood, getting all dressed up much to the embarrasment of Edouard and the neighbourhood, at one point she takes him to the park regales him about the olden days how a boat was launched with all the dignitaries present, however at the boatlaunching it goes front first into the lake, sinks, so that the aft his sticking out of the water, and after a few minutes breaks in half, leaving the dignitaries red faced. She then proceeds by taking him to the spot were she and Edouards father made love on the ground when Edouard was conceived.We end up home with everyone present a wonderful soup has been prepared by Albertine, (Edouard's Sister,who dislikes the chippies, lo and behold Mercedes and Beatriz arrive and Albertine refuses to serve them, however Victoire insists they stay, and that she will ladle out the soup, the meal concluded Victoire's brother tells the story about hauling the moon out on a daily basis, at this point I am desperately looking to see what has happened to my beloved Duplessis, well he is on the lap of one of the knitters one floor up and even though blood crusted and smelly falls asleep, and I can only hope Duplessis gets well.It is a book, that I will need to re-read and focus in on some of the characters, but I feel like I have spent a few hours on rue Fabre, in Montreal, a wonderful rompy read."}, {"userName": "Kay Palkhivala", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27191726-kay-palkhivala", "userReview": "The book is apparently one of a bunch, that together draw a portrait of a neighbourhood. It's probably not really fair to judge this one alone, but here goes. As a piece of sociology, it is certainly interesting, but I hope not accurate, as the neighbourhood is composed of people who are perpetually angry, mean, narrow minded and fearful. Nobody seems able to show kindness, empathy or compassion, until the end. The grandmother's idea of fun is to try to make her daughter enraged! The last third of the book, that takes place on a day in Lafontaine Park, almost reads like another novel entirely; people are actually nice to each other. Josaphat-le-Violon seems to be the only one who is fundamentally kind and considerate. His story about the moon is great, and he has a good effect on the others while he's in the house. There are some really creepy bits, such as Therese and the young park attendant, that make one fearful for the future of these characters. I wonder if Tremblay would have written the same way nowadays when we are more conscious of how dysfunction passes down the generations. He seems to regard the general neglect of children as perfectly normal. As a piece of literature, it isn't impressive. I don't think much of Sheila Fischman as a translator; unless Tremblay really writes in that flat, dry, jerky style. The \"skipping around\" is not really a problem as everything goes to make up the portrait. The characters are quite two-dimensional, the only thing that makes them more that cliches is their bad tempers! There is no plot, really, so one can't get confused about what happens when. The setting is familiar to us Montrealers, but apart from the street names, it's just sketched in. The only evocative writing is Josaphat's moon story. I think the book, and the rest of the set, are popular because there isn't much competition for stories about life in \"balconville\". But the story is not humorous, heartwarming, colourful or appealing. I don't want to spend more time with these people, what's to love?I did like the invisible immortal neighbours and their perpetual knitting. They have elements of the Greek three Fates. I wish their significance had been more developed, but maybe that happens in a later book. I also liked the bits told by the cat. Cute idea that the fat woman of the title has no other name. Do you suppose this means she isn't really \"one of us\" in that family?Also loved the swearing, French Canadian style, tabernac! And a wonderful diatribe on the Catholic Church, starting on page198.

Michel Tremblay\u2019s passion for his beginnings is shared with us through a day in the life of the residents of la rue Fabre in the heart of Montreal in the \u201840s, with the fat lady next door paying homage to his beloved mother. The mystical sisters, Rose, Violette and Mauve, have sat in their rocking chairs knitting booties for generations of the past, and persevere for seven babies soon to be, the magical triple clicking of their needles a necessity for continuum. Helplessly driven by a predetermined pattern, they are merely observers to the struggles of their tormented neighbours, as they sit with instruments in their hands and compassion in their hearts.The eccentric and opposing personalities Tremblay presents us with intermingle through the pages amidst their willful ignorance, blinding judgements, and suffocating shame. These transgressions, perpetuated by the shadow of a stifling religion, a begrudged war, combined with a lack of imagination, serve to disquiet them as they struggle to find their footing on the soft ground of the changing season. The Fat Women Next Door is Pregnant although brimming with delicious prose, did prove to be a difficult read at times. The compilation of 22 distinctly different, three-dimensional characters \u2013 a supercilious cat, a matriarchal witch, the she-wolf of Ottawa \u2013 and a writing style with no regard to paragraphs or a properly referenced dialogue, left my head swirling on more than one occasion. Seemingly each and every character begged to have their depth explored and their connection with the reader furthered, and as such, I think the story would have been better served as an elaborate, 800-page epic. Aside from this, I came away from the novel with the feeling that \u2018family\u2019 is the true essence of our being, as through all of the chaos and ridicule that can be found on these pages, the love that emits from this clan is a fortress of undeniable strength and authenticity. By the end of the story you\u2019re sure to have a fondness in your heart for the fat woman next door. www.booksnakereviews.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Darren Clever", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56174532-darren-clever", "userReview": "Un de mes livres pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s de M.

The action of the novel takes place in a Montreal neighbourhood on one day, May 2, 1942. The colourful cast of characters includes three generations of a working class family all crowded together in one household, grandmother Victoire, her three children: homosexual Edouard; Albertine, the mother of 11 year-old Therese and four-year old Marcel; Gabriel, his bedridden fat pregnant wife, and their sons Richard and Phillippe. Albertine\u2019s husband is serving overseas in a war that many feel does not concern them. Gabriel on the other hand is accused of having impregnated his 42 year old wife to avoid military service. The neighbours include prostitutes Mercedes and Beatrice, restaurant keeper Marie-Sylvia and her cat Duplessis, and a good half dozen pregnant women. The neighbourhood abounds with life and gossip. Unseen and watching over Victoire\u2019s family, there are also Florence and her three daughters, Rose, Violette, and Mauve, constantly knitting like the three Fates.

It starts slow, confusingly, as you try to keep track of the many French Canadian names and the relationships.

What an interesting perspective on the war years in Quebec. I'm not too familiar with this time in the province's history, but as a woman whose sexuality owes at least some of its liberated-ness to the fact that I lived my early 20s in Montreal, it was enlightening to see a pre-sexual-revolution Quebec from through several rather repressed women's eyes. Tremblay is a master of dialogue, of course, but this book reveals also his ability to get inside the head of such a wide range of characters, from a barely-three-year-old boy to a thirteen-year-old-girl to a neighbourhood cat to... well, you'll see.

I liked that it felt very real, yet had an element of fantasy, what with the \"fates\" living next door. The story takes place over one day and different sections are told from the point of view of different characters, even a cat. I didn't like that the prose was not set up in paragraph format. Every section was one huge paragraph; even the dialogue ran into each other so sometimes I wasn't sure who was speaking. In places I couldn't tell if the dialogue was spoken out loud or if the character was just thinking. I get a little frustrated if I have to read over a section because I can't tell what's going on."}, {"userName": "C", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21322-c", "userReview": "found this book confusing as there were many characters and it shifted swiftly from one group of people to another.The book's paragraph structure was also annoying and slowed the reading down.
