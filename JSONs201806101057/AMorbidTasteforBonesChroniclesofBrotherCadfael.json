Brother Cadfael, monk by vocation and detective by circumstance, is a really delightful character. A medieval-time, Welsh-born man, Cadfael now carries out his monastic duties at Shrewsbury Abbey in England. He has not been in the service of the church his entire life, however, and that is what makes him such an intriguing fellow. \"For Brother Cadfael had come late to the monastic life, like a battered ship settling at last for a quiet harbour.\" A former soldier and captain of a ship, Cadfael has even experienced his fair share of sweethearts \u2013 \"he remembered other ladies, in more lands than one, with whom he had enjoyed encounters pleasurable to both parties, and no harm to either.\" You can\u2019t help but adore this guy!While Brother Cadfael may be well-liked, author Ellis Peters also introduces us to some less agreeable characters as well. Prior Robert cuts a splendid and authoritative figure, and is well aware of this fact. \"For whatever virtues might be found in Prior Robert, humility was not one, nor magnanimity. He was invariably sure of his own rightness, and where it was challenged he was not a forgiving man.\" The prior\u2019s latest ambition is to acquire the relics of a saint in order to advance the prestige of the monastery. Thus begins an adventure to Wales in search of the resting place of Saint Winifred. Prior Robert bands together a small group of his monks to carry out his mission, Brother Cadfael among them due to his Welsh background. He will serve as translator between the Shrewsbury brothers and the people of Gwytherin. Upon their arrival at Gwytherin, the monks quickly realize that despite the fact the saint\u2019s grave has been neglected, the villagers are not necessarily keen to give her up to a group of strangers. Here we meet another group of interesting men and women; Peters certainly delivers in her characterizations! I loved that she also included a strong female figure in a young woman named Sioned. Brother Cadfael is not without a great sense of respect and admiration for her as well. \"There are women as strong as any of us, and as able.\"When a leading citizen of this quaint Welsh village turns up dead, Cadfael will put to use his sleuthing skills to ensure that justice is served. But this unconventional monk will not necessarily do everything by the book, making for an intriguing, sometimes humorous, and very enjoyable read. I\u2019ve had A Morbid Taste for Bones waiting for me on my kindle for quite some time now. I dillydallied about actually reading it, thinking that a book about an assortment of monks could be either a snooze fest or too heavy on the religion (I was wrong!) When a GR friend chose this book for me as part of a book swap, I finally jumped right in. I am so glad that I did, because I have now found a fabulous, new-to-me, historical mystery series to indulge in \u2013 thanks, Jen! Recommended to those that love historical mysteries with an appealing and bit out of the ordinary leading man."}, {"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "Note, Aug. 7, 2017: I edited this just now to correct a minor typo.Dame Edith Pargeter had already, by 1977, made a reputation for herself, under the pen name of Ellis Peters, as a mystery writer; but under her own name, she was also a respected author of historical fiction, much of it set in medieval Wales. When she brought the two genres together in this first of many novels, set in the border country between England and Wales (where she grew up) in the turbulent mid-1100s and featuring Brother Cadfael, a former veteran soldier now a monk in his sixties, and well-versed both in herbology and in solving mysteries, she single-handedly created the now-flourishing historical mystery subgenre. (Before that, the only historical mysteries were Sherlock Holmes pastiches.) The appeal of the series comes mainly from the character of Cadfael himself --wise, shrewd, caring, a bit mischievous, and endued with a gentle, life-affirming faith much like Pargeter's own. It also comes from her appealing depiction of the 12th-century world, her sympathy with her characters, and her optimistic and moral view of the world. (Writers, she once said, need to depict evil; but for them \"to take pleasure in evil is mortal sin.\")Here, the Welsh-born Cadfael finds himself brought along as an interpreter on his prior's expedition into Wales to extract the bones of a saint (venerated as holy relics) from the unwilling congregation of the little country parish where she's buried. But when the most vocal opponent of transferring the bones turns up the victim of a murder, Cadfael finds himself called on to do more than translate. The solution of the mystery will demand detective ability, but this is only part of the picture; Pargeter has stated that she was never attracted to the purely intellectual -puzzle type of mystery, so as much of the focus here is on the human drama of the characters and their interactions."}, {"userName": "Willow ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow", "userReview": "This book is actually quite good. I must admit though, I had a hard time getting through it. In fact, I pretty much had to sit myself down and force myself to read through to the end. I\u2019ve decided that has much more to do with me than the book itself (consequently my high rating). The truth is, I just don\u2019t like mysteries, and now I know that even by setting the mystery in a fascinating time period, this doesn\u2019t change. When I was younger, I used to read every Agatha Christi \u2018Poirot\u2019 story I could get my hands on, and I think I burned myself out. Most of the time I just don\u2019t care about \u2018whodunit\u2019. This leaves the magnetism of the detective to carry the story, which recently just hasn\u2019t been enough.For people who love mysteries though, I think you will love this. Peters writes very well. She uses dialogue to bring her characters to life, and it\u2019s great. I was surprised at how funny this book was. Cadfael is simply a GREAT character. Peters also captures the 1100s with insightful details into monasterial life. I think so many authors forget how powerful and important the church truly was during this time. This same attention to detail was used on the inner workings of a medieval Welsh village too. So many books just make out the villagers out to be ignorant clods, but Ellis is much more generous than that, giving everybody a more rounded feel. Everybody has a different agenda and a different motive, and Cadfael is able to work this out quite clearly and succinctly.Maybe someday I will be in the mood to read another Cadfael book, but I think I\u2019m going to skip historical mysteries for a while. I do believe this is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of historical mysteries though."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "I am quite sure that I used to own a copy of this novel, back in the early 1980s. I finally donated it because I just couldn\u2019t get into the story. Now, I look back at my younger self and shake my head, because this time around I found the story to be very accessible and very easy to engage. Another instance of the right book at the right time\u2014not suitable for me in my 20s, but eminently suitable for me in my 50s.I think that Brother Cadfael will become an old friend\u2014I will certainly be reading the next book of the series! In my opinion, Peters transplants the murder mystery genre into medieval times extremely well. She gives Brother Cadfael common sense and logic to work with, plus a good dose of human psychology. How he deals with the Church hierarchy and the other Brothers feels very real and is often amusing.The action begins slowly\u2014the reader must be patient as Peters builds the story towards the murder, but after that, the action is unabated until the final resolution. This story is quite different from the forensic-based murder mysteries that crowd today\u2019s shelves, but that very difference recommends it. Not exactly a cozy mystery, but a gentler one. No gore or psychopaths to deal with here."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "$1.99 Kindle sale, today (Dec. 13, 2017) only.

This was a very satisfying re-read for me, and I\u2019ll be revisiting this series again in the new year. I love Cadfael\u2019s decency, warmth and humanity - and humor. Same reason I enjoyed Margaret Frazer\u2019s Dame Frevisse series; a smart, strong, experienced religious makes a wonderful detective! This visit to a Welsh kingdom to acquire the remains of a saint for Shrewsbury Abbey stirs up unforeseen conflicts and a murder, and we are introduced to several wonderful Welsh characters, along with Cadfael\u2019s English fellow religious, some truly good, some cynically manipulative of the faith of others.I love reading novels set in a much more slow-paced time - although I don\u2019t yearn to live in a time before germ theory, women\u2019s suffrage and civil rights, I do find the portrayal of such a simpler time peaceful and relaxing.

We meet at last Brother Cadfael. Pray tell, Brother, was it as boring for you as it was for me?I have heard much about the Brother Cadfael series and heard plenty of good reports on the books, including the first book in the series. This one. A Morbid Taste For Bones. Having been one of the only English speaking persons in the world to have never read any of the books or watched any of the tv shows I have had A Morbid Taste For Bones on my radar for a goodling amount of time. Always putting it off for whatever reason...I am not sure now what they were.My Ellis Peters blooding was a successful one and came in the form of one of her historical fiction books written under her other pen name, Edith Pargeter, which I read last year. That was A Bloody Field By Shrewsbury. The memory of her incredible writing in that book still makes my toes curl to this day. I loved it. It became one of my all time favourite historical fiction books.It was this lingering taste of the author's work that made me clear the schedule this month and finally read the first Cadfael. But next to the Classicist nature of A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury, I am afeared A Morbid Taste For Bones presents like the poor, country cousin. The writing quality I recognised, although it was more Shakespearean than Classicist in this historical mystery. For me there was no story of interest propped up by the intelligent writing. It took far too long to get to the crime and then I really couldn't care less who killed whom and why. The scenes kept reminding me of a drawn out Shakespearean play. Good for someone watching in the back seats of a dusty old theatre with their mouths agape, leaning forward, their fists clenched in anticipation of events, but for me as a reader, it was more like a two hour train ride. Very little bumps and very little entertainment unless I bring it myself.This may seem sacrilegious to those who love these books and the tv series, but I could easily have given this book 2 stars instead of 3. If it were not for my immense admiration for the way Ellis Peters strings her old fashioned words together, I would not have been so kind to A Morbid Taste For Bones."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "Having enjoyed the TV series (starring Derek Jacobi as Cadfael), I've long wanted to read the books on which they were based.

There are many parallels to the TV adaptation, but also some slight changes as well, which was ok. Brother Cadfael is a wonderful leading character.

However Ellis Peters did so and repeatedly. Now I am sure there were books in this style written before Cadfael and there are most certainly many written after however I think Brother Cadfael has stood the test of time and in the process spawned a whole series (as well as a very successful TV series and various guides and supporting books - some of which I have mentioned here already)but what of the book, well on one level it is a book of intrigue and mystery but what really makes it come alive is the historical references which were so diligently described and illuminated making the crime almost feel secondary.Now living in an area where there are a lot of medieval ruins and historical sites I have always struggled with envisioning them as living thriving sites - books like this (okay it IS a crime story after all) help me see a human and dynamic side and help me see that a story can be told in any location but the character of that location help give that story a unique flavour."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/899665-jon", "userReview": "4 stars"}, {"userName": "Hanne", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne", "userReview": "In a weird way, this book is pure nostalgia.I never read this book before, but my mother used to have the entire collection and in my memories it seems like she was constantly reading one of them while i was a kid (which is probably not really true, but you know how memories work! they are alway slightly distorting the truth).I saw this book a little while ago in the library and i just had to read it now.It is a nice, quick and enjoyable read.
