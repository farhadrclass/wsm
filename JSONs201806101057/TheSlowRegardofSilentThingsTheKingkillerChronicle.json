This isn't an unusual thing. Authors are always anxious before the release of a book. We worry if people will like it. We worry about the publisher being satisfied with the sales. We worry about the translations being good. I am all those types of worried. But I have other worries too. One of my biggest concerns is that despite my best efforts to spread the word, people will pick this book up thinking it's book three. (It's not.) If that happens, they can't help but be disappointed. If you take a drink expecting milk and get orange juice instead, you're going to be unhappy. It doesn't matter how good the orange juice is. It's shocking and unpleasant. Equally troubling to me is the thought that people will see this book and think, \"Oh, I've heard of that Rothfuss guy. Maybe I'll try him out...\" And then they'll pick up this book and start reading. And it won't make one damn bit of sense to them because they don't have any idea who Auri is. Because this story is about her. This is Auri's book. For all these reasons, I wrote my first ever Author's Foreword. I expected my editor to cut it. But she didn't. And when I asked her if I could share it here. She said I could. So here it is.* * *You might not want to buy this book. I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate. First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here. My first two books are The Name of The Wind and The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost. Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here. On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world.... Well, then this book might be for you."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric", "userReview": "Update: I am going to leave my earlier rant about Rothfuss below, since it received so much commentary -- both positive and negative. Here I will leave my thoughts on the novella, now having read it.There is no way I can review this without it looking like I am just piling on and confirming what I ranted about, but let me assure you, despite my wish that he finish the Kingkiller trilogy first, I really wanted to like this. I did enjoy The Lightning Tree, another diversion of his, a great deal.That all said, this is a beautifully written and illustrated story in which almost nothing happens -- except Auri being generally strange, giving names to various objects, and making soap. Mysterious minor characters like Auri seem to work a lot better in smaller doses, not following their every odd action for an entire week. The only time the prose wasn't beautiful was when the title -- \"the slow regard of silent things\" -- was awkwardly inserted into the text at one point. Kvothe isn't even mentioned by name, although he is clearly alluded to. The end of the novella did allude to Kvothe's future in an interesting way, although it wasn't worth the 160 pages getting to it. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of Rothfuss's afterward non-apology apology, that read, \"If you\u2019re one of the people who found this story disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing, I apologize. The truth is, it probably just wasn\u2019t for you.\" I didn't find it any of those things, I just didn't find it compelling.***This is not a review of this book, as it is not out yet. I just needed to vent after hearing about the upcoming release of this novella.Am I the only person that thinks that Patrick Rothfuss may be getting lost in the echo chamber of his fanboys' squeeing adulation?Let me back up and explain a bit. The Name of the Wind is an amazing book, and it brought me back to reading the fantasy genre, so don't think I hate this author or all of his works. But he committed to the Kingkiller trilogy, saying, for one thing, that it would only be a trilogy, and for another, and I will just quote this directly from his blog:The second and third books of the trilogy should be coming out fairly quickly, considering how long they are and the fact that I\u2019m fairly obsessive when it comes to my writing. That means book two should be out about two years from now. Book three will be a year or so after that... The trilogy is already written all the way through to the end, but there is still some editorial work to be done. I want the second one to be at least as good as the first, if not better. That takes time.This blog was written on April 18, 2007. Note that it says the books are \"already written all the way through to the end\" and that the releases should be in 2009 for The Wise Man's Fear and 2010 for Doors of Stone. The reality is he overshot both of those predictions by not publishing The WiseMan's Fear until 2011, and there is no sign of things improving, since Rothfuss has already said Doors of Stone won't be out until at least 2015-2016.So why am I mad that I am getting this in the meantime? Shouldn't this help tide me over until the final book in the trilogy comes out? Shouldn't I be more supportive of his creative process and understand that \"it will be done when it is done?\" Maybe, but I think I also have a right to be annoyed that I was promised something by the author and not only hasn't he delivered, he is more than five years overshot his estimate. I get optimistic estimates, but this is well beyond that. I think its possible that Rothfuss has become too enamored with his own celebrity, hosting shows about writing, penning children's books, running an annual charity drive, becoming involved in a myriad of Kickstarter projects, and now writing three short pieces in the Four Corners universe -- How Old Holly Came to Be, The Lightning Tree, and now this novella -- instead of finishing his long-overdue promised trilogy. And despite all this stalling, all I see is his fans tripping over themselves to placate his procrastination. I think he should remember what made him famous in the first place and focus on that. And I realize it is not popular to shame authors into writing, but fact is, he claimed this was written back in 2007, and no amount of editing could take this long.Will I read those short stories and this novella? Almost definitely. But I won't pay money for them, and I will likely be annoyed the entire time that Rothfuss refuses to instead deliver what he promised seven years ago. Sour grapes? Surely. A valid complaint? I think so, obviously."}, {"userName": "Brigid ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8169059-brigid", "userReview": "WOW. people are seriously fucking angry on here.

It could be a memory, a place, a loved one, an emotion.Keep thinking.It's not the best analogy, but it's the best I can do because The Slow Regard of Silent Things is in a class all of its own and it evokes a response that no other book has managed to elicit from me.It is strange, it is gentle, it is true, it is heart-warming, it is poetic, it is pure Rothfuss.I don't know about you, but I fell in love with The Name of the Wind because of the attention to language and the sheer beauty of the story. Now imagine if Pat could concentrate only on those things and say \"fuck it!\" to conflict, action, and dialogue.This is a story only he could pull off, and I can tell you that yes, yes he does.This is one of those books you need to set aside some time for, brew a mug of coffee, and bundle up undisturbed.I want you to read The Slow Regard of Silent Things to understand what a story is and what it isn't. To explore the boundaries of language. To feel the cadence and the beat and the lilt and the rhythm of the words. To revel in one of the most fascinating characters the genre has to offer.

People are pissed. I\u2019m pissed. I\u2019ve been warned about this, several times in fact. I\u2019ve been told that it's terrible. I\u2019ve been told that it has no plot or any string of story. I\u2019ve been told that it is utter garbage, and I disbelieved it. I consider myself a huge fan of Patrick Rothfuss. His first book was great and his second book was almost the same. His writing is fantastic, his world is superb and his magic system is as complex as it is brilliant. So, when I was told that this was abysmal I didn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then I read it. And wow! This was so bad, so surprisingly bad. Not just bad, but absolutely crap. That\u2019s a whole new level of badness!  (SCREAMS SILENTLY INSIDE)It\u2019s just a complete mess. There is truly no plot or any excitement. It gave me no reason to read it. It is a glimpse at Auri\u2019s life, which is to say the whole thing is a young girl exploring a whole lot of nothing. It\u2019s dull, painful and redundant. I couldn\u2019t get into it. Well, I say nothing because Auri hasn\u2019t got a clue where she is. She is like a child in a vast and complex world. She perceives things in an oddly unique manner. This isn\u2019t bad in itself; it just makes the whole thing hard to follow because it is so easy to form misconceptions. Auri just seems lost within herself as well as the world at whole. I hated it in its entirety. Certainly, she is a strong enough character for her own side story, but this story isn\u2019t strong enough for her. Nothing really happens. There is no plot driver or reason to read; it\u2019s a waste of time. The writing felt quite awkward as well. Shocking I know, that I could say this of Rothfuss. He focalised the narrative through her. For me, it didn\u2019t work; it just seemed strange to the point of awkwardness rather than a representation of her character. The result was a narrative that felt expressionless and flat. I didn\u2019t like it one bit.Rothfuss mentions in the forward that this story is \u201cdifferent.\u201d It clearly deviates from the standard expectations of his writing, but that\u2019s a bad thing. That\u2019s a terrible thing. I think, after this, Rothfuss should stick to what he does best. I sincerely regret reading this. I\u2019d like to forget that it actually exists, but, alas, my perceptions of a character I previously liked are swaying toward the negative.  On a positive note, I do recommend the author\u2019s novels. They\u2019re great fantasy stories that are worth reading. This, however, was utter garbage. Pat, again, sums it up better than I could in his weirdly self-defeating forward. \n\u201cI was writing a trunk story. For those of you who don\u2019t know the term, a trunk story is something you write, then when it\u2019s finished you put the manuscript in the bottom of a trunk and forget about it.\nHe knew this was weird. He had doubts. So why publish it? p.s- when do you think  Doors of Stone will be released? I\u2019ve got my money on late 2018."}, {"userName": "Petrik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik", "userReview": "2.5/5 StarsProbably one of the weirdest books I ever read. I like and dislike this book equally, hence the rating. (Since this is a novella, my review will be shorter than usual.)The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a novella about one of my favorite side character in the Kingkiller Chronicle series, the enigmatic and bizarre Auri and although it\u2019s numbered Kingkiller Chronicles #2.5, the plot of this novella actually took place during chapter 7-11 of The Wise Man\u2019s Fear and it\u2019s centered on Auri\u2019s daily life and gift searching for Kvothe.Rothfuss has said in the beginning of the book that this is different from his main series, a lot of readers won\u2019t like it and yes, it\u2019s completely different. This novella is littered with things I dislike but at the same time, the things I like are about equal.Auri is an adorable character and I really like her relationship with Kvothe. Their scenes have always been one of my favorite scenes in the Kingkiller Chronicle series and from there we already know that Auri is a bizarre person. To be honest I was expecting to know more about her background here since she's so intersting and unique but apparently, other than showing her excitement in waiting for Kvothe visitation, the whole only book deals with her OCD on inanimate objects, which at the same time made The Slow Regard of Silent Things an apt title for the novella. I find Auri's behavior on this to be something positive in the book, I don\u2019t think I have an OCD but I do love and took care of my possessions REALLY carefully and I find her behavior on this subject really relatable (I don\u2019t kiss my stuffs though) in a way. The gorgeous illustrations that were spread throughout the book is also a fantastic addition, providing great atmosphere to the novella and Rothfuss writings, although different than the style he used in the main series, is still beautiful in a poetry kind of way.Sadly, the novella is almost completely pointless to the series and I don\u2019t like reading novellas that doesn\u2019t provide any proper story or new information to the main series. Rothfuss himself said on the endnote that there is NO STORY in this novella, yeah he really said that. I mean c\u2019mon, there are literally 8 pages of Auri making soap, I almost bathe this book with a soap during that section.Another huge annoyance for me was while Rothfuss\u2019s writing is beautiful and well done, it\u2019s really hard reading the book from Auri\u2019s POV. Other than 'Mantle' and 'All Things Above', I have no idea what the other places mentioned in the novella really supposed to mean. Finally, for a book about Auri, as I said before there\u2019s no new important background on her character at all which disappointed me very much.I\u2019ll admit if I finished reading The Wise Man\u2019s Fear in 2011 and then during my waiting game of the 3rd book I was given this novella, I\u2019ll rate this a 1 star in a heartbeat. Luckily that\u2019s not the case but overall, I don\u2019t really know how I feel about this book since I really like and dislike it equally to the point where I don\u2019t care if this book exist or not. At the end of the day, if I have to choose, I don\u2019t think this piece of novella is suited for me.\nSide note: Rothfuss's 8 pages Endnotes on this novella is really pleasant to read, probably more than the novella itself.\nPicture: The Slow Regard of Silent Things by Marc SimonettiYou can find the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy/Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest"}, {"userName": "\u018a\u1eaf\u0273  2.\u260a", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12058788-2", "userReview": "I\u2019m not exaggerating whatsoever when I say, this may very well be The Worst Book I Have Ever Read. Yes, worse than every children\u2019s book, pop-up picture book, Twilight, teen romance, Dean Koontz, Scooby-Doo mystery, you name it\u2014I\u2019ve leafed through more entertaining chemistry textbooks. As far as literature goes, this is the bottom of the barrel scrapings! This opinion, no less, is coming from a Rothfuss fan who really enjoyed each of his first two books. Yes, they were kitten squishers, but the writing was quite good, the worldbuilding and magic system were highly immersive and well defined. If I could remove say 80% of the Denna sections from that first book it would rate close to five stars for me. But this book . . . no, this Abomination felt like a blatant money grab!What you have here is an author who\u2019s built up a tremendous fan base off the back of a promised epic fantasy trilogy. Book two however, came out way back in 2011, so I can only imagine that his publishers are starting to get a little antsy. Book three has been promised basically every year since, only to fall back into endless re-edits. Supposedly, the entire story was written years ago in college, but it\u2019s taken a tremendous amount of time to iron out all the kinks. In the meantime, what\u2019s a greedy publisher to do, with the fans clamoring for that final chapter? The pressure\u2019s mounting. People are starting to lose patience. Well hell, why not provide them with a side story of a minor character to tide things over? Not only is this the perfect opportunity to milk the public out of some of their hard earned cash\u2014the amount of preorders alone will no doubt make this a roaring success\u2014but who knows, some morons may even think, \u201cOh my God, book three has finally arrived!\u201dSo what we\u2019re left with here is an entirely pointless and plotless novella about an OCD girl mired in feng shui issues. Auri lives in the sprawling maze of tunnels and basements under the university. She\u2019s a quiet, shy little mouse of a girl, hiding away from the world. Only to be occasionally drawn out of the \u201cUnderthing,\u201d by her only friend, and trilogy main character, Kvothe. In the other books, this was the only time we saw her, when she was lolled out by his music and stories. This novella takes place over a six day period in-between a couple of his visits.The feng shui she\u2019s concerned with isn\u2019t even over say, some handsome leather chair, or antique vase, or that perfect rug that\u2019ll tie the whole room together. Oh no, not hardly! Her entire world revolves around the perfect placement of worthless trinkets. It goes a little something like this, \u201cOh dear, where does this broken gear belong, next to this belt buckle, or over by the holly berries? Oh no, now the lipstick is lonely. Oh good heavens. NO, NO, NO this will not do! The mirror\u2019s become upset, I\u2019ll need to cover it with the blanket. I must kiss it and reassure it.\u201d On and on it goes. The entire book is filled with this absolute nonsense! Her only other concern is what gift to bring Kvothe. \u201cThe ice-blue bottle wasn\u2019t entirely at home. It huddled on the lowest, leftist shelf upon the eastern wall. Auri touched it gently, doing her best to reassure. He liked bottles.

You need to step away from whoever\u2019s advising you.

I don\u2019t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is . . . different.Oh, you don\u2019t say. And then you tack on an author\u2019s note at the end where you apologize even more profusely.Well, let\u2019s be honest, I was more than a little nervous about this story. I knew, deep in my heart of hearts, that my new-wrought story was a train wreck. A colossal, smoldering mess of a train wreck.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do the things a story is supposed to do,\u201d I said to her. \u201cA story should have dialogue, action, conflict.

But amazingly his friend advises, \u201cLet those other people have their normal stories . . . This story isn\u2019t for them. This is my story. This story is for people like me.\u201dLater Pat realized, I was writing a trunk story. For those of you who don\u2019t know the term, a trunk story is something you write, then when it\u2019s finished you put the manuscript in the bottom of a trunk and forget about it. It\u2019s not the sort of story you can sell to a publisher. Not the sort of story people want to read. It\u2019s the sort of story that you write, then on your deathbed you remember it and ask a close friend to burn all your unpublished papers. Right after they clear your browser history, of course.All this doubt and second guessing, and yet this story still sees the light of day. WTF man? If you\u2019ve got all these worries over a silly little novella, just trash it, Pat. Go with the gut for God\u2019s sake. Is it really worth burning your loyal fan base to make a quick buck? I hope you\u2019re happy because what you\u2019ve left them with is a steaming pile of SHIT!I dare you to buy this. Better yet, this would actually make the perfect gift for someone who thinks you\u2019re friends, but whom you secretly despise. Oh what joy will fill your heart, as they actually thank you for your thoughtfulness.I, for one, would rather burn my ten dollars. I promise it\u2019ll provide you with more light and warmth than what you\u2019ll glean from reading this pretentious drivel. And no, Pat, as you\u2019ve suggested, I do not think my opinion would improve upon a reread.

When i heard about the completion of the novels and the general praise the book was getting i decided to pick it up, of course i completely fell in love with the books cliche yet beautifully written story, the characters were deep and full of life, i was really in love with the book. I couldn't wait for the wise man's fear, i couldn't wait to see what questions would be answered, how they'd be answered, what new riddles would pop up within the pages. Unfortunately, this books release date was pushed back several times due to reasons i do not understand. Instead of a 2008 release date like the fans were promised the book was pushed back four years. Four years. I will admit that the book was extremely well written, but the depth of the story is no where near as long or as deep as a series such as the game of thrones, which George Martin has taken just as long to write a single novel in his series.This in my opinion is unacceptable, the series was claimed to be finished and yet the book is pushed back three years for what? editing? three years would not be allowed at all for anything other than a book, if a movie, game, tv series, even a new phone model was pushed back three years there would be an outrage, but since we fans are the pawns of authors we have to abide by their will.I cannot make excuses for authors, Patrick Rothfuss might have really been editing his book for four years, however the much more likely occurrence would have to do with the side stepping of his writing, the general distractions that Patrick has enjoyed immersing himself in so joyfully. (more on this later)So, it has been three years since the release of the wise man's fear and even now, may/2015 the release date has been pushed back several more times for the doors of stone, looking at reviews from 2012 i can see people expecting the book to release in 2013, this was then pushed to 2014, to may 2014. It would be about the time i'm writing this review that the book; the doors of stone would have been published, a book that was apparently written seven years ago. We can't assume why it's taken so long, we can only defend Patrick, that he has been editing his book this entire time or take the offense, that he has been caught up in distractions and knows about the money he can make by jumping a hype bandwagon that has been leaving fans in it's trail for years.So, what has happened in those three years since the wise man's fear?- Fundraisers (of course for a good/great cause, raising money for the people in need can never be looked down upon)- side books (to be released in october 2014, months after the announced release date of the doors of stone)-Children's books- Kickstarters (Nobody cares about the card game that you're trying to force down our throats Patrick, you wouldn't need people to donate money for a kickstarter if you released your novels earlier anyway, since when do authors even engage in such gimmick money grabbing events anyway? Also those stones or coins? really? really??)- Constant interview after interview (if you follow Patrick on facebook you'll know what i'm talking about, every few days is another interview that barely seems to intervene with his writing schedule, almost as if he doesn't have one at all)There are more i could list but anyone would get the gist of what i'm saying, Patrick has obviously gotten so involved in the money making events his books could potentially create that he's lost sight of an actual goal, this to me in disgraceful. To release a book seven years ago, telling his fans that all three books were finished only to have released the second book four years later is pathetic. Patrick has release 2 books of his Kingkiller chronicles trilogy in 7 years. Let that sink in. I can't see an end to this series. What initially was introduced as a quick trilogy for us to enjoy and finish with a quick smile has been turned into seven years of money grabbing and lies, dates constantly being pushed back for no reason, books that have no relevance to the series are being released. Sure Kvothe's story might only last a trilogy, but what about Kote's? we all know that Patrick will never fit both 'characters' stories into one book, will we see the final book split into two? My guess is a new series all together, a sequel if you like for Kote to regain his 'powers'. Not only that but books that are to occur within the four corners have been announced, not only has Patrick ridden the fame train for 7 years for these two books, he's preparing the rest of his life as an author to be based around this world. If you are really blinded by how much Patrick spits into the face of his fans, you deserve the wait, you deserve to wait another who knows how many years before you have your trilogy finale. Another book coming out in october this year only confirms another year or more before the doors of stone is to be released, and if that book is coming out in october what does that say about the doors of stone? a book that was meant to be finished 7 years ago, a book that Patrick has supposedly been editing for 3 years is now being pushed back because Patrick was writing a different book altogether.Pathetic Patrick Rothfuss, just pathetic, for an author praised for his writing ability you sure do like to make fans who have been with you for almost 7 years wait for a third book. And then there are authors like Brandon Sanderson, who take their writing as a job seriously, who know how to make their fans happy. There are Authors like J.K. Rowling; who work tirelessly and are completely great full for opportunity their writing has brought them, people like them are able to write their books, please their fans, make their money, donate to the needy and are praised.You however have been praised for releasing 2 books over the course of 7 years and milking his fans down to absolutely nothing.Pathetic.EDIT: If you're planning on commenting, read the comments first, i've been getting a lot of negative feedback which i have addressed almost a dozen times now, if your negative feedback hasn't been met with an equally negative, sarcastic response from me; feel free to tell me how much of a shitlord i am, however please note that you're wrong."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "4.5 filled with secrets starsI have wondered for two books now more about two very specific characters Auri and Bast and does this ever deliver on Auri. I longed to know more about what Auri does in the Underthing, how she ended up there and what else goes through her mind. One of my favorite things in The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear were Auri\u2019s interactions with Kvothe things like: \n\n\u201cI have an apple that thinks it\u2019s a pear. And a bun that thinks it\u2019s a cat. And a lettuce that thinks it\u2019s a lettuce.\"\"It\u2019s a clever lettuce, then.\"\"Hardly,\" she said with a delicate snort. \"Why would anything clever think it\u2019s a lettuce?\"\"Even if it is a lettuce?\" I asked.\"Especially then,\" she said. \"Bad enough to be a lettuce. How awful to think you are a lettuce too.\u201d\nI really wanted to get in her head and see what really is happening in there because I find her absolutely fascinating. Well, Rothfuss heard my wish and put me inside Auri\u2019s head for an enthralling 159 pages.Warnings:DO NOT read this until you have read at least The Name of the Wind, although I would recommend reading both TNotW and The Wise Man\u2019s Fear first. DO NOT expect see Kvothe because he isn\u2019t here. It is all Auri all the time and it is enough.DO NOT expect this to be a normal story because it isn\u2019t. I think this falls into more of a character study. Auri is an interesting character, enough to carry an entire story like this, enough to follow around like a reality TV show but better than a reality TV show because she is far more interesting.I LOVE AURI\nShe is so different. She pretty much lives in the steam tunnels under a school and so far we have only seen her through Kvothe\u2019s eyes. She is a wild, feral thing and seems sorta like a skittish creature in many ways. But that is just the very tip of the iceberg, she is so much more. Right away I was drawn into the way she sees her world and the way she wanders through it. Is she crazy or is she more in tune to the world around her. She has actual relationships of sorts with inanimate objects. The way she sees them they are almost sentient. \nSkipping close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave. She picked it up and put it in the pocket that didn\u2019t have the key inside. They would only fuss if they were put together.\nWe get to follow Auri through a week in the Underthing as so goes through what she believes is her purpose there. She is also looking for the gift to bring Kvothe when she knows they will meet. It is such an interesting journey to see that world through her eyes. Nothing is mundane not even a belt buckle.\nMight the buckle be for him? That would be a good beginning to the day. A nice thing to have settled early on, his gift all ready with his visit days away.Auri eyed the buckle sharply. Was it a proper gift for him? He was a tangled sort. And he was much hidden, too. Nodding, she reached out to touch the cool dark metal.But no. It didn\u2019t suit him. She should have known. He was not a one for fastening. For holding closed. Neither was he dark. Oh no. He was emberant. Incarnadine. He was bright with better bright beneath, like copper-gilded gold.\nAuri is smart, so much smarter than I expected. She gathers and coerces and makes silent deals with inanimate objects. She seems to intuitively pick up on signs and there meanings she knows something that is coming and she is getting ready for it. Also there is a hint to her power that I really wasn\u2019t expecting.\nShe closed her eyes. She drew her shoulders back. She took a slow and steady breath.There was a tension in the air. A weight. A wait. There was no wind. She did not speak. The world grew stretched and tight.Auri drew a breath and opened up her eyes. Auri was urchin small. Her tiny feet upon the stone were bare.Auri stood, and in the circle of her golden hair she grinned and brought the weight of her desire down full upon the world.And all things shook. And all things knew her will. And all things bent to please her.\n\nThis left me wondering though what will become of Kvothe in the next book. It seems that Auri has a hint of it and a plan. I\u2019m really excited to see them together again. I think this will be a love it or hate it story for most. Since it isn\u2019t traditional I can see why some might not like it. But I enjoyed the character study of Auri. I swam around in her head and learned a bit of how she made something that should have been like a sewer of sorts into a breathtakingly magical place full of hidden chambers and unexpected treasures. This is why I fall on the side of LOVE."}, {"userName": "Allie", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4954691-allie", "userReview": "Being one of Pat's beta readers I had the pleasure of reading this last month.

For that see further below. Also, those of you who rate books before they are released and haven't read an ARC, what the hell? 5-star , 1-star, whatever-star, you haven't read the book yet so withhold your judgement. Or is that a way of you just rating your excitement for the book? Maybe goodreads should have a \"Hype\" indicator you can vote on so you can get your fix that way. This is mainly focused towards all you keyboard warriors out there. I'm being a bit of a hypocrite right now, I know. I don't even really know where to begin with this so I'll just start with the \"he said they were already done 7 years ago and blah blah blah...\" Cry me a river... That was a mistake to say and Pat knows it, let it go. He's said in numerous interviews that he's a far better writer now than when he originally wrote the trilogy, so he basically just uses the original material as a rough outline for the new books. He has a editor now that probably wanted many things altered as well. Many characters and side plots (including the Waystone Inn framing) have also been added, so he obviously has much more work to do in that regard. You try rebuilding a 1000 page novel from scratch without having any hiccups in a 'timely' fashion.For those of you who compare Pat to Brandon Sanderson and the like, just stop. Not all writers work at the same pace or in the same way. They're different people. Rothfuss also writes more poetic prose than say Sanderson, and Brandon will tell you the same. This takes time. Especially when you have to work on a sentence that sounds right to you, while also conveying the message it needs to. That can take hours. For those of you that call people like me \"Fanboys,\" go right ahead. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't a fan. But you know what, you're here too. The most angry comments are those always complaining the books aren't coming out fast enough. Strange, that. I'd say you are the biggest \"Fanboys\" here since you seem to be the ones most desperate to get your hands on Doors of Stone. If you're this angry about a book, then you have some bigger problems you need to worry about. We Rothfuss apologists aren't defending him because, while we may like his books and personality, we have some semblance of empathy and understanding in our bodies. The man has a family, people. His obligations aren't strictly to you. Deal with it.And lastly, for those of you complaining this is a \"money grab,\" you... you are the worst of all. He started this as a short story, and it became something longer. That's all that happened. The man needs to work on other things so he stays sane. He could have just kept it for himself as world building material and start slaving away again at your leisure - Yah, Rothfuss! Yah! - but he decided to take the time to polish this work, The Slow Regard of Silent Things, to tide you over because so many of you seem to be foaming at the mouth. If you like the series, then you probably like the world and characters. Here is something for you. Stop looking a gift horse in the mouth. Also, I noticed some of you are complaining about price. It's $11 for a hardback! Are you kidding me? That's cheap! Comparing to say The Ocean at the End of the Lane, I open up the dust jacket and it says $25.99 for a novel of roughly the same length. I loved the book, so I'm not trying to give an impression in that regard, but just as a point of comparison. I never saw anything about that price, though there could have been. Rothfuss probably had to fight to get the price down. Or the people at DAW are just the most lovely ever. To the other Rothfuss apologists out there who 'get it' - preach on brothers/sisters. And thank you Patrick for writing this, Auri is one of my favorite characters so this will be a pleasure to read. *** Having finished the book, I suppose I can see why some people would find it off putting. It's different. But... Auri is different. It took me a while to read this book, not because it was too boring or bland, or I just couldn't get into it for some other reason, but because it was sweet like honey and was something I wanted to savor, like bottled moonlight. I didn't give it 5-stars because it does lack a certain depth of plot that I usually look for in a book, but I still very much enjoyed it and became quite captured by Auri and her nature. However, the poetry of words one will find in this book itself makes it an interesting read. Most people read books for the characters and the relationships they forge, so looking at the  Characters  section here on  goodreads  might turn off more than a number of people, as it simply says \"Auri.\" But I didn't really see this book as having but one character. Some of the objects in  The Slow Regard... are so important and central to the story, that they feel like characters themselves in a way. At one part I was actually saddened when one particular object broke. I have to commend Pat for that. While it's not BOOK 3, Pat definitely slipped some information in here if you're paying close enough attention. If you're somebody who reads between the lines and is interested in what's going on behind the scenes in Temerant (man + tree ?), this is worth your time. The art also really helps to make this book. It's really integral to see what Auri sees so you feel more connected with her doings. I should say that this book isn't for everybody, and Pat tells you this from the start. But if you're somebody who has ever sat on your bed and listened to the white noise in your room, laid on your carpet and fingered its threads, kissed an inanimate object *raises hand*, sat in the sun filtering through a window and watched the particles of dust floating in the air, touched all the objects you could in your room just because they seemed lonely, then you might like this book."}, {"userName": "James Lafayette  Tivendale", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10282461-james-lafayette-tivendale", "userReview": "Auri is adorable.

Listen to the man when he tells you in the foreword and the author's note, that you might not want to buy this book.

So here it goes. I don't understand the negativity surrounding this novella. Especially those saying this book is a \"money grab\" or some other ridiculous baseless statement about him delaying the third instalment. Listen, with all respect, don't buy it if you think it's just for profit. There is a beautiful thing called choice that we all have, feel free to exercise that glorious human right. Instead of directing all this hate why don't we thank a brilliant author for not only this beautiful novella but also thank him for his amazing works, and allow him whatever time he needs to put out a product that he feels is adequate. He even had the decency at the beginning AND end of this novella to explain that it wasn't for the every day reader, yet haters gonna hate right? I said my piece.As for this book, I understand both ends of the spectrum in terms of its contents. I understand those who may not fully appreciate or downright hate it, to those who love it. I tend to fall in the category of the latter. This book is Auri. If you have read either of the instalments of kingkiller chronicle then you know what I mean. Auri is an enigma, and so is this book. It was so wonderfully rich with a dark and beautiful \"Auri-esque\" world. One that lacks of comprehension but screams with skin deep innocence and darkness at its soul. I loved it. To hate this book is to not understand Auri as a character, or maybe I look at her through a different lens then others.

It doesn\u2019t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do.\u201dPatrick Rothfuss, 2014 [/b]Yes. Going into The Slow Regard of Silent Things I\u2019d heard all the warnings from Patrick Rothfuss \u2013 that this story might not be for me, you or anyone else. However, if you\u2019re a fan of Rothfuss I\u2019m not sure that even a \u2018radioactive hazard\u2019 sign could stop you picking up this book.For those who don\u2019t know: the story goes that Rothfuss began writing this story initially as a submission for George R.R. Martin\u2019s Rogues anthology, but it spiralled into something that was too long and completely unsuited for such a collection.From there it sat half finished for a while and Pat wasn\u2019t sure whether he should take the time to finish it. However, fascinated by its \u2018strangeness\u2019 and \u2018odd sweetness\u2019 Pat found he couldn\u2019t leave it without a suitable ending \u2013 I guess he felt he owed it to Auri, one of his favourite characters. So, he got back to work and once completed showed it to some friends. All agreed that it was beautiful and that they liked it, but also concurred with Pat\u2019s assessment: that it was weird. So, again, Pat considered leaving it at that \u2013 an exercise of exploring the inner workings and experiences of Auri. Eventually though Pat showed it to one of his editors who loved it and told him that he needed to ignore his anxiety over what people \u2018may\u2019 think and just get it out there for those who \u2018will\u2019 like it. And that\u2019s what Pat did.\u2014THE REVIEWThe Slow Regard of Silent Things is a novella that focuses on Auri and her life down in the Underthing (the abandoned underground floors of the university we visit briefly in The Kingkiller Chronicles).As you will know, Auri is a character of mysterious origins. In The Kingkiller Chronicles we hear from Elodin (a teacher at the University) that he has seen Auri sneaking in and out of the university for a number of years. She is petit, sweet, innocent and almost faery-like. Although Elodin was never able to approach her, Auri is attracted to Kvothe\u2019s mastery of the Lute and her fondness of watching him play eventually allows him to draw her from the shadows and build up enough trust that they interact and become friends. Despite the bond that they form \u2013 a true, loving one \u2013 Auri will not answer personal questions about her past and is very uncomfortable even being asked.Entering Auri\u2019s point of view, we instantly recognise that we are not following a \u2018normal\u2019 person. Something in Auri is perhaps broken or perhaps fixed in a way that is very different from your typical POV. Every inanimate object and space that surrounds Auri is personified by her: given a name, a place to live and even attributed feelings. This ranges from the small green light that she fondly calls Foxen \u2013 sometimes brave and sometimes scared when faced with the dark \u2013 a brass gear \u2013 full of true answers and love \u2013 and the sitting room \u2013 that has a \u2018strange wrongness\u2019 that stops it being \u2018circle perfect\u2019.I won\u2019t go too much into theories and such for this review (there will be so, so many read-alongs that will do that, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for), but you will pick up a bit more understanding of alchemy \u2013 or at least how Auri is able to know the name of things \u2013 that may help you get the \u2018naming\u2019 of things a little better. Certainly, it\u2019ll add fuel to the numerous theories that Auri is either a princess, something Kvothe created as a result of his naming talent, part of the Amyr and so on.The writing by Patrick Rothfuss is exquisite as ever. The number of beautiful metaphors, the authenticity of Auri\u2019s voice and the emotions that the story invokes are as strong as you would expect. Despite being in the third person, we truly feel connected to Auri as she wonders through the Underthing hunting for a gift to give to Kvothe. Indeed, from the moment we meet Auri it is made clear that of everything Auri does, choosing the \u2018perfect\u2019 gift for Kvothe is the most important part of her life during the time we follow her \u2013 timeline-wise, a point during Kvothe\u2019s stint at the university.The view of the Underthing is atmospheric, claustrophobic and enlightening. This isn\u2019t some kind of magical place that Auri retreats to (as I initially thought), it is a dark and creepy place that no young girl should have to live. The pictures that accompany the novella vary between shots of objects Auri sees (such as pipes or footprints), areas of the Underthing and detail-less sketches of her in various poses. They don\u2019t hold up to the kinds of illustration you will find in Subterranean Press novellas, such as the stunning artwork in the ones they have published by Peter V. Brett, but for Rothfuss\u2019s aim \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to show too much of Auri in order to keep her and the Underthing mysterious \u2013 they are probably about right. In terms of style, most are sketches, but some are kind of silhouetted \u2013 as if black card has been placed against a light source. Finally, on the topic of presentation, I\u2019d like to point out how absolutely beautiful the Gollancz (UK) cover was. The US one was kind of cool and kind of creepy, but the UK over \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 knocked it out of the park.The problem with this novella is that that from here there isn\u2019t too much more about the story or occurrences that I can tell you. We follow Auri around for a while as she finds certain objects, wonders whether they are good enough for Kvothe or not, decides they are not and puts them back or puts them somewhere new. Auri feels that everything has a place and if something is where it shouldn\u2019t be it leaves her feeling very uncomfortable \u2013 it feels similar to OCD.I think the \u2018thing\u2019 that is missing from this story is a clear: a logical destination. For example, when we pick up a Sherlock Holmes novel there will be a body on the floor, and a killer to find. Around page 80 of The Slow Regard of Silent Things I began to wonder what the plot was and it wasn\u2019t until I flipped over the final page that I realised there wasn\u2019t going to be one. As Patrick Rothfuss said, this truly is just a few days in the life of Auri, a secondary character, through her eyes. Going back to our Holmes analogy, without a body being found on the floor there is no killer to find. Without a killer to find it we write a story about Sherlock Holmes he is just an eccentric guy being weird at home or wherever he chooses to go and that\u2019s kind of how this novella felt.As a result, reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have been mixed. Diehard Rothfuss fans have thanked Pat for a chance to spend a day with one of his characters whereas other fans, some furious, have accused the author of cashing in on a piece of work that should have stayed in the \u2018research\u2019 folder of his computer.So, my review: The Slow Regard of Silent Things is what it is. It is a snapshot of Auri\u2019s life when she isn\u2019t with Kvothe. The author has said that you may not want to buy it if you are expecting something more than that and I think that is sound advice.\u2014REVIEWER\u2019S ENDNOTESo, my review hasn\u2019t been overly positive, but for those who have read the book or those who have been put off I feel it unfair to leave it there, because I truly feel there\u2019s something more going on with this release. Firstly, I\u2019d like to ask you to consider something for a minute: is Patrick Rothfuss capable of writing a short story without a point? Patrick Rothfuss has a B.A. in English and is now a teacher of University level students. Having my own B.A. in English I can tell you that it is drummed into you constantly during such a course that a short story is not so much about the words on the page, but about what is beyond them and what they leave your reader with.After the novel there is an afterword by Patrick Rothfuss. A number of reviewers have reacted negatively to this. Rothfuss writes:[b]\"If you\u2019re one of the people who found this story disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing, I apologize. The truth is, it probably just wasn\u2019t for you. The good news is that there are many other stories out there that are written just for you. Stories you will enjoy much more.This story is for all the slightly broken people out there.I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me.\"[/b]It leaves me wondering whether Auri and her pursuit of perfection is an allegory for Patrick Rothfuss\u2019s pursuit of perfection with The Kingkiller Chronicles. Being a writer is lonely job. You spend the vast majority of it in a world that no-one else can see or share. Around you the world is going by, mostly unaware of your struggles, whilst you are far removed from it. Once you get to the editing stage, like Rothfuss is, everything that surrounds you is roughly in place, but not quite. Like the toy soldier Auri finds on the floor, a sentence may be OK if left in one location, but until you put it in its correct place in the correct paragraph \u2013 or the toy soldier on the correct shelf in the correct room \u2013 it will bother you. Again, when you consider the immense pressure Rothfuss must be feeling having now racked up about 3 years editing book 2, trying to put everything in its rightful place, is there any wonder that he has:[b]\"a special place in my heart for this strange, sweet, shattered girl.\"[/b]As the book currently stands I think 6/10 people we ask will be disappointed with what they get out of it. However, I think 9/10 people will say that they are glad they got to read it, because if Pat had said he\u2019d written this book and wasn\u2019t going to show anyone then we\u2019d all feel cheated, right? What I believe is that this story should enter a collection of Pat Rothfuss short stories in the future and be a standout tale in that collection. Coupled with other stories about other characters I think this will be truly appreciated and, with hindsight, earn the author some sympathy as to his battles with OCD and perfectionism whilst working on book 3."}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "This story is for all the slightly broken people out there. I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me.When I first heard that Patrick Rothfuss was coming out with a book on Auri I was really excited. Despite my huge disappointment in the second book Wise Man's Fear, Auri was one of my favorite characters and I was thrilled to learn more about her.This book is pure Rothfuss. Although there is not a lot of action, there is beauty in the words that few other authors can create. The story haunts. It resonates.The wide and welcome path to Black Door stretched before her like a dark black open mouth. A maw. A maul.I loved that everything was given a distinct personality and I loved the way that Auri interacted with her world. The care she put into all she did, and the joys she took in the simplest of things. It was a pure pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Eric Allen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6229358-eric-allen", "userReview": "Well that\u2019s a whole lot of nope. Believe it or not, I don\u2019t think that Patrick Rothfuss is god\u2019s gift to the universe. The man has published two whole novels in an entire decade. One of which was mediocre at best, and the other of which was a dumpster fire of epic proportions. He has since gone on to do some really shady, con-artisty shit, and make some very questionable, and outright offensive comments about entire genders and such that just makes me never want to hand another penny of my hard earned money over to him again. The guy knows how to bask in his fame, I\u2019ll give him that, but you know what, going by reader reviews posted on Goodreads for his forthcoming (maybe) third book, that fame is drying up fast. You can call me jealous of his success if you want, but why would I be jealous of a man who had the world in his hand and threw it all away through procrastination and treating his fans like dirt? I\u2019d rather be nobody. I\u2019m not buying this. I\u2019m not reading it. And I\u2019m never supporting this man\u2019s career again. Honestly, after so many years of defending my unpopular opinion that his second book was a vapid, pretentious pile of crap where the only thing epic about it was how large of a dumpster fire it became, I\u2019m pretty well done. If you enjoy his work, keep on truckin\u2019. If you\u2019re content to wait decades for a book that\u2019s probably not even going to be all that good, you go right ahead. If you want to defend this man and all his sketchy shit over the last seven years, power to ya. If you want to call me jealous, that\u2019s your right. But me, I have the right not to give a shit. I also have the right to tell people that I don\u2019t give a shit, and why I don\u2019t give a shit. So this is me doing that. If you have a problem with that, you can bite me. That\u2019s the beauty of not giving a shit. Young people these days, that\u2019s anyone under 35 to me, seem to have a real problem with understanding the fact that just because you like something, it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone has to. I don\u2019t have to. Is saying so such a crime? Am I not allowed to voice my displeasure about anything? Are you the only one that gets to do that? Are you the only one allowed to have an opinion of your own? Are opinions with the majority the only ones that matter? You really need to learn to understand that just because I do not care for something that you love, I am not an idiot, or jealous of its creator, or any number of thousands of other absolutely stupid shit people have said to me over this. I simply didn\u2019t like it. And the author\u2019s behavior since producing it has left me feeling that he\u2019s more than a little morally bankrupt, and someone whose career I don\u2019t really want to support. Sometimes, you\u2019re just going to meet people who hated things that you love. It\u2019s called humanity. There are 7.5 billion people on this planet, and every one of them has different likes and dislikes. Every one of them is looking for something different in a story. And Rothfuss\u2019 work just doesn\u2019t have what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve read details about this novella, and I\u2019ve got to tell you. It sounds like something I\u2019m going to find boring and painful. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m an idiot who doesn\u2019t understand the complexities of the story, the character, or am jealous of its creator. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not an exact copy of you, and have my own thoughts, feelings, likes and dislikes. Honestly, if you are so offended by one faceless guy on the internet disagreeing with you, maybe you need to take stock of who you are as a person, and make some changes in the way that you see the world. Basing your entire life around pounding sense into people who disagree with you, with your trusty shovel of justice, isn\u2019t really the best way to go about dealing with those insecurities. This PSA brought to you by the cranky, middle-aged asshole foundation. The more you know. *ding*The thing that I really find funny is that I have had, literally, hundreds of people leave comments similar to this one for me: \u201cNobody cares what you have to say. You\u2019re just a nobody jealous of someone else\u2019s success.\u201d Usually it\u2019s liberally laced with profanity or uninventive insults. First, I don\u2019t expect anyone to give a crap what I have to say. I find it odd when anyone actually seems to. Second, just because nobody cares what I have to say, doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have the right to say it anyway. Third, YOU clearly care what I have to say, or you\u2019d not have taken the time out of your day to finish reading it and then comment on it. If you didn\u2019t care what I had to say, you\u2019d have read a few lines, rolled your eyes, and moved on. And lastly, why do so many people accuse me of being jealous? I don\u2019t even understand that. To me that\u2019s like trying to prove it\u2019s raining outside by painting a wall. These two things are not related, and yet people, somehow, draw lines between them. I don\u2019t lash out at things I envy. I work toward them instead, and anyone that does otherwise is wasting opportunities. I lash out when I wasted my time and money reading a book that was a complete waste of time and money. I only have one life, I\u2019d rather not waste it reading long-winded, sexist garbage when I could be spending that time and money on something I actually enjoy. And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s my last word on Patrick Rothfuss. I\u2019m done complaining now. Everyone who has been harassing me about it can shut up now. I don\u2019t care. You really shouldn\u2019t care. Let\u2019s all just shut the hell up about the whole mess, shall we? You can keep liking Rothfuss\u2019 work, and I can keep not liking it, and everyone will be happy."}, {"userName": "Sally Howes", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23122552-sally-howes", "userReview": "THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS will say something different to every reader. To me it says not only that nothing is ever quite what it seems to be, it says that everything is so much more than it appears. And it says that being broken doesn't mean you're not also perfect. It reminds me very much of one of my all-time favorite quotes, from Hemingway's A FAREWELL TO ARMS: \"The world breaks everyone, and afterward, many are strong at the broken places.\"There are two things that are very important to know about this book, both of which I know were of nail-biting concern to the author. The first is a major caveat: If you have not read Patrick Rothfuss's other books, or at least the first book in his Kingkiller Chronicle, THE NAME OF THE WIND, you really should not attempt THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS, as it will be almost impossible to understand. It is very hard for me to discourage anyone from reading any of Rothfuss's work, as I am a huge fan of his, but this warning is important, and one that the author himself gives in a foreword to the book. THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS was written for fans of the Kingkiller Chronicle and assumes knowledge of the characters and the world they live in. However, for anyone who wants to ignore this warning, I'll offer a brief explanation. The main protagonist of the Kingkiller Chronicle is Kvothe, who is, among other things, a student at \"the University.\" This university teaches the usual subjects, like chemistry and linguistics ... plus the odd bit of artificing, sigildry, alchemy, and sympathy, which we would collectively term \"magic.\" The pressure the University places on its students in terms of workload plus the complexity and power of its knowledge produces a high rate of attrition - which in this case means not only that a lot of students \"drop out\" but also that a lot \"crack up.\" Auri, the main protagonist of THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS, is one of the latter. She has fled to what she calls \"the Underthing\" - the drains, tunnels, forgotten rooms, and catacombs underneath the University - shunning any contact with humans and hiding away like the most timid of wild animals. As well as being a student, Kvothe is a talented musician, and his music eventually lured Auri to him and forged a firm friendship between them. Despite living what most people would call a pitiable life, Auri seems busy and happy with her lot, spending her time scavenging and arranging everything in the Underthing \"just so.\" And she has a gift few possess - the ability to see the hidden value and beauty in the most mundane of everyday objects. And so, if you are determined on experiencing THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS without first knowing THE NAME OF THE WIND, this is perhaps enough information to begin with.The other important thing to know about THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS is that it is most emphatically NOT your typical novel, or even your typical novella. Again, Rothfuss himself has admitted with some trepidation that he has done here a lot of things that should not work in a story and few things that are expected. And speaking of admissions, I will admit that I spent the first half of the book feeling enchanted but slightly bewildered by Auri's story. But at the halfway point, my eyes suddenly opened and I began to see the layers upon layers of complexity hidden beneath the fairytale, childlike veneer. And then all I had room to feel was awe and gratitude. Of the hundreds of stories I have read so far, this is the one that made me feel like it was written not just for me but about me: one of the broken people.THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS chronicles one week, day by day, in which Auri is preparing for her next visit from Kvothe. Does a week sound like plenty of time to prepare for the coming of a friend? Well, it might be for you, but for Auri it is only just enough time to get the Underthing perfect for a visit from this brave, broken man who means so much to her. Each day is crammed with busy activity as she prepares herself and her home to receive her esteemed guest. Much of this activity centers on finding a place for every one of Auri's treasured objects, and everything in its place. I have never met anyone who is as good as Auri is at focusing my mind on everyday objects in unusual ways. Unusual at the very least. In a deep way, Auri instinctively understands commonplace magic and everyday miracles. How silly it would be to think that objects don't have souls just like people do. Auri understands how all her fellow waifs and strays feel, whether they are human or not. For example: \"The key needed urgent tending. It was for certain the most restless of the lot. This wasn't even a slim sliver of surprise. Keys were hardly known for their complacency, and this one was near howling for a lock. Auri picked it up and turned it in her hands. A door key. It wasn't shy about the fact at all.\" And another time: \"In Van she was startled to find the mirror was unsettled. Anxious even ... [I]t was the sort of thing only a fool would willfully ignore. And Auri was no fool.\" As well as drawing my attention to the souls of common objects, Auri shares her deep knowledge of and regard for light in all its manifestations. She is the sun and she controls the shadows.In the books of the Kingkiller Chronicle, I vaguely sensed that the Underthing was not merely a place but almost a living thing. Well, THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS proves me abundantly right, as the Underthing responds to Auri's every whim in delightful, characterful ways. \"It was hers, and the place loved her, and she fit here like a pea in her own perfect pod.\" The Underthing truly is alive, and Auri knows its moods intimately - she knows when a pipe is easily offended, she knows when a door is eager to be opened, she knows when a wall is being slightly condescending. \"The Twelve was one of the rare changing places of the Underthing. It was wise enough to know itself, and brave enough to BE itself, and wild enough to change itself, while somehow staying altogether true. It was nearly unique in this regard, and while it was not always safe or kind, Auri could not help but feel a fondness for it.\"The world of the Kingkiller Chronicle (a world, according to this new book, called \"Temerant\") is obsessed with the names of things, but little does it know that there is a young woman living underneath the University who is all but a master namer herself, or at least Master Elodin's kindred spirit. For while Auri knows the names of all the different rooms of the Underthing, it is not because she has named them but because she has listened when they have told her what their names are. \"Some places had names. Some places changed, or they were shy about their names. Some places had no names at all, and that was always sad. It was one thing to be private. But to have no name at all? How horrible. How lonely.\" Auri herself received her name from Kvothe, who named her for the sun, this elfin, golden-haired girl full of light, and this name may be her most precious possession of all. She has to intermittently check that it is still inside her, for if it is not, nothing can be right in her world: \"She felt around inside herself for her true perfect name and though it took a long and lonesome moment, finally she felt it there. It was shivery and scant. Scared. Skint. But just around the edges it was still scintillant. It was still hers. It shone.\"Rothfuss has the most charming way of turning our own cliches around on us, so that Auri doesn't have butterflies in her stomach but tiny fish. This is one of the most simple illustrations of Rothfuss's mastery of language and almost alchemical power to shape it to his will. \"The slow regard of silent things\" simply means \"patience.\" In this way, through Auri, Rothfuss finally made me understand the magic he weaves around words, the magic that has been hiding in words all the time. By making more of them than they usually are, by approaching them laterally, from odd angles and under odd falls of light, he shows that words are their own kaleidoscopes, not our narrow-sighted microscopes. Their potential for beauty is limitless. I feel like this is one important part of the answer I've been searching for, and I found it in the most unexpected place - a place that is \"... crickly with heat.\" A place in which \"He was emberant. Incarnadine.\" A place in which \"... the gear was nowhere near as shimmerant as it had been before.\" A place in which \"... the prickly chimbleys of Crucible, and winged Mews [are] all full of flickerlight.\"One of my peculiar character traits is that whimsy can make me feel slightly tipsy, which means that spending so much time with Auri in THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS left me feeling positively intoxicated. The good news, however, is that the hangover that follows such intoxication consists only of lighter spirits and a tendency to break into a grin for no apparent reason. Whenever I'm around Auri, laughter bubbles just below my surface, never more so than when faced with the juxtaposition of her neat primness against her occasional forays into mild bawdiness, such as when she is bathing her \"nekkid self\" in general and her \"tender altogether hindmost self\" in particular. It is a beautiful thing to see Auri revel in her own fairy-like beauty: \"Heading back, she went through Vaults for a change of air. Running down the hall, she sprang over the first deep fissure in the broken floor as lithely as a dancer. The second crack she leapt as lightly as a bird. The third she jumped as wildly as a pretty girl who looked like the sun.\"If Auri were some kind of goddess or fairy, which doesn't feel entirely unlikely, her realm and sphere of influence would be that of propriety - both personal and keeping everything in its proper place - and consideration, both in terms of kindness to all creatures, places, and things, and in terms of deep and earnest thought, especially about the consequences of one's actions and doing the right thing: \"She wasn't one for rucking things about. She stepped the way the water moves within a gentle wave. Never mind the motion, the water stays unchanged. That was the proper way of things.\" But it is important to realize that Auri is so proper not because she is a prude but because she wants everything to be beautiful and happy: \"It was better to be gentle and polite. It was the worst sort of selfishness to force yourself upon the world.\" For Auri, perfection is joy and imperfection is a terrible thing to contemplate: \"Auri shivered at the thought of moving through a joyless world like that. Nothing perfect. Nothing beautiful and true. Oh no. She was too wise to live that way. Auri looked around and smiled at all her luxury. She had a perfect loving leaf and lavender. She wore her favorite dress. Her name was Auri, and it was a shining piece of gold inside her all the time.\" With a hint at something more sinister, we learn that Auri finds not only beauty in perfection but safety, too: \"You did not want things for yourself. That made you small. That kept you safe. That meant you could move smoothly through the world without upsetting every applecart you came across. And if you were careful, if you were a proper part of things, then you could help. You mended what was cracked. You tended to the things you found askew. And you trusted that the world in turn would brush you up against the chance to eat. It was the only graceful way to move. All else was vanity and pride.\"As mentioned previously, it took me fully half the book before I realized that there was so much more to it than whimsical, cheerful charm. \"[Auri] knew the true shape of the world. All else was shadow and the sound of distant drums.\" The light that shines from Auri is so dazzling that it takes a while to notice the shadows it conceals, but they are there: the constant struggle to make order from chaos; the fear that maybe there just isn't a perfect place for everything and everyone; the guilt at work left undone and perhaps people disappointed; and, especially, the loneliness and maybe, just maybe, unrequited love. This is initially expressed in terms of the feelings of her treasured objects, but the implications for her own psyche are obvious: \"On her way back she wandered through Port to check on the blanket. It seemed to be doing well, but she brought the hollybottle over to keep it company too, just in case. It was a terrible thing to be lonely.\" Auri has her bad days, just like any of the broken people, and she has the dark moods that accompany them: \"She thought that she might cry, but when she felt around inside herself she found she had no crying left. She was full of broken glass and burrs. She was weary and disappointed with all of everything.\"The second half of the book also gives the most faintly whispered hints about what drove Auri into the Underthing in the first place. In her heart, Auri knows that she is not as she should be: \"She felt the panic rising in her then. She knew. She knew how quickly things could break. You did the things you could. You tended to the world for the world's sake. You hoped you would be safe. But still she knew. It could come crashing down and there was nothing you could do. And yes. She knew she wasn't right. She knew her everything was canted wrong. She knew her head was all unkilter. She knew she wasn't true inside. She knew.\" I may be wrong, but I read violence and possibly abuse into these hints about what horrors chased Auri into the Underthing: \"She knew already. She knew of red. She'd had enough of screaming.\" It seems that Auri is obsessed with order because she knows the catastrophes that can come with a misstep in life: \"She should have moved more gently with the world. She knew the way of things. She knew if you weren't always stepping lightly as a bird the whole world came apart to crush you. Like a house of cards. Like a bottle against stones. Like a wrist pinned hard beneath a hand with the hot breath smell of want and wine ...\" I've read many books that I thought had hidden depths, but possibly none more so than this one, both in terms of how deep those depths are and how hidden. If you asked Auri, she would tell you her days are busy and happy with her work of ordering the Underthing as it is meant to be ... But I can't help thinking this is really a story about friendship and its redemptive power in a lost and lonely life. A broken brass gear signifies love to Auri, and it becomes her anchor when turmoil threatens to overwhelm her. It is not really the signifier that anchors her, though, it is the signified. It is not a big brazen gear that anchors her, it is love. The second half of the book in particular will give fans of the Kingkiller Chronicle the occasional little thrill of insight into Auri's relationship with Kvothe, how much he means to her, and why. She has a deep understanding of him, such as is rare even between friends: \"He was plum full of anger and despair. And pride ... well, he had that in a sure and certain surfeit.\" Auri's tenderness toward Kvothe is something I found very moving: \"He would be here soon, all sweet and brave and shattered and kind. He would come carrying and clever-fingered and oh so unaware of oh so many things. He was rough against the world but even so ...\" It is clear that although Auri and Kvothe are very different in many ways, their friendship is based on what they have in common: \"Soon he would come visiting. Incarnadine and sweet and sad and broken. Just like her.\" The little insight we are given into what Auri's life has been like before and after meeting Kvothe is brief but profound: \"It had been like this before sometimes. Not for a long time now, but she remembered. She had been sitting like this, empty as eggshell. Hollow and chest-heavy in the angry dark when she'd first heard him playing. Back before he'd given her her sweet new perfect name. A piece of sun that never left her. It was a bite of bread. A flower in her heart.\" It seems that Auri is willing and able to be fierce for Kvothe's sake in a way she never could be for herself: \"But for him it was a different thing entire. For him she would bring forth all her desire. She would call up all her cunning and her craft. Then she would make a name for him.\" If you have ever experienced devotion like that, you may begin to understand just how deep Auri's feelings for Kvothe run.I honestly can do no better than to end with reference to Patrick Rothfuss's author's note at the end of THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS. In it, he explains how unconventional Auri's novella is, and it certainly is that. Audaciously, beautifully, perfectly unconventional. He has taken enormous risks with this book, as brave and brazen as Kvothe or the big brass gear. But because Patrick Rothfuss is a master storyteller, those risks pay off a thousandfold. And because of his empathy for his audience, so poignantly expressed in his author's note, Auri's story will mean as much to many other people as it does to me:\"This story is for all the slightly broken people out there.I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me.Pat RothfussJune, 2014.\"And here's one extra bit of unconventionality that I bet even Mr. Rothfuss wouldn't expect: Books occasionally make me cry, but this is the first time in my life an author's note has made me cry. I would just like to say this to Pat Rothfuss: From all the broken people in the world, thank you."}, {"userName": "C.W.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16702632-c-w", "userReview": "I just don't understand why this even exists. Honestly, it's useless - I don't feel like I've learned a single thing about Auri, whom I love as a character in the Kingkiller Chronicles, that I couldn't have already gathered, or that couldn't have been told in a much shorter five page short story. Ten pages at the most. The writing honestly isn't even up to par with his other books. It's not that it's boring, it's not that it's confusing, it's not that \"it doesn't do what stories should do\" (as Patrick Rothfuss says in the Endnote); it's that it's pointless and just doesn't add anything to the character or the world this takes place in. I like Patrick Rothfuss as a person, but there are times - the last third of The Wise Man's Fear, for example, or the entirety of this book - that I just can't tell if he knows what he's doing as a writer. There are such meaningless little \"metaphors\" in this book that just reek of trying-too-hard, like, \"Foxen was frightened and full of mountains.\" Don't even get me started on both the Author's Foreward and Endnote - at first seeming to be a harmless justification for this book's existence, fine enough, but then becomes a statement of, \"If you don't like this, you just don't get it. It wasn't for you. It's for a special club of people who are oh-so-special because they like aimless stories, like I do.\" The thing is - I completely get the feeling he describes; that feeling of being alone, of being slightly or totally broken depending on the day or the hour. It's just that it wasn't written very well. Don't sit there and try to make the reader feel bad because they didn't \"get\" what you wrote.The best thing about this book is the cover, the hardback itself, and the illustrations inside.

I have friends who have gushed to me over both the Rupert Degas and the Nick Podehl versions.I'm not sure if those people will bothered by this one being read by Mr. Rothfuss himself, but I thought for this book at least, he makes for a good narrator. As he was the one who wrote it, he was able to put emphasis on the words he wanted to and he has a good story telling voice.\nFull Review\nI'm going to try to write a review without getting too ranty, but I may fall short in that regard, so I apologize in advance.First a little background as to where I'm coming from: I heard about The Name of the Wind and Patrick Rothfuss over four years ago from Penny-Arcade. Since that time I had several friends telling me I had to read it. I was reluctant to do though, because the third book hasn't been published and there is no real eta in sight. I was content to wait until at least their was an announced publish date. Until last year that is, when I finally caved and read both books with a few friends. I'm glad I finally did, though now I'm stuck waiting for the final book like everyone else.I seem to be in a minority of the fans I've talked to who thought that The Name of the Wind was good, but The Wise Man's Fear was much better. So maybe that will put me in the minority of fans once again who find myself a bit disappointed with this story.Originally slated for Rogues, Mr. Rothfuss set this one aside and wrote The Lightning Tree instead. It has a similar feel to this. We follow Bast around for a day in the life. I really loved that story. I felt like we got some good insights to his character we didn't in the main novels.Auri is definitely one of my favorite characters in his books, so I was really excited to see he had a novella about her coming out. Until I saw the price. I like to support authors I read so they will hopefully continue to write more stories I enjoy, but $17 for a 150 page novella seems crazy to me. So maybe I was already in a negative mindset coming into this book.I was planning to wait until I could get a copy from the library and if I enjoyed it, picking up a copy for my shelves if/when the price came down. However, I was fortunate enough to receive an early review copy of the audio book, making the price irrelevant to me personally.So I've written all these words now (and apparently you've kept reading them) and still really haven't talked about the book. That seems appropriate because there really isn't a story here. We follow Auri around for a week. We do get some insights into her thought process. Maybe someone smarter than me will argue we get a lot of insights. Maybe if I read it again, I'll come away with more. I don't know. What I really wanted was to know more about Auri's background more so than her character. As far as I'm concerned, you get none of that here. Maybe I'm just not smart enough.And that brings me to why I rounded down my rating of 3.5 to a 3. I was all set to round up to 4 because I really like Patrick Rothfuss, and I really like Auri. He seems like a generally nice guy who does a lot of great things for other people with his success and influence. But Mr. Rothfuss felt the need to include this long author's note at the end. He makes it out like an apology to his fans who may not \"get\" this book, or don't like it. But to me it came off as insincere and really more like him turning up his nose at anyone who doesn't love this story as much as Vi Hart.And the thing is, I didn't dislike it for any of the reasons he mentioned. This book definitely FEELS like Auri. I liked all the randomness. Auri's OCD makes me feel way better about my own. She really is a great character, and that shines through here. As I said my main disappointment was getting nothing about Auri's back story.But to talk about \"There are plenty of stories out there for you, even if this one isn't\" came off condescending to me. I'm probably just reading it the wrong way, because Mr. Rothfuss never stuck me as that sort of person before now.So if you want a story where nothing really of note happens and to just spend time with Auri, you'll probably love this story. If you like me were hoping for some kind of back story, you may be disappointed like I was. There definitely were a few hints dropped, but nothing that made any real sense to me, just left me with more questions than before I read it."}, {"userName": "Nihan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18003226-nihan", "userReview": "Okudu\u011fum en garip \u015feydi."}, {"userName": "Nico", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5244445-nico", "userReview": "German Review on GosuReviewsOnly for real hardcore fans.

It would have been really better off in an anthology as originally planed. I wouldn't be surprised if this will damage Rothfuss's reputation."}, {"userName": "Macarena Yannelli", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20487738-macarena-yannelli", "userReview": "Lo hiciste de nuevo. Patrick, damn you. Al principio estaba tan confundida que cre\u00ed que no me iba a gustar, pero creo que es lo que logr\u00f3 este hombre, que la confusi\u00f3n sea algo bello.

Few people know of it: a broken web of ancient passageways and abandoned rooms. A young woman lives there, tucked among the sprawling tunnels of the Underthing, snug in the heart of this forgotten place.Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auri\u2019s life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auri\u2019s eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows...In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of The Kingkiller Chronicle\u2019s most enigmatic characters. Full of secrets and mysteries, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is the story of a broken girl trying to live in a broken world.AUTHOR\u2019S FOREWORDYou might not want to buy this book.I know, that\u2019s not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren\u2019t going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I\u2019d rather be honest with you right out of the gate.First, if you haven\u2019t read my other books, you don\u2019t want to start here.My first two books are The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man\u2019s Fear. If you\u2019re curious to try my writing, start there. They\u2019re the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you\u2019re probably going to feel pretty lost.Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it\u2019s only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don\u2019t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn\u2019t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you\u2019re looking for a continuation of Kvothe\u2019s storyline, you\u2019re not going to find it here.On the other hand, if you\u2019d like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you\u2019re curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...Well, then this book might be for you.", "title": "The Slow Regard of Silent Things\n      \n          (The Kingkiller Chronicle #2.5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21801768-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398466718l/21801768.jpg", "reviews": 8518, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/108424.Patrick_Rothfuss", "name": "Patrick Rothfuss"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Short Stories", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21801768-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535271-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22739835-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27399257-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22050093-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23203101-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25409080-sessizli-in-m-zi-i", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22740436-la-m-sica-del-silencio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7286699-the-thing-beneath-the-bed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21032488-doors-of-stone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31433982-the-lightning-tree"]}
