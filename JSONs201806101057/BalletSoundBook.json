Ballets featured here include \"Swan Lake,\" \"The Nutcracker,\" \"The Afternoon of a Faun,\" \"Don Quixote,\" \"Coppelia,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Giselle,\" and \"Romeo and Juliet.\" All the music is lovely, and the fact that the board book is sturdy means that it should be able to withstand quite a lot of wear and tear. Little dancers or would-be dancers will enjoy this one. This is an appealing introduction to ballet, and many adults will enjoy it just as much as the youngsters will."}], "description": "This Sound book is aimed at children 3 and above.It includes 8 sound modules on the side.
