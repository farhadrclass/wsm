Awad gets everything right and, throughout these interconnected stories, reveals how absurd our culture is about women and their bodies. Several sections had me in tears. The challenge is the second half of the book, when the main character, Liz loses weight. Awad again gets this right, the challenges of going from fat to skinny, the pressures, the self-obsession and the warped outlook, but the story becomes utterly stagnant and so much is left unexplored.

I quit about halfway through it because I just couldn't take it any more. As a big girl, I feel invested in how people portray overweight women in the media. And I just couldn't handle how stereotypical this damn book was. Liz is a big girl. She's also socially awkward, a poor educational achiever and had terrible self esteem. She's portrayed as being so desperate for male attention that she doesn't care how badly she's treated and is generally pathetic. To be honest, this fucking disgusts me. I am well aware that there are some overweight ladies who have a LOT of self esteem issues and self hate. There are equally a TON of big girls who have fabulous lives, loves and careers. I'm sick of stories only talking about the women who hate how they look and all the ways being fat fucks up their lives.My own story doesn't include being dumb, struggling with school or being socially isolated. I've had times where I can't stand how I look (in fact, I pretty much always wished I looked differently), but it hasn't kept me from having real sexual relationships or a career or, frankly, being able to get laid when I want. And there are plenty of ladies out there who are bigger than I am who have smoking hot partners who are totally dedicated to them. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop portraying all fat characters as losers who hate themselves."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "\u201c13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl\u201d consists of thirteen vignettes that are mostly narrated by Lizzie (the \u201cfat girl\u201d of the title) but a few of the stories are about Lizzie from another person\u2019s perspective. The first vignette was uncomfortable and disturbing in an icky sort of way \u2013 I decided to read one more vignette to see where Awad would take Lizzie.And\u2026\u2026..thirteen vignettes later\u2026\u2026I found this collection to be extremely poignant, powerful and memorable. I got this from the library but I think I may purchase a copy for myself to reread and fangirl over later. Why on earth does this have such low ratings on Goodreads? Lizzie, like her mother, struggles as a young woman with weight issues. Her lack of self-esteem is heartbreaking and leads to one cringe-worthy situation after another. Lizzie manages to shed her weight but becomes obsessed with what she is (and isn\u2019t) eating. She marries Tom and transitions into Beth and then Elizabeth, a bitter, judgmental woman consumed with her appearance, her diet and anger. So much anger!I suspect women will relate to this book much more than men. All the burdens society places on women around appearance will feel very real. I think women especially understand how obsession with appearance can lead to obsession with food, how a lack of self-respect can lead to self-loathing. The tragedy is Lizzie/Beth/Elizabeth is unhappy from start to finish, from fat to thin \u2013 just unhappy in a different way. She is rarely \u201clikable\u201d but she always made my heart ache for her. Even though I haven\u2019t had her exact journey in my life, I feel as though I know her in my bones.The writing is excellent, and Lizzie is a character you won\u2019t soon forget. If you do pick this up, the first vignette may make you question whether this book is for you. Trust me - read the second vignette. I dare you to put it down."}, {"userName": "Samantha Price", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5619506-samantha-price", "userReview": "Well, that was NOTHING like I expected. I didn't know anything about this one going into it. From the first few pages the shocking and graphic content had me speeding through the chapters, disliking Elizabeth/Liz/Beth (depends on the point in time) until the very last page where I actually just felt so sorry for her. She goes from an obese teenager desperate for attention (in forms of online dating and her 40 year old boss), to a thin young adult, obsessed with food and gravely unhappy. I wasn't sure about this book while I was reading it - it's uncomfortable, to the point where it's not enjoyable. It's like an accident and you can't look away. You just keep staring, and in this case, flipping the pages. In retrospect however, it's pretty darn powerful. Anyone that's struggled with body image issues will likely relate to at least one of the thirteen essays taken from different moments in Beth's life. The world is a scary place to live for young girls these days... And our minds? Even scarier."}, {"userName": "Laurie \u2022 The Baking Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5289134-laurie-the-baking-bookworm", "userReview": "From the reviews and accolades that I've read about this book I was expecting a light hearted 'Bridget Jones-type' read with funny bits, a quirky protagonist and a good overall message about weight and learning to love oneself despite not being a size zero.Others described the book as 'hilarious' and 'sparkles with wit' but I had a very different experience with Lizzie's journey. I actually found Lizzie to be quite sad and depressing. There were some rather funny descriptions thrown in throughout the book but overall this was a sad read for me because Beth/Lizzie/Elizabeth (or whatever moniker she's using) comes off as an unlikeable, sad and lost character that I couldn't relate to. By the end of the book I still didn't feel like I knew Lizzie and that was disheartening.It was hard to like Lizzie. Even when she does lose weight she still lets the weight issue control her view of others as well as herself as she continues on her path of self destruction. Whether she's fat or thin Lizzie doesn't like herself. She will always be, in her own mind, the fat girl no matter what she calls herself or how much weight she loses which is an interesting look at self-esteem/weight loss but not an easy one to read. I also wasn't fond of the short story/vignette format (which isn't alluded to in the book description). It took me a bit to figure out that the author was using this brief snap shot format instead of a more linear story line and that definitely affected my feelings for the book. I also found it hard to determine the time frame for some of the 13 stories that illustrate Lizzie's struggles. In one provocative sexual scene I initially thought Lizzie was a tween (thankfully she turned out to be older) but I didn't get that understanding until much later in that vignette. Unfortunately this short story, choppier method of storytelling didn't help me feel grounded in the plot and gave the book a disjointed feel that I didn't enjoy. Readers get glimpses into Lizzie's life but, like I just mentioned, there are some rather odd and uncomfortable sexual situations thrown into various stories which, I feel, took away from the overall message. I think the message that obsessing to fit into society's view of what a 'perfect body' isn't the road to happiness is a good one but these provocative sexual scenes happened with more frequency than I was comfortable with.This book follows the life of a young woman with severe self-image issues. What I'll take away from this book is the idea that a happy life and self-esteem aren\u2019t a guarantee once you fit into a pair of size 4 jeans. You have to be happy with who you are - weight be damned. Unfortunately I didn't find reading about Lizzy's continued journey of self-loathing an enjoyable read. Other people may get more out of this book but for me this was a miss.My Rating: 2/5 starsDisclaimer: My sincere thanks to Penguin Canada for providing me with a complimentary paperback copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "The cover of this book is BRILLIANT, and I didn't realize what I was looking at until I finished. Just as the main character moves between fat and not fat in the thirteen different sections of the book, the word \"fat\" in the title has been partially erased. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Why? Being fat as a girl or woman is a heavy weight in our society (pun intended) - the assumption people make that fatness is the same as stupidity, worthlessness, lesser - we all do not want to believe it is there, but it is central. So anyone who feels fat (regardless of facts) is confronted with constant verbal and non-verbal messages from others, but even worse, from the inner dialogue, the one that has internalized the societal view of beauty and is every person's worst critic. The central character of Elizabeth (who changes names as she changes size - Lizzie, Beth, etc) moves through life experiencing many of the aspects of this experience - relationships with inappropriate men, not knowing if they are just using her; the pride coming from a family member once the weight is lost (not realizing it wasn't there before); the anger from controlling your diet; the obsession of all of this and how losing the weight doesn't get rid of the negative feelings.... It's all there. It's honest, and imperfect, the way life is. Almost uncomfortably so. I would recommend this to every person who wants to see inside, and maybe gain a little empathy. But it isn't a lesson book, and I don't want anyone reading this review to get that impression. Elizabeth doesn't \"figure it out\" and \"move on with her life\" - this entire issue taints her life, no matter her size. That's as close to reality as I've ever seen, but it's not necessarily encouraging or uplifting.This is the author's first novel?

I don't believe the subject matter should be funny but this was a mega downer with a mean-spirited character who was her own worst enemy unable to look beyond the fat.But I'll say it again, a lot of truth in the pages which just might help set someone free.

However when I did the special feature, I completely rethought my decision!After reading the discussion questions of the feature, I was intrigued. This book sounded like it was going to be raw, honest, and dark but yet poignant and meaningful. This book was all of these things and more!For me, this book was much more sad than funny. Lizzie has a very honest voice and I loved that about this book. I never felt like she was trying to hold anything back or manipulate the situation for the readers benefit and comfort. This was a book that was completely honest about the struggles of women. While I wasn\u2019t always able to relate to Lizzie, I think that her experiences were so honest that I felt her pain and struggles acutely.I personally liked the parts of the book about her struggles with weight and body image which took up the first half of the book. The second half was about her weight loss and for me the first half was much more raw and sad. I thought many times \u2018finally, someone who is willing to address the pressures that women/girls feel about their bodies\u2019 but then the second half didn\u2019t quite do that for me as the first half did.That said, the writing is still powerful and engaging, I just felt like the first half was much more strong and alluring to readers. The first \u2018story\u2019 really hooked me and I hoped that each chapter would follow a similar pattern. And thought they didn\u2019t always follow the same structure, each \u2018story\u2019 was important and advanced the plot in some way.I liked that this book made me slightly uncomfortable as a reader. The whole time all I could think of was \u2018somewhere out there, there is a girl going through this exact situation\u2019 and it made me so sad. I think almost all women can relate in some way with the struggles of body image and the demands of society. This is a raw, honest look at society and body image and it definitely makes the reader uncomfortable but it\u2019s so hard to ignore the blatant honesty in the pages.This story didn\u2019t have a conventional plot, climax, and resolution that many readers might expect. It didn\u2019t have likable characters or a happy ending either but I felt satisfied with how the book ended. It gave me a lot to think about and digest long after it ended. I like book that make me sit up and think and hit me with a raw honest voice. This book did just that, not to mention it read quick so I didn\u2019t feel trapped in the story. I was able to finish it and continue to think about things and issues raised by Lizzie.This is not the kind of book that I normally read but when I find books like this I think they are hidden gems in the literary world!See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Nore", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32583028-nore", "userReview": "Awad seems to have written this book to capture every single negative stereotype about women of all sizes in one fell swoop - fat women are all bitter, unhealthy, maladjusted try-hards; thin women are all vapid, or bitchy, or vapid and bitchy; those in between are frumpy, unattractive, pathetic things that are barely worth mentioning. To try and better yourself is pathetic and senseless, according to Awad, but to accept yourself and \"let yourself go\" is even more so. There isn't even a point to this. Awad isn't telling us anything we don't already know - that women can never do right, that there is no correct way to exist as Woman without the scrutiny of others - and she isn't offering a solution. No, she's reveling in this miserable pit of a story like Lizzie's mother accuses her of doing with her depression in her teenage years - she isn't confronting the way women self-objectify themselves, perpetuating the male gaze even in the absence of men. She isn't confronting the treacherous way women navigate self-image under duress in this day and age. She isn't confronting the fraught relationships women have with one another. I'm sure that's what she intended with this book, but what she actually did was simply show us a miserable, wretched woman who spends her life hating herself and every woman around her. That's it.This is not a funny story. There is very, very little wit, and absolutely no \"bright spark of humor.\" I don't know what book the reviewers read, because it wasn't the one I did - the only real saving graces of this book are that it is mercifully short, and Awad's prose is smooth enough to rip through quickly.

This book is a series of linked short stories centered around Lizzie/Elizabeth/Beth (\u201cthe fat girl\u201d) from adolescence to adulthood. It really digs into the concept of what it\u2019s like to be a fat girl and explores the ways in which it forms Lizzie\u2019s identity, even after she has lost the weight in her adulthood.

Okay, track that back a bit. The sentences were well-written, and I actually liked the short-story-as-novel format. 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl is not poorly written, but the content is awful. It is one of the most bitter, depressing books I've ever read. After I finished it, I looked at the quotes plastered all over it, promising its humor and wit, and could only wonder what the hell book the blurb writers had read, because it wasn't this. Elizabeth loathes herself, deeply and fully, and in that loathing, she can't dig up an ounce of sympathy or human connection for anyone around her. Her relationships with men are desperate and unfulfilled; her relationships with women are competitive and vicious, and she grows not a whit emotionally as her body transforms externally. Maybe I would have felt differently about this book if I hadn't read Dietland first, but having seen what a book like this could be, I couldn't help but hate what this book is.

Proceed at own risk.My relationships with both weight and food have been complicated and mountainous for as long as I can remember, so when I heard about 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl, I couldn't have been more excited to read it. Whether you struggle with your weight or not, I'm sure you're familiar with the obsession our culture has with physical appearance. The way we view our bodies and reduce their value to the hypothetical sexual desires of others is quite ridiculous. I couldn't wait to see what Mona Awad had to say about the issue. First and foremost, this book is well-written. There were several one-liners that, as a writer, I felt almost jealous that I hadn't come up with them myself, namely this golden nugget: \"My wide slash of bared stomach feels like an emergency no one is attending to.\"I mean, how great is that? Aside from the well-crafted language, the pacing was good. I liked that this was more a collection of vignettes from Elizabeth's life, rather than a straightforward narrative. Much like a struggle with weight, it was unpredictable and confusing. In that way, the organization was a real strength.Mainly what I had a problem with was this hopeless despondency we are left with at the end. Everything our protagonist does to lose weight, she does for other people. She isn't trying to be happy, boost her health, or feel good about herself. She just wants strangers to approve of her appearance, for men she has no interest in to find her sexually desirable. She has no real friendships, no real career, and she lets the only successful relationship she has fall apart, all because she has entered indentured servitude to her Gazelle and her food scale. I understand what it's like to be a slave to the calorie, I really do. I understand what it's like to have a metabolism that seems almost sentient in its attempts to screw you over. It isn't easy, by any stretch of the imagination, and Awad definitely captures the frustration, guilt, and self-loathing that comes with the territory, even though I think there are a lot of things this book gets wrong about being a \"fat girl\"--mainly, the weird sexual aspect of the story. I'm not squeamish when it comes to sexual themes in literature, but that element in this particular book was just bizarre and felt rather forced.I was hoping for a more uplifting message, one in which Beth/Elizabeth/Lizzie/Liz learned to appreciate herself and embrace being healthy, because when she is thin she is definitely not healthy, physically or mentally. Instead we are left to assume she spends the rest of her life alone, punishing herself for not being someone else's idea of perfect. She even begins to dehumanize other people who are overweight to make herself feel better! That's a very damaging idea, and really one I found off-putting. I wish I could recommend this book, because as I said before it is quite well-written and the topic is both relevant and important, but the underlying message is just too disturbing to pass along.I received a complimentary copy from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kyley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27402213-kyley", "userReview": "This book is sad and lonely and emotionally raw in a way that was beautiful and also, at times, uncomfortable to read.

I was looking forward to a charmingly funny story about a big girl who's uncomfortable with her body at first, but learns to love herself at whatever size she is. This is not that book.We see Lizzie through different stages of her life - when she's fat, when she's thin, when she goes by different variations of her name. Through much of 13 Ways, I found it hard to identify with Lizzie, but around the middle I started to get more into the story and was more able to appreciate it for what it is: a story about a human who has a hard time liking herself because of her weight and low self esteem, and how it affects all of her relationships - with herself, her female friends, her husband, and her parents.I've seen this book described as \"hilarious\" and \"funny\" multiple times, but personally, I found the funny parts few and far between. And even then, I didn't find them so much funny as I did relateable. When Lizzie goes clothes shopping, for example, she searches for the items that are the \"Least of All Evils\". That is so incredibly true to life, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I read that. It's so hard to find plus-size clothes (although it's getting easier nowadays), that that's what I've personally been reduced to for most of my life, and I'm sure most, if not all, plus-size people would identify with that.Mona Awad gets right some of the anger that comes with being bigger, as well as some of the hardships we face, including socially, societally, and personally. At the same time, I found it hard to identify with Lizzie for most of the book. I found that she had so much self-loathing, which I know is true of a lot of us fat people because the media and our North American society as a whole tells us that we're basically the opposite of the ideal, attractive body type. I was hoping that she'd gain some sort of self-confidence in herself somehow, but that didn't even happen when she lost the weight. She became obsessive in her diet and exercise, and she became so bitter - about herself, about other thin women, about fat women...no one was safe from her judgment.I really liked how the author portrayed Lizzie's relationships, they were all really interesting. I found myself sobbing uncontrollably through one particular chapter, where we get to see more of her relationship with her mother. Her mother wouldn't tell her anything, but it was so clear that she knew she was sick and was trying her best to enjoy and absorb every moment with her daughter during her visit. She knew she wouldn't have very many chances to see her daughter anymore because Lizzie lived far away, and it was so heartbreaking to read.I have a complicated relationship with this book. On one hand, I found it hard to identify with the sad, angry Lizzie, but on the other hand it's interesting to read how her relationship with herself affected her relationships with other people. This feels like something I would have read in one of my university English classes, and I did always enjoy dissecting these kinds of stories because they raise important and interesting issues.

While reading and after I was done, it kept me reflecting throughout. I experienced a range of emotions about the characters and story. And when I finished it, I decided soon after I'd like to read it again soon, perhaps as soon as next month.Beneath the surface-story-level, I found a nuanced depth for those with the personal \"3 -D glasses\" or \"magic eye\" perspective that makes all the difference. Given the devastating critique of surface-level, 2-D appearances at the heart of this book, I find this deceptively easy-to-read book rather brilliant actually."}, {"userName": "archdandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4402720-archdandy", "userReview": "There wasn't one thing I liked about this book. I think the only reason I finished it was because it was so short and I wanted to see if there would be anything redeeming about it all, there wasn't. The characters were miserable and it was almost physically painful to read about them. The \"story\" wasn't even really a story, just chunks of Elizabeth's pathetic life. The 13 essay type chapters were disjointed and had no flow to them at all. It wasn't entertaining and I regret wasting my afternoon reading it.

I'm not sure what the intent of this book was, if there was supposed to be hope or humour, but all I got was self-loathing and heart-breaking. That this obsession with looks and weight should essentially ruin her life, destroy her marriage, affect her friendships and turn her into a obsessive compulsive food denier. It was really too much for me, I don't like stories without hope, characters without pep and maybe most of all, I don't like that this story is probably all to common."}, {"userName": "aer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45142143-aer", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book more, as it was Kirkus Star reviewed... but I found it charmless. I understand there are characters we're meant not to like, but, I couldn't sympathize with her. As a young woman myself, I feel the pressures of society and want to be as thin as possible but this book had no silver lining and nothing redeemable about Elizabeth/Liz/Beth. I whipped through the book because I just wanted to finish it. The writing was by no means poor, it just didn't resonate with me."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "Even though Ruth's only a hair thinner than I am, she's way on the other side of the fat girl spectrum, looking at me from the safe, slightly smug distance of her own control and conviction.\n13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl is kind of a novel, with thirteen self-contained short stories that follow one young woman from school girl to adult, and throughout it all, Elizabeth (variously known as Lizzie, Liz, or Beth as her body changes and she seeks new identities) remains obsessed with her own weight and how that compares to the women around her. As she balloons and shrinks, attracting and distancing herself from friends, family, and lovers, Elizabeth is unhappy at every age and size, never measuring up, so focussed on herself that she makes no real connections with others. This book is by turns funny and discomfitting, it shines a light on the extremes of society's unrealistic expectations for women's beauty, but in the end, there was a kind of relentless sameness to the stories that wore on me; this wasn't a particularly enjoyable reading experience, and as the second half of the book sees Elizabeth thin and bitter and offputting, the character lost its heart and my sympathy. \nI remind myself that Britta is another country, another sort of terrain, strange and distant from me. That she is bigger than I am. Older. Sadder. More beyond saving. That body-wise, spirit-wise, I'm just a room compared to her sad house.\nAnd yet,  13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl has some very interesting writing. I should break it down like this: sentence-by-sentence, I admired author Mona Awad's craft, and story-by-story, there were many scenes that I found shocking or funny or perceptive (maiden aunts and pearl-clutchers might be put off by some of the material), but in the end there was no synergy; these parts did not add up to something larger for me. This is a shorter than average review for me because there's simply nothing left to say.\nI caught the owner of the Turkish restaurant next door staring at me from his upstairs window, smoking, just as I had finished my post-salad ritual of dragging my finger pads over and over again across the empty plate and sucking the oil off them one by one. It used to be he would say hello when I walked past him in the street. Now he looks at me like he's familiar with the details of my most unfortunate pair of underwear. Has fingered the fraying scalloped edge. Waggled the limp pink bow.

(\"In her brilliant, hilarious, and at times shocking debut...\") Brilliant? Maybe. Hilarious? Definitely not. Shocking at times? That I'll give a yes to. I found the book to be raw and kind of depressing. It wasn't because the main character (Elizabeth, Lizzie, Beth - it all depends on what mood or phase of her life she's in) was whiny or overly annoying, mind you. I found it to be depressing because you could feel her struggles. To anyone who hasn't had body image issues, she could come across as bitchy and self-absorbed, but to those of us that have struggled with it, it was quite painful at times.You watched Lizzie go from a fat teenager with horrible self-esteem issues to a skinny adult who still hates the way she looks. Even after she's lost the physical weight, the emotional weight is still there. You could see it in how she talks about other people, thinks about them, and lies because she's so used to telling people what they want to hear. There are times when she's near breaking down because she just can't take the stress of trying to fit this image of what she thinks she should look like. No matter what she does, it's never good enough. She ends up pushing people away because of it - friends, family, even her husband.She does it to herself, which kind of gets annoying, but again - it's understandable. You want to help her, but at the same time you want to smack her and tell her to get over herself. You feel sorry for her, but you can also relate to her. She's the friend that you want to be happy but know that there isn't a damn thing you can do for them because they don't want to change. Not really, anyway. Some people just enjoy being miserable because it's all they know. They feel like they don't deserve to be happy.Okay, so did I like this book? As weird as it seems, I did, kind of. I mean, I liked that Lizzie was so relatable, but at the same time I couldn't stand how negative she was. I guess I could go either way on it. I honestly felt worse for her husband than for her. So, if you're looking for a book that's definitely NOT funny (some parts were, but not many and they were very far apart), but still make you feel something, this is for you."}], "description": "Growing up in the suburban hell of Misery Saga (a.k.a. Mississauga), Lizzie has never liked the way she looks\u2014even though her best friend Mel says she\u2019s the pretty one. She starts dating guys online, but she\u2019s afraid to send pictures, even when her skinny friend China does her makeup: she knows no one would want her if they could really see her. So she starts to lose. With punishing drive, she counts almonds consumed, miles logged, pounds dropped. She fights her way into coveted dresses.\u00a0She grows up and gets thin, navigating double-edged validation from her mother, her friends, her husband, her reflection in the mirror. But no matter how much she loses, will she ever see herself as anything other than a fat girl? In her brilliant, hilarious, and at times shocking debut, Mona Awad simultaneously skewers the body image-obsessed culture that tells women they have no value outside their physical appearance, and delivers a tender and moving depiction of a lovably difficult young woman whose life is hijacked by her struggle to conform. As caustically funny as it is heartbreaking, 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl introduces a vital new voice in fiction.", "title": "13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25716567-13-ways-of-looking-at-a-fat-girl", "average": 3.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445534207l/25716567.jpg", "reviews": 1230, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7104825.Mona_Awad", "name": "Mona Awad"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Contemporary", "Cultural", "Feminism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25716567-13-ways-of-looking-at-a-fat-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28174589-13-ways-of-looking-at-a-fat-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29655442-13-ways-of-looking-at-a-fat-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29346374-if-that-s-all-there-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36504069-bunny", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17788344-modern-grimmoire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33650417-storie"]}
