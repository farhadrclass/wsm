The first two stories skew towards a young demographic, i.e. early elementary school age. #1 is about two dogs caught by the dogcatcher who learn from an older dog at the shelter how to make themselves presentable to humans in hopes of being adopted. #2 involves a dog who is reminded by his friends at the dog park (including a dog named Bruno, whose breed isn't identified like the others were) that his 1st birthday is coming up and to make a wish. #3 concerns a basset hound whose owner has passed away and only one of the lady's 3 children can possibly adopt the dog, but his wife is skeptical until a life-changing event occurs.That 3rd story doesn't seem to fit with the others because although all had happy endings, that one is about a more adult situation and deals with things that might be scary to kids, including death and snakes.Overall, a simple eBook and easy to see why it was free. The last page indicates the author is working on a full-length book, but unless the stories are written more maturely, I think I'll leave that book to the kids."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6668514-susan", "userReview": "This book was a freebie so no complaints about the price. The stories were cute but it was way too short and for the most part basic writing. I imagine it was intended for the very young (at least they can sit through it in one sitting) but even so if I had to pay for it, I would really be unhappy with it."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7497938-nicole", "userReview": "This is a cute collection of three very short stories about dogs and their humans. The third story is a touching story about a man in a state of grief connecting with his mom's dog. The first two stories focus more on the points of view of the dogs. This is a book that could use more development, and a bit stronger vocabulary, but it will still have any dog lover smile."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2128705-monica", "userReview": "This was a nice easy read. I love animals and to read stories about any kind just brings tears to my eyes.There are 3 stories in this book. Stray dogs that become best friends, a dog's birthday wish, and just a dog that joins a new family.I enjoyed the book and just seeing life through the eyes of dogs."}, {"userName": "Kelley Short", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7249901-kelley-short", "userReview": "This was a freebie so it's hard to be disappointed in it.

Listen, I love dogs and I still thought this was a rather lazy attempt on the author's part. The third story (of three) was the strongest (I use that term relatively) and slightly helps redeem the first two. Pretty predictable stuff here."}, {"userName": "Cece", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965102-cece", "userReview": "Really cute"}, {"userName": "Mackenzie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6000891-mackenzie", "userReview": "A bunch of cute little dog tales to make you smile on a bad day."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10408922-wendy", "userReview": "Even tho it was only 3 short stories, it was a nice read something you can read to kids."}, {"userName": "Tina Wilson", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3972283-tina-wilson", "userReview": "thought i was getting a bunch of short stories. there were only three very, very, very short stories. they were cute though. i will probably re-read them to my grandson."}, {"userName": "Taylor overman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7354350-taylor-overman", "userReview": "i read this book in 4th grade and i read it like 4 times and loved it llike crazyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!"}, {"userName": "Kitty", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1525021-kitty", "userReview": "Ok, sappy, but dog lovers may like."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3764388-karen", "userReview": "A collection of shorts stories about man's best friend.
