I love her candor and voice. I don't like condescension in self help books, but she doesn't talk down to her readers. And there is no man-bashing, which I cannot tolerate.

Any husband will be happy that his wife wants to read this book."}, {"userName": "Josephine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/434102-josephine", "userReview": "The humble, willing to take advice side of me admits that this book had some good advice on improving myself and becoming a better wife.The defensive side of me, who wonders why I ever read self help books, got downright irritated and almost offended at some of the authors wife blaming/bashing/guilting going on. Especially when it came to her constant harping on keeping up your appearance \"for your husband.\" She quoted her mother as saying, \"your husband is surrounded by babes at work all day long. Make sure he doesn't come home to a slug.\" The first time I read that I cringed and rolled my eyes. The second time she threw it in there I was irritated. The third time, (because yes, she felt inclined to include this quote THREE times as if it's some super inspirational words of wisdom to ingrain in your mind and live by!) I got downright angry! I don't give a flip if my husband is surrounded by the most beautiful women in the world every day he goes into work. He promised to be faithful to me, and if he chooses to oogle attractive women (because trust me, it doesn't matter what kind of makeover I give myself, there will always be women out there more attractive than me) that is HIS choice and has NOTHING to do with me. I decided a long time ago that I was not going to be held responsible or accountable for his choices and actions. No woman, no matter how much she has \"let herself go\" is to blame for a husbands wandering eyes. What if this little gem of a quote was turned around on a husband with a wife telling him, \"you better keep yourself ripped and in shape and very sensitive because while you are at work I have access to the internet and soap operas where I can fantasize about handsome sensitive men.\" How would that kind of threat and negativity motivate anyone? It would just lead to stress and mistrust I would think.Besides her harping on keeping up your manicures and hair roots, there were some other situations that reminded me of Dr. Laura's book (which I hated) that blamed women for their husbands choices because of all their nagging. One man went inactive because his wife nagged him so much about church stuff, and of course his wife is completely to blame for this choice of his.Which brings me to the critical side of me who thought this book should have been named, \"How to be a Better Wife and Manipulate your Husband into being Wonderful using the Equivalent of Jedi Mind Tricks: Merrilee Boyacks Guide to Emulating her Near Perfect Example\". In the beginning she said she wanted to write this book because she has been married for 26 years and feels like she's learned some things worth sharing. I thought that was as cute as how after I potty trained my oldest child, I kind of thought I was an expert and I mused about how I could write a book on potty training. Then I had three more kids and realized how naive a thought that was! Merillee has been married for 26 years and has become an expert on her husband and her marriage. Some of the advice she shares would not fly in my marriage! She tells you to be spontaneous and your husband will love it! Really, she is constantly telling me what my husband will love, and she is dead wrong. I have learned that spontaneity (which I always thought was nice and romantic) really stresses my husband out and if I constantly pretended he was spontaneous (she advocates pretending your husband is something until he becomes that) our marriage would totally be ruined.The author is an estate planning lawyer, not a marriage counselor. Her advice should be taken with a grain of salt.Ok, so I'm probably being way too critical, but I would really hate to see a woman read this book looking for hope and help with a husband who views pornography, or doesn't spend much time at home, and all she gets out of it is that it's all her fault. The author was very critical of other women and their mistakes. When she shares her own mistakes, she is quick to point out how she learned from them and became better because of them. When she points out the mistakes of others, it is to \"tut-tut\" and shake her head sympathetically at how clueless they are and how they are ruining their marriage and life. I really cringed when she downright mocked a woman in her ward who wore a dress to church with a safety pin in it. Wow. Just wow.Ok, that's enough. I think I actually got more out of this book than I am willing to admit and my marriage and life might even improve for it. Merillee really does seem like a neat lady and it was brave of her to put herself out there by writing this book.And congrats if you made it all the way to the end of my ranting review!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1257516-heather", "userReview": "I found a few gems to help my marriage in this book. My favorite thought is that both partners is a marriage have strengths to create a whole partnership. But this book also had stuff that caused me to feel guilty about the days I don't want to wear makeup. It felt like the pressure is on the woman to make the husband want to come home and not flirt with the ladies at the office (although as a woman reader I realize the author was speaking to her audience and the fact that we are only in charge of ourselves, not our husband).I know several people who love this book, so please take my thoughts with a HUGE grain of salt! :-)"}, {"userName": "Shiloah", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/973558-shiloah", "userReview": "I loved this book!

So when people I know get married my present to them is usually Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands. After I read that book I had the best 6 weeks of my marriage. That book has some real strengths - first and foremost it puts you *inside* a guys head when you can look at yourself as they see you. Why they think that way. Why I should do this a particular way. It lacks some gospel perspective as well as a little bit of tact; but Dr. Laura isn't popular for her soothing advice, now, is she? Sometimes tough love is called for.So I was hoping for more of the same but BETTER with this book. And it just fell flat for me. I think the strength of this book lies in the last few chapters about how to be spiritually compatible with your husband and to pray for/with him. Not the same brick up the side of your head as the other book; more like a marriage improvement class at church in sunday school with a few random tangent. ps not a big fan of her attitude with the 'must have fake nails' or 'you must have date night every week' or 'dye your hair and keep up with the roots', etc. Does she just make so much money she's disconnected from reality like that? Like she's floating around in Richy-Mormon-Cali-Land and doesn't realize what it's like in the real world of \"I don't have money for that crap?\" or \"my husband works 60 hrs a week + two night classes per week + is the ward EQP so I literally don't have 1 night a week for that?'pps She also borderline made fun of a friend in her ward that wore a dress to church that was missing a button so it was safety pinned at the bottom in that spot. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, \u201cOur pioneer forebears lived by the adage, 'Fix it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without' \u201d Apparently she's not a fan of that. As fun as Boyack is as a Education Week speaker, it seems like I don't think I'd like to be in her ward (or maybe even her friend) because I try to live by the adage \"People that mind don't matter, and people that matter don't mind\" and it seems to me like she'd be in the first group when it would come to judging me by looks/dress/etc. I would have given 3 stars but after writing this I think I'd downgrade the 2 star to = it was ok."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/920424-jessica", "userReview": "Great concepts and information. Here is the review I wrote for my family's book club:I really liked this book. The information and concepts were great! It was a nice change from Dr. Laura. Even though I love the information and concepts found in Dr. Laura's book, I liked this author's tone much better. I've read a lot of nonfiction and self-help type books lately, so I had to take this book a little slower. I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed, and her humor was a nice break (although I must say a little cheesy and over the top at times, i.e. her flirting tactics...I've never been much of a flirt, even when we were dating...I think it would freak Tad out if I started acting like that:). Okay, so some of the things that stood out to me:*I liked when she talked about humor and the importance of having a sense of humor. There was a quote in there (I just mailed the book back to Spanish Fork, so I don't have it to refer to) by Pres. Faust (I'm pretty sure it was Pres. Faust) that really hit me and made me realize I need to keep a better sense of humor. It will make everyone happier around me.*I liked when she talked about some of the scientific differences in the brains and functions of males and females. Of course I've always known we're different, but I liked learning some more of the specifics. Now I understand better why Tad is so into creating an extensive music collection. She even used that as one of her examples. *Like Lindsay, I also liked how we're not supposed to depend completely on our husbands to solve all of our problems and fulfill all of our emotional needs. I don't need to dump so much on Tad. And once solved I need to just let go and not rehash it.*Overall it's the whole idea of changing myself and my perceptions. When it comes down to it, that is the only person I really have control over. However my attitudes and behaviors can influence and perhaps even motivate others. It is important for myself and those close to me to constantly work to improve and become better."}, {"userName": "Tannie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1136543-tannie", "userReview": "I read this for book club, and honestly it wasn't my favorite! I wanted to like it so much, because a book that focuses on strengthening marriage is awesome. But... I just could NOT get over her writing style. It way too informal to me (almost ridiculous), very judgmental, very one sided (as in the author was sure she was right about everything), and a little bit archaic. I don't know how to describe it other than that. I think I was most annoyed with her preoccupation with appearances and how looking really good will improve our marriage because our husbands will like us more. After reading this for more than 30 pages early on in the book I had a hard time taking anything else she said seriously. It just came off as so shallow. I am not against looking nice, but REALLY... she went on about getting your nails done, getting facials, dying your hair, losing weight, and over and over again about not letting yourself go. Sheesh. In any case, there were really good tips and some things I would like to try and a lot I agreed with, but the overall presentation was distasteful to me."}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/782425-sunny", "userReview": "Good advice is cheap, it's putting it in a way that people want to hear it that is difficult.

I imagine her as one of those women who is quite pleased with herself all the time, and even if that's not true that's how I read her narrative voice so it's irritating to me ... true or not. She has some good ideas, some of them I kind of chuckled about before I realized it wasn't another one of her little parenthetical jokes. Are you serious? Acrylic nails are part of being a good wife? I'm supposed to be my own date until Husband finds it in his heart to come with, and that's ideal wifedom? It sounds like she's the kind of woman who doesn't even need a husband, because she thinks she's awesome enough alone to not even need to be half of a partnership. Like she's the main event and he's the groupie. Again, probably SO not accurate, but the tone chafed me all the way to the last page.That being said, I thought there were enough valid and universal points to merit a reading, even a second reading of the book. One of my favorite things about her was that there was no husband bashing. I hate when women do that, so it was nice to not have to listen to it. I showed my husband a few parts and he agreed with what he read, so thank you, Merrilee, for the advice.

I'm not sure why, but I have this aversion to referring to a husband as \"hubby\" and I'm pretty sure that's the only way she refers to husbands. I think there may have been some good things in the book, but I couldn't wade through all the 2-page quotes and self-glorifying examples to hone in on the good advice. I finally had to admit to myself that I just wasn't going to be able to read the book. I'll be putting it up for sale on ebay in hopes of getting some of my money back.

I was expecting so much more, considering how stellar I thought Merrilee Boyack's \"The Parenting Breakthrough\" was. The first five chapters she goes on and on about how men are different from women and we just have to live with how they are, blah, blah, blah. It wasn't until the sixth chapter that she actually gives practical advice at how to deal with the annoying things he does and how to approach discussing issues with him. I still am not sure anything she said would be useful in applying to my marriage. Much of it was the standard advice (go on a date every week, keep up your appearance, etc.) that is all good and nice but not helpful. I was hoping to find ways to improve the communication so that we can start having those \"deep conversations\" again and such and got no practical advice on how to do that, other than to \"talk like you used to\".

A newlywed could easily be distressed and overwhelmed by some of the suggestions in the book that I think are mostly bunk. The author obviously comes from and is talking to white, upper-middle class (high-upper-middle?) western Mormon, and she unabashedly makes generalizations from that limited world view. At times she was condescending, shallow, contradictory and self-important, but not everything she said was to be ignored. She did have some useful points to ponder. I give it a three because the good outweighed the bad. -And I'm not sure if her and I would be friends or not if she were in my community, but she sounded like a Trekkie who likes to camp and doesn't like to cook, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she's a flawed human with some good ideas that would be interesting to go on a hike with.

It was definitely worth reading, and probably keeping for reference."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/418084-holly", "userReview": "2.5 starsThe advice in this is mostly sound advice, though a little obvious. (At least, to me.)Don't bash your husband, try not to look like a shlub all the time, etc.Something about her was really irritating to me though. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was the cheesy date suggestions, the importance on getting acrylic nails, or the frequent mentions of Krystal and her flower arranging class. Anyway, a new bride might benefit from it, but for someone who already has a successful marriage of 11 years and doesn't wear full makeup and high heeled boots to Target and say \"dagnabbit!\", it fell flat."}], "description": "Things can get pretty crazy in marital relationships.
