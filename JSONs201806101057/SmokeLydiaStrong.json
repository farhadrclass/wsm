I think I may have read one of the earlier books a long time ago. This books starts out well but starts to drag in the middle. I felt like it was never going to get to the point. I am not sure if it is me or the books I have chosen lately but I feel like too many words are spent between page one and the end to tell a simple story..."}, {"userName": "Rhea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20236441-rhea", "userReview": "Smoke was a perfect finish to an amazing series. This book was well-crafted, smartly plotted and filled with suspense. Each book in the Lydia Strong series was better than the last. I'm so sorry this series is over. It's only been one day since I finished it and I already miss Lydia and Jeff so much!"}, {"userName": "Wanji", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4054319-wanji", "userReview": "First of all this book needs to be a LOT shorter than 328 pages. I don't know why it's that long when most of it is irrelevant to the story. Miscione just adds details such as the specific type of cars that the main character drives. Why would I need to know that she drives a Mercedes? By the time they found a clue that could help solve the case, it felt anti-climatic to me. It was like, \"Oh, that's what happened? Cool.\" And then I couldn't stand the main character Lydia Strong. She felt fake from the start. Then from a review it said that she named the character's husband after her own. That killed it even more for me. It looked as if she was just basically writing a fantasy life for herself. I've never read a book like that, heck I didn't even finish this one. I plan on never reading another book by this woman again. Just a plain waste of time."}, {"userName": "Denise MacDonald", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6434623-denise-macdonald", "userReview": "I found this book a bit confusing and boring at times.

This one is very powerful, and I evidently started with Book 4 in the series. ( Yeah, I'll be looking for the first three!)Lydia Strong is a true crime author, and her husband's a private investigator. They end up involved with a religious cult, stolen diamonds, faked suicides, weapons dealers, and psychopaths. Lydia has an ex-student that had called for help, and then suddenly disappears. LOTS of twists and turns in plot and assumptions!"}, {"userName": "Linda Lewis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11565513-linda-lewis", "userReview": "Loved as all the rest of her books that I have read.

I also understand that \"Smoke\" is the 4th title in the series, A Lydia Strong Thriller, but it can definitely be enjoyed as a stand-alone title.One of the reasons that I enjoyed the novel so much is that instead of just one strong character (no pun intended)of Lydia Strong, I felt that the author had taken the time to give definitive characterization to 4 characters, Lydia Strong and her husband Jeff and NYPD Detectives, Matt Stenopolis and his partner Jesamyn Breslow. There is also an air of mystery about Lydia and Jeff's employee and friend Dax that keeps the reader attuned to any further information that might be divulged.I also liked the turns when Lydia and Jeff questioned their pursuit of the clues to find Lily Samuels and shared other \"what if\" the clues should have been pursued in a different way because they had not made the right interpretations of the clues and/or events occurring and instead of solving a case they were adding more jeopardy to Lily's life and others.Even an action-packed, suspense novel normally follows one path of pursuit. This thriller presents many possible alternatives in the midst of solving a case and was an interesting read. It might also give some empathy and understanding to why true investigations are time-consuming.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in investigations."}, {"userName": "Pamela ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3925721-pamela", "userReview": "Even though I really liked the first three, just like some other reviewers, I did not like this book. More than half-way thru and I finally stopped reading it. I couldn't care what the outcome of the book was. Quite the disappointment. I didn't like the story. Lydia hasn't seen the missing woman for a year and-a-half and considers Lily as a mentoring student. Yet later on she tells every one how much she cared for her. Which is it? If you cared for Lily, you would have returned her phone call two weeks prior to finding out she's missing. But instead, as usual, she's caught up in her own life and dismisses the call. And who the hell saves voicemail messages from over a decade ago? Give me a freakin' break! As you can deduce, I found the protagonist, Lydia Strong, to be very selfish and a total bitch. I couldn't stand her anymore. It's always be considerate of her feelings, yet she never thinks of anyone else, not even her husband's. She's just irritating as hell. She's actually the main reason I gave up reading the book."}, {"userName": "Patricia Williams", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9569165-patricia-williams", "userReview": "This was an excellent mystery. This book is by author Lisa Unger writing under her maiden name. The books have been re-released now under Lisa Unger and I got this copy of one of the books. Lisa Unger has always been one of my favorite mystery authors. I've read all her books and I was not surprised that this book was good. But I was very happy that it was as good as it was. This was a really good story and I never figured it out. Lots going on, lots to read but very interesting. This is about a character that is in several of her earlier books. I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/thriller."}, {"userName": "P.S.

The author gave the story a lot of twists and turns, especially at the end. I wish she would have said more about Lydia's past because hints came up here and there, but I never did quite find the story that seemed to have a lot to do with the person Lydia has become. all in all though this is an intense novel that will keep readers hanging on for a wild ride."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5933158-wendy", "userReview": "Ewwwwwwww. I'm too tired to go into much detail. Not the author's fault but the description on the back is misleading. It is the author's fault, however, that she names the protagonist's husband after her own. And things just go downhill from there. This is one annoying character, driving around in a Mercedes in NYC - who the hell needs a car in NYC? If you like Lifetime movies, you'll probably like this book. If you like Lifetime movies to laugh at, skip this book. It will just irritate you. It's boring and ludicrous."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5541855-tammy", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I was intrigued by Jaz and Mount the police officers who really cared about their work though their boss was always on them not following up with this particular case. The boss was just not interested in much. I wasn't sure if Lilly was going to be found alive or dead. The case was interesting as to how the New Life group could get people to follow them and give all their assests to them. Very interesting plot and once I hit the last part it got very exciting and I wasn't sure who would live or die!"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19905127-jess", "userReview": "One of the best thriller book i have ever read. The story reflects how the character commit herself to finding the missing girl as well as finding the truth about her father daughter crisis.I have read other books that also tells a crime story.

Both were intersting- lilly as a character and the organization.... well just because it's an eerie concept made worse because sometimes you feel like that could happen.
