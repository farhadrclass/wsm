I'm supposed to have accumulated things by now: possessions, responsibilities, achievements, experience and wisdom. I'm supposed to be a person of substance.\" The scary thing is that you stay a child inside that accumulation of life. You take your childhood with you when you enter the grown-up world, and as much as you try to pretend that you are free and light as a feather, you carry the heavy weight of having been a child wherever you go.This is the story of a grown-up woman, an artist, who dares to go down memory lane and remember the abusive friendships, the feeling of dependence, of helplessness, of hatred and admiration merged into the odd feeling of wanting to belong even if belonging means being in acute pain. It tells the everyday tale of a sensitive child under the spell of a bully. It explores how selectively we can choose to forget in order to be able to live on, and how inconvenient it can be for us to suddenly remember what we chose not to know anymore:\"You don't look back along time but down through it, like water. Sometimes this comes to the surface, sometimes that, sometimes nothing. Nothing goes away.\"I loved this novel to bits when I first read it, and it scared me out of my comfort zone. It was one of the most intensely revealing reflections on childhood and its impact on grown-up life I have ever encountered, simply because the story is so common, and so universal, and so typical. The idea of confronting a childhood bully with one's memories is terrifying, especially as one can never trust the mind to behave as a grown-up when confronted with deeply hidden childhood fears and wishes. A bullied child won't ever forget the feeling of powerlessness or the humiliation and the wish to change the pattern of perceived failure. But the bully will have her own reality, unconnected to the all-absorbing memories of the hurt child:\"She will have her own version. I am not the centre of her story, because she herself is that. But I could give her something you can never have, except from another person: what you look like from outside. A reflection. This is part of herself I could give back to her.\"My guess is that most bullies are too one-dimensional to accept a reflection of themselves that might not be favorable, and that it remains the role of the weaker and more sensitive (more intelligent!) human being to understand the mechanisms behind evil group behaviour: \"Whoever cares the most will lose\". But that is only part of the truth. Looking back with hindsight, a new pattern is formed, and the negative memories become fruitful for personal development.They are the roots for a rich inner life, and the message I read between the lines in Cat's Eye is that your experience can't be changed or undone, but it can be turned into creative power, and it can feed your understanding of the world. It can help you keep your inner child active beyond childhood, and drive your ambition. You can sculpt a life out of the clay you are given, and turn it into your individual artwork. If you dare to look into the cat's eye of your memories, that is.You carry your cat's eye marbles with you, shiny, cold, hard, difficult to trade and play with, but beautiful and magical at the same time, a visual and tactile proof of your existence:Recommended to those who are brave enough to face the true life of children, often too hard to retrospectively bear for grown-ups."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "I look at the progression of 5-star ratings by friends - mostly women - and wonder if it is a womanly weakness to rate a book 5 stars which deconstructs the world from the female perspective? Is this visceral urge something to be ashamed of, something you must suppress to show due deference to 'standards' of literary appraisal? But then why don't I feel conflicted enough while handing out my 5 stars to those modern masterpieces written mostly by dead, white men? All those narrative voices that busy themselves with the righteous task of pondering the depths of colonialism and oppression and class conflict and what other sociopolitical fuckups have you while simultaneously omitting out one half of the human race's points of view - books that throw in a woman character as the obligatory object of patronizing love or lust or as a lifeless plot device, turning her into a mere accessory meant to embellish the life of the male narrator whose word is the truth by default while the sanctity of all else is subject to skepticism.\nThe naked women are presented in the same manner as the plates of meat and dead lobsters, with the same attention to the play of candlelight on skin, the same lusciousness, the same sensuous and richly rendered detail, the same painterly delight in tactility. [] They appear served up.\nOr is this a failing of civilization that a large majority of readers will simply glance at that blurb or the reviews which make it sound as if this were solely about the private world of girls, spot that glaring 'feminism' label and dismiss the possibility of reading this? One would think that even a literary treatment of the 'private world of girls' is a subject so outside the sphere of all humanly concern that it warrants the level of universal apathy it generates.\nWomen are hard to keep track of, most of them. They slip into other names, and sink without a trace.\nThis is not so much the story of an ageing female painter (Elaine Risley) - a relic of the pre-feminism mode of life - told in snatches, as much as it is an account of the relationships which molded and shaped her character and the enduring trauma of childhood bullying which manifested itself in nearly all her life choices, flawed as they were. Not so much a fictionalized outpouring of her discontent with her declining youth and whitening hair as much her rivetting blow-by-blow dissection of the world and the people around her through the years. And because I know Atwood stringently avoids any associations with the term 'feminist' or any group identity which seeks to shoehorn her writing into some exclusive compartment, I'll merely say it also includes some of the most cutting, precise and unbiased observations about every issue of major importance. Wars, terrorism, racism, religious bigotry, sexism, misogyny, art and art criticism, motherhood, the politics of relationships...you name it and Elaine has startling new wisdom to offer on that topic, however time-worn.\nThe world is being run by people my age, men my age, with falling-out hair and health worries, and it frightens me. When the leaders were older than me I could believe in their wisdom, I could believe they had transcended rage and malice and the need to be loved. Now I know better. I look at the faces in newspapers, in magazines, and wonder: what greeds, what furies-drive them on?\nThe complexity of relationships between women of nearly all ages is often a difficult thing to fully comprehend let alone commit to paper. Generally, we find it easier to communicate with men. While with other women you are forever grasping at straws, unable to determine which layer of superficiality you are dealing with and which of your layers of feigned cordiality or fabricated fellow feeling may win their favor. But Atwood, the mistress of the craft that she is, has brought the private, secretive world of female bondings alive and demolished one of the greatest pop culture stereotypes ever - that of the mean girl. So believe the reviewers who have confessed to having a Cordelia-like frenemy in their lives - someone who understood them better than a lot of people while simultaneously doling out emotional torment in devious ways. I'm no exception. Once you come across a Cordelia in your life - no matter how much you may have loathed her at times - it's hard to dull the edges of the memory of your involvement with her. She looms larger than life at the back of your mind and fades into the distance of years. Try as you might you cannot forget her. And neither could Elaine.\nThere is the same shame, the sick feeling in my body, the same knowledge of my own wrongness, awkwardness, weakness; the same wish to be loved; the same loneliness; the same fear. But these are not my own emotions any more. They are Cordelia's; as they always were."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "What it's about\"We are survivors of each other. We have been shark to one another, but also lifeboat. That counts for something.\" The power of abusive friendships and relationships is the theme of this book, though not all the relationships are tainted, so it's not depressing and at times it's quite amusing (e.g. discerning the mysteries of puberty). There is also a fair bit about art and artists, with a dash of early feminism. Plot structureElaine is an artist in her late fifties/early sixties revisiting Toronto for the opening of a retrospective of her work. This brings back vivid memories of her childhood, teens and twenties. The sections set in the past are told chronologically, and interspersed by the contemporary story of a few days in Toronto. Gradually all the threads tie up, particularly near the end when contrasting a curator\u2019s descriptions of Elaine\u2019s works with her own explanations, many of which arise from incidents described earlier in the book. However, \u201cI can no longer control these paintings, or tell them what to mean. Whatever energy they have came out of me. I\u2019m what\u2019s left over.\u201dHer early years were peripatetic but not unhappy: the family travel with her entomologist father. When she is seven, he takes a university post and they settle in the Toronto suburbs, but her family is rather eccentric, and she doesn't quite fit in, exacerbated by her being a tomboy and the fact she\u2019s never really had the opportunity to make friends before, so doesn\u2019t know the unspoken rules. Perhaps inevitably, Elaine becomes the victim of bullying, and the first overt instance is very cruel, although it involves no physical pain or nasty words. There is nothing to tell. \u201cI have no black eyes, no bloody noses to report: C does nothing physical.\u201dThe pull of bulliesI\u2019ve never really been bullied, but the thoughts and self-analysis sound plausible. Like so many victims, Elaine feels drawn to the bully: she \u201cis my friend. She likes me. She wants to help me, they all do. They are my friends\u2026 I have never had any before and I\u2019m terrified of losing them. I want to please. Hatred would have been easier\u2026 I would have known what to do. Hatred is clear, metallic, one-handed, unwavering; unlike love.\u201d She reasons, \u201cI will have to do better. But better at what?... I think they [bully\u2019s older sisters] would be my allies if only they knew. Knew what? Even to myself I am mute.\u201d She even gives things to her tormentors because \u201cin the moment just before giving, I am loved\u201d even though she has no doubt about the love of her own family.Coping strategiesElaine develops various coping strategies. She self-harms in a minor way (\u201cthe pain gave me something definite to think about\u201d), adopts a talisman (the eponymous cat\u2019s eye marble and the luck of a royal visit to the city) and in some ways, victimhood builds strength and also empathy. \u201cI can sniff out hidden misery in others now.\u201d She also escapes through art, especially of foreign places and discovers that \u201cFainting is like stepping sideways, out of your own body, out of your own time or into another time. When you wake up it\u2019s later. Time has gone on without you.\u201dThe most important question is only occasionally made explicit: how should parents handle things? When Elaine\u2019s mother realises something of what\u2019s going on, she tells her daughter to toughen up, in part because she doesn\u2019t know what else to suggest. The church-going mother of the main bully has a far more alarming attitude, based on the fact that Elaine is a heathen.Eventually Elaine finds the inner strength to walk away, \u201cI can hear the hatred but also the need. They need me for this and I no longer need them.\u201d Nevertheless, although they sometimes go for years without contact, the connection continues, though balance of their relationship alters at different times. Adult consequencesI don\u2019t know if all victims have the potential to become bullies, but Elaine occasionally has flashes of it in adulthood, \u201cIt disturbs me to learn I have hurt someone unintentionally. I want all my hurts to be intentional.\u201d She is always more relaxed around boys (she has an older brother), \u201cboys are my secret allies\u201d. Conversely, \u201cI enjoy pestering the girls in this minor, trivial way: it shows I am not like them\u201d and in a bar with boys from the university art class, \u201cI expect nothing from them. In truth I expect a lot. I expect to be accepted.\u201dAs an adult, Elaine is moderately happy and successful, yet her past taints all her relationships to some extent. She also fears passing on her anxieties to her own daughters, \u201cI felt I had to protect them from certain things about myself\u2026 But they didn\u2019t seem to need that protection.\u201d As a teenager, she didn\u2019t want to know too much family history, even about apparently trivial things, \u201cAll this is known, but unimaginable. I also wish I did not know it. I want my father to be just my father, the way he has always been, not a separate person with an earlier, mythological life of his own. Knowing too much about other people puts you in their power, they have a claim on you, you are forced to understand their reasons for doing things and then you are weakened.\u201dLines I liked* \u201dClothes lines are strung with\u2026 a display of soiled intimacy, which they [mothers] have washed and rinsed, plunging their hands into the grey curdled water.\"* About knowing about her brother\u2019s secret girlfriend, \u201cKnowing this secret\u2026 makes me feel important in a way. But it\u2019s a negative importance. I can know because I don\u2019t count.\u201d* \u201cWhat they call a shopping complex, as if shopping were a psychic disease.\u201d* In a department store, \u201cthe air is saturated with the stink of perfumes at war\u201d.* \u201cAll fathers except mine are invisible in day time; day time is ruled by mothers. But fathers come out at night. Darkness brings home the fathers, with their real, unspeakable power. There is more to them than meets the eye.\u201d* On the difference between faith and knowledge: Elaine thought she had a vision, but next morning was less certain, \u201cI\u2019m not sure now, that it really was the Virgin Mary. I believe it but I no longer know it.\u201d* \u201cArt is what you can get away with said somebody or other, which makes it sound like shop-lifting\u2026 A hijacking of the visual.\u201d* \u201cMy name has solidified around me, with time. I think of it as tough but pliable now, like a well-worn glove.\u201d* \u201cSomehow the war never ended after all, it just broke up into pieces and got scattered, it gets in everywhere, you can\u2019t shut it out.\u201d* On giving money to a beggar, \u201cIt\u2019s obscene to have such power; also to feel so powerless.\u201d* \u201cCraziness was considered funny, like all other things that were in reality frightening and profoundly shameful.\u201d* An antique shop has \u201cone-time throwouts, recycled as money\u201d.* The angry sex of a disintegrating relationship: \u201cWe make love, if that is any longer the term for it.

Its heroine, Elaine, has all these 'outward wits' which Atwood captures magnificently. But, although Elaine is an artist, she has almost nothing of the 'inward wits' of communal sense, imagination, fantasy, estimation or memory.The story is three dimensional: the North/South dimension of her life with her parents who migrate every year from Toronto to the Laurentians on biological field trips; the East/West dimension of her independent life which stretches from Toronto to Vancouver; and the temporal dimension of her own maturation.Periodically the three dimensions collapse into moments of insight and clarity that progress from childhood with age: boys are noisy and messy but essentially uncomplicated; girls are generally hateful even, especially, when they are friends; young men are superficial and boring; older men are duplicitous and domineering; motherhood is a schlep; marriage is a continuous losing battle; feminist sisterhood isn't to be trusted; art is largely pretense and scam and dates rather quickly.Elaine's life is a tale of haplessness, of lurching from one emotional trauma to the next. There are no plans, no goals, no passions. She falls into art as she falls into bed with unsuitable men. The step by step development of her life is told is Proustian detail but without the introspective analysis. Every action is compulsive with no apparent rationale.She knows this and learns from her traumatic experiences, but only those lessons that are relevant to the past, not to new situations. Every insight is obsolete as soon as she arrives at it. Her past persists in her feelings and her art, both inadequate for the world she inhabits now. She realizes that her life is a ruin, with no obvious cause for its ruination.So Elaine lives in pain. \"Pain is important but only certain kinds of it: the pain of women but not the pain of men. Telling about pain is called sharing.\" Among her feminist friends at least. She prefers men, even her ex-husband, to this therapeutic band. \"There's not much time left, for us to become what we intended,\" she says, as if she actually had an intention. Perhaps this is the source of her pain. \"Potential,\" she says, \"has a shelf life.\" But Atwood isn't saying what the source of her apathetic trajectory might be. She let's the reader make her own diagnosis."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james", "userReview": "As a relative latecomer to the works of Margaret Atwood (this was my fourth book in) \u2013 she continues to impress and engage immensely.\u2018Cat\u2019s Eye\u2019 has, like \u2018The Blind Assassin\u2019 (which it predates by around a decade) memory and memories as its central narrative device. Both novels have a central protagonist nearer to the end of their days than to the start \u2013 looking back and confronting the memories from various periods in their earlier lives. Ostensibly, that is as far as any similarity goes \u2013 beyond that the books bear\u2019s very little resemblance in either nature or narrative to each other.The very first page, indeed the opening paragraph, sets the scene, the tone and the theme \u2013 this is a novel all about time, it\u2019s all about dimension and circularity. This first page is so particularly well written, so compelling (even by Atwood\u2019s high standards) it defiantly draws the reader in, reels them in like an unsuspecting, helpless yet consenting catch, submissive on the end of Atwood\u2019s line. Thereon in we learn more about the childhood, formative years and life of our main protagonist \u2013 Elaine Risley latterly an artist, seemingly addressing her life through her work, making preparations for a retrospective of her paintings, whilst at the same time remembering and revisiting her past.The subsequent parts of the book concerning Risley's childhood are particularly strong, indeed outstanding \u2013 these form the heart and the most powerful part of the novel. Whilst this is clearly familiar territory for many writers, what Atwood gives us here is not the usual tired, clich\u00e9d, staid, mildly diverting but rose-tinted and empty nostalgia \u2013 as you would expect from some, Atwood gives us far more than that. Yes this is by definition of course a form of nostalgia (of the best kind) it has to be and it does provide us with some of the funniest work by Atwood that I have read thus far, nevertheless and nostalgia nothwithstanding\u2026underlying all this there is always a brooding presence, a sense of foreboding, a feeling of impending doom. There\u2019s an expectation of a fall, of a downward trajectory\u2026always just on the horizon, always around the next corner, always just behind that door\u2026 It has been noted by others in the past that \u2018Cat\u2019s Eye\u2019 is a \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 for girls\u2026. For this novel is ultimately all about the scars, the fears, the hurts and the pains of childhood \u2013 that in many cases stay with us throughout our lives; indeed in some cases define the rest of our lives.This is the world of the playground bully, playground rules, unwritten codes of conduct and a childhood world where making one wrong social move can have dire and unspeakable consequences. This is so very well written and portrayed by Atwood \u2013 conveying a deeply disturbing picture of the world of growing up, trying to fit in \u2013 in a world of covert bullying, perfidious and all pervading.It could be argued that this element to the novel presents what is essentially a Freudian world view and analysis \u2013 all about the traumas, the mental scars of childhood remaining with us, affecting and determining our lives, defining our futures. \u2018Tell me about your childhood\u2019\u2026 as it were. But I think what Atwood provides is something more sophisticated and complex than that, more profound and less simplistic. There is much here about the compulsion to recognise, to acknowledge and to confront the demons of our childhood. It does feel very much throughout this novel that there is the need for this confrontation, for resolution and for closure \u2013 as to whether Atwood gives us this\u2026I will leave you to decide\u2026Perhaps, as in life (or at least some lives) the parts of this novel concerning childhood do seem to determine and define the remainder of the novel. Whilst the passages concerning teenage years and adulthood in \u2018Cat\u2019s Eye\u2019 are on the whole extremely well-written and engaging, as you\u2019d expect from Atwood \u2013 for the most part they don\u2019t have the same emotional impact and power as those concerning childhood. It should be noted that there are apparently some elements contained herein from, or influenced by Atwood\u2019s early life, however she has repeatedly stressed that the plot is an entirely fictitious one. This is not even close to being semi-autobiographical.This is a novel about the circularity of life and of time \u2013 this much is clear from the opening page. It is about the ending(s) and the beginning(s) \u2013 the beginning(s) and the ending(s) \u2013 the child within us is always there, the past is always ever-present, always with us.\u201cTime is not a line but a dimension\u2026nothing goes away\u2026\u201d Whilst possibly not quite in the same league as \u2018The Blind Assassin\u2019 or indeed \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 \u2013 this is undoubtedly a very fine book, Atwood writes so very well and with such skill; \u2018Cat\u2019s Eye\u2019 is clearly another important part of the hugely impressive Margaret Atwood literary canon and is not to be missed."}, {"userName": "\u0130ntellecta", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67897611-ntellecta", "userReview": "\"Katzenauge\" is one of the many novels of the well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood.It is the story of two women and their friendship; a friendship that became hostility - a story about childhood, about growing up.The style of writing is gripping, almost enthralling, so that the reader feels so close to reading so the impression arises that the narrative contains biographical features."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "Margie!It's a little tough-going to talk about this book, because the description makes it sound so Ya-Ya Sisterhood chick-lit. Girl/girl friendships, coming of age, an assembly-line presentation of messy sexual relationships, dadurdydurr. It's sad that a simple outline of the plot could potentially close off 50% (or more) of the population's interest in reading this book, because unlike her speculative fiction, this is less a plot-driven novel reveling in world-building, and more of a parade of just absolutely extraordinary craft. While I may tell you that this novel is like a metaphor pride-parade, it doesn't read like something flimsy stuffed with stylistic filler. Coming from an artist just over-the-hill, cold and regretful yet still working through her own specific contributions to the wrecking of her life, the turgid yet sardonic Elaine rings true. And yeah, it's a book about girl/girl relationships, coming of age, and an assembly-line presentation of messy sexual relationships. A damn good one.Having said that! I guess I can see how the book may hit more emotional targets if you know what it's like to be a girl growing up in the shitstorm that is girl culture, but it can be such a savage, exacting world that I don't see how it couldn't hold the interest of just about anyone fascinated by human dynamics and the way childhood experiences and societal expectations can straight fuck you up. For me, there were a number of special little memory triggers, but the same pile of words could be thrown in someone else's lap and make a whole different but equally interesting kind of mess. The story covers an artist's life from her childhood in the 40's to the day of a retrospective of her work in the 1980's, particularly focusing on her longest, closest, and most complicated female relationship. And that stuff, man. I think a lot of us ladies grew up with or perhaps even were a Cordelia, a maddening sort both loveable and detestable, the most horrible yet weirdly loyal person you may ever know. Mine was this pretty, six-feet-in-middle-school Cordelia-type who did all kinds of messed up betrayal type stuff to my little feelings over the years (stealing my things, sleeping with every boy I even sort of liked as soon as she could manage it, subtle manipulation to make me feel insecure \u2013 she got me, but no one else did or could, pathological lies, sabotaging all my other female friendships out of jealousy, the works), but literally boot-kicked the chest of someone for just looking at me funny, cracked a head open with metal object for unkind words, showed up at just the right time to jump in front of me as a group of three older girls who didn't like the look of grungy (hey, remember the early 90's?) wee-me were about to make full use of their size/numbers advantage until she frightened them away with her homicidal, cub-defending threats, took the fall when we would get in trouble, etc. My platonic, Amazonian boyfriend-girl. A lot like Cordelia with her insidiousness, really, and the shift in power over the years that occurs between Elaine and Cordelia created similar echoes of that girl and I's relationship as I grew into myself and away from what I eventually realized had always been a pretty toxic friendship. I may be horribly malformed and suspicious and still struggle when it comes to female relationships largely because of my years with her, but at least I never got the shit beat out of me for being poor and weird, right? But people aren't caricatures, and the situation and motives were more complicated than just that. In Cordelia, Atwood has brought to life that sort of brutal blood-sister mentality, then sliced it open and poked around a bit. It's surprising what shitty ways people will treat one another because they are emotionally damaged and needy in ways they don't understand. You never know how insecurity will manifest itself. Sometimes a person subconsciously manipulates and demeans you because they really just don't want you to reject them, to outgrow them and go away. They want you pinned under paw, not to torment or smush you, but to keep you close and codependent. That is Cordelia. I don't think I'm being overly generous as far as my situation goes, either; when I finally formally ended that long-standing friendship, I was astonished by how crushed the girl was, and how sure she was that she had never done anything wrong, and had been the best kind of friend imaginable. It was the only time I saw her looking truly weak, and much like Elaine, it didn't make me feel powerful or good about myself. Just surprised and sad and really, really glad she didn't beat me up for it.That's just some of how I related to the book. I don't really know how else to talk about it, except to say that it's beautifully written and absorbing (like a tampon!), and if you read it, I swear your dick won't fall off. It's seriously accomplished for a faux-memoir (you know, a mem-wah), riddled with stunning visuals and turns of phrase and illuminating analyses of human-on-human social and sexual warfare. Even the best of people are kiiinda batshit and broken in places. Here you will find a whole bunch of reasons why.Also, Elaine's areligious, environmental-apocalypse-theorist, entomologist dad is the coolest.

While passing the big boulevard of University Avenue, I even looked up at a couple of windows in dull, brick buildings (I\u2019m sure the original has been torn down, replaced by something more modern), imagining the girls on one of the upper floors caustically commenting on the tacky floats. Images like that pervade this nostalgia-tinged book about Elaine Risley, a painter in mid-career, who visits the city where she grew up while a retrospective of hers is going up in a chic Queen Street West gallery. Cat\u2019s Eye is a novel full of ghosts, especially that of Elaine\u2019s childhood nemesis, Cordelia, who taunts her, torments her and in one particularly disturbing scene leaves her to die one winter night in one of Toronto\u2019s ravines. Spoiler alert: Elaine survives, and the way she\u2019s rescued is suffused with a mystical element that later works its way into her art.Elaine is now based in Vancouver, but as she walks past landmarks she keeps thinking she sees Cordelia. She\u2019s also haunted by her brilliant physicist brother, and the intense games she and he were forced to play to be accepted socially once they moved from rural Ontario, where their father studied bugs, to the city. This is one of Atwood\u2019s most personal books. Her father was indeed an entomologist, and she and her family did live for many years in the woods, isolated from the social rules and hierarchies of city life. It's filled with lots of sensual details \u2013 sights, sounds, tastes \u2013 that evoke childhood, youth and young adulthood.The book also provides a clear-eyed look at the complex relationships among women \u2013 friends? rivals? competitors? \u2013 especially in the decades before the feminist movement.And for anyone familiar with Toronto, Atwood provides a very amusing look at how the city has changed: not just geographically but culturally, with every hip pretension and snobby boutique savagely skewered. The details about Elaine\u2019s early works \u2013 and the media reaction to a feminist group show \u2013 are also fascinating. And the way women are treated in the art world \u2013 first at school and then professionally \u2013 have a documentary-like realism to them. Atwood knows this scene.I wanted a bit more about Elaine\u2019s current relationships. And there\u2019s a schematic quality to the book\u2019s time scheme that Atwood has used in other books, like The Blind Assassin.But this is a powerful, essential novel in Atwood\u2019s oeuvre, and one of the best novels about this city ever written."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104004-jessica", "userReview": "\"Another belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise.\"Simply put, I worship this book. Cat\u2019s Eye follows the controversial painter Elaine as she reflects upon her childhood and younger years when she returns to Toronto (the city of her youth) for a retrospective of her works. Her reflections stir up memories of friendship, longing, betrayal, love, hate, and pain. Especially haunting are her memories of Cordelia, a childhood friend with whom she had a complex relationship. It is a truly brilliant story, so completely well-written and beautiful that I just wanted to read certain sentences over and over again. Her story also rouses intense emotions in the reader, as we can all unearth memories of childhood friendships gone awry, awkward teenage years, and failed love. Elaine finds she needs to mourn her past in order to get through the present. Her past is so achingly realistic and personal, that you can\u2019t help but empathize and contemplate your own personal grief. That\u2019s not to say the book is fully depressing; instead, I would say that it is haunting. There are certain things to which I can relate at this exact moment in my life, which may have caused the book to have a bigger impact on me than it might for others. Regardless, I think this is another brilliant masterpiece by Atwood and would recommend it to both Atwood fans, and those new to her writing."}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "[well in this case the child is the Mother of the Woman, but the general principle is the same (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "We have just started reading another historic Booker shortlist in The Mookse and the Gripes group. This time the year is 1989, and although The Remains of the Day is one of my favourite Booker winners, this one must have come pretty close.The narrator is Elaine, an artist who has returned from a new life in Vancouver to Toronto, the city where she spent most of her formative years, to attend and supervise a career retrospective exhibition.Each of the book's sections begins with a short introductory chapter set in the present and proceeds to tell another part of her life story, these start in childhood and gradually catch up.The dominant relationship is the one with her childhood friend Cordelia. At the start of the book Cordelia is presented as a scheming and manipulative bully. This part of the story is powerful and very believable, and culminates in an incident where Elaine almost drowns after falling through ice while trying to recover a hat Cordelia has thrown off a bridge.Later in childhood the balance of power in their relationship changes. Elaine becomes more successful and Cordelia more needy, and it becomes clear that Cordelia and the need to resolve their relationship still haunts Elaine as an adult.The best parts of this book are very strong, but perhaps it is a little too long. The sections on Elaine's development as an artist and her marriages were less interesting, but did allow Atwood to find humour in the gallery curator's attempts to find meaning in the personal pieces."}, {"userName": "Debbie \"DJ\"", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj", "userReview": "Nearly impossible to write a review for such a masterful work as this. All I can do is write some of my thoughts while reading this. It's like a psychological character study. It's the feelings that are evoked. Everything is full of descriptions, the meaning belongs to the reader. Atwood brings me to the brink, then pulls back leaving me with a sense of uneasiness. Our lives can only be interpreted by us. Which of my own memories have been blocked, or purposely left unremembered only to surface in other areas without an understanding. How well do we know anyone, as we carry our own secret thoughts, what do others carry.See? I will be pondering this book long after it's reading.

In fact this one is quite amazingly interesting. It revolves around the memories of the main character, Elaine who recalls her friendships as a young girl. It becomes apparent that she was bullied quite severely by her young friends and one of them in particular. As the story progresses we find that in the end Elaine escapes from the bullying and eventually even turns the tables. The bullied becomes the bully. It is a sad story but written in Atwood's amazingly beautiful style, it becomes a superb reading experience."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "When I was considering whether to read this or not, what flashed through my head was, \u201cDo you really want to read a book about bullying?\u201d I knew this was the book\u2019s central theme. I thought, \u201cWhat can I learn from this?\u201d I knew, even before picking up the book, how despicable such behavior is. I knew where I stood, so I wondered what more could be learned.By reading this book one experiences on an emotional level the cruelty and the fear and anguish bullying inflicts on another. The experience becomes excruciating personal. It is not something you are soon to forget. A deeper understanding is achieved of the pain and grief involved and of its long-term effects. I am very glad I read the book. I have never been bullied. I now look on such behavior with a fuller understanding.This book is about a trio of girls who bullied a fourth. They are eight, nine years old when the bullying starts. Why this happens, the consequences of bullying and how adults react are all explored. In depth. The book follows Elaine Risley, the girl who is bullied, from her earliest years to when she is middle aged. She has become a prestigious artist and is having a retrospective of her work in Toronto, but this is also where she grew up and where the bullying occurred. Elaine thinks back, remembers and draws conclusions about what she wishes could have been different.The story is told in \u201cparts\u201d, each part split into chapters. Each part begins in the present, i.e. at the time of Elaine\u2019s retrospective, which is probably in the 1980s. She is telling her story; we are hearing her point of view. Her thoughts in the present drift back to events in her past. Past events are told in chronological order, so each new flashback starts where the last one ended, making the story easy to follow.The reader sees life in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. We look at how life has changed during this time-period. Elaine\u2019s relationship with those in her family changes of course too. This is a coming-of-age story. It is about her relationship with her brother. It is about being a woman, being employed and being independent. The book is not just about bullying! It is about art and art criticism. The book keeps you thinking, on not just one topic but many. The book has wonderful lines. Look at these:\u201cKnowing too much about other people puts you in their power, they have a claim on you, you are forced to understand their reasons for doing things and then you are weakened.\u201d\u201cAnother belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise.\u201d\u201cThere is never only one of anyone.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s never learned the intricacies of male silences.\u201d\u201cLove blurs your vision; but after it recedes, you can see more clearly than ever. It's like the tide going out, revealing whatever's been thrown away and sunk: broken bottles, old gloves, rusting pop cans, nibbled fish bodies, bones. This is the kind of thing you see if you sit in the darkness with open eyes, not knowing the future. The ruin you've made.\u201d \u201cWhat we share may be a lot like a traffic accident but we get one another. We are survivors of each other. We have been shark to one another, but also lifeboat. That counts for something.\u201d\u201cWe make love for the comfort of it.\u201d\u201cHe is like an apple after a prolonged gluttonous binge.\u201d\u201cLittle girls are cute and small only to adults. To one another they are not cute. They are life sized.\u201d \u201cYou don't look back along time but down through it, like water. Sometimes this comes to the surface, sometimes that, sometimes nothing. Nothing goes away.\u201d \u201cArt is a hijacking of the visual.\u201d\u201cArt is something you can do at home, in your spare time.\u201d\u201cYou can draw art very well, but you cannot draw life.\u201d\u201cToday on the way home, it snows. Big, soft caressing flakes fall onto our skin like cold moths; the air fills with feathers.\u201d \u201cHe looks like someone who will later turn up on a stamp.\u201dThe book is described as being disturbing, hilarious and compassionate. It is all three. The lines upset, make you laugh and cry and leave you thinking.The audiobook is very, very well narrated by Laurel Lefkow. She makes Elaine sound real, both when she is young and as she becomes older. Her thoughts and her emotions feel genuine. It felt like Elaine was talking to \nme\n. This is definitely my favorite book by the author. It has excellent writing, which I also saw in her other novels of a more dystopian bent, but the realism of this novel made it much easier for me to relate to the characters."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.When renowned and controversial painter, Elaine Risley, returns to her home-town of Toronto it sparks in her a confrontation of her buried past. Dark childhood secrets resurface and the Risley everyone believes they know is actually as fractured as the truth hidden inside her creations.This was an interesting chronicle of one woman's life. I adored how the reader is introduced to Risley in her present, older self, before we are invited to return to her childhood and explore how the woman and the child become one.This was a poignantly dark exploration of adolescence, with topics such as bullying, sorrow, misogyny and individual prejudice discoursed upon. I especially found myself most grief-stricken when reading of the initially seemingly harmless interactions and struggles for dominance in her first girl-friendship group, which shared a stark similarity with my own. Atwood perfectly captured what it was like, at least for me, growing up with a burgeoning awareness of myself as both feminine and an individual. The simultaneous pettiness and brutality of children is also captured here and the emotions were most raw for me, throughout the relaying of this entire period.From here the reader moves to college and as Risley ages so do her experiences alter and shape her. Whilst all of innovation and intrigue, none quite compared to the sorrow of youth, for me however.This quietly clever novel is quite simply brilliant. The accumulation of life events are laid bare for the reader to discover and the journey leads us back to the beginning: to the individual this opened with."}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "There is still a wide-eyed teenager living inside me, and this book makes my melty twee little heart break and sing in equal measure.

You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.Buffy: Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?Cordelia: Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.(from Buffy the Vampire Slayer season one episode Out of Sight, Out of Mind.)Cordelia, I love you (most of the time), but it reaaaaally doesn't beat being alone all by yourself.  I've been through the ringer, the rinse (and repeat) cycle, what have you, time and again. Bullied? Been there and done that and got the t-shirt (a few sizes too large so the catty girls can imply I have a weight problem). I've got stories that are dead on the spot to kill all the cells for more hair and nail curlingly embarrassing cringe worthy trips down memory lane. My saving grace was that the bullies were not my friends. I should say that I knew that they were not my friends. Elaine's so-calleds are the Ike Turner variety. We meant it, baby. You had it coming, baby. Or more like a slot machine that lets you win once in a great while to keep you thinking that you might just win this time. It's the jackpot of approval. If you do win they'll just take it back like the Florida lotto taking back the money they said they gave to education. (The dreaded backhanded compliment! Pleaaaaaaaaaaaaase, anything but that. Just watch the French film Ridicule and you will be a pro.)Not too long ago I heard a great bit of wisdom on coughs teen show Pretty Little Liars coughs (Don't judge me! It's addicting) from most likely to be suspected of murder town scapegoat, Toby, to the lesbian in disguise, Emily, that if you change yourself to be what others want you to be they still won't like you. What they really want is for you to go away. Okay, that wasn't really anything I hadn't figured out on my own but I thought it was pretty apt all the same. Mission: Impossible. When I was a miserable kid I'd go through those vicious encounters and take apart everything I might have done differently to avoid it. I always came up with not a damned thing. I could have skipped school, again. Unlike Elaine, my tormentors were mostly boys. (Something about getting breasts at age ten. It took a very long time to get over that.) I did find it awfully irritating all of her assessments about getting along with boys, boys being so much easier, blah blah blah. I'll get to the sexist undertones later. It annoyed the fuck out of me and greatly contributed to my three star rating. (Okay, I'll do it now. I'll go on many different tangents and might not remember later. It read like I was being lied to, either on purpose or in a sidestepping all of the ramifications of bullies and those who get bullied by making it all about the bully. One, it's crap. There were shit men in her life. Why was it okay for them to call girls dogs and bitches? Because she \"knew\" they didn't mean HER? I could have used some feel for how the hell she took these sides beyond stereotypes about tomboys and a couple of bitchy girls. It just felt generic to me, I guess. Don't go giving me product of your times, Elaine! I'm not buying the claimed ease. There's got to be more to this story.)My brother told me the only thing that ever helped: people are only the cool kids when they are around other people just like them and they get to have some unspoken (or maybe it is spoken) rule that this is what is cool. Cat's Eye in the start of the book is a more intriguing read than in the end for having that sense that it could have gone another way. Was it really the end all of Elaine's life? It isn't anything you do yourself that brings it on. It is who you are with that determines the drift. If Cordelia had brought that used sanitary napkin to a different set of girls they might have crucified her for it. Not to mention a number of things done by Carol or Grace. These are not sophisticated girls. How DID it happen in the first place, other than the pain in the ass need to be liked? Elaine did not understand it, merely prayed for the winds from the star I see tonight to blow the candle out and make that wish for it to be Carol's turn come true. Cat's Eye is a middle aged lady waiting for someone else to explain it to her. In their sinister playtime they are bended to Cordelia's whims. It was her golden age because of them. The three girls picked up her mean brain waves and her itch or whatever it was was scratched (no doubt it has to go somewhere). (I hope she didn't have kids for an all new audience.) Elaine doesn't know what forces called Cordelia to her torment. No latter day \"My, this neighborhood has changed!\" walk through could have been as good as feeling that anything might happen. Cat's Eye was missing that feeling too often and it was completely gone in the later half. Damn Elaine was too busy wishing it had never happened to give me the insight that I wanted! The painful self consciousness (if not awareness) that was so real in the memories of childhood disappears into bland narcissism. I mean, they tried to murder her! Telling Elaine's mother that she had some school thing was a deliberate attempt to prevent Elaine's body from being found. That's sick as shit! There's no way it was all about power. They had to have been gleeful about it as they pushed Carol to be the one to tell Elaine's mother. My court of law says they are fully culpable. Nuh uh, no way did Elaine \"switch places\" with Cordelia. If Cordelia was acting out abuse from her father and two sisters, what were Carol and Grace doing? Escalating torture? Little sociopaths of Canada? Not that I'm sure that Elaine realized the implications of their Elaines whereabouts story to Mother so she wouldn't go looking for her... Exactly! She STILL doesn't get it. Why?! Would she have done any differently if it were Carol or Grace in her watery hole? Or Cordelia? I think not. Is this why it does not have meaning to her? Because it is what you do? I was expecting it be revealed that Elaine was one of those unreliable narrators. An unreliable narrator in the sense that she did not know herself or her own story to tell it. I wearied of this. Was Elaine's part time sexism really because of what Cordelia and her cronies did to her? Sure, she claims to have such an easy time of it with men... Um, what about that creepy as shit art professor who you let treat you like his bitch? Or going into the nuthouse 'cause your relationship didn't work out? Or going back for memory sex with him when you've got your comforting I can take or leave you second husband? How did Elaine really feel about anyone? I have a bad feeling that she could easily have been Carol and Grace herself (she did admit to enjoying the time or two when it was Carol's turn) for all her lack of independent thought from generalizations and rationalizations. I'm thinking that's the real reason she is a woman grown and not over it.What I really want to say is there are long, long parts of life stuff that reads like when someone tells you they lived some \"You know how it goes\" life thing, and either doesn't want to admit they aren't like what they think everyone else is supposed to be like, or they have no personality at all. I can't decide which is which but I didn't care after a while. I don't know if her experience as a little girl had everything to do with Cordelia if she didn't remember it until much later in life. There HAD to be something more to it than that. What Cat's Eye really read like to me was trying to get around saying what one really feels because they are afraid it is the wrong thing to say, or will make them look bad. The ending felt to me like Elaine is going to be uneasy until her dying day if she never gets that final reassurance from Cordelia. It's okay, I like you. (Isn't that why people like bullies? They feel cool if that person who doesn't like other people likes them.) What I do know is that shit about girls being more cruel than boys is bull shit. Man, that really bothered me about this book. Watch the film If... (Malcolm McDowell landed his A Clockwork Orange role due to this performance) or read Robert Graves's memoir Goodbye to All That. Buggering little buggers, man! It's a hard thing to do, anyway. I didn't believe that Winona Ryder's character wanted Heather #1 to like her. She was way too collected for that. The other two Heathers, yeah. Mean Girls she wanted to be her. Did Elaine want to be Cordelia? Maybe this speaks badly of me... (I can have a mean tongue myself. It has chased away attempted bullies in my adult life. Don't knock it!) I didn't think it was that bad! It's not like she tried to kill her! I was more bothered by the creepy I'm upset I'm not as young and hot as I want to be whingeing. There had to have been more to it than I met this girl and she didn't like me. Maybe Elaine wants to \"win\" over and over again and will never grow up. I can guess what that winning entails and I'm glad to not be reading Cat's Eye any longer. If there wasn't any more to it... Why did I ever waste my time worrying or getting upset when I'm not liked? John Malkovich once said that how someone feels about something he says is about them, not him. I aspire to one day be like John Malkovich. In reality I'm more like Morrissey. How dare you don't like me! Sobs. Cutting remark. Sobs. I'm gonna die aloooooone. Sobs. (Sobs. Sobs. Sobs! Poor Morrissey!) I'm thinking John Malkovich has got something here, other than the whole attempted murder part, of course. That would be hard to brush off. Unless you were Elaine and seemingly incapable of original thought.. If one could grow thick skin... Cordelia: Harmony, shut up. Do you know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep.Harmony: I'm not a sheep.Cordelia: You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm way cooler than you are 'cause I'm not a sheep. I do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what? I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how lame he is. (Buffy again! From Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered. That's season two for the lame lay person.)Cordelia is a sheep. Elaine is a sheep. Carol is a sheep and Grace is a sheep. If you are as cool as who you are with... Not wolves in sheeps clothing but sheep in sheeps clothing acting as their own shepherds in some closed off pasture. And they are also the mongrels (I mean dogs). Lassie IS a bitch. Baaaaaah. That's the moral of this story as I see it. It must suck to be a sheep and it must doubly suck to be caught in with other sheep. It sucked for me to be caught with this sheep (Elaine)."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16973418-tracey", "userReview": "Another magnificent read for me from one of my new favorite authors Margaret Atwood.

She has such a keen sense of the human experience, a strong skill of observation, and she comments so wonderfully on these insights that I am moved and troubled in reading her works. She forces me to think about my individual experience as well as its reflection in light of our connected humanity.Cat's Eye follows Elaine Risley, an elderly woman, famous for her controversial paintings, as she prepares for a retrospective show of her work and reflects on her childhood. Particularly, Elaine is haunted by the memories of Cordelia, her best friend and biggest bully from her school days. That complicated relationship affects how Elaine handles her marriage(s), family life, and career. Like I said, Atwood is so observant. Her attention to detail and almost hyper-awareness of the human psyche is so impressive. The story is excellently crafted as well. Details resurface time and again to link the narrative into a cohesive piece, much like the cat's eye is a motif in Elaine's paintings and life story. I didn't expect much going into it, actually knowing very little about the story, but I was pleasantly surprised. It makes me excited to continue to read from Atwood's oeuvre. 4.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Miss Ravi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21314656-miss-ravi", "userReview": "\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0627\u062a\u0648\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0645\u060c \u06af\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0632\u0647. \u0686\u0634\u0645 \u06af\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0646\u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u062a\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0632\u0647 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u06a9\u0634 \u06a9\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u06a9\u0634\u0634 \u06cc\u06a9 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u067e\u0634\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647. \u062d\u062c\u0645 \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0634\u200c\u0628\u06a9\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u062d\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0642\u0637\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u06af\u0634\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0642\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u062a\u0648\u0648\u062f \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u0622\u0647\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0622\u0647\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0634\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u062f."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "So what do you do when you're a girl and you have this peculiar friend, who is also your worst abuser, but for some reason you hang out with her, go to the same school and all that jazz? Why, you become a controversial painter, get involved with some creepy men, and then sort of go on from there. Good thing your brother is a semi-genius fascinated with spacetime and all its promises, and your dad is this entomologist who travels all over the country with his family. We don't want things to be too normal, because that would be so boring!Cat's Eye is the story of Elaine Risley, the character in question who reflects on her life as she arrives in Toronto for a retrospective of her art. She remembers her brother, Stephen; travels over the country with her father and the life she has led. But most of all she remembers Cordelia, Cordelia who was at once her best friend and tormentor. The narrative switches between the past and the present, as Elaine tries to understand what has happened to her so far and what she should make of it. The exact same approach was used in The Blind Assasin, Atwood's Booker winning novel, and I dare to say a better work. There the narrative flow was smoother, transitions less jarring; it felt natural. Not so with Cat's Eye, which was also nominated for the Booker, but didn't win.The main theme of the novel is the development of relationships between girls, and the unique topic of female bullying. This isn't a theme explored often in fiction, and the theme of past experience influencing present experiences and their lasting effect becomes the main crux of the narrative. As the novel takes place in mid 20-th century Canada it is also rich in commentary about the political and social situation in the country: the relationship of the country with the British Empire during the second World War, and the forming of Canadian identity, the visit of the British royalty; another war, and the draft dodgers who arrive in Canada to avoid going to Vietnam, and the reality they faced that didn't quite met their expectations, the city of Toronto and its evolution through the years. These themes appear one after another and never feel properly developed, making their inclusiom seem to be only tactical, as if the author checking points to cover for the reading group's guide to include at the end of the text. Instead of being fully developed they have been reduced to mere remarks, whispers and utterances.Margaret Atwood is a fabulous writer, and reading her describe everyday situation will put you as if you were there with her, on the streets of the city or deep in the wilderness, both natural and that of the human mind. However, in Cat's Eye I felt that her powers weren't quite on their full display, as with her later novels The Blind Assasin and . Any Atwood novel is worth the time spent on reading it, and this is no exception; however, I did wish at moments that the time I spent on reading Cat's Eye would flow faster."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57090347-maria", "userReview": "Elaine, a painter, returns to her childhood city of Toronto to participate in an exhibition in her honor. There, she is flooded by childhood memories, especially of her childhood friend and tormentor, Cordelia. This is a book about bullying, and how it can affect your whole life. The novel changes between short descriptions of Elaines present visit to Toronto, and longer passages of childhood memories. The childhood memories starts with Elaine travelling around with her parents and big brother, never having a place to call home. When they eventually buy a house in Toronto and settle down, Elaine is introduced to a mystical world she has only ever read about before: the world of girls.I always find it interesting to read about the world seen from a child's point of view, at least as long as it is realistic and the child is not too cute or naive. Atwood gets this just right, she is brilliant at describing the cruelty and selfishness of children, and how happenings in their life, things adults can find amusing or of little consequence, often have a life or death importance to the children themselves. And more than anything else, Atwood nails the social rules and conventions of children. Their imaginary worlds, the different games and their laws. The importance of winning the best marbles. The ways girls are supposed to play: dressing up and cutting things out of magazines, rather than playing war and climbing trees, like boys do. All the do's and don'ts.When Elaine comes back from a summer holiday away from \"the world of girls\", she is quickly re-assimilated into the rules she must follow among her friends and schoolmates, for example how to behave when you have to wear skirts again:Now that I have changed from pants to skirts, I have to remember the moves. You can't sit with your legs spread apart, or jump to high or hang upside-down, without ridicule. I've had to re-learn the importance of underwear, which has a liturgy of its own:\tI see England, I see France,\tI can see your underpants.Or else: \tMe no know, me no care, \tMe no wear no underwear.This is said by boys, while making faces like monkeys. And young Elaine more or less uncritically internalizes the hierarchies and values of this system, even though she is able to see through them now and then.Into this world enters Cordelia, and everything gets turned up a notch. Cordelia constantly criticizes and corrects Elaine, and make other girls spy on her and report back. Elaine is always watched, she can never relax. She is often punished and sometimes rewarded, depending on Cordelia's whim. And Elaine desperately wants to please, to the point where she is not able to say no to anything she is told to do. One time, Elaine refuses to babysit a one year old boy, because she knows that if Cordelia orders her to do something that might hurt the baby, she will not be able to say no.Cat's Eye is predominantly about power constellations between people, both children and adults. Even grown-up Elaine, who is in her fifties, still seems affected by this. She often comments on how fashions and different styles has changed throughout her life. Trends, social rules, how you look and how people perceive you is never far from her mind, not even when she tries to be critical and distanced about it. When she visits the gallery in Toronto that's going to exhibit her paintings, she is very critical and negative about the place, to the point where I was wondering how a professional, experienced painter could feel so uncomfortable in what should be her own domain:I open the gallery door, walk in with that sinking feeling I always have in galleries. It's the carpets that do it to me, the hush, the sanctimoniousness of it all: galleries are too much like churches, there's too much reverence, you feel there should be some genuflecting going on. Also I don't like that this is where paintings end up, on these neutral-toned walls with the track lighting, sterilized, rendered safe and acceptable.I don't give a glance to what's still on the walls, I hate those neo-expressionist dirty greens and putrid oranges, post this, post that. Everything is post, these days, as if we're all just a footnote to something earlier that was real enough to have a name of its own.This older Elaine is much more critical, which is to be expected. But right after this description, there is a scene where she feels like a small and stupid pushover among the twenty-something women who work at the gallery. An interview for a magazine, where Elaine loathes the questions she is asked, but feels like she can't defend herself against them, ends like this:Her voice is getting farther and farther away, I can hardly hear her. But I see her, very clearly: the ribbing on the neck of her sweater, the fine hairs on her cheek, the shine of a button. What I hear is what she isn't saying: Your clothes are stupid. Your art is crap. Sit up straight and don't answer back.In my opinion Elaine fails when she tries to free herself of the need to please others, to fit in. It's something she can never quite get rid of.Only the first half of the book describes Elaine's childhood. In later chapters, her life progresses more rapidly, until it catches up with present day Elaine, having her exhibition in Toronto. I really like reading good childhood narratives, and there is something special about the age 8-12. So when Elaine's story moved on, into her teenage years and beyond, I was surprised, and a little disappointed. But seeing how her childhood sufferings effected her later on, and how her psyche tries to deal with it, was interesting and at times emotional.I also really enjoyed the descriptions of Elaine's paintings. At one point, Elaine says that she stopped painting what was without, and started painting what was within. All her paintings are very personal, they are stories from her life that very few people would recognize. So while the curators at her exhibition tries to interpret them into different periods and art styles and show how they criticize patriarchy or some other aspect of society, it's really just a painting of an elementary school teacher Elaine didn't like or something like that.All in all, I really liked this book, although it had its ups and downs. Not all of it was great, or even that interesting. But most of it was good, and parts of it really made me feel something strongly while I was reading, which is always a good thing. Atwood is so good at driving the point home. Everything she describes is so accurate, and at the same time it feels effortless. It's always a pleasure to read her, and no matter how dark it can get, there is always a lot of humor there as well."}, {"userName": "Chris Dietzel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19351209-chris-dietzel", "userReview": "Until now, Surfacing was my favorite non-dystopian book by Atwood. Cat's Eye now claims that spot. There were parts of this that were so honest and awkward in their depiction of children being cruel to each other that it was uncomfortable to read. Atwood does an amazing job of providing a main character who is not necessarily an unreliable narrator but who is definitely an unaware narrator. And yet the author finds ways to convey subtle ideas of just how unaware that narrator is without ruining the main character's voice. A really wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Agreenhouse", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1322308-agreenhouse", "userReview": "This book has been on my must-read list for a long time, so I was very excited to finally get my hands on a copy. Unfortunately, as much as I tried, I did not love this book. The language was absolutely stunning, with scenes rendered with such poetic language and detail that I felt I was in the scene. The problem was that the scenes Atwood described were so miserable, I did not want to be there. I have never been to Toronto, and after reading this book, I never want to go. I can't imagine a more bleak, desolate place on the planet. I am sure the Canadian Tourist Bureau does not promote this book. The narrator is a depressed woman, and this book just made me feel depressed. Did Margaret Atwood ever right anything happy, or at least with a little bit of hope? One of the reasons I wanted to read this book was it has to do with bullying among girls, and as a teacher in charge of a class full of fourth-grade mean girls, I hoped to get some insight into what happens between the children when I am not looking. The best quote of the book is \"Most mothers worry when their daughters reach adolscence, but I was the opposite. I relaxed, I sighed with relief. Little girls are cure and small only to adults. To one another, they are not cute. They are life sized.\"I have reminded myself of this quote during the past few weeks, confronting certain girls about their behavior, refusing to ignore or dismiss even the slightest of hurtful remarks. Before I became a teacher, I might have thought that Atwood exaggerated the cruelty among children,especially girls, but I have seen them design and carry evil schemes, soley for the sake of excluding certain students and putting themselves into positions of power. For example, two girls in my class stole the trip money from another girl because they did not want her going on the field trip. Isn't that unbelievable!!? If you saw the two little thieves, you would not believe it because they are adorable and attend church every Sunday. In Cat's Eye, the parents were either powerless to stop the bullying or accomplices to it. The story takes place in the 1940s, when the gap between the worlds of children and adults seems much greater than it is today. Back then, what happened among children, stayed among children. I am still surprised that the mother in the story did not do more to protect her child. Part of the point of the book is that the effects of the bullying haunted the narrator her whole life. She was never able to form bonds with women, and in the end, she regrets the lack of female friendships. Another interesting \"historical\" element of the novel was the description of being a radical female artist in the 1970s. I realize now that I grew up in a post-feminist era because I could not see what was so radical about a group of women artists getting together to put on a show. Will the young children of today grow up in a post-racial era, not understanding the hoopla over an African-American president? I hope so."}, {"userName": "Karlyflower *The Vampire Ninja, Luminescent Monster & Wendigo Nerd Goddess of Canada (according to The Hulk)*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17243568-karlyflower-the-vampire-ninja-luminescent-monster-wendigo-nerd-godde", "userReview": "[Love blurs your vision; but after it recedes, you can see more cleary than ever.

I finished it really, really late the other night after a night out with some friends and was completely overwhelmed. It's taken me a few days to review it, just because of how emotionally devastating the book is.Cat's Eye (from the almost-always-fabulous Atwood) is less a narrative than a glimpse into a series of spectacularly vivid memories that Elaine Risley recalls as she returns to her hometown of Toronto for a retrospective on her paintings. There was really no part of the novel that didn't tug every mind/heart/whatever string inside of me. From the start to the finish, I was stunned by the masterful way in which Atwood brings back both the moments of and the way of viewing (from a child's perspective) childhood--I felt at times, even though I didn't share very many of Elaine's childhood, that I was reliving my own. At one moment, you are made to understand how isolated Elaine feels--because adults are unable to comprehend the cruelty children inflict upon one another. In the next, Elaine is experiencing a sort of \"loss of innocence\" as she realizes Mrs. Smeath has been completely aware of her daughter's misdeeds towards Elaine--and approves of them! It's exactly the sort of moment I always return to in my memories of childhood--the innocent enjoyment/ignorance of some things, and then the subsequent shattering of that innocence and ignorance. Atwood captures something so magical in her depictions of Elaine's childhood.Meanwhile, adult Elaine is coming to terms with her role in the world--as artist, as daughter, as mother, as wife, lover, sister, etc. Though I've got a long way to go before I reach the adult Elaine's age, I can already understand that same feeling of displacement as you realize life really will never be what you had imagined it when younger. Elaine has to reposition her own selfhood withing the roles she wishes to assume, and the roles thrust upon her (one particularly great moment is her interview with some punk trying to excavate some sort of vicious pseudo-feminist reponse out of Elaine).That was actually another high point in Atwood's handling of the novel--her ability to cope with such overtly feminist issues without making it a polemical. Her subtlety is ludicrously admirable. Don't get me wrong--I'm an incredibly ardent feminist--but I have so much respect for Atwood (who I believe was responding to her own experiences as an idolized \"feminist\" writer) and her ability to portray what it really means to be human, and one that has labels thrown at her (mostly) unwillingly.I could go on, but the bottom line is that this is one of the single best novels I've read in the past several years. The Handmaid's Tale is one of my all-time favorites, and Oryx & Crake only reinforced my love of Atwood's prose. But I was hesitant to dive into a more \"realistic\" novel by Atwood, as I hadn't much liked The Edible Woman. This completely shifted that opinion--now I can't wait to grab for the next Atwood novel off of my shelf. Highly recommended to, well, everyone!"}], "description": "Cat's Eye is the story of Elaine Risley, a controversial painter who returns to Toronto, the city of her youth, for a retrospective of her art. Engulfed by vivid images of the past, she reminisces about a trio of girls who initiated her into the fierce politics of childhood and its secret world of friendship, longing, and betrayal. Elaine must come to terms with her own identity as a daughter, a lover, and artist, and woman - but above all she must seek release from her haunting memories.
