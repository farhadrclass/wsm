His thinking is not systematic, and he has no interest in conforming to conventional ways of doing philosophy. He prefers an oblique approach, so he writes aphoristically, or in essays with a confined focus. He's also unapologetically emotional at times. All of which makes him hard to pin down. He will not stay in the box. The Solomons do a nice job of trying to contain the man. Robert Solomon is the more congenial speaker, a teacher of obvious talent who occasionally wanders off into personal anecdotes that demonstrate the power and everyday application of Nietzsche's ideas. It's not unlike the way Nietzsche himself presents himself in his work: heartfelt and honest, and not afraid to screw up a little. This is sort of rare in philosophy. Kathleen Solomon takes a more direct and plain approach, which would be fine were it not for her egregious overuse of the impersonal pronoun. One ought not do that, lest one be tempted to smite the lecturer with one's tattered copy of Beyond Good and Evil."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary", "userReview": "Most of the science or philosophy lectures I read (and listen to) will bring up Nietzsche in some way or another. So, at the best I was getting a spattering of Nietzsche's beliefs in an incoherent way. This lecture series has set me straight and has given me a consistent and coherent look at this very interesting philosopher (who at times could be inconsistent). Most philosophers I find wanting. After this lecture series, I must say I still find Nietzsche intriguing and worth reading more about his philosophy. From this series, it's easy to see that how people can read so many different things into his philosophy. I suspect that's what Nietzsche wanted from his readers. The lecturers (a husband and wife) were very good when they compare and contrast Nietzsche with different philosophies such as those of Kant, Schopenhauer, Existentialism, and Spinoza.I particularly disliked the book \"Closing of the American Mind\", by Bloom. My dislike for it hit me at a visceral level at the time I read it earlier this year. At the time, I wasn't sure why I disliked it so much, but, now, after having had listened to this lecture I understand why. Nietzsche at his core is a non-absolutist and thinks our truths are always a matter of perspective and our desire for self-esteem is what drives us. The author of the book, Bloom, thinks the exact opposite. He was using Nietzsche as a surrogate for all that he thought was wrong with America in the 1980s. I don't think Bloom, the author, was right then or is right now. I'd rather live with uncertainty and doubt then 'to pretend to know something I don't know'. In the end a lecture on a philosopher is only as good as the philosopher under consideration, Nietzsche is definitely worth considering and this lecture is definitely worth listening to. There's enough in these lectures in which the average listener will be able to take something from them and make it his (or her) own and be the wiser for it."}, {"userName": "Mohammad Ali Abedi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22641312-mohammad-ali-abedi", "userReview": "The audiobook is released by The Teaching Company, marketing their educational audiobooks as similar to college lectures.That might be true, but in no way is that a positive quality to me, as college education is awful.\u201cWill to Power - The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\u201d is an awful audiobook on Nietzsche. Its length is 12 hours, so it is not exactly a quick listen. But what an astonish waste of time. The lecturers are Robert C. Solomon and Kathleen M. Higgins, two professors with zero charisma in giving the lectures. It is incredible how much difference the way of speaking itself makes in an audiobook, and both Solomon and Higgins kept making me fade outThe biggest problem with the lectures is that Solomon and Higgins insist on defending Nietzsche\u2019s works to such a degree, that it castrates anything interest about him. This is a typical modern (or maybe in every generation?) approach. Take something interesting and try to force it to abide by today\u2019s standards of morality. Therefore, the lecturers take all the bite, force, and urgency out of Nietzsche\u2019s work, and turn it into a boring, trite, and safe piece of philosophy.I have not read any of his books yet, but I have read excerpts of his, and he is unique in philosophy for disregarding conventional boundaries of thought. He plows through accepted concepts, breaking walls, and forcing us to rethink everything. Solomon and Higgins are too preoccupied with Nietzsche\u2019s work not offending anyone that we are left with nothing."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16897950-tiffany", "userReview": "It took me nearly a year to get through this Teaching Company lecture because it wasn't what I was hoping for. As a relative newbie to all things philosophy I'm still looking to be spoon fed my philos like a baby. Professors Solomon and Higgins taught this course like they were talking to a group of adults with a cursory knowledge of Nietzsche's work and reputation. So not only did I begin at a disadvantage I also did not have the reading material they suggested for each lecture which I assume would have advanced my understanding greatly. One thing that would improve the strength of this course would be if the lecturers read portions of the text they would be extrapolating from. They didn't, so that opportunity to build confidence through repetition was lost. I have nothing else to say that could improve the course in any way--I observed they knew their subject intimately, they judged Nietzsche on the merits of the body of his work and did not unduly extirpate his texts to suit their theses. A laudable experiment. Ultimately if there was a failure here it was in my not being a better candidate for the material. If you have a passing acquaintance with Nietzsche and feel like deepening it this course is for you. One final remark--I'm always willing to admit my faults as a thinker or a learner when the subject matter is unfamiliar to me, but I do become worried and suspicious when lecturers try to illustrate points by bringing other subject matters into the lecture and they misquote or misattribute them. Prof. Solomon made two big-ass mistakes in areas I would've thought he had covered: first, he misquoted Emerson saying \"consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds\" when the JUICE in the statement is that Emerson said \"a FOOLISH consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\" There ain't nothing wrong with a healthy consistency--it's when it becomes dogma that there's a problem. The difference between the meaning of the two statements is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. Secondly, I don't know how he managed to put Jane Austen's infamous Mr. Collins in Sense and Sensibility when everybody knows he was Lizzy Bennett's personal bugaboo. There are only three books by women authors every male teacher should have read and Pride and Prejudice is one of them.

The lectures are about a half hour in length and are delivered by experts in their field, in this case, a married couple who are professors @ University of Texas and Nietzsche scholars. (Imagine their dinner table conversations!). It has been many years since I read Nietzsche as a college student, and like most of us, I have been subjected to misinformation about him and his contributions to Western philosophy. This course is an excellent corrective to distortions of his critique of the 19th century German culture in which he lived. Turns out he was not an anti-Semite. The course elucidates many of his important ideas such as \"will to power\", perspectivism, the death of God, the ubermensch, master/slave morality and the \"herd instinct.\" Two centuries later, his thought is still relevant to an understanding of our current \"culture war.\""}, {"userName": "John Doyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8670076-john-doyle", "userReview": "A clear and comprehensive exploration of Nietzsche's rejection of all dogmas (stoicism and religion alike) that tend to suppress expression of the individual will.

The Roman Catholic church did a terrible job with morals, and morals are God, so God is dead. He never existed.\t2. You should make your own morals, that correspond to life, unlike what the church did.\t3. Making your own morals makes you the ubermensch, who is superior to the untermensch, who purvey false morals that do not correspond with life.\t4.

The world is meaningless, but you can create your own meaning (positive nihilism) through choosing life and being an ubermench.\t5. Create your own meaning by exterminating the Jews.Academia says that obviously, because of point 5 not being common to both siblings, Nietzsche never had the first four.But this is a blatant logical fallacy. Nietzsche wrote his books far in advance of his sister's work. I do not see much evidence that she rewrote his works already in print, rather than merely patched together his notes, and apply anti-Semitism, of which I have not seen so far. She never radically rewrote anything; she applied everything. She applied Nietzsche's system to her own morals. There is nothing in Nietzsche's system that opposes her doing this, because there is nothing to say that she did wrongly, except force. When you take God out of the equation, man is no longer viewed as a bearer of God's image, so life can be redefined. All races outside of the ubermensch's can be defined out of life. There is no transcendent ethical compass without God, and if you reject Him, you ultimately reject life. If there is nothing beyond \"life\" then what is, is right. Might makes right, and justice is whoever is strongest.Positive nihilism and racism are not mutually exclusive. Germany's positive nihilism took the *shape* of racism. This is not to say that all nihilism is inherently racist, or that racism is inherently nihilistic. Germany under control of the nationalist socialist workers party largely rejected moral and religious principles, and replaced them with racially-based tribalistic morals.How do we know that NS did not completely overhaul all of N's books, leaving an entirely different philosophy? We speak of N speaking well of Jesus in Z, but what if that was written by NS? Why did N's 40 friends which he sent copies not decry NS's rewriting, if it were so changed from N's vision? Why did his friends say nothing, if his vision was so obviously mangled? Is Z corrupted, or just edited? It does not matter who authored what if they are both positive nihilists."}, {"userName": "Anders Risager", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14851506-anders-risager", "userReview": "Difficult read, but really interesting"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1717905-mark", "userReview": "I was hoping that this Great Course would help me to understand the philosophy of existential philosopher Friedrich Nietzche. It is taught by the husband wife team of Professors Robert Solomon (who also taught the Existentialism Great Course) and Kathleen Higgins in 24 half hour lectures. Both professors speak well, they are knowledgable and both speak clearly. I felt a bit like a pinball in this course though. I get that to undertand where Nietzsche was coming from, we have to know a bit about who he was talking about in his various books like The AntiChrist, The Gay Science, Will to Power and Beyond Good and Evil, but it seemed to take several chapters of the lecture series to even begin to discuss Nietzsche. I heard about the Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, other German Philosophers like Hegel, Kant and Schopenhauer. Not only does the topic move from subject to subject without much real organization, but they also take turns speaking! In one lecture, Solomon may be speaking about one thing, then his wife Pr. Higgins follows up with something else.Instead of concentrating on his thoughts a work at a time, the two lectures seemed to pick topics at random like Nietzche on ethics, morals, women or the Greek philosophers. It was very hard to follow and get a true sense of what he believed. Since both took turns talking and both also talked so much about other philosophers, by the lectures end, I wasn't sure whether what I was remembering was Hegel's view on a subject, Nietzsche's view on the subject, or Nietzche's view of Hegel's view on the subject. I will grant you that my background in philosophy is not as strong as history, music, science or religion, but the reason I listen to the Great Courses is to improve my understanding and to learn. I came away not really feeling like I understood Nietzche much better than I did before. I actually liked the chapters on Nietzche that Pr. Solomon presented in his course on Existentialism better. I also was more impressed with a course I took last month on Machiavelli, which really left me understanding much more about what Machiavelli thought and what his philosophy was, even though previously, I had only read The Prince. I will go back to my Libravox audio narrations of Beyond Good and Evil and The AntiChrist and perhaps come back to this one. Some things that I did learn. Nietzche's sister edited his last book Will to Power, and put her own biases into the book leading many to believe that Nietzche was a precursor to some of the ideas that Adolf Hitler came to like. I did learn a lot more about what Nietzche meant by \"God is Dead\" as a philosophical idea. I also learned a bit about his personal background growing up in the late 1800s in Germany. This lecture series, although it was easy to listen to, I didn't feel that it was a good introductory course. I felt almost like I should have already read not only, Thus Spoke Zarathrustra, Beyond Good and Evil, The Gay Science and The AntiChrist, but also Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit as well as Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation before listening to this lecture series. (I did come into it with a basic understanding of Greek philosophy). I shall go back, read some more and revisit this lecture series. However, as a gateway into Nietzche, I felt only an existential angst, and a nihilistic emptiness."}, {"userName": "Bruce Baugh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729017-bruce-baugh", "userReview": "A very good introductory survey of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, team-taught by a husband and wife pair of professors. Both have very good delivery, though Prof. Kathleen M. Higgins does use \"in a sense\" more than I think is actually illuminating. It was enjoyable to listen to, and clear throughout. Their presentation weaves together biography and discussion of ideas - as they point out, Nietzsche did this himself and endorsed it as a method, and the biographical context definitely clarifies a bunch of ideas and ways of expression that are (to put it mildly) ambiguous on their own. Prof. Robert C. Solomon also makes use of his own biography to demonstrate how some statements of principle can apply in individual lives, most poignantly in how encountering the idea of eternal recurrence led him out of an ultimately unrewarding path for his life to a better one, including being in a position to use that story as part of his teaching.I think they cut Nietzsche some slack he may not deserve, but then again, I do that myself when expounding on work that matters to me and has been valuable to me. They don't attempt to whitewash or cover-up anything, and they do a great job laying out contexts from the paragraphs around a particular comment to the place of a work's development in the whole sweep of Nietzsche's life. I'd gladly listen to more courses from either or both of these professors.

If we're charitable, we can learn quite a bit from Friedrich Nietzsche. Regretably, their understanding of Christianity is no more sophisticated than his. Some notes: -both good and bad deeds are motivated by a desire to display our power -Nietzsche's cry that God is dead is a call to imagine a new foundational myth-Philosophy is rhetoric-There can be no universal rule, because someone is always disadvantaged-The lecturer's understanding of Christianity is astonishingly shallow-Beyond Good and Evil: there's some good stuff here.
