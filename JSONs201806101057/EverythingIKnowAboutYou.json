In addition, I try to read all (or as many as possible!) MG and YA titles that discuss this topic to ensure that the portrayal is 1) accurate and 2) sensitive and 3) non-glamorizing. I am so happy to say that this book hits all three of those in the best middle-grade-way possible, and in addition, addresses the life-long nature of anorexia and purging through exercise rather than a tied-with-a-bow quick fix. Tally.....oh Tally. She is one of my new favorite middle grade heroines because of her body positive attitude and strong sense of self. She bows to no one, but also realizes her own vulnerabilities, and is willing to admit when she is wrong and apologize to those who deserve it. She EATS food and dresses to her heart's desire and rejects harmful body image and style stereotypes. Her struggles with how to deal with Ava's issues are heartfelt and so so real. Now for the trip storyline. I *JUST* returned from a middle school bus trip to Washington DC with my daughter and her class, so this story entered my reading life at the exact right time! I connected with every part of the trip, and it brought me right back there - I loved how Dee addressed the rooming issues and social issues, as these are the exact things I witnessed during my time as a chaperone. For anyone who hasn't gone on this trip, please know that this book perfectly nails it. EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT YOU deserves a place in every middle school library and classroom, and I have already pre-ordered copies for my library and my daughter. As a mom, THIS is the book I want my daughter reading and Tally is the heroine I want her reading about. Please also go and read Dee's post on Nerdy Book Club on her motivation for this story - it is required reading!AND if you want another MG on this topic, with a slightly different, but equally good twist, please read THINGS THAT SURPRISE YOU by Jennifer Maschari."}, {"userName": "Kristen Picone", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34019498-kristen-picone", "userReview": "An important book for tweens and teens!

Main character Tally has always been comfortable in her skin, until being forced to room with Ava on an overnight field trip to Washington DC makes her really look within herself. Tally\u2019s two best friends begin drifting toward other friends and she finds herself unsure of what to do about Ava. Should she tell anyone about Ava\u2019s eating habits?

Are you one of those friends? That is Tally Martin. She is always taking care of her best friends Caleb (aka Spider) and her new friend Sonnet. When she finds out about the seventh grade class trip to Washington, DC she is so excited.. that is until she finds out that the teacher over the trip is trying to promote seventh grade unity and is making them room with their enemies. Tally is mortified that she is going to have to room with \"clonegirl\" Ava Sealy. They have been mortal enemies for so long, how can she be expected to spend three whole days with her? Tally, Ava, Sonnet, Caleb and everyone else on the trip soon finds out that there is more to their classmates than they every imaged. Tally soon finds out that everyone is fighting a secret battle. This book is filled with friendships, fightings, break-ups, make-ups, and even a possible crush comes to light. However, the biggest challenge Tally faces is when she finds out that her roommate may possibly have an eating disorder but she is being blackmailed into not telling anyone, especially Ava's mom. What will Tally do? Will she still have her best friends at the end of this trip, or has her tight reigns finally broken? Will she do the right thing and get her enemy help despite risking an incredibly embarrassing picture coming out?

I haven\u2019t read a MG book that touches on anorexia until this revelation from Barbara Dee. Spunky and original Tally is forced to room with the oh-so-popular Ava, a \u201cbonding\u201d experience made to enhance their 7th grade DC trip. And if that\u2019s not bad enough, Tally\u2019s lifelong friends, Sonnet and Spider, are moving in other directions. But as Tally and Ava spend more time together, Tally begins to see that Ava\u2019s life might not be so perfect after all. Barbara Dee has a knack for creating original characters that tug at your heartstrings, and Tally is definitely another one. Multiple conflicts, well-developed characters, and an engaging setting made this a read I couldn\u2019t put down, and the resolution had me in tears. I was alternately cheering for and irritated at Tally and Ava, but ended up caring so, so much for both of them. This book belongs in the same category as Wonder, Finding Perfect, and Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus: characters with heart that are so much more than what\u2019s on the surface.

But when she goes on the 7th grade trip to Washington, D.C., she's paired with her arch-nemesis, Ava. Ava is everything Tally is not - popular, fashion-forward, able to fit in with her classmates. When Tally's friends start to branch out and find other people to spend time with, Tally is stuck with Ava, and when she sees how little Ava eats and how much she exercises, she faces some tough decisions.I read this entire book in one sitting, which is something I can't often do. I loved that Tally had a very well-rounded personality but that she wasn't perfect. Her fierce protection of her friends made them think of her as their babysitter or \"rescue dolphin.\" She had her own style and was blissfully oblivious of what others thought of her. But then Ava is not a 2-dimensional antagonist, either. She has her own personality and we get to learn more about her throughout the book. I don't know that I've ever seen a book for tweens about anorexia, but this is definitely an issue that tweens can struggle with, and I'm glad that this book exists. My only (very small) complaint has to do with the cover: it looks to me like a cover of a book for adults or older teens. I'd love to have seen some characters on the cover, or an illustration of Washington, D.C. or something. Nevertheless, this book will be added to my library's collection and I will be book-talking it to the tweens and teens.Recommended for: tweensRed Flags: Tally talks about how she punched a classmate for bullying her friend; Tally's roommate Ava counts the calories in her food and over-exercises, so there is discussion of anorexia as wellOverall Rating: 5/5 starsRead-Alikes: Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus, Sadia, The Popularity PapersI received a complimentary copy of this book through Edelweiss for the purposes of review."}, {"userName": "Kristin Crouch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68240644-kristin-crouch", "userReview": "Thank you to Barbara Dee for providing an ARC for review to #collabookation.Tally is embarking on the seventh grade field trip to Washington, D.C. But she's been assigned to room with the head \u2018clone girl\u2019 and neither are happy. Over the course of three days with Ava, Tally\u2019s forced to examine her motives for almost everything she does: Why does she dress so outlandishly? Why did she create the term \u2018clone girl\u2019? Who are her real friends, and what do they love about her? And, how is she supposed to help the girl she's despised for so long? Everything I Know About You is a great read with some powerful messages: you don't need to love someone to help them, and you don't always have to help those you love. I've always thought that when you feel genuine anger at an actor, they've played their role to perfection. Just as I began to find Tally a bit too overwhelming, mature, and protective, the story turned and her prior actions caused self doubt and fear. *I actually wrote a post-it stating, \u201cWell played, Barbara Dee.\u201d The shift was so spot on.* Dee illustrates perfectly the fragility of adolescence ~ the perception of self and others, the transformations friendships undergo, and the struggle to be accepted for who you are, not who others think you should be.

This novel also touches on the changes in friendship during junior high, and the ways you can stand out or blend in.

When head teacher chaperone Ms. Jordan makes her room with the popular Ava, and even worse, puts Spider with Marco, who had bullied him the previous year, Tally is not pleased. When the group finally gets to the patriotic themed hotel, Sonnet ends up with Haley, and Tally gets along better than she expected with Ava. She does notice, however, that Ava eats very little, and spends all of the free time in the hotel working out in the gym. Ava's mother, Mrs. Seeley, is along as one of the chaperones, and Tally witnesses some of the mother-daughter interactions that indicate that Ava's home life is not all that pleasant. Sonnet seems to be enjoying herself with Haley, and Spider and Marco are getting along extremely well, to the point where Spider accuses Tally of always having to protect him. Feeling left out, Tally makes the poor choice to dye her hair with products purchased at the hotel gift shop, and the result is less than attractive. Tally makes many interesting choices about personal adornment to show that she doesn't care what others think, but this makes her self conscious. Ava and her mother end up being very supportive, but Ava does not react well to Tally's concern about her eating habits. There's lots of drama, lots of sights to see, and a lot to be learned about how people who normally don't interact can get to know and care about each other when normal circumstances change.Strengths: Always glad to see a book about a trip to D.C. instead of another class election, and this does a good job of including details about the sites AND the attendant drama that frequently occurs. Eating disorder books are always interesting to students, and seeing Ava through Tally's eyes is a good change from the first person narratives I've seen in the past. Also good is the portrayal of Tally's friendships, and how they change when the students are away from their normal routines. All in all, an engaging and timely book that should be included in all middle school collections. Dee has an excellent eye for timely problems that lack adequate literary representation, which is a skill every bit as important as her ability to tell a good story.Weaknesses: There were some details of the trip that were very unlike the D.C. trip at our school-- a chaperone would never be able to go off alone with just two students, there is a LOT more free time than we give kids (seriously, the bus rolls out at 7 a.m. and we get back at 11 p.m., which leaves no time for movie watching or random hair dying!), and Ava is not old enough to use the exercise facilities in most hotels. Those are small quibbles, but I might say something to the readers in my school who pick up the book before going on our D.C. trip. Tally was not a likable character to me, but she wasn't so horrible that it interfered with my enjoyment of the story. What I really think: Definitely purchasing to have on hand with Carlson's Faded Denim, Barson's 45 Pounds More or Less, Lytton's Jane in Bloom, Anderson's Wintergirls, Padian's Jersey Tomatoes are the Best, Porter's Dance of Sisters, Maschari's Things That Surprise You, Knowle's Still a Work in Progress, and the ur-anorexia novel, Levenkron's The Best Little Girl in the World."}, {"userName": "Laura Gardner", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/215964-laura-gardner", "userReview": "Thanks to the MA youth services book review blog for the FREE book! #partner @simonkids @barbaradeebooks ~*~*~*~*~*Love, love, LOVED this book!

This book achieves that goal perfectly. Tally is a fabulous character -- surprisingly comfortable in her skin for a middle school student, both in terms of her body type (\"jiggly\") and her fashion sense (eclectic). I was completely invested in Tally and the choices she made. It brought back those confusing feelings in middle school when I didn't really know how to be a good friend and everyone was changing so fast that it was hard to know how to act. The storyline about body issues for middle school girls is a relevant and important one -- it breaks my heart to know tweens worry about these issues, but I know that they do.

Kids experience so many trying situations in their lives being able to see that others are going through similar things is a way to connect for that child. It also allows a window into how others may be feeling and that you never really know what another human is dealing with. Dealing with body image as a young girl or a young boy is an issue that is not often addressed in middle grade books. Barbara Dee handles this topic with care, grace, and knowledge. She allows the characters to discuss their own body image and how they feel others perceive them. This connection for the reader is real. The characters are real. At times, you aren't sure that you are rooting for the protagonist, she doesn't always make the smartest choices, but you do realize that she always has the best intentions.

She eats whatever she wants and refers to herself as strong, she refuses to talk about her body in a bad way with other girls. However she does keep saying to herself that she has a huge butt that isn't attractive but she just doesn't care. Obviously she does care to some extent, but she won't starve herself or anything. But she realizes she has a body image disorder through her frenemy (friend/enemy) Ava. Ava is her roommate who DOES have an eating disorder. Ava works out all the time, refuses to eat, and tracks every single calorie that goes into her body. Ava is forced to confess what's going to on to Tally, and she hasn't developed anorexia because she \"feels fat\". It all started with the stress of her parents divorce; because she was always sick to her stomach and couldn't eat, she slowly became obsessed with tracking everything she DID eat. Then tracking her exercise, then tracking her size because she had control. This is a great portrayal, because I've read a few fiction books about disordered eating and this is the first one I've read that showed how anorexia is about more than weight or food. A lot of times it comes from the need to be in control of something, and that's exactly how Ava feels.

But her roommate, Ava, is Miss Perfect \u2013 a stick-thin \u201cclonegirl\u201d who is flat out mean to Tally. Ugh! Soon, though, as Tally gets to know her roomie, she discovers that things aren\u2019t always what they seem, and Ava is far from perfect. In fact, she\u2019s hiding something really big and scary, and Tally has to make some tough choices. She also has to navigate the changing waters of her friendships with Sonnet and Spider, who she feels are growing more and more distant from her. Change is hard, and frightening. There are plenty of bruised feelings along the way, but, as always, plenty of opportunities for growth.Tally is one of my favorite 12-year-olds in middle grade lit today. I absolutely loved the relationship she has with her family, who love and support her no matter what; it was wonderfully refreshing to find a family so in sync with each other. And even as we watch Tally stumble along the way, you just know this smart, sassy, tender-hearted girl is going to be ok.Please note: one of the topics covered in this book is disordered eating. It\u2019s handled wonderfully and should foster some excellent discussion. Grownups should be prepared for some questions and emotional responses! Recommended for ages 9-13, grades 4-8. This book is out June 19!"}, {"userName": "Lauren- The Smile Lines", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2373663-lauren--the-smile-lines", "userReview": "Thank you to the kidlitexchange for sharing a free copy of this book. All opinions are my own. EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT YOU by @barbaradeebooks is a book I WISH I read when I was 11, 12, 13 years old. I NEEDED this book! Parents, friendships, body image, crushes, academics, bullying, exercise, teachers, eating disorders, forgiving, and just being completely confused about everything. . . All of these issues are in this storyline. \ud83d\udc95The part that really tugs at my heart is the pressure there is to keep a secret or not keep a secret. Do you tell someone your friend is hurting or in need if it will hurt her? What should you do?? \ud83d\udc95 I think I could be an actual character in this book in my middle grade years. I want to meet Tally and Ava... I read this book so fast and had to read it just one more time! You can preorder this June release book on Amazon. It is a great one especially for middle grade girls!"}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5383191-evelyn", "userReview": "I received this book free through Goodreads.

For Tally, rooming with \u201cclonegirl\u201d Ava Seely feels like punishment, rather than potential for fun.But the trip is full of surprises. Despite a pact to stick together as much as they can, Sonnet pulls away, and spider befriends Marco, the boy who tormented him last year. And Marco just might \u201clike\u201d Tally\u2014what\u2019s that about?But the uneasy peace in Ava and Tally\u2019s room is quickly upended when Tally begins to suspect something is off about Ava. She has a weird notebook full of random numbers, and doesn\u2019t seem to eat anything during meals.
