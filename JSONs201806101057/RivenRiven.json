I think this has to be my favorite story by this author so far. Theo was the type of character I desperately wanted to reach through the pages so I could hug him and Caleb garnered the same reaction out of me. One of my favorite couples I've read about this year hands down. Theo loves music. He loves writing it and creating it. He loves seeing people enjoying their music. What he doesn't love is the paparazzi following him and taking his picture. The crowds that engulf him when he's out and about. He's not happy. Even in his band he feels alone. He hates touring but loves performing. Caleb loves music as well. He's a talented musician in his own right but hasn't been on a stage in years. He is a broken and damaged soul who is just trying to survive his addiction. He has learned his triggers and does anything to keep himself from temptation. But he needs music like he needs the blood pumping through his veins. But as much as he needs it he also fears it is exactly what will have him fall back into the life he's desperately trying to leave behind. He can't afford to fall down that slippery rope again so he's done his best to accept his new life as a loner. That is until Theo walks into his life. Theo hears Caleb playing when he's out having a late night stroll. Theo is completely captivated by Caleb's voice and the fingers that strum the haunting music that pulled him to this man. Caleb knows that Theo is trouble with a capital T and has more power to bring him to his knees than any drug ever had the ability to. He knows one night with this sexy vulnerable man won't be enough. But can a man who has been trying so hard to live a solitary life let himself be open to a man who is very publicly known?With Caleb, Theo finally found like he belonged. That he found someone who saw him and wanted him just the way he was. With Theo, Caleb felt like he could be someone more than his past and the drugs. That he could be happy. I really loved this story and will no doubt be reading it again. One of my favorites of the year. **I received an ARC from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.**"}, {"userName": "SueBee\u2605bring me an alpha!\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15735368-suebee-bring-me-an-alpha", "userReview": "M/MMM AN ADDICTING BAD BOY ROCKER!Stand-alone.LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK | B&N | KOBO | iBOOKS |Blurb: Theo Decker might be the lead singer of Riven, but he hates being a rock star.

If the story speaks to you then you are on a good way to your next favorite. Roan Parrish is a new-to-me author and this is what happened to me when I started reading Riven.Theo lives everybody else's dream. He is the lead singer one of the most popular bands, Riven. He and his bandmates sell buckets of records and make a ridiculous amount of money. The problem? Theo loves performing but hates hates the fame that comes with being a superstar. On a short stop at home while touring he meets Caleb and they connect instantly through music.\n\n    His tongue was an instrument, and he kissed me like he was playing a song, coming on strong, easing off, building to a crest, changing the rhythm.\n  \nCaleb is a recovering drug addict and a former well known musician. These days he doesn't perform anymore - too big is the fear to fall back into old patterns. His one-night-stand with Theo suits him just right because the gorgeous man is drug-material and he just can't replace one addiction with another. But the rockstar is nothing if not tenacious and a couple of weeks later he shows up at Caleb's doorstep, temptation personified and a delicious dance of push and pull begins.First let me gush a little about these two characters. How cute were they? Seriously? On-stage Theo is a charismatic frontman who wraps his audience around his fingers. He captivates people with his voice and words and talent.\nTheo had a way about him that got people in the palm of his hand. He was human but glamorous; effortlessly cool but vulnerable.\nOff-stage he is adorably shy and awkward. He's also extremely forgiving but I never felt that he was a doormat. There was something very refreshing about his honesty. Theo doesn't know how to not show his feelings. They just bubble out of him and it's what makes him so extremely lovable. I wanted to wrap him up in bubble wrap and keep him safe because he needed somebody to give him love and safety. There were so many thoughtful and sweet things he did for Caleb, he was incredible.\nOut of nowhere, I felt my chest tighten and my throat seize, suddenly close to tears. In all of this, somehow, Theo had managed to remind me of who I was. Who I wanted to be. Who I could be again.\nCaleb fears nothing more than a relapse but he lets this fear rule his life. He stays in his old farmhouse and takes up planting vegetables and basically goes through the motions. Theo rattles something inside of him and it scares the living daylights out of him. Caleb pushes Theo away, again and again, and faithful, sweet and forgiving Theo totally has Caleb's number so it's easy for him to forgive the man he's falling in love with. Usually I get really annoyed when there is too much pushing away going on - not with Caleb. It was so clear right from the start, so understandable why he did it. There just wasn't a reason to be mad at him. His fears were totally valid - a relapse was a possibility, but little by little he realized that Theo was his strength and not his weakness. These two were multi-layered characters who had a wonderful and easy connection, in tune with each other.Theo has some issues too but he loved with an open heart and had an astonishingly positive outlook. I swear to God I choked up a couple of times because his loneliness really got to me. Caleb's need for distance was really hard on him.\n\n    Caleb told himself the story that no one could depend on him because he\u2019d break their trust.\n    And what stories had I told myself? That I was unlovable. That I had to earn the right to be cared for. That unless I made myself indispensable, I would be tossed away.\n  \nI found myself utterly charmed by the whole cast of this book. Not only the two main characters were delightful, Caleb's best friend Rhys was amazing too. It was so good to see that Caleb had somebody who loved him with all his deficiencies and flaws and was just a rock for him when things got really hard.Riven is a fast read and kept me invested throughout the whole story. I just couldn't stop - I was riveted and enthralled, I hurt and was sad, I laughed and smiled and I was happy when I closed the book leaving Theo and Caleb in a good place. Roan Parrish has a beautiful writing style. The dialogues are actually very close to how people really talk. If you're insecure or awkward there are lots of uh's and ah's and um's. I actually liked that. But her descriptions were beautiful and sometimes beautifully haunting.\nI turned to him and watched him listen to the song I\u2019d written for him. The song that had gathered inside me, that I\u2019d held tight all these months and finally unspooled for him in the early morning light. The song that told him all the things he already knew, but in the language we both felt deeper than words.\nMs Parrish has a new fan. I will now go forth and buy all of her backlist because this was one of the most beautiful MM stories I've read.\u00a0This book is written with heart and feeling - it's a story this author can be proud of."}, {"userName": "Lana \u2747\u273eDirty Girl Romance\u2747\u273e", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498948-lana-dirty-girl-romance", "userReview": "4 STARS\n\nHe was lust and heat and power and I fucking loved it.\n\nHave you ever read a book for the cover alone? What? Now don't look at me like that. Have you seen this cover? There's just something about it that's utterly magnetic. It lures you in. And then you read the blurb, and INSTANT HOOK!This was my second book by Roan Parrish and I'm definitely a fan. Riven is an emotional, character driven story that was as gripping as it was raw. Now normally, I don't really enjoy a romance where the main characters hook up in less than 20% of the book. But that's what happened when Theo first stumbles onto Caleb. The unwilling rockstar that's trying to escape his reality meets a brooding recovering addict and sparks fly immediately. After no more than some conversation over their love of music and a romantic walk, they fall into bed together. But yet somehow it totally worked in this story. The chemistry between Theo and Caleb may have been instant, but it also progresses over the course of their courtship. Caleb struggles daily with his sobriety. He was such an endearingly imperfect character. This is a man that's as far from perfect as it gets, and he knows it. After several failed stints in rehab, he hopes his third will be the charm. Cutting himself off fully from his previous life is the only way he sees of serving sobriety this time around. And Theo and his fame threatens everything he's worked so hard for.Theo was absolutely adorable. There was something so vulnerable about him that you can't help but fall for him. He wears his heart on his sleeve and his emotions all over his face. He's one of the most genuine characters I've read in a long while. His fame is still a shock to him and something he struggles with. He loves music, but hates the notoriety that has come with it and the weird vibe that he seems to have with his bandmates. Caleb is his escape from his own gloom reality.\n\nTheo had burrowed deeper than I\u2019d realized, dug barbs into me. And when he\u2019d ripped away\u2014when I\u2019d pushed him away\u2014it had felt like they all tore loose at once.\n\nThis was a bit slower paced than I normally like, but it still worked for me. I loved the characters, and I absolutely loved the story. It may not have been my normal cuppa, but it was one I enjoyed from beginning to finish. Caleb and Theo were adorable together and oh so sexy. If you're looking for an emotionally charged, character driven story, this is a definite must read.

It started poorly for me because the purple prose was out in full force. This author loves her words and she loves to use all of them at the same time. What could be said in 4 words, she uses 20. It kept pulling me out of the story and by 15% I was thinking about dnf-ing this. I liked the overall plot enough to push through and by the mid way mark it either got better or I became numb to it.This story is about Theo who is a huge rock star. But he hates it. He hates everything but the actual music itself. He hates touring, the business aspect, the attention, the lack of privacy, etc. He feels guilty for hating it though and tries to push himself to appreciate what he has. One night while he's walking around NYC trying to clear his head, he hears music that captivates him and he finds himself walking in to a hole in the wall bar. There he finds the source of the music is ex addict and ex jazz/blues musician Caleb. The two men have an instant connection both emotionally and sexually. What starts as a smoking hot one night stand, leads to a budding romance.It is part a romance and part a story about them figuring out what they want to do with their lives. Theo needs to find a way to be happy and stop putting everyone but himself first. Caleb needs to find a way to stay sober but incorporate music back into his life. Their story is told in alternating points of view. I adored Theo. I loved the chapters told by him and I connected with him immediately. He was a great MC. Caleb on the other hand was a struggle. I imagine his trials and his fears were probably very realistic but he exhausted me. And every time he made Theo cry (which was more than once) I wanted to punch him in his fictional face. Thank goodness the author chose to do alternating pov's because if I struggle with Caleb this much while reading how he felt, I probably would have hated him if I'd only gotten Theo's pov. I had high expectations for this after seeing other reviews and having a few friends love it. Unfortunately it was just average for me. The overall plot and the MC's had potential to be great but I couldn't get past the flowery writing style. It's just not for me.

Because ARC.Rock Star MCs don't typically appeal to me...and I don't usually like that trope or the stories that seem to go with it. So, when I decided I would ask to review this book I did it with some trepidation. But only a little. After all, it's written by Roan Parrish and I've yet to at least 4 Star anything I've read by Roan so far...which made my decision easier to take the chance.And Oh Gawd, am I ever glad I did.See, these guys - yes, they are/were Rock Stars, and with that comes a few expectations...well, yeah, no. The stereotypical self-indulgent, self-centered, selfish egotist is missing in this story. Because the title of that story run about Theo, The Reluctant Rock Star, is very apt. He's a musician, who loves to perform, and got caught up in wanting to prove to his disappointed \"parents\" that he is worthy of their time, love, respect in buying into the fame portion of being in an up-and-coming band.Unfortunately, his band-mates thought he was pretentious - pretending not to like this notoriety - which alienated Theo, and he didn't get the replacement family he thought he was signing up for. Luckily, Theo didn't fall prey to the dangers that level of celebrity & disappointment can foster...unlike Caleb, recovering heroin addict, child of an alcoholic, looking for an escape in his music, relapsing time and again (pre-story) who is so afraid of failing, of backsliding, that he can't trust anything industry related not to lead him astray again. And who questions his every choice, want, need or desire because he's determined not to let one addiction be replaced with another. Only, that fear cuts him off from all but a few close friends...and almost keeps him from a life with Theo.The level of angst, of frustration, of emotional connection and yearning, is off the charts. But it doesn't feel manipulative. It feels real. Like they were real, that their struggles were real. And hey, there may be musicians out there struggling like this. Who get swept up in all the trappings of fame and want out, who only wanted to write music, or pen lyrics but found themselves years down the road not knowing how to get out. I hope they find as happy an ending as Theo and Caleb did. Is it perfect? No. Caleb still struggles with his addiction and Theo will never get the approval he seeks...but it's perfect for them. Because they have each other.And it was exactly the kind of heart-warming, sexy, engaging story that makes me love Roan's writes, and the whole MM Romance genre in general.HIGHLY recommended, just have some tissues handy...trust me, though, it's worth it.(And I really hope this comes out on Audio at some point.)ARC provided via Netgalley and Random House/Loveswept in exchange for honest review."}, {"userName": "Elsa Bravante", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43297890-elsa-bravante", "userReview": "Ese chico de la portada es maravilloso... El contenido del libro, pues como casi todo, ir\u00e1 en opiniones, pero para m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n lo ha sido. Una historia de amor entre dos m\u00fasicos que viven un momento distinto en sus carreras, pero soportando ambos un peso que les impide ser felices y sentirse bien con lo que hacen, el hecho de encontrarse cambiar\u00e1 sus vidas.La din\u00e1mica entre los personajes es una que ya hemos visto en otros libros de Roan, no es algo nuevo. Por un lado Theo tiene \u00e9xito con su grupo Riven, pero es tremendamente vulnerable e inconsciente de su valor como persona y como m\u00fasica, con un f\u00edsico propio de una estrella de rock. Despu\u00e9s, Decker, que igual que en su momento lo hizo Rafe o Rex, representa la tranquilidad, la fuerza, la estabilidad, tambi\u00e9n f\u00edsicamente. En Riven la m\u00fasica es protagonista, pero todo lo abarca la historia de amor entre Theo y Decker. Su relaci\u00f3n comienza de una forma un tanto precipitada, el instalust es totalmente razonable, pero en lo relacionado a los sentimientos me hubiera gustado algo un tanto m\u00e1s lento en su desarrollo. A pesar de esto, la relaci\u00f3n va evolucionando con mucha belleza y Roan tiene la inmensa de virtud de ser capaz de escribir escenas llenas de intimidad y carga emotiva, que al menos a m\u00ed hace que sienta lo mismo que sienten los personajes y pueda entenderlos.Adem\u00e1s de tener muchos sentimientos a flor de piel, el libro es entretenido y cuenta con muy buenos secundarios. La pena es que no todo es perfecto. El ingl\u00e9s no es mi lengua, pero no suelo tener ning\u00fan problema para leer, no utilizo el diccionario, no lo domino hablando, pero s\u00ed leyendo. Sin embargo, con este libro ha habido frases que he tenido que leer m\u00e1s de una vez para entenderlas.

But the story is so much better, and so much more, than my crappy summary.Reluctant rockstar wasn't precisely accurate. More like, Rock Star Who Loves Performing with a Fiery Passion but Hates Being Famous More than He Ever Expected.This is my third read by Parrish and I've finally finally found the love for one of her stories that I've only ever glimpsed, or that has always just been out of reach, in those past experiences. Or, maybe that's unfair. I've always loved her writing but either struggled with the POV of an annoying protagonist (IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEWHERE) or found the narrative interesting but couldn't stay connected when the lack of chemistry between characters failed to keep me engaged (THE REMAKING OF CORBIN WALE). This time? This time it works. I knew the danger of waiting for some outside force to bend a gentle knee and change my life. I knew that if anything was going to bring me back to life, it would have to be me.Theo is adorably charming, intense, naive, talented, hopeful. Caleb is afraid, resigned, reluctant, tender, worldly. They were the perfect balance for one another; Theo pushed, Caleb cautioned, and they found something that worked just right.. even when it didn't.I didn't know how to explain the way certain thoughts -- certain ways of thinking -- sparked other thoughts, like a match touched to a line of gasoline. How I was still learning what they were, and how terrifying it was, wandering around with a lit match all the time.RIVEN is the perfect sweet spot of edgy, sexy, and raw, driven and expressed by Parrish's absolutely magical, unbelievably expressive, lyrical, prose. I'm not sure I've ever read a rockstar romance for the m/m genre but there's more here than just that. There's the struggle about what it means to be tempted, to be an addict; what a person might push themselves to endure to prove something to others; what it means to battle with unhappiness, to bury their wants for the sake of others; and to be overflowing with love for others after receiving so little all their life. And it's also hot as fuck.I'd spent the last year learning to mistrust the things I wanted. Learning that chances were if I desired it, it was going to kill me eventually. It was hard to reconcile that lesson with the man in front of me, offering himself with one hand and protecting me with the other.Is it too early to want to get my hands on REND? Because if it is.. I'm not sorry. I want more.4.5 \"I was used to being looked at, but being seen was something quite different\" stars** I received an ARC from NetGalley and the publisher (thank you!) in exchange for an honest review. **"}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49847054-ariana", "userReview": "Omg.

Maybe I can break it down into what I loved, liked, and didn't.LovedBoth MCs are songwriters and musicians. I loved how the story focused on their talent and calling. All of the secondary characters were also musicians and that was a big plus for me too.LikedI really liked that both of the MCs in a MM Romance were unapologetically gay. There was no drama or undue attention given to their sexuality. It simply was. I liked that a lot.It was a fast read for me. I never got bored so I have to give credit to the pacing of the story.Didn'tIf you've read enough of my reviews you know I prefer action filled plots. This is a character driven plot. The character driven plots I tend to enjoy are the ones where an MC overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds. This one had the potential to do that with one of the MCs, or maybe both. But it didn't dig deep enough into each MCs \"issues\". The problems were being overcome as we were reading the story. We were not privileged to walk alongside the characters when it was most difficult for them.NigglesWas there a previous story that focused on best friend Rhys? Seems there's backstory there that I'm missing.Even though the chapters are titled with each character's pov, there are some switcheroos within the chapter. It's hard to tell when it's the other MC thinking or talking for a minute before going back to the chapter's main pov.OverallI really enjoyed the story. It was an easy, fast read. But I really don't know how to rate it. I think I can safely say that, in this case, the lack of a five star rating is definitely the reader, not the book.3.75 starsReview ARC graciously provided by the publisher via NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Laxmama ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31804110-laxmama", "userReview": "ARC review for NETGALLEY, Roan Parrish is really hit or miss with me.

Seriously. I\u2019ve said it before but I am going to say it again. She is easily and I\u2019ll also add quickly climbing to the top of my favorite list. She has a way of writing that I feel I can see it, hear it and feel it. It's like magic. This was no exception.I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to feel about this one though, favorite author or not. Let\u2019s get the disclaimers out of the way. First, I don\u2019t normally even touch a book about addiction. It\u2019s just not my thing. I don\u2019t like that type of reality in my romance but, favorite author and all, so, chance given. Secondly, I don\u2019t usually dig celebrity type/rock star stories. But, same, Roan Parrish. I don\u2019t know why I was worried at all really.If stories with addiction and fame were always handled this way I would probably change my tune. I wasn\u2019t put off by either in this book. I can\u2019t say I completely understand where either Caleb or Theo are coming from but I feel that these two subjects didn\u2019t take over the story, they were part of who they were but not all they were. The normal formula was thrown out the window and I was able to just focus on the romance and read their story.So, as I mentioned, it was just almost true love. I don\u2019t really understand addiction, like I said, it just isn\u2019t my thing and I like to live in my na\u00efve bubble, so maybe with a bit more understanding I\u2019d feel differently, but I feel like Caleb was just not in the right place for a relationship and Theo was continuously hurt by this but also too forgiving. It seemed to keep happening and it got on my nerves a bit. Na\u00efve or not I mostly understand where Caleb\u2019s fear was coming from but I\u2019d have liked a little more of a backbone on Theo. Sorry does not always need to = sex. At least, in this case it shouldn\u2019t. There needed to be a bit more groveling.That is probably it truly. Everything else I think I loved. I especially loved Theo remembering a gig in Philly!So, I\u2019m just going to call it another win for me.

His band, Riven, is huge right now, and since he\u2019s the lead singer - he\u2019s the face of the band. That means that people constantly recognize him on the streets and try to get his autograph, picture, hug, clothes... you know, whatever he\u2019s willing to give them. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not that happy about that. Theo loves making music and preforming, but at the same time, he hates his fame and lack of privacy.After coming back home to NYC after a long tour, he runs into Caleb in a bar and is instantly charmed - by his music.Caleb is also a musician, but he gave up touring and preforming after an addiction ruined it all for him. These days he focuses on staying clean and having a quiet and stressless life. However, he can\u2019t give up music entirely, so he plays only for himself. Theo accidentally hears him playing, and is immediately fascinated. They start up a conversation and very quickly hit it off, both spiritually and physically. Yep, they have sex. And it\u2019s amazing! But Caleb leaves at the middle of the night, never expecting to see Theo again.However, Theo is persistant, and he tracks him down. He knows that he and Caleb have a connection that is so much more than physical attraction, and he\u2019s willing to fight for it. Luckily, Caleb gives in, and what starts afterwards is a beautiful relationship.I loved loved loved these two together. You could actually feel the chemistry between them, yes they had incredibly hot sexy times, but it wasn\u2019t just that. Their conversations were meaningful\u00a0and they truly cared about each other. You could really feel how their connection grew stronger and stronger throughout the story. I also loved each one of them individually. Especially Theo, he\u2019s such a sweetheart. On the stage he\u2019s confident and in control, but out of it, he\u2019s awkward and shy and wears his heart on his sleeve. You can\u2019t help but adore him. But it\u2019s not all rainbows and sunshine for them, they had some serious issues to face before they got their HEA. The biggest issue being Caleb\u2019s fear of relapsing because of his relationship with Theo. You see, Theo\u2019s world is what made Caleb become an addict, so being with him is kind of a trigger for him, and throughout he story he has to learn how to deal with it in order to stay with the one he loves.This book is also very much about music. Theo and Caleb love music with passion, and the somewhat lyrical writing style only intensified that feeling. The author is obviously a fan of music and the creative process behind it, it was all so very well written.Overall, a very touching and sweet love story that left me feeling all warm and fuzzy on the inside.

How strong the stories we told ourselves were. What power they had to shape how we saw the world, even when confronted with evidence to the contrary.

There was this moment before, the first note left my mouth, when everything changed. There was the before and the after, the quiet and the noise; the off and the on.

Riven  is an honest and beautiful book that makes you shake your head, want to throw your kindle and pull at your hair. But it's real and it's raw. And it makes you feel everything that the characters feel; their nerves, the fear, and the happiness. What it feels like to live in fear and not be able to do anything about it. Or that it takes you a while to find you happy place.  I wanted to be the center of my own life again. I wanted to matter.  It was about Theo and Caleb being 'reborn' in a sense.

That\u2019s who we met and fell in love with in Riven. Two very lost men finding each other by chance when they need someone the most and discovering the music that resides within them both. Roan Parish wrote two characters with such depth and detail we felt like we knew them, heard the lyrics of their soul and felt their bond and intense attraction.\u2018Theo, who would never assume that people would think he was worth paying attention to because for most of his life, people hadn\u2019t.\u2019Theo, the lead singer of Riven is lost. The frontman for a successful band with adoring fans he is amongst people every day but never feels part of a unity, lyrics swirling through his head; an extraordinary beat drumming in his veins.

He can\u2019t forget the man he met though such was the attraction and need to protect. It\u2019s easy to let fear rule your life but when love rears its powerful head nothing can withstand it.\u2018The hope on his face nearly tore me apart. Because it was all for me. This man, standing in front of me, was dreaming a dream for me, and it was humbling as fuck.\u2019Beautiful writing, a unique voice, such depth of character and vivid imagery made this a wonderful romance that had every human emotion depicted in such an emotional and passionate way. Caleb and Theo came across as real honest and flawed characters that truly crave nothing more than a human loving touch. Their love story was lyrically addictive and wore its heart on its sleeve.

This was SO GOOD. There are certain authors that you trust to write books that you're going to love because their writing is what you crave. Roan Parrish is absolutely one of those authors that just does it for me. First of all, let me just say that I don't generally seek out books with music/rock star themes. Almost every one that I've tried has left me bored, skimming, or even DNFing. But Riven was such a beautiful story, and I couldn't put it down. The writing is fantastic. I highlighted so many lines, whether gorgeous, heartbreaking, or just plain funny. There is a great balance here, and it was such a rich reading experience from beginning to end. I already can't wait to reread, and I only finished an hour ago.Character development is off the charts, and Theo and Caleb are wonderfully complex and just come off the page. One of my favorite things about RP's writing is that she always makes her characters so interesting, giving them vibrant personalities and little quirks that truly allow you to fall in love with them. I think everyone who reads this is going to absolutely adore Caleb's best friend, Rhys. This is definitely one of my favorite books of the year. This is why I read romance. ETA: Roan Parrish also does Pinterest boards for her books, and she has one for Riven! I love when authors do these...it's so fun to see who who use for character/style inspiration. She also has one for book two in the series (SQUEEE!!!) and it looks like it's going to be about Rhys and Matt! *dies*\nARC provided by publisher through NetGalley in exchange for review"}], "description": "Theo Decker might be the lead singer of Riven, but he hates being a rock star.
