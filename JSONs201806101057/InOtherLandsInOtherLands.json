We read a given genre with pleasure, eventually discovering patterns to which we respond in various ways. The fictional deconstruction I tend to gravitate to reads like a conversation, and like a conversation can vary from critical engagement to sly tweaks and riffs. I\u2019m not really into the slamdunks, though many readers I know are.In recent years there\u2019ve been a lot of fictional deconstructions. In fantasy, there was, for example, Lev Grossman\u2019s The Magicians, which\u2014like Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials\u2014deconstructed C.S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia, and unlike the latter, also took on the magic school tropes as found in the Harry Potter books, along with many, many previously published fantasies that never reached that level of popularity.A lot of readers found Grossman\u2019s deconstruction mean-spirited, smug, etc etc\u2014you can find the reviews right here on Goodreads. These reactions have sparked interesting discussions in fan and genre circles; I\u2019ve talked with many who enjoy deconstructive fiction but couldn\u2019t make it through Grossman\u2019s books for various reasons, from objection to rape to coming away feeling that they were despised for liking Narnia.I invite those readers to try Sarah Rees Brennan\u2019s In Other Lands, which deconstructs children\u2019s portal fantasy, but without ever being mean-spirited about it. There is even a reference to Narnia (not named) but no sneering.Instead, what we get is an often hilarious look over the wall that not everyone can see, into magic lands where elves, dwarves, mermaids, harpies, trolls, and others live . . . not in peace.Thirteen-year-old Elliot, taken on a class trip, can see the wall. To the attempt to recruit him for the summer, he responds like a 21st century kid would, even if that kid is an indefatigable reader, causing me to startle the dogs with my laughter.Elliott is taken to a camp that trains young warriors and champions to defend the borderlands . . . and he hates it. He wants nothing to do with sword-slinging or death-dealing. Instead, he firmly opts for the smaller program that teaches diplomacy.He also falls in love.Usually I find older emotional tropes in younger kids an eye-roller, but Brennan made the whole scene funny enough to keep me reading, and as I picked up the clues to his emotionally starved character, it made sense. This is a smart kid who has spent thirteen years knowing he is unwanted, and so he attacks the world head on . . . while seeking love.He falls for Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle, an elven girl whose family didn\u2019t want her involved that closely with humans, but gave in. She is so adept with weapons that her natural partner is Luke Sunborn, the handsome golden-haired boy who is the general object of admiration for his prowess and handsomeness.Elliott, in falling for Serene and wanting to be close to her, is stuck with Luke coming along, and thus we get the most brilliant deconstruction of the Deadly YA Love Triangle ever ever ever.Don\u2019t come to this book looking for Tolkienesque worldbuilding; this is more of a character book, slyly but charmingly and generously and affectionately examining and often turning inside-out all those familiar portal fantasy tropes, while the central focus is firmly on character. It\u2019s funny, and wise, and sometimes heart-breaking, definitely LGBTQ friendly as the three main characters grow into their teens and discover sex and its attendant emotional landmines. Love-starved Elliott is the main POV, but the narrator dips into others\u2019 POVs when necessary, and expertly presents Elliott with hilarious grace notes of free indirect discourse, adding to my delight.I would have bought it alone for the elven culture, which turns out to be a gender-mirror to high chivalric mode: it\u2019s the women who are the strong defenders, and their dear, silly men must be protected for their own good, their virtue guarded, and those who stray are seen as floozies and wantons. There were moments I laughed so hard my nose hurt."}, {"userName": "C.G.

I love being a part of a fandom or a community, so usually a hype is something that pulls me closer and not away. Unfortunately, sometimes I talk myself into believing I like something much more than I really do and then the realization is disturbing and I feel kind of fake or stupid. It happened to me already once this year so when I started reading In Other Lands I promised myself to be careful. All my friends seemed to like it or love it, so I didn\u2019t want to jump on the hype train just for the sake of sharing if the book wasn\u2019t really for me. So I was cautious and at first I turned up my nose a bit \u2013 the novel seemed to be a little too much, I wasn\u2019t sure if I really find it funny, if I really can get into Elliot\u2026 And then, around page 30 I laughed aloud for the first time and decided I like it a lot. Around page 60 I cried for the first time and decided I love it.This is a kind of a book that will make you smile and laugh, then you will want to hug it and sleep with it under your pillow only to have your heart broken several times. But in the end it will take all the pieces, glue it together and you will love it with no end. Or at least it happened to me, and believe me, I didn\u2019t know what an emotional ride it would be for me.I could talk about this book for hours so I will try to write about at least a few things I loved. Generally, the premise is pretty simple. A guy gets to a school in a magical land where there are representatives of different races. The school isn\u2019t about magic but it is a soldier training course. Elliot, our hero, is not interested in combat at all, being a book lover and a little nerd. He is also insufferable, nasty and hilarious, despite often he is the only one who laughs while the others run away. He makes some unexpected friendships and grows up to make decisions about himself and maybe influence in some way the whole magical world. Sounds original? Not really. But that\u2019s not the point, because the author concentrated on making the issues she touched deep, cohesive and thorough. I\u2019ve recently complained that in many YA books the author decides to incorporate some themes to their novel and then when it should become darker, deeper, uncomfortable \u2013 they back off as if shrugging, \u201chey, it\u2019s just for teens!\u201d Well, this book does nothing like that. If the character acts certain way because this is his protecting mechanism or anything else \u2013 fine. You will get to know about his trauma. But he will also pay a price and have to learn how to deal with his issues. If there is an action, there will be a reaction.Another thing \u2013 I loved the characters. Elliot was heartbreaking and hilarious at the same time, I was mad at him and I understood him so well. I believe most people will find a piece of him in themselves, especially when they were teens. His path, his growing up, his decisions\u2026 All touched me deeply. Serene was irresistible, even if also made me uncomfortable with her comments. I wasn\u2019t sure at first what to think about the elven society. Gender reversal may be funny but it made me uneasy in a way \u201cokay, I love Serene so what, should I think that all those chauvinists are in fact loveable guys like Serene is?\u201d \u2013 but don\u2019t worry, the author addresses that. Generally, the author has a beautiful tendency to address all the issues she writes about. So when a character is nasty or does something awful don\u2019t worry, she won\u2019t brush it off as \u201cproblematic but cute\u201d, no. There will be consequences, there will be addressing.And no, I don\u2019t forget to mention Luke, my prince of sunflowers. I\u2019m just so much in love I can never stop if I start writing about him.Then there is an anti-war message, as clear as it can be, which is a nice thing after all these dystopias that of course criticize wars but also make their heroes look so wonderful in uniforms and all. Then there is explicit bisexuality, discussed and treated beautifully. Then there is demisexuality \u2013 not named but made clear and described by a person who \u2018feels that way\u2019. There is a whole lot of chosen family theme, friendship, romantic scenes, teens being teens and the whole message of trying to learn about \u2018the other\u2019 and respect them that is so close to my heart.Is it a book without flaws? No, probably not. There are no POCs as far as I remember [edit: there is one character, I was corrected, but still it feels like some minimum, right?] as if the different races thing was enough. I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m afraid. The book is also a bit heavy on angst in the middle of it, which for me was fine and only logical but I guess not everyone will like it. Finally, I\u2019m myself not a big fan of misunderstandings as a basis of a romantic plot so I guess it may be a problem for some people. But then I believe this romance here was much, MUCH more than that and the misunderstanding made sense. Also, I shipped them from the first scene they appeared in so sue me. I might not be very objective and I don\u2019t care.It\u2019s easier to criticize books. When you love something and talk about it, it\u2019s wonderful but also makes you a bit vulnerable. But I can\u2019t really make any disclaimers here to make myself distant from this opinion. I truly believe that though it\u2019s not flawless, it\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019d like you all to read it and join me in being happy what a great book it is. And then we could talk about it for hours, pretty please."}, {"userName": "Jessi \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24482269-jessi", "userReview": "\u201cHe had spent his whole life not being loved at all, and he had thought being loved enough would satisfy him. It would not. He did not want to be loved enough. He wanted to be loved overwhelmingly.\u201d\n  \nIt takes a talented writer to develop one character from age 13 to age 17 in one book, and do it in a realistic, fun, not rushed way. Elliot Schafer is a normal kid, no exceptionary skills, no earth-shattering powers, except maybe his incredible ability to annoy anyone he wants. He enters a new magic world, and through his eyes, exploring this different place, this magic school, is the funniest thing. As the years go by, some of the lightness dissipates, as we see him deal with things, internal and external, that I think, we all deal with, where there is no right or wrong, but you still have to take a stand, you still have to deal with your doubts and your insecurities. I cannot go further without saying, the other two main characters are I N C R E D I B L E. Serene and Luke are by far some of my favorite supporting characters ever. This book lets us explore society in a fun and bizarre way. I, for one, did not expect to relate to a 13 year old redhead living in a magic world, but here I was, laughing, agreeing, disagreeing, discussing and crying with him. PS.

It was originally posted on my blog: HEREI must say that the blurb of this book is a little misleading. I was expecting a fantasy book \u2013 full of adventures, mermaids, elves, dwarves, maybe even some dragons \u2013 you know, the usual stuff. That was not what I got. Granted there were elves and mermaids, and some other mythical creatures \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t fantasy. It had fantasy elements, but that\u2019s it.Also the praise for this book keeps calling it gothic, I didn't see or feel anything gothic about it at all (just fyi). 5 shining stars for concept and ideas. 2 very bleak stars for the execution of those ideas.The topics and issues this book was exploring were fantastic! Racial, cultural, sexual, political \u2013 you name it \u2013 this book has it! But the way the book was going about them \u2013 desired better.To be honest, I felt like this book didn\u2019t quite know what it wanted to be. It started out as a middle grade fantasy, then it became young adult fiction, then it turned into a contemporary, then lgbt, then finally I realized that this was more of a coming-of-age novel than anything else.\u2018In Other Lands\u2019 has absolutely no plot. This book is 433 pages and is full of so many different things, yet somehow \u2013 nothing really happens. Nothing too important, nothing too shocking, nothing too big and life changing. Example: Elliot\u2019s friends go to war. They fight. He sits at camp and worries. They come back unhurt and all is good. Later on only one of his friends goes to fight again. Two others sit and worry. Friend comes back unhurt and all is good. Where is the tragedy? Where is purpose? Where is the plot?Mind me, some important things do happen, is just the main character is so indifferent to most of them that it made me indifferent too (there are reasons for his indifference, but they were presented quite late in the book). Things would happen and he would have the most mild reaction, so instead of gasping and being shocked I would think \u2018Well if HE doesn\u2019t care, why should I?\u2019Protagonist of this story is Elliot, and he acquires two friend-sidekicks (so to say), Luke and Serene (why does it always have to be two sidekicks? Why is it always a trio?). Anyway, Elliot and Luke are human, and Serene is an elf.Elliot is the most annoying, bratty and insufferable main character ever. For the first 100 or so pages, all he does is complain, says how he is better than everybody else and calls people \u2018loser\u2019. He must have said \u2018loser\u2019 more than 50 times through the whole book. All I wanted to do was grab Elliot by his little fictional throat and squeeze..! Yes, the premise warns us that Elliot is grumpy, and not hero-like, but at times he was so spiteful for no good reason, that it just felt overdone. Because of this, I never grew to feel any strong compassion towards Elliot, no matter how sad the events that happened to him were. He was ruined to the point of no return for me, and when the time came to feel for him \u2013 I just didn\u2019t care that much (I did still care a little though). Elliot is as pacifist as you can get. He feels very strongly about war and fighting. He HATES it, he DESPISES it. He finds it completely useless (which I agree with and applaud him for it). But, in my opinion, he goes on about being pacifist very wrong. He constantly tells other people how stupid war is, how stupid they all are for fighting (although his friends risk their lives protecting him, because he refuses to learn even the basic defenses and prefers to hide behind their strong warrior backs. Later on he even asks his friends to protect and fight for him, so that, in my opinion, negated the whole pacifism thing).\u200bAt first I thought that a pacifist-character was new and different from all other fantasy-adventure novels out there (a main character who doesn\u2019t fight to survive, doesn\u2019t kill, doesn\u2019t have tons of weapons on him at all times \u2013 what??!). But there were so many snide remarks and little comments that it actually got me thinking \u2013 maybe instead of just being different this book makes fun of all dystopian, fantasy young adult books out there? Makes fun of the idea of children and teenagers having to fight, and survive, while adults stand by? Luke was very bland for the most part of the book. However, I liked his character a lot! He was reserved, old-fashioned and a prude (which was funny and refreshing at the same time, for you don\u2019t often get to see a prude male character).Serene was a girl of the trio, and an elf. Oh, how I enjoyed Serene in the beginning. Her thoughts and humor were so stoic, it was delightful. Also Serene is a feminist! Or so I thought. To understand why I went from liking Serene to basically despising her, you have to know that the elf community in the book was basically a backwards-human-community, in terms of how their sexes worked. For elves, the woman was a warrior, a provider and a \u2018macho\u2019. Which at first I thought was incredibly cool and feminist \u2013 to portray women so incredibly equal to men. But then it was shown how elven women treat their men (as feeble, helpless, gentler-sex made only to care for children and cook, and do needle-work while women were on the battlefield) and I thought \u2018wait a minute, all this does is just flips stereotypes without changing a thing\u2019. I was really looking for equality all around, and it just wasn\u2019t there.If you expect 'In Other Lands' to be a fantasy-adventure book - you will be very disappointed.This is a coming-of-age story, with a character who just wants to feel loved, but doesn't know how. It is Elliot's journey of finding himself (even if his journey takes him on a kissing and sleeping with every girl, boy and other species spree). This book talks about many important issues - bullying, abandonment, fitting in, sexuality, racial and sexual stereotypes, pains of growing up and politics - it is truly a gem. But it is a well hidden gem. And I am afraid that many readers will feel that the way this book is presented is not engaging enough to actually get to those hidden gems. I would like to thank LibraryThing and Big Mouse House publishing, as well as the author, for providing me with an arc of this book. I always feel honored to be able to read novels before they hit the market.

I'm kicking myself for that now. Sarah Rees Brennan has read and loved all the same YA fantasy novels you have, and she has also noticed how ridiculous they can be and turned her talents to fixing that. Yes, this is still occasionally ridiculous, but deliberately so. It's snarky as hell, but also heartfelt. It has elves and mermaids and trolls and dwarves and even a unicorn, but no wizards because it's not that kind of magical land. Elliot is every human kid from \"our\" world who finds himself whisked away to a magical world, but he's also kind of a dick. He's a selfish know-it-all who's clueless about friendship and feelings and shit.

How dare you!\"\"It's not a bad thing,\" Myra said, \"but when a boy calls a girl the nightlight of his soul, other people might be forgiven for thinking he's being intentionally over the top.\"Elliot Schafer, irritable resident of Earth, finds himself in a quasi-Medieval magic school. People are talking about warrior-training (UGH, says Elliot) and all of it looks a lot like child endangerment. BUT, there are elves. Specifically, there is Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle, the Border Guard's first elven recruit, and Elliot falls in love at first sight. So he decides to stay despite the presence of musclehead types like that really annoying Luke Sunborn person. Let me be clear. This is not an epic journey through the otherlands or a massive worldbuilding adventure with quests goals. This is a very personal, very emotional journey of HOW DO YOU DO RELATIONSHIPS starring Elliot Schafer, who is to conversations what machine guns are to gangfights. Every other word out of his mouth is an insult and I am continuously amazed that people don't try to strangle him more than they actually do. Elliot is... SPIKY. He is so spiky. He is a headgehog in human form. I love him so much that I sometimes state at the ceiling and have feelings about Elliot trying to make sense of relationships. It's very teenage, and I usually hate that, but there's so much WANT and NEED and NEVERTHELESS YOU ARE MY FRIENDS that I am touched rather than annoyed. The other two spokes of the trio are just as dear to me. Luke is a sweetheart of a Disney Princess who is nevertheless bound by the thought processes of his world and his life, and Serene is the most hilarious method of calling out the patriarchy that I have ever encountered. Her sincere confusion about all the sensitive human men killing people in the face and not doing manly things like embroidery never ceases to be a delight, and I'm continuously thrilled by the fact that Serene is the elven version of the too-cool-for-you Bad Boy with a Heart of Gold. Gender roles get lined up and shot at a lot, and I'm always a fan of that.This collected and remastered version of the original The Turn of the Story features a few extra filler scenes, as well as Elliot-PoV version of Wings in the Morning, so you have new reading material even if you have the entirety of The Turn of the Story saved into your laptop like I do."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3982003-kat", "userReview": "This book broke my heart a little bit. In typical Sarah Rees Brennan fashion, it is by turns hilarious, absurd, breathtakingly romantic, and bitterly, bitterly sad. Our young hero, Elliott, has the worst parents since a Diana Wynne Jones novel, and basically no people skills whatsoever. He's not the sort of kid you'd expect to wind up in magic land, or to be the main character of a fantasy novel, and his struggles to figure out himself and his relationships and his place in the world are so real: sometimes you facepalm at his lack of clue, and sometimes you want to give the poor kid a big hug, even if he would probably hate that.I'm starting to babble, because it's hard to describe how this book affected me. I loved it, and I devoured it in no time flat, but it's a raw and often painful read. The best way that I can put it, is that it's a very strong book, or potent, like strong coffee or liquor. I am grown now (and unlike Elliot I have awesome parents), with wonderful, beloved friends and a family of my own, but I still remember being that friendless, lonely kid, desperate for even a drop of love or approval, and in places this novel cuts to the bone.Which is to say, Brennan has written a masterpiece. A hilarious, strange, and brutally real masterpiece. With, you know, elves and mermaids and stuff. \ud83d\ude01ETA: The most common complaint in the negative reviews I have read seems to be that this book is a coming-of-age tale dressed up in fantasy clothing, and that's absolutely true. If you are looking for your typical action-fantasy yarn, where the brave hero learns to kick ass and beat up demons/evil wizards/dragons/ogres/whatever, well, this is not that book. There are, however, plenty of instances of that book out there already, and the world probably doesn't need another one. That the \"exciting\" action-y bits happen off-stage, as it were, is part of the actual point of the novel; it is not a bug, but a feature. If that fails to appeal to you, I would gently suggest that this book isn't for you. I don't think it's for everyone. I do know it's for me.Also, the illustrations are great."}, {"userName": "Hollis ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16668577-hollis", "userReview": "Even if you found yourself in a magical story, there were no guarantees that you were the hero, or that you would get the things you dreamed of. Elliot knew no way, being who he was, to deserve that.IN OTHER LANDS is subversive, silly, sassy, strange, and sweet. It's also a wee bit heartbreaking. And sometimes you kinda wonder if anything is happening, and what's even going on, and maybe Elliot is like super abrasive and awful (kinda like how Hermione could've been if she was completely without filter and did not absorb her besties' social skills), but then you're charmed by the whole thing all over again, marvel at all the gender reversal and discussion over traditional roles turned on their heads, and get to experience a fantasy story where the lead character avoids all sorts of violent conflict, preferring to use words and treaties instead of fists and war. \"I don't need you to explain to me the concept of a magical land filled with fantastic creatures that only certain special children can enter. I am acquainted with the last several centuries of popular culture. There are books. And cartoons, for the illiterate.\"This book is a whole lot of things. \"All right then. Tell me about computers.\"\"Well.. they're boxes.. but you can write things in them. And read things in them. And there are cats in them who are funny for some reason.

It might be my favourite thing anybody has ever said.\"Also I just really wanted to include that exchange about computers because it was the best. Seriously, this book might've been really long, and sometimes I wish it had been less so, but it also made me laugh a lot and it was also really smart.

But it'll probably be the best one I read in 2018 too. It took me a little bit to get into this, but once I was on board with the dry humour and understood who Elliot was (obnoxious little turd that he is who has never been loved), I could not stop reading this book. It's a wonderful nuanced portrayal of a bisexual boy and about a kid who goes away to a portal fantasy world that isn't quite the idealized thing he imagined and who's built up so many walls around him to protect himself from a world who doesn't care about him. Just like the people around him in the book, when I first met Elliot I found him abrasive and obnoxious; but it didn't take me long to love him. It was so amazing to watch his journey, where he gets to a point of \"Elliot could not help but think of how often he had struck out wildly to defend himself, when just saying what he felt would have worked. Except it would not have worked, not on his father, or his mother, or on Jase or Adara. It only worked when someone cared how you felt. He did not know how to act, if Luke cared what he felt.\" I was not expecting this book to make me cry, but that part did.Did I mention it has an ADORABLE queer love story? Also, there are unicorns and harpies and mermaids who are also nasty but also flawed species just like humans. And the humour is great, it had me laughing out loud many, many times, most of all Serene's matriarchal elf speeches about protecting fair gentlemen and how women are especially suited for the battlefield (I also loved how Brennan interrogated that matriarchal way of thinking and didn't idealize it). Serene and all the supporting characters, especially Luke and his family, were wonderfully drawn. Do I need to gush more? Just read it!!"}, {"userName": "Beth Cato", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato", "userReview": "I received this book through the LibraryThing Early Reviewers Program.This book was not what I expected it to be. At the start, I was highly engaged at the thought of a new, creative take on a kind of Harry Potter book with a sarcastic, pacifist geeky lead. Then I started to wonder what the actual plot was, as nothing developed along those lines. Then it became clear that it was really an angst-filled catalog of teenage sexual exploits with some fantasy dressing. There was no real plot beyond the coming-of-age story, though that was certainly rewarding in some regards. I liked Elliott as a lead, though he's an unlikeable person at times--with reason. He's from an abusive family, and the writing along those lines is heart-breaking. He's also bisexual (or more like pan sexual, as he's interested in a variety of species) and it's great to see representation in that way. The thing is, I wanted more to the book than that. I wanted... a fantasy book. Some romancing and relationships along the way are fine--great! But the sordid teenage melodrama took over the whole book, and everyone slept with everyone. I wanted a bigger plot. Higher stakes. More fantasy, because the fantasy elements were great. I loved the takes on mermaids and harpies and elven feminist culture, and I wanted so much more of that. Instead, it was 90210 in fantasyland."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3165683-laura", "userReview": "omgggggg this book is just sheer perfection \ud83d\ude2d I'm definitely going to be rereading it sometime soon Elliot my spiky, bitchy bi son I love youLuke my shy badass sweetheart Serene my beautiful awesome polite elf READ THIS BOOK AND LOVE THESE CHARACTERS"}, {"userName": "Bee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4251389-bee", "userReview": "This was so good!!!

Sarah Rees Brennan has a very distinctive prose style that sometimes works against her narrators, but this -- a snarky limited third person POV -- is perfect for her, and perfectly executed as well. As I read I kept getting glimpses of the other, completely different books that were happening at the same time (Luke and Serene's star-crossed swordsisterhood, Serene's long-distance courtship, the adventures of the Sunborn women, Commander Woodsinger's ascent to command, and of course poor Luke's tortured and enduring unrequited love) but I wouldn't trade in judgmental, self-sabotaging, pacifistic Elliot for anything. The loving satire of classic portal fantasy and its colonial overtones is beautiful, and every time an elf said something sexist I couldn't help cracking up.
