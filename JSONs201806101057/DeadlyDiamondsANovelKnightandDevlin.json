The plot revolves around the abduction of Kevin O'Byrne, the spoiled son of a Boston Irish mob boss Frank O'Byrne, who has apparently taken a joy ride in the new Cadillac of an Italian gangster only to discover the dead body of one of the thug's capos in the trunk. Kevin is soon indicted for the murder, placing Knight under greater pressure, as Kevin's attorney to free him. Soon, a beloved Monsignor named Matt Ryan, a long-time associate and friend of Lex Devilin, is maliciously accused of child molestation. A former mafia Don and friend of both Devlin and Ryan, Dominic Santangelo, helps the two lawyers understand some of the dynamics of the hot situation. The plot reveals itself through relatively snappy, idiomatic crook-lawyer-priest dialog seeming to ape that learned at Mario Puzo's knee with maybe a little Dennis LeHane, before he learned to write, thrown in. There are also at least two specific nods in the text to writer Lee Childs and his literary character Jack Rusher. The writing is pretty derivative, devoid of real tension and excitement. As the plot develops, Knight determines that the crime cannot be solved without his taking a trip to Ireland. The remainder of my review will appear on my blog on Sunday, August 25. If you decide to purchase it, please consider entering Amazon through the portal there."}, {"userName": "David Duncan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21287061-david-duncan", "userReview": "Deadly diamonds is my 9th book that I have read from Goodreads.

So I was excited when the publisher sent me Dobbyn\u2019s newest novel in the Knight & Devlin legal thriller series, Deadly Diamonds. This series features a Boston attorney team who just can\u2019t stay away from trouble despite the best of intentions, and each novel I\u2019ve read has an international element to it. Deadly Diamonds is no exception. Before you get concerned about this being a series, each one I\u2019ve read works quite nicely as a stand-alone read. And to make it even better, they sent us two copies that we\u2019re featuring in today\u2019s book giveaway!

It just felt \"unreal\" how some things fell into place, the ease with which they get away with tight situations, how they pull off stunts easily, and how seemingly well practiced or experienced Johnny Walker was in dealing with thugs/the mafia/RUF without a hint of hesitation or fear. But even with this in mind, the author was able to maintain the interest in readers and push away all doubts in the hopes of finding a resolution."}, {"userName": "Kent Hinckley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19533324-kent-hinckley", "userReview": "This is the fourth in Dobbyn's series of a brash Harvard lawyer dealing with the Irish and Italian mafias plus the blood diamond trade in Sierra Leone, Africa. I enjoy reading Dobbyn's novels because they have a great story line, plenty of suspense, and the writing is excellent. This is a page turner.

The movement of \"blood diamonds\" at enormous profit but grave human expense: mafia killings in Boston and Ireland and child enslavement and murder in Sierra Leone. And who is ensnared in the middle of all of this - Michael Knight and Lex Devlin. Can they stop the enormously profitable trade of these tainted jewels? They must come between the Italian mafia in North Boston and the Irish mafia in South Boston including some remnants of the IRA in Ireland. They must also pit themselves against the enslaved and deadly child-army in Sierra Leone, who smuggle these diamonds into the mainstream for cash to buy weapons and drugs. At great personal risk, Knight and Devlin struggle to find a solution that satisfies this disparate combination of characters and, hopefully, dampens the diamond flow.", "title": "Deadly Diamonds: A Novel\n      \n          (Knight and Devlin #4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19321508-deadly-diamonds", "average": 3.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386633067l/19321508.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1181140.John_F_Dobbyn", "name": "John F.
