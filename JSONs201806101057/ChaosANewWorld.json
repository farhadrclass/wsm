I actually found it kind of humorous and enjoyable. I was so tired at work and this booked helped keep me awake. I first tried The Magician's Assistant, but the narration was like a lullaby, gently lulling me sleep. So I switched to this one. There was no sleeping with this one....I think it had something to do with the Zombie sound effects. I'm a sucker for sound effects in audios. This was very very cheesy. The MC was portrayed as 'walking perfection' along with his girlfriend. And all the other characters, including the zombies, were only in the story to make these two glow with glittery perfection. But I still liked this. It was kind of funny. I'm actually looking forward to the next one.This book was a little too simplistic in writing and story line. But it moved along very well. The narration was awful, but again, I found it all amusing and not annoying. I wish I could pin point why exactly this gets 4 stars, especially with all my complaints, but it was 4 stars. Now I need to log on to my library and see if they have the next one."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13871803-tristan", "userReview": "I very seldomly rate a book this low and also don't tend to write reviews often, however I wanted to do this so anyone thinking of trying this series or reading this because they saw I picked it, PLEASE DON'T. While the story itself became somewhat engaging as it dragged along, I cant get over how incredibly over the top the author detailed simple things like opening a door or entering a small convenience store. I have never found any distopian book I've attempted so far to be SOO disappointing. I give props for the fact that the author had this much story to write but my god man the HORROR of forcing myself to the end of this book was horrible! And its a real shame because there are quite a few more and while I'm moderately curious what happens I know I couldn't read all of these unless I had NO other option. To Mr. O'Brien, I'm sorry to be so harsh man but I have to speak my mind on this one so as to not let anyone I care about find themselves recommended this series so often by Amazon that they give in and try it. I suggest reading DJ Molles or James N Cook for anyone into zombie books who hasn't checked those authors out. They are both excellent series without this book's level of CRAZY, over the top detail that bored me to hope for my own dystopia just to get away from it."}, {"userName": "Riayl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5680336-riayl", "userReview": "I can't keep going.

The characters are well rounded and in most cases likeable with the odd clusterf*** to provide contrast.There are quite a few twists and turns throughout the plot.The lead character is Jack Taylor an ex-USAF and Special Forces veteran, who faced with the collapse of society and the evidence of an epidemic decides to try to secure his family and then set out to rescue his girlfriend Lynn, who is based in Kuwait. He has, because of circumstance, been able to take his children and his son\u2019s girlfriend with him, to leave them behind would have placed them in obvious jeopardy.The action is based initially on his collecting his children and the girlfriend, the drive to collect them through eerily quiet streets gives no real hint as to what is yet to come; only that it is not going to be a picnic in the park.Jack then begins preparing/planning to get an aircraft, that hopefully Jack is able to fly, if not initially, at least after reading the manuals.They proceed to put the plan into action. It progresses through their locating and acquiring a C130 and then their cross country/cross continent travel to locate Lynn.With stops and confrontations on the way not least with authority,The action involving the people affected by the epidemic is fast paced and because of the way it is written, you can almost feel them outside and hear them in you nightmares, you certainly do not want to open the door to check.The characters of the children and the girlfriend are quickly established and they mature throughout in response to the circumstances and trials that they are forced to face.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and read it at one sitting interspersed by breaks for food and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre and likes the military angle that John puts on it.I would rate this 3 \u2013 4 and am already reading the next book in the series and looking forward to not only meeting all the current characters again but new ones along the way.Having never read this type of story before, I am now a fan."}, {"userName": "Netanella", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157679-netanella", "userReview": "First paragraph: Picking Up The KidsI step outside sliding my Beretta 9mm into the speed draw holster at my side and carrying my 12 gauge pump shotgun.

One crow, taking up station on the tallest branch of a tree where the driveway meets the road, calls out its warning.

It involves a zombie-like outbreak (details unknown). The main character is a pilot in the military who needs to fly from USA to the middle east to rescue a friend in the midst of being overrun by zombies.  This is a short book (less than 300 pages). It's okay. It keeps your attention for the most part, but the story is a little weak. It's fight zombies, move to a new location, find resources, fight more zombies make it to your destination. The End. There was little about the characters that made me want to read the next book in the series, but I still enjoyed the read okay."}, {"userName": "Amanda Felix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17820136-amanda-felix", "userReview": "I picked this book mainly because I was fresh from reading Mark Tufo's Zombie Fallout series which were just fantastic. I needed a new series to keep me until his latest came out and found John O'Brien. The book took me by surprise as the action began pretty fast without knowing what the protagonist, Jack Walker was getting into other than he was preparing to 'go get his kids' and the world seems to have gone quiet. Okay, got my attention... and O'Brien kept it going. If you're looking for another Zombie series this is not it. If you're looking for fast paced action and something other than zombies this is the book(series) for you. Jack Walker and his girlfriend, Sgt. Lynn Connell who happens to be somewhere in the Mideast, talked about end of the world scenarios and what they would do to find the other no matter where in the world they happened to be. Jack has every intention of keeping that promise( gotta love the man for that alone) especially since he's lost contact with her and just about the entire world. He sets off to find her. What neither expected in their end of the world scenario was the transformation of humans into creatures with a taste for human flesh and they are Legion! No Zombie's here but perhaps worse because they have a rudimentary thinking process and they learn quickly. It's fast paced and scary because the reason for what is happening could very well happen."}, {"userName": "J.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7586367-j-r", "userReview": "Chaos is the first book in the New World series written by John O\u2019Brien. The premise is that some sort of \u2018Super Flu\u2019 has swept the world after originating at Cape Town. The story follows the adventures of Jack Walker, a former USAF pilot and US Army Special Operator. And yes, you can have both of those specialties only not at the same time. Book 1 opens with Walker attempting to come to terms with what has happened and rescue his son and daughters from the house they\u2019ve taken refuge in which turns out to be his ex-wife\u2019s. The plot it tight, concise and cohesive and doesn\u2019t waste time wandering around. The reader is sent into the thick of the action as the steps that Walker takes are deliberate and professional, exactly like one would expect from a former SOF operator. O\u2019Brien\u2019s description of the changed world is excellent in every little detail. From small towns to large cities, he hits it spot on.Moving back to the overall plot of the novel, Walker\u2019s goal after being reunited with his family is to somehow find a way to get to his girlfriend who is currently deployed to Kuwait. As the setting for the story is primarily in the Pacific Northwest, this creates a logistical and transportation problem that must be overcome. Walker realizes that his only chance to find his girlfriend within a reasonably time frame is to \u2018borrow\u2019 an aircraft from JBLM (Joint Base Lewis/McChord). As he\u2019s a former C130 pilot that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but locating a plane could be. As luck would have it, he locates a HC130 at McChord and using his family as flight crew, heads off to SWA. Bluffing his way past one of the few remaining military installations enroute to get more fuel for his plane, he finally lands in Kuwait. In the meantime, his girlfriend has had her hands full dealing with the infected. The reader gets their first glimpse of the infected when Walker enters McChord\u2019s hospital to gather medical supplies. Inside is a charnel house of gore, bodies and other detritus items left over from the infected\u2019s assault on the uninfected. Walker\u2019s plan comes to fruition when he successfully rescues his girlfriend Lynn and the remaining personnel on the installation then begins his return to the states and specifically the Pacific Northwest.Overall, this was an excellent book with a well developed set of characters. The primary character, Jack Walker, is exceptionally well detailed with a believable background not just a one dimensional finger puppet that has the ability to perform high speed procedures. O\u2019Brien\u2019s details of the aircraft, flight characteristics and handling are a wonder to enjoy. His version of the infected don\u2019t quite fall into the canon of zombie lore as they are not reanimated dead but cannibalistic predators that have evolved due to their exposure to the \u2018Cape Town Flu\u2019. A New World: Chaos falls into the apocalyptic/horror genre more than the zombie genre but it\u2019s still an extremely enjoyable read. Within the entire novel, I was only able to find a few minor things that appeared odd to me. One was when Walker is on his way to rescue his kids and he places his handgun on the passenger seat. That struck me as odd due to the fact that if he had to stop quickly or make any kind of avoidance maneuver, that weapon would leave the seat and most likely end up on the floor. In a potentially hostile environment this is not something you want to happen. In one other scene, he checks an S&W .38 revolver and then flicks on the safety. Revolvers don\u2019t have a safety mechanism like semi-automatics do. The only \u2018safety\u2019 a revolver has would be to leave one chamber in the cylinder empty. In a later scene, Walker enters a building to clear it and has to rack the slide on his Beretta once he\u2019s inside. This struck me as very out of character as it\u2019s already established that he\u2019s a former SF operator so making that kind of rookie mistake appeared out of context. Those minor issues aside, O\u2019Brien\u2019s writing far surpasses others that have attempted to use a military theme in their work. His writing is not by any means an attempt at writing a military apocalyptic novel, it is a winner that brings actual inside information to the novel that is realistic and authentic as only someone who has BTDT can do."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17065900-rosemary", "userReview": "A New World: Chaos by John O\u2019Brien is the book that started off my fascination with Post Apocalyptic and survivalist fiction. I read it in one sitting, logged on to Amazon and bought the rest of the series. I read them all \u2013 one after the other, far too quickly, as I then had the long, long wait for the next book.The main character in the story is Jack Walker \u2013 a former United States Air Force pilot, and special operations soldier. He lives in a Post Apocalyptic world that was brought to its knees by a flu virus which originated in Cape Town.A vaccine was then developed, fast tracked through the necessary channels, and distributed to the public, with disastrous consequences.The result..... the Night Runners. They are not zombies as we know them; they are extremely aggressive, cannibalistic creatures. On the 'bright side', they avoid direct sunlight and are most active at night \u2013 which gives the survivors a chance to breathe, and plan, without the constant threat of the Night Runners trying to get to them.The story starts with Jack setting out to rescue his three teenage children who are hiding out in the basement of the house they shared with their mother (his ex-wife). The suspense in the first few pages of the book is nail biting, the way the author details every step Jack takes, and every thought that he has, has you in Jack\u2019s head, which makes for very, very intense reading. At one point Jack accidentally kicked a board, and it went skidding along the floor making a heck of a noise, I cringed.Jack is a no nonsense type of guy, but he is a great Dad, and a caring partner so it was obvious that he would do whatever he could to rescue Lynn, his girlfriend who was stationed in Kuwait. He and his family then \u2018borrow\u2019 a military aircraft and set off to find her on an army base, on the other side of the world.The author did a really great job in building the characters in the story. Each and every character was either someone you could relate to, or someone you hope you never get to meet, or more importantly, someone you hope to have in your corner when the ball drops.What made this series really outstanding is that the story line is totally believable. It is told by someone who knows what he is talking about, and it showed. The details and the tactical and technical descriptions, for me, a non-military person, was extremely helpful and was told in a way that I could understand, without taking away from the story at all.This was a really great book and the rest of the series was just as good \u2013 if not better. I highly recommend this book, and series, to anyone who enjoys this genre, and even to those who have never tried it before. I loved it."}, {"userName": "T.W.

Yes, it does go into technical explanation at times, however, that has to be seen as the strength to this series. So often, the military are either depicted as villains, or they are glossed over and ignored due to the lack of in depth knowledge a writer has on the subject.Jack is not an \"every man\". He is a bona fide hero. He has a military past and history that puts him ahead of the game. His experience is needed to save those around him and he uses it. For once, we get a guy with \"MacGiver\" skills that are actually believable. The zombies are O'Brien's own construct and they do not behave in typical fashion which makes this an even bigger thrill. If you want a series that takes the action fast and furious, this is your book. And perhaps keep it handy. It might make a great survival guide should the 2012 fanatics be right."}, {"userName": "Marcel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18345127-marcel", "userReview": "Wow...

If you can get past that implausibility I found the book to be fairly enjoyable. The author clearly has a military background and shows that he definitely knows his stuff. He can clearly describe how a plane is flown and the details of a house sweep. This is both a positive and a negative for me. I appreciated that he knew his stuff but struggled to keep my focus at times as he described in a very detailed way the interior of an airplane and the exact procedure to start it up. the writing style also seems to show a military background since the author does not use contractions and talks like a military man.By far the best part of the book for me was the creatures. I find it hard to exactly classify them but the best way I'd describe them is as a mix between three different horror monsters. The alive style zombies of 28 Days Later with their hyper aggressive, fast, mindlessly attacking. Vampires, they can only come out at night as sunlight kills them. Wolves, they seem to hunt by scent and have some sort of pack mentality. O'Brien did a good job of not just recycling your average zombie or vampire. I feel like with the .99 price of the books they are worth the time and investment if you enjoy a horror/survival style story. The books aren't going to knock most people's socks off but I found this, and the several others I have read as I found myself with free time in between other novels, to be a fun change up from my usual high fantasy novels."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5506829-heather", "userReview": "This is actually a good story. Unusual, vivid, and with a different set of priorities than most zombie tales. It\u2019s very detailed. The only problem is that the writing lingers over everything. At best it\u2019s thoughtful; at worst it\u2019s extremely slow except when winding up to action scenes (which compared to normal action scenes are also slow, but they seem fast compared to the rest of this book). It also sometimes makes the main character seem a little slow-witted, which doesn\u2019t match his occasional very dry fits of humor.There are places in this zombie world that don\u2019t have hundreds of zombies crawling around (presumably due to the original high death rate from the flu itself). It\u2019s a nice change from the standard story.Especially considering the slow pace, there are far too many flashbacks in here, to things that are not necessary for us to know.

Humanity went out not with a whimper, but a bang.Jack, a sometimes humorous, sometimes philosophical ex-special operations pilot and soldier is one of the few left to struggle through the desolation left in the aftermath; seeking to survive as a new ferocious species emerges from the rubble, hungry and unrelenting. Will his special forces training be enough? Will he be able to keep his children safe and guide the few survivors through perils that now roam the world they once knew? Or will the hordes that now own the night prevail, forever removing the last of mankind from existence? Humankind was once at the top of the food chain. But that has now changed. This hard-hitting, action-packed series begins with Jack Walker being suddenly thrust into a world where the infrastructure which cherished Armani suits, night clubs, fast and expensive cars and watching the daily stock market are gone. Left in its place is the material world mankind built but a majority of the population has vanished; replaced by a new, savage, unrelenting, cunning, animalistic species which hunts and operates at night.", "title": "Chaos\n      \n          (A New World #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11660204-chaos", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335382043l/11660204.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5823495.John_O_Brien", "name": "John       O'Brien"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11660204-chaos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13299341-chaos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34683893-chaos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12842996-return", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13365907-sanctuary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13577865-taken", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17199775-dissension", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17877542-takedown"]}
