Somerset Maugham writes here of his travels in Southeast Asia in 1922-1923. Not until 1930 was the book published. He mixes fact with fiction. He did travel from Burma through Thailand and Cambodia to present-day Vietnam, departing by ship to Hong Kong, but that he traveled with his partner Gerald Haxton is not once mentioned. Does this truly matter? I don\u2019t think so. Many authors have left out such information before. Maugham does seem to honestly reveal what he saw and experienced, both the good and the bad, frankly admitting his own shortcomings and stating clearly his preferences and personal interests. There is fact. There is fiction, and some information is simply left out. Beginning in Burma, the route taken is via Rangoon, Pagan, Mandalay, Amarapura and Kengtung in northeastern Burma, on to Thailand visiting Ayutthaya, and Wat Suthat in Bangkok, on to Cambodia visiting Phnom Penh, Kep and of course Angkor Wat, on to present-day Vietnam visiting Saigon, Hue, Turan, Hanoi and Haiphong and finally departure to Hong Kong. He travels by train, mule, riverboat and for a short while by car. He shies away from the big cities. He visits more places than those mentioned, but you can see from those named his route. No pictures being available, I visited each via internet. Some of the places in Burma will take you breath away. Maugham talks with those he meets along the way. Interesting characters! An Italian priest, a pudgy Belgian colonel, a circus owner, Monsieur le Gouverneur of a French colony who needed a wife and fast. Maugham runs into an acquaintance from his schooldays when he was studying to be a doctor. We are given a string of stories. Stories that are alternately amusing, interesting or philosophical in tone. In Bangkok he comes down with malaria, and we hear what the proprietress of the hotel whispers to the doctor\u2014he must be moved from her hotel before he dies! He refuses opium, because that he had tried before in Singapore. In Ayutthaya, he is worn thin by the multitude of Buddhas shown him, and he says so. Some of the stories are, of course, more interesting than others. Some will appeal more to one reader and less to another. Maugham even throws in an invented fairy tale, which I found delightfully funny. It is the stories, some real and some fictional, that will determine how much you enjoy the book. The book is less a travel guide than a description of what Maugham experienced as he made this trip. Right at the beginning, he indicates his view regarding the importance of \"facts and figures\". He meets up with a Czechoslovakian who proudly states, \"He is a mine of information.\" Maughan asks him what he aims to do with all this information, clearly indicating his disdain. Maugham tells his readers that he will not provide us with a list of the species of birds and animals encountered, nor a scientific recounting of the flora. He admits he has little interest in the history of places, and he is no politician. What does interest him are cultural differences, for example between the English and the French, behavioral differences between those of the East and those of the West, reticence versus incessant talk, the value of silence, just plain ordinary people and more. Maugham exceptionally well paints pictures through words. Such pictures enable a reader to grasp the feel, the atmosphere of a place. He does this through lyrical prose. A night spent on a sampan is delightfully depicted\u2014we feel the roll of the boat under our own bodies, hear the gurgling and lapping of the water at the boat\u2019s edge, see the colors as they fade from the night sky to be replaced by an array of brilliant stars.The audiobook is narrated by Philip Bird. It is very well performed. I have given the narration four stars. He captures wonderfully how an Italian or a French person might speak English. He is fluent in French. He intones in such a way that a listener hears both the lyricism and humor in the lines. Nothing is unclear, and it is simple to follow.

But he did travel to exotic places, in an era when travel was grand and everyplace was exotic, and he wrote about it. This book is the story of several trips: One up the Irrawady river to Mandalay in Burma, then a trek across the Shan mountains into what was then Siam, after that down the Mekong to Saigon and up then up coast to Hue in Vietnam. I enjoyed reading it because I just got back from Burma and saw both the Irrawady and the Shan mountains. But I also enjoyed reading it because Maugham is so funny, so typically English yet not. His descriptions are enjoyable and you feel like you are there with him enjloying that gin and tonic. But what he does best is tell the stories of the people he meets. He is really a fiction writer after all. He tells funny stories about the man who tries to run away from his fiance of 7 years. She follows him all over Asia until she finally catches him and marries him on the spot. And he tells sad stories like the sixty year old Italian priest living in the Shan mountains who rarely saw Westerners and would never see Italy again. Maugham gives us all these characters as a gift and through them we understand these exotic places we went to even better."}, {"userName": "Petya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25359015-petya", "userReview": "\u0415\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0432 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0432\u044f\u0445\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438, \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u041c\u043e\u044a\u043c, \u0442\u044a\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a (\u0442.\u0435. \u0441\u044a\u0441 \u0441\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0449\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435 :) ). \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0449\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e. \u0418 \u0441\u044a\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a... \u0412\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0449\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0432 \u0437\u0440\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 -

Somerset MaughamA single man?In 1922 William Somerset Maugham by then already a very successful playwright, short story teller and novelist. Makes a journey from London to Ceylon and onwards to Rangoon and Mandalay, by mule to Keng Tung in the Shan state of north east Burma, from where he continues to Bangkok, Angkor Wat in Cambodia and onwards to Saigon, Hue and Hanoi in Vietnam and finally to Hong Kong across the United States and finally back to London. He only got around to writing his account of this trip seven years later in the travel story \u2018The Gentleman in the Parlour\u2019. In the years in between he was very productive and wrote some of his most famous books as \u2018The Painted Veil\u2019 (1925) \u2018The Casuarina Tree\u2019 (1926) two full length plays and the novel \u2018Cakes and Ale\u2019 (1930) High points in this travel story are his (mule) trip to upper Burma, his period in Bangkok and his description of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Aldo he tells us he has left himself at home he gives us a very interesting and personal account of his observations. But more than a traveller Maugham remains a story teller and writer, some of the stories he tells us from this trip he published elsewhere to, sometimes even before this journey.So more than a travelogue this is a very carefully composed novel in the form of a traveler\u2019s story. And also his observations tent to be very personal he is very careful about his private life. For instance there is no word about his companion. His eighteen year younger lover Gerald Haxton, how also was a great help on all his journeys. He always pretends to travel alone (with local guides and helpers) he actually never does. Like many famous travelers, such as Bruce Chatwin, V.S. Naipaul, Graham Green and Wilfred Thesiger, all pretending to travel alone, but all in the good company of lovers, wives and mistresses. Nothing wrong with that but it sheds a little different light on their journeys, and makes the travels of the few actual solitary wanderers all the more heroic. All do complaining sometimes the periods of his travels though south east Asia must have been among the happiest of Maugham\u2019s life. He is happy, healthy, in the company of his lover, enjoying country as well as city, confident, hopeful and full of energy. This novels tells us that too, the long line of works he wrote after this trip even so."}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9674584-mona", "userReview": "Reading Maugham's colorful descriptions of his travels in a small volume with yellowed pages easily lulled me back eighty years into the time he wrote which is so different from how one would go to SE Asia nowadays. Taking a break from writing fiction, he filled his journal with interesting stories of people he met along the way. I especially marveled at the former monk's recollection of collecting food in his begging bowl and the man who had to marry in a hurry in order to get a job. The beauty of his writing shown through each page; for example: \"The coconut trees with their disheveled heads were like old men suddenly risen from sleep.\" Written from his heart, the journal felt like a way of getting a look inside his soul."}, {"userName": "Julie Thomason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20293977-julie-thomason", "userReview": "I always enjoy his work and was delighted to find this book.

Essentially a travel diary filled with stories of Maugham's encounters with other Europeans along his travel route -- many of which become polished short stories at a later date. They are charming and insightful and witty, as one would expect, but sadly they are Anglocentric to the extreme. Maugham's world is one seen through thoroughly British eyes and his encounters with Asians are barely sketched in, something like a minimalist pencil drawing. Maugham eschews local foods in favor of tinned British goods found along the way, which he covets. At every opportunity, Maugham feels the need to insult: the costumes of the Vietnamese are beautiful but sadly uniform; Asian art may have aesthetic value but remains childlike in its tendency repeat themes; Burmese architecture has aesthetic merit but, well, who cares about the history of its many kings. Oh, Mr. Maugham, if I didn't love you so you'd have drawn my ire with this one."}, {"userName": "J.

I am a Maugham fan, absolutely adoring The Razors Edge, but not appreciating the Summing Up (perhaps because I hadn't read enough of his books yet). I love the story of Maugham and am intrigued by his time. I moved from the US to Asia a few years ago and have been to some of the places Maugham describes in this book, and have yet to explore some of the others (namely Angkor Wat and Burma). I actually found this book on the SE Asia travel section in the library!What fascinated me most was that though the book was written in the early 20th century - so much is still the same! On the flip side, I really enjoyed reading about how tedious travel was, and how things were back in those days (e.g., in Haiphong, all Westerners arriving were printed in the newspaper!). Makes me appreciate how much of the world I get to see today with such relative ease.This book is great fun to read, especially if you plan on doing a similar journey."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds Paz da silva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19379280-lu-s-paz-da-silva", "userReview": "Gosto de literatura de viagens.

Shortly thereafter, in 1922, Maugham took another journey, travelling from Taunggyi in the Shan state of Burma to Kengtung and then into Siam, trekking from Lopburi to Ayutthaya and on into Bangkok. From there, he sailed to French Indochina, with stops at Angkor, Saigon, Hue, and, finally, Haiphong. This book, The Gentleman in the Parlour, was the result, although it was several years after the trip before it was published. In the Introduction to this edition, Paul Theroux comments on the perspective of Maugham's travel writings, noting that it is from a sole point view, while in reality Maugham travelled relatively comfortably and in the company of friends and associates. But that perspective of Maugham's, I suppose, is what makes this book work so well. As he describes venturing through mountain trails on the backs of mules, exploring the ancient ruins of Siam and Cambodia, and encountering the mysteries of Bangkok and Saigon, it all sounds more like an expedition, an adventure, rather than a mere traveler's report. And in all those places, Maugham captures the mysterious allure of the Orient he felt so strongly. In particular, he is at his strongest in describing the Moment, that time spent on a sampan during a Saigon night, the bewitchment of the ancient ruins of Angkor disappearing into the gathering gloom of evening, or the indescribably hidden unknowns of Bangkok that refuse to let themselves be known to the visitor.I especially enjoyed his encounter with Bangkok. It has been almost a century since Maugham visited. I wonder what he would make of today's Bangkok with its eight million people? Back then, he already thought it populous like other Asian cities \"with their straight streets, their arcades, their tramways, their dust, their blinding sun, their teeming Chinese, their dense traffic, their ceaseless din.\" The size of the city has certainly changed, becoming overwhelming with its populace. But the nature is the same as Maugham describes it. Only the Skytrain now substitutes for the tramways.At the end of his journey, Maugham has brought his readers along on a metaphysical as well as temporal exploration of Southeast Asia. His vivid descriptions of people and places complements the insights into a different way of living and a different system of values for living in the Far East. Never did the divide between East and West seem more stark or beguiling than when examined through Maugham's eyes."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5921013-kayla", "userReview": "This book is one of the best travel books written at its time.

But once I got into it, I was a bit disappointed with what was actually written inside.Somerset Maugham is one of the finest writers I\u2019ve ever read, \u201cOf Human Bondage\u201d is honestly one of the best novels I\u2019ve ever read, more of the most memorable and soul wrenching stories ever set down on paper. His other works have been no less spectacular \u2013 \u201cThe Moon and Sixpence\u201d and \u201cThe Painted Veil\u201d are masterpieces both. That said, I\u2019ve read a few books by Maugham that have been less than satisfying \u2013 I couldn\u2019t finish \u201cThe Razor\u2019s Edge\u201d or \u201cThe Magician\u201d while \u201cUp at the Villa\u201d and \u201cCakes and Ale\u201d were both quite dull reads. Every so often though I see his name and remember how \u201cOf Human Bondage\u201d kept me going through an enormously long journey in Japan a few years ago and decide to try him again. \u201cThe Gentleman in the Parlour\u201d is very descriptive, going into detail on the buildings and surroundings, the clothes the people wear, the food they eat, the weather \u2013 if this is your thing then you\u2019ll enjoy the heck of out this book. For me, description is probably the thing I least enjoy about reading. I simply don\u2019t care what people wear or how someone describes a sunset, and frankly it reads like a dull travel program minus the visuals. Strangely, the parts where Maugham digresses and talks about the books he\u2019s reading are the most interesting and reminded me of the essays that form his book \u201cThe Vagrant Mood\u201d. There are a couple of personal stories from the people Maugham met on the road which I\u2019m sure were once scandalous and racy but sadly in the light of the 21st century merely pale into dreariness. That said, I did finish the book instead of setting it aside with a sigh. It\u2019s immensely readable and Maugham\u2019s style in this book is very chatty and amiable. It feels like you\u2019re being told a story by a human version of Carroll\u2019s Cheshire Cat. But overall I would rate it quite low in this writer\u2019s list of great works and would instead implore the curious reader to pick up his more accomplished and beautiful books \u201cOf Human Bondage\u201d and \u201cThe Painted Veil\u201d, the latter of which is set in South East Asia and is a far more entertaining book."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3889314-daniel", "userReview": "This book was a surprise. Maugham's prose is perhaps his most finessed in this attempt at a travelogue. It is by no means as detailed nor sophisticated as Naipaul or moving as Mathiessen, but Maugham occasionally provides poignant insight into the human condition. Maugham himself deprecates his ability to write several times, claiming himself nothing compared to a poet. Yet he still attempts to find poetry in the people and places he visits. Sometimes it works, but other times, such as his visit to Angkor Wat, do not. In one paragraph, he claims Angkor Wat is beyond description\u2014or at least his ability to describe it. A few chapters later, after expanding upon the natural world, he provides some descriptions or the wat, but his efforts are mainly to contextualize. This book is a continual push-pull of a writer wanting to find something special to write about while also refusing to do so but attempting to do it nonetheless. For example, Maugham's descriptions of the places where he stays is usually limited to \"clean\" or \"dirty,\" and people are usually savage or civilized. It can be frustrating, but then he will write something like this about Buddhism: \"[Gautama] was more like the artist who does his work as best he can to all that are willing and able to take it, passes on to other work, shrugging his shoulders tolerantly if his gift is declined.\" Astute, touching, and accurate. Later, Maugham seems similar to Thoreau when he writes, \"Is man like water that can be forced to an artificial altitude, but that reverts, as soon as the force is removed, to its own level? It looks as though his normal condition were the lowest state of civilisation compatible with his environment and in this he can remain unchanged from age to age.\"A good travel writer evokes the senses and the spirit of a place and its people. Maugham manages to do this fairly well despite a clearly privileged English slant on things. Of all his works, I find The Gentleman in the Parlour one of Maugham's most inconsistent, self-referential, and yet touching stories."}, {"userName": "Ffiamma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4574821-ffiamma", "userReview": "un viaggio lungo in asia: in birmania, thailandia, cambogia, spesso in condizioni disagevoli attraverso giungle, fiumi, piccoli villaggi, citt\u00e0 caotiche. capitoli incantati e pure frizzanti si alternano a pagine noiosissime, in cui maugham racconta con dovizia di dettagli aneddoti poco interessanti o descrive spostamenti infiniti. mi hanno colpito la rapidit\u00e0 con cui ha liquidato luoghi stupendi come angkor e la scarsa attenzione verso parecchi posti [ma poi mi sono documentata e ho visto che si definiva un \"bad traveler\" in quanto mancante del \"dono della sorpresa\": \"i travel because i like to move from place to place, i enjoy the sense of freedom it gives me\" e mi sono resa conto che forse, il modo di viaggiare di maugham era troppo intimo per poterlo comprendere appieno leggendo i suoi libri sull'argomento]"}, {"userName": "Streator Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14751353-streator-johnson", "userReview": "Somerset Maugham is one of my favorite authors, so I was kind of looking forward to this book, but it wasn't nearly as great as I expected.
