There's no real art to it (people are \"white as paper\" and so forth), but it's written for people who don't exactly have alternative lifestyles or world views. The baby boomer housewife married her husband because he respected her desire to be a housewife at a time when \"most people our age wanted to change the world,\" and she knew he'd be a good provider. As someone who eloped (and really upset her mother), I flinched when the wife freaked out just because her daughter wanted a small wedding (and says she would be horrified if her daughter had eloped). The entire book is devoted to wedding plans - the narrator will say something like \"I spent the afternoon in my den making calls for the wedding\" and then DETAIL them (called the sheetrock guy, who said...called the gardener, who said...). These are conversations that bore me in real life, so why would I want to read them in a book I'm ostensibly reading for pleasure???And it is so over-the-top - the daughter asks her mom to be her matron of honor, and then there's a twist at the end that is impossible to believe would ever happen. Still, there are folks that will love this book despite its sappiness, and I don't want to rain on their parade more than I already have."}, {"userName": "Beatrice Masalu\u00f1ga", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4590441-beatrice-masalu-ga", "userReview": "Most Nicholas Sparks' books are tear jerkers and heartbreaking, I just didn't expect this one to make me cry a little. It's more of happy tears than sad ones. I'm just incredibly touched with the story. Noah Calhoun's words helped Wilson Lewis to become a better man to his wife, Jane. Realizations of how much time he lost because he's too busy at work and doesn't pay much attention to his family. Wilson made a mistake of forgetting their wedding anniversary and hurts Jane's feelings. To make up for it, he prepared something special on their next anniversary. .

OK. So, Wilson forgets to bring a big bouquet of flowers and an expensive bottle of perfume through the door on their 29th anniversary. He has forgotten. Jane pouts until bedtime when she tells him what he has done now. That is the beginning of all the trouble. Then, Jane runs off to spend time in her son's out-of-state flat. Apparently thinking about leaving Wilson, The Husband Who Has Forgotten Their Anniversary. The son then tells his dad how devastated his mother was. Shame on you, Dad.Wilson shuffles into high gear when he realizes he may lose Jane. Taking time off work (he has become a workaholic), he pulls together a grand and beautiful and expensive wedding for his daughter (in a week's time) while he also tries desperately to woo Jane back. For someone who has been \"neglectful\" for years, I am surprised at his creativity and alacrity in planning all these events.Meanwhile back at the ranch, Jane's father (Noah, of Notebook fame)is suffering health setbacks and she is panicky and irritible. He spends his days sitting by the lake feeding a swan and now he's in hospital insisting he's all right.And Jane... Help me here... she feels she must be treated like a princess when she wants to be (her 30th birthday, she is only given a diamond tennis bracelet instead of driven in a limo and given every single thing she wants). She quietly mopes instead of taking the initiative and saying something like: \"we're growing apart, what can we do?\" and waits for Wilson to pick up on her silences. (Boohoo, I'm not getting any attention, etc.) Then she has the gall to hate the swan that her father is feeding at the retirement facility. I dunno Jane. Get a grip.Anyway, in the end it all works out for everyone, especially Jane who feels like a queen once again instead of just a friend. Perhaps it's because I've never seen this kind of marriage and would shrink at a man fawning over me like that. (It might make me wonder what he's done wrong.) But then, that's just me and I don't speak for the rest of the world.I also think I'm done reading anything by this author."}, {"userName": "Kimmie Cocchiola", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1268148-kimmie-cocchiola", "userReview": "This was my very first Nicholas Sparks book. I never had time nor made time for reading, other than educational reads for health and career. I decided to choose a book in the airport before boarding the plane. I figured it may keep my mind off of flying- I never in my life thought I would spend the next 3 days unable to put the book down. From that day on I continue to read Nicholas Sparks books. For me I find his books to be captivating, always drawing me in and keeping me there as I continue to be unable to put his books down. I truly enjoy his novels and I now enjoy reading for pleasure.

At first I was worried it was going to be lame because it makes it seem like it's going to be another story about what a jerk the main guy is and how he's neglecting his wife. However, I really liked the way the author made Wilson not a bad guy, but a good guy who just doesn't know any better. I usually don't like mushy books because it always seems like it's way overdone, but this book was really sweet.The one aspect I didn't really like was the author ties the book to his previous one (which I love) The Notebook. I guess you could argue that it plays a big part in this story, but I really don't think so. I kinda think the author tied the two together to get people to buy this second book. However, I think it stands fine on it's own.Warning:: If you cry easily in books, this could get you to tear up. Plus, if you are one of those girls who always hopes your husband were a hopeless romantic, but honestly, he never has been so chances are he never will be, don't read this book. Well, I take that back. Read it if you can look at it as sort of a guide on things YOU can do yourself FOR your husband.

He spends his time feeding a lone female swan, distinguished by a dark patch of color on her chest. Noah feels that this is Allie come back to him, and his children feel that he's lost touch with the world. Noah, however, never gives up on his theory and insists that it is his dear beloved wife.Noah and Allie's oldest daughter, Jane, is married to Wilson Lewis. They've been married for nearly 30 years and have raised three children, all of whom are now adults. Jane and Wilson's story is told in flashbacks, as Wilson remembers what brought him and Jane together all those years ago. The reason for his reflections, though, is that he knows Jane is very unhappy with their marriage. So unhappy, that she leaves town for a few weeks to spend with their son Joseph. She doesn't say exactly why she left, but Wilson knows she needs to get away to think things over.In the meantime, their oldest daughter Anna has announced that she and her boyfriend Keith plan to be married in a few weeks. She doesn't want anything fancy, and plans to marry at the justice of the peace. However, this is not what Jane wants for her daughter. Suddenly, Jane shows a new interest in life, and with the help of Wilson the two of them proceed to organize the best wedding any daughter ever had.As the wedding plans take shape, Wilson keeps Noah up to date. During their visits, Wilson notes how Noah dotes on the swan, talking to her and sharing his thoughts with her. A few odd events almost convince Wilson that maybe this is indeed Allie reborn, but he always keeps these thoughts to himself. And all through these visits, Noah reminisces about his wife, while Wilson remembers his own first love Jane"}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening Line: \"Is it possible, I wonder, for a man to truely change?\"Although not the best book in Nicholas Sparks's collection this is an easy and sweet (sometimes sickly) read without the usual gut-wrenching heartbreak at the end. I found it amazing and a credit to Sparks as a writer that he was able to craft an entire book out of the simple premise of a wedding and a few flashbacks. This is almost like a Seinfeld episode in that it's about nothing but still intriguing to watch unfold. And even though he tries to be sneaky you'll have a pretty good idea early on of how it's going to play out.Despite the shining example set by his in-laws (Noah and Allie from The Notebook)THE WEDDING tells the story of middle aged workaholic lawyer Wilson Lewis and his year long romantic journey to rebuild his failing marriage. This is basically filler but it is good to hear from THE NOTEBOOK's Noah and Allie again. Wilson has spent too little time at home and too much time at the office during his marriage. Neglecting his wife and missing his children grow up. The crux comes when Wilson forgets their 29th wedding anniversary and after witnessing his wife's tears and subsequent departure is forced to face a painful truth. Jane has fallen out of love with him and it's entirely his fault. Unable to express his true feelings in words (although we get to hear all his internal dialogue and more than once I wanted to shout at him; tell your wife how you feel, don't just think it.) Wilson vows to make some serious changes and somehow get his wife fall in love with him again. Wilson spends the next year planning their 30th wedding anniversary. He also goes on a diet, learns to cook romantic dinners and begins really listening to what his wife has to say. As the day approaches their oldest daughter Anna suddenly announces that she's getting married and as a tribute to her parents wants to do it on their anniversary, overshadowing Wilson's secret plans. Jane however is excited and begins showing new interest in both her routine life and as Wilson helps with the hurried preparations, their long neglected marriage. Jane and Wilson's story is then told in a series of flashbacks as Wilson remembers what brought them together all those years ago. Throughout the arrangements Wilson visits Noah at Creekside retirement home updating the cantankerous old man on the preparations and getting advice on how to save his marriage. For me Noah was the best part of this book and I loved revisiting this spunky yet heartbroken character. He is absolutely endearing here, spending his days feeding and talking to a lone female swan who in herself becomes a character. With the memories of Noah and Allie as a guide and their old family home as a setting the wedding plans come together. But has Wilson been able to change himself and their relationship enough to see them through things afterwards? Will he be able to show her how much she has meant to him all these years? And will it be enough?"}, {"userName": "Reem Alomari", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17570916-reem-alomari", "userReview": "This book was different in two ways. First, it was written in one person's point of view, the male character. Second, it is not a story about two people meeting and falling in love. No. These couple met and married each other. And the story starts off thirty years later. This book was so adorable. I thought it was realistic and it had zero percent cheesiness. I learned a lot about marriage from Wilson, the husband. I learned that marriage is a battle everyday where you have to fight to keep the romance alive. I also learned that in order to keep your marriage strong, you have to appreciate, compliment and listen to your spouse. And always be there and make them know that you'll always be there for them. What else can I say about this book? I loved the surprise ending of course! Nicholas always writes the best conclusions. And I am proud to say that i knew what would happen even though it wasn't obvious. Still, i was totally surprised! I also learned that if you want to get your spouse the perfect present, you don't need to worry about the details because it'll come from the heart and you'll know what to get him/her. I thought the present Wilson got was perfectly thoughtful and romantic. All in all, it was good to read something different for a change. I would really love to see this turn into a movie though.Side note:I just opened my very own blog! I'd be so happy to see people reading my reviews and telling me what they think of them.

Actually it will be really hard to rate this book as I feel I loved it but it wasn't as deep and tragically as most Spark's books usually are. I have been dying t read this book for years as I heard it was the only one with a HEA this author wrote. Well, I'm happy to tell you guys that's true. Not a single person dies in here which is usually how Spark's books go. This has pro's and con's. While I enjoyed everything being happy and nice, I missed those deep feeling Sparks usually makes me feel with his books. But it was a nice change. I did loved it, and I definitely recommend it. In my case, I just prefer his usual style and that's what I will be looking forward in the future, I guess when it comes to NS I enjoyed being tortured, maybe he has changed me into a bit of a masochist,LOL.Another thing I adore about this author is the way he writes, so many descriptions you can't help but to feel part of the story. In this book we get to read about a couple who has been married for 30 years and while they had an amazing marriage, with time it has become nothing as it used to be. With this book you'll face a harsh reality and something almost most couples get to go through with time. It was so fascinating to see them fighting to stay together, to see the love the have for one anther and how even though with time a person can screw it over and over it's still possible to make things better. Good things come with sacrifice, but they are always worth it, we just have to fight for them. Sparks takes us to everyday situations and makes us analyze them and understand things we give for granted. There's no other author that has his effect on me.Moreover, THE NOTEBOOK has been an all time fav for me, and I loved to see some of the characters again. Great read. I'm not giving 5 stars to it because I enjoy his other type of books better but definitely a book I would recommend."}, {"userName": "Delores", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1105796-delores", "userReview": "This is the second Nicholas Sparks book that I have read; the first being The Notebook.

However, that being said, I suppose as a married woman, I should be glad to have a closer look at the \"male perspective.\" I am getting used to Sparks' style of writing which I wouldn't say is quite chic lit.The story was a bit slow in the beginning but I really enjoyed the ending which turned out quite romantic.

Yay! Still, it was boring.It was basically this guy who was making calls the whole year to get things in order. I was waiting for a conflict but there was none whatsoever. That's a lot coming from someone who doesn't like conflict very much. It also got predictable halfway through the book. As in I knew, somehow, who the wedding was for. I think it was because she said her daughter would regret it if she didn't have a \"proper wedding\" ... but that's just me.The book was well written as in it was easy to read so it was okay. My major issue is in the story. I see why most women would love this book (that may sound stereotypical but, hey ...). I mean, who wouldn't want to feel like a queen and have her husband court her again ... and over and over again? I'd love that too but I feel for a guy who is faithful to his wife and did his best to provide for his family but, apparently, is still \"majorly\" flawed because ... I dunno, he couldn't say \"I love you\" all the time because it wasn't in his nature. It seems a bit petty. If, for example, he brought her perfume for their anniversary, one that he let his secretary pick, would he have known that she felt that way? Would she have cried? Would she go to NY to be away on her own? Also, I'm not an expert on being a parent and in marital affairs but would a mother go to her kids about marital issues? Would a mother burden her children about it? Hey why don't I make my son the shock absorber, never mind that he'll surely pick my side and hate his father afterwards. Again, I'm no expert but I think I'd go to my friends. Or my siblings, even. There's another side to this so why lay blame? Maybe she was too busy tending to the kids too that when they left, she, herself, didn't know what to do with the two of them being alone. She did bury and busy herself in redecorating the house after their kids left, right? And they didn't say in the book that she asked him to go away on vacation or anything. Men can be dense. Don't get me wrong. I loved that they made the marriage work in the end. Or I should say HE did something to make it work in the end.

It's not that I didn't kind of enjoy this book, it's just that it seemed a little, okay a lot contrived. There is no way a man would ever behave this way...even a good and decent and worthwhile one. Even a romantic one. I just think books like this contribute to divorced women who sit at home reading sappy romances and wondering why they can't find a man like that. Give the guys a break. How does Nicholas Sparks come up with this stuff? It reminds me of a 30 Rock episode I saw a while back where they are trying to make an older Latina woman change her bad opinion of the villain in her favorite soap opera. So they write the script for him to become charming to the point of asking to see photos of the older heroine's grandchildren. Things like that just don't happen in real life.

Unfortunately, this one disappointed me. This was a rather stagnating story; meaning that nothing much happened besides the musings of fifty-something man, Wilson, who's married to Jane, the daugther of the eldery Noah Calhoun (and Allie) who were the main characters of the Notebook. After a thirty years of marriage, Wilson has finally realized that maybe his wife has fallen out of love with him. His arguments for coming to that conclusion are very well rationalized. He's been an absent father, more focused on providing for his family than being part of that family. He's been working non-stop and has established an excellent reputation as an estate lawyer. They are not super rich, but they are upper middle-class people. It's always been his wife, Jane, that was close to the children, and close to what's at the emotional heart of their little unit. What we witness in this book is the progression, the best-case-scenario of a man trying to win back the emotional connection to his wife.

Desperate to win back his wife, Jane's, heart, he must figure out how to make her fall in love with him... again. Despite the shining example of Allie and Noah's marriage, Wilson is himself a man unable to easily express his emotions. A successful estate attorney, he has provided well for his family, but now, with his daughter's upcoming wedding, he is forced to face the fact that he and Jane have grown apart and he wonders if she even loves him anymore. Wilson is sure of one thing--his love for his wife has only deepened and intensified over the years. Now, with the memories of his in-laws' magnificent fifty-year love affair as his guide, Wilson struggles to find his way back into the heart of the woman he adores.Did You Know?The Wedding is a follow-up to The Notebook?The Wedding was inspired by a few unnamed couples that Nicholas knows well?The novel is set in the North Carolina town in which Nicholas now lives?", "title": "The Wedding\n      \n          (The Notebook #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3466.The_Wedding", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385738787l/3466.jpg", "reviews": 5607, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2345.Nicholas_Sparks", "name": "Nicholas Sparks"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3466.The_Wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/818273.The_Wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19190215-la-boda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437393.The_Wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18934594-the-wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24868155", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15931.The_Notebook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3473.A_Walk_to_Remember", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5526.Dear_John", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6400090-the-last-song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063499-the-lucky-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
