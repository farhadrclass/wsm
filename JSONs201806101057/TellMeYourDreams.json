Among all of his books, this was the one that could drop my jaw down..haaa. I remembered reading this book during my grammar class, since i could not put it down even for a single second.In the end i was kicked out of the class because unconsciously i was gasping very loudly. Sheldon really put the story in a stunning and excellent way. The plot, starting from the beginning,the climax, till the end was really well written.

I was in high school back then. A friend had an edition which included two novels - Nothing Lasts Forever and this one. I had heard a lot about Sheldon's novel and borrowed the book.Nothing Lasts Forever did not make much of an impression but Tell Me Your Dreams was the real deal. I was hooked on from the very beginning and became a fan of the author. I agree that this book is not a great piece of piece of literature. But, it is a very entertaining potboiler indeed.Now let's come to the story. There is serial killer out there! Men are just not being murdered but their bodies are horribly mutilated. The killer operates across countries.Then there are three very attractive young women with different natures and nationalities. They are somehow in the middle of all these.The book is chilling - I loved the atmosphere of suspense and tension. All the trademark ingredients of Sidney Sheldon novels such as sex, deception, betrayal, dark secrets, ulterior motives, greed, opportunism have been skilfully used. I enjoyed how the author portrayed the dark psyche of human beings. If there are perverts hiding behind a facade of respectability then there are some very decent people as well.The mystery, the suspense, the tension - all these make the novel a very engrossing read. The author has thrown about a few clues here and there.It is a psychological thriller. Nowadays readers can very easily connect the dots - the theme has been used a thousand times in novels, TV serials and movies. But, back then - when the story was published, I am sure quite a few readers were stumped.The added bonus for me was the trial. I enjoyed the way the defense counsel fought to win against a deluge of negative public opinion, ignorance and even a hostile judge.The ending makes the book even more chilling and terrifying.The book had introduced me to not only the psychological thriller genre but made me aware of a condition as well. I had come across the said condition somewhere prior to reading this book the first time but couldn't place it in the story. Years later I purchased the book as I wanted it in my collection.For me re-reading the book for a buddy read was a great pleasure.Even if you can see through the mystery - I would still say that the story can keep you turning the pages. If you like thrillers and do not mind sex & gore -then you might enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Andrei B\u0103dic\u0103", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57321276-andrei-b-dic", "userReview": "\"Iar ea \u00ee\u0219i aminti durerea a\u0219tept\u0103rii disperate a lui Jim din gar\u0103, cum crezuse \u00een cuvintele lui, av\u00e2nd \u00eencredere \u00een el.

This is another book you simply cannot put down (even for just a little bit). Anyway, I'll start with the usual. :> Tell Me Your Dreams is a 1998 psychological thriller by the well-known American author, Sidney Sheldon.The mystery in this novel lies within a woman named Ashley Patterson and her past. It\u2019s better to say less about the story. I might spoil it too much and you wouldn't like it. teehee:pMoreover, the whole story comprises of attention-grabbing characters with different professions/jobs like painters, jewelry shop owners, introverts, computer technicians, psychos, cops, detectives, lawyers, and doctors, but it does not dwell on police procedures very well. It is set in California and touches in Quebec, London and Rome. Despite all the differences of the characters mentioned above; this is still a simple, easy, and an unforgettable read. I would suggest that you better hang on to your seat guys!In the end, I wanted to spoil a little excerpt\u2026 \u201cThere could have been a terrible ending for her (Ashley Patterson), but this was the happy ending she had prayed for.I'm on my way at last.

Gradually, we learn about other twists to character, which moves the story forward. (if you could be kind and forgiving enough to categorize them as twists that is).However, the reason why I hated the book was because really how dumb does the author expect us to be? The writing is simplistic, enough so to be actually demeaningly termed as a mediocre chick-lit. Not expected from a world famous author. Second, the different characters are so shallow and so poorly fleshed out that you actually feel like whether you're reading a last moment class assignment, or an actual published work. Maybe if you have not read works like Stieg Larsson's The Millennium Trilogy, then you might empathize with the protagonist, or gush about how great it is.I guess it was a feat in itself for me to complete the book."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1905130-stefanie", "userReview": "Review originally published at http://www0.epinions.com/review/Tell_...The novel opens introducing us to the heroine, Ashley Patterson. Although she cannot prove it, she feels and believes that she is being stalked by someone with murderous intentions. She comes home from work (in Silicon Valley) one day to find that all the lights in her apartment have been turned on. Another day she sees that her lingerie drawer has been ransacked. In the next two chapters, we are introduced to Toni Prescott and Alette Peters who work at the same company with Ashley. Toni is six years younger than Ashley, born in England, she is a bit of a wild child with serious maternal issues. She is a wonderful singer, but her inner thoughts keep flashing back to her mother telling her she was no good and would never amount to anything. Toni likes to dress provocatively and go club hopping on the weekends. She despises Ashley because Ashley is everything she herself isn't. Alette is eight years younger than Ashley. Born in Rome, she is a soft spoken, sweet artist who also has maternal issues. Though people around her keep telling her that she is an extraordinarily talented painter, she keeps hearing her mother tell her the contrary. Though she currently has a very close relationship with her father, Ashley is haunted by the memory of her father forcing her to leave her High School sweetheart, Jim. She had planned to run away and be married to Jim, but he never showed up at the train station. When Ashley attends her ten year reunion, she learns that Jim was viciously murdered and castrated the morning they were supposed to meet. She is stunned and immediately suspects her father. When a man at work who has been bothering her meets the same fate after she complains to her father about him, Ashley is convinced that her father is behind these murders. On a business trip to Canada, Toni meets her Internet boyfriend for the first time. He presents her with a beautiful emerald ring and is then murdered and castrated. Alette\u2019s artist boyfriend back home in California is also killed in this same fashion. Upon returning home, Ashley finds on her bathroom mirror the message You will die. The deputy assigned to protect her is found the next morning in the alley, dead and castrated. When the emerald ring given to Toni is found in Ashley's jewelry box and her fingerprints and DNA at each murder scene, she is arrested. At this point, we are a little less than half way through the book. If you haven't guessed from the review (I had already guessed from the novel), Ashley suffers from MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder). Toni and Alette are both alters which had been created by a traumatic experience (when Ashley was six and eight years old). From this point backward, the novel had been gripping and enticing. I couldn't put it down. After this, I was thoroughly disappointed. Ashley's father persuades a criminal lawyer turned corporate lawyer, David Singer to return a favor and represent Ashley. The second half of the novel deals with the trial, the fighting psychiatrists: (Multiple Personality Disorder is a real disorder, Multiple Personality Disorder isn't a real disorder), and Ashley's treatment and introduction to her two alters in a state asylum. The most interesting part of this section was learning the horrific event that caused her fragile psyche to shatter as it did. This novel was written in the third person, with insight into the minds of Ashley, Toni and Alette. The focus on MPD was interesting, but slow paced. It was frightening how someone can commit brutal murders, be released to an asylum for treatment and then released upon being deemed \"cured\". I could tell that I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel, but I missed the adventure, the world travels, the intrigue and thrilling plot twists to which I've become accustomed."}, {"userName": "Ann Jenelle Rotol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5911490-ann-jenelle-rotol", "userReview": "I have to confess that I'm really not a fan of Sidney Sheldon's works. The thing he writes isn't just my cup of tea. But I can honestly say that I really like Tell Me Your Dreams. That's because there's a touch of psychology in here. Psychology's holy grail plus murder equals a masterpiece! I can say that Sidney Sheldon is a good writer because of this book.I remember being amazed of how Sidney Sheldon narrated this novel. Where everything at first is confusing and gradually it all becomes clear until the very end. (Oh, it's also a book about healing...) Unlike what has happened in Doomsday Conspiracy, where everything in the end is just - bleh (sorry for the lack of a better term).

She have a two seperated different personalities, Toni Prescott who is a very aggrasive girl and Alette Peters who is a shy and kind girl. Both of them was created when Ashley was raped by her father, Dr. Steven Patterson, who is famous doctor in the world. This story is divided in three part. First part is related to the story of murder by Toni and then, in the second part, author narrated that how David win the court about murder by Toni. Last part is the story about how Ashley overcome her problem. However, last page give me the hint that Ashley will look for her father to revenge and protect her new half sister. People normally have their problem which nobody know about. The concerns is that how to overcome their problem and create a new life and build a positive mind. Sometimes, people eager to find a doctor to explain their concerns and to have a solution. Unfortunately, In Korea, it is the shame action to have a mental theraphy in the hospital. I think that this circumstance should be changed for people to feel free to find a counseller. Especially, current modern society make people frustrated in a various condition. For example, teenagers are received big pressure from high competitive relationship in shcool. Many people are hardly to listen to the positive message form media and journal. This is the important time for people to make a better life. Committing a suitcide, people lost their dream and hopeness from people. Always listen to the negative message from relationship and think of the awful image from the violent movie.

By familiar, I mean I've been knowing his famous name with dozens of bestseller book yet didn't have any interest to even try to read some of his books. Not until my husband eagerly introduced it to me and showed me how he'd been impressed by the Sheldon's novels. So at first, I tried to please him by reading one of the Sheldon's novel he had recommended me, \"Tell Me Your Dream\". This eventually marks the first novel of Sidney Sheldon I've read. And my impression was beyond what I'd thought before. I thought I was going to get bored reading it. When I went to the first several pages, I felt the plot was too predictable while I undoubtedly admitted that it's very well-written. Though quite predictable in the first chapters, I so much enjoyed the novel until I was addicted and couldn't stop reading it. The story was cleverly maintained, the characters were strongly built, and the end part was quite realistic.In brief, the story is about a woman who suffers from the Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), a mental disorder results in two or more split identities which then controls the individual's behavior. Because of this syndrome, she has to face a trial for the murders she doesn't commit. The story mentions in detail the trial process, how the defender argues for her, how they struggle for win by assuring the judge, the prosecutor, and more importantly the jury that she is not guilty because of insanity. The novel also narrates how people with MPD is being cured with several therapies and how she has to face her alters, the conflicts inside herself, and how she and her alter egos have to cope with her dark past.In sum, Sidney Sheldon had brought the novel into something brilliant. And I guess he had done some research before, thus from the novel I could get some valuable information about MPD syndrome and the criminal trial process in the State, though the later perhaps wasn't descripted deeply. So I could say that I was as much impressed as my husband, and feel so much confident to read other novels by Sidney Sheldon. :)"}, {"userName": "Mwanamali ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32149976-mwanamali", "userReview": "It was perfect the first time.

She is lonely, shy, and lives a life that is unfulfilling to her. She is also absolutely convinced that someone is stalking her. Toni Prescott and Alette Peters are both co-workers of Ashley's, however the similarities end there. Toni is a saucy, British vixen with a penchant for Internet dating and dancing at discotheques. 'La bella Italiana' Alette is an aspiring artist who prefers quiet, dreamy weekends spent in the arms of handsome painters. Reminiscent of high school, Toni and Alette do their best to keep Ashley out of their cool clique, but find it extremely difficult after a string of murders irrevocably binds their lives together. Toni, Alette and Ashley know virtually nothing about each other until all three women are inexplicably linked into a murder investigation that will lead to one of the most bizarre trials of the century.This book is a work of fiction, but is based on several actual cases. I really enjoyed this book and found it to be an interesting read. I was definitely hooked by the plot and wanted to discover what happened next.

If you want a book you can't put down, his is the best shelf in the library. So, obviously, I was expecting nothing less than perfect from the book.And, this novel matched, no, went beyond all the pre-set standards! The story is about a girl with a multiple personality disorder..And she's completely unaware of it. The book goes through three stages: One, the girl, and her multiple conflicting personas, get involved in a horrible serial murder case. The second stage takes you to the journey of the following lawsuit and court proceedings. The third phase focuses on her efforts to overcome her disorder.The best thing about Sheldon's novels is their ability to completely immerse the reader in the ocean of the plot. You smile when the protagonist begins a love story, cry when she has a heartbreak, and laugh the most evil laugh when she takes her revenge. And, it's not just the few main characters, but you feel attached to each sidekick that comes along too, the way you are related to all people in actual life.Do read the book!

Terbagi dgn 3 bagian cerita, bagian pertama ttg kehidupan Ashley Patterson dan kedua alter ego nya, Toni dan Alette. Toni dan Alette saling kenal, tetapi Ashley sama sekali tidak mengetahui mereka. Hingga terjadi 5 pembunuhan sadis pria dgn penikaman beruntun dan dikebiri.Bagian kedua adalah ttg si pengacara David Singer dgn segala problemanya menghadapi kengototan ayah Ashley dgn mengungkit hutang budi dan ambisinya menjadi partner di firma tempatnya dia bekerja. David shock ketika mengetahui dan melihat sendiri Ashley mengalami gangguan Multiple Personality Disorder dimana perilaku dominan Toni sama sekali tidak bisa dikontrol oleh si tuan rumah, Ashley. Setelah nyaris kalah, mukjizat terjadi saat-saat terakhir oleh gagasan cemerlang dari David. Bagian ketiga menceritakan proses pengobatan MPD Ashley, sempat maju-mundur prosesnya. Nyaris membuat dokter yg menanganinya juga frustrasi akan kegagalan. Dan titik terang mulai terjadi saat masa kecil Ashley terungkap.Walaupun saya tahu novel ini hanya fiksi belaka, saya tergelitik juga bhw ada \"kebenaran\" dlm kasus MPD ini. Trauma masa kecil yg sangat tidak menyenangkan bisa sangat membatasi/memagari pikiran pasien MPD, sehingga menekan hal tsb ke alam bawah sadar, dan secara tidak sengaja malah menciptakan kepribadian yg lain, bisa jauh sangat dominan dan berbahaya seperti Toni, atau yg sensitif dan pendiam seperti Alette yg dikontrol oleh Toni. Tak dipungkiri agak kezel juga dgn ending-nya yg tidak memberikan karma yg setimpal bagi si tokoh biang kerok-nya, tapi novel ini luar biasa dgn psychological thriller yg lumayan mencengangkan."}, {"userName": "Liv (\u041e\u0459\u0430)", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-liv", "userReview": "Actual rating 3.5CONTAINS SPOILERSThis was such a great book! I couldn't put it down! It was full of twists that just made me gasp. The characters were great and had depth. I totally believed the whole story. I believed the characters. The writing stil though simple, was really capturing.But: there are a few things about the plot I did not like.1. The romance between Gilbert and Ashley wasn't actually shown, even though it was clearly pointed out in some places that the two had feelings for each other. It would have been even greater if Ashley and him became a couple when the therapy finished. It would make it clear that the therapy worked.2. What was the story about the mother? Why did she hate Ashley so much? It was never mentioned in the book.3. Sheldon said that dr Patterson and his wife always fought about one thing, which was as well never mentioned. I think that it could have made a good addition to the plot.4. Why wasn't dr Patterson arrested for rape? All in all, I enjoyed this book very much. I strongly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Shaghayegh Sedaghat Modabberi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13833776-shaghayegh-sedaghat-modabberi", "userReview": "\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u0686\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0648\u0634 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u064a\u062f\u060c \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u0634\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u0643 \u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u062c\u0644\u0648\u062a\u0631\u0647.\u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0634\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u064a\u0643 \u0631\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0646\" \u064a\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0632\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0646\" \u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0648 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0634 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \"\u0646\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u064a\u0643 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0647 \u0632\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0634\u062a\"\u0646.\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u0628\u0627\u064a\u064a \u0643\u064a\u0641\u064a\u062a \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0634\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a. \u0628\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u063a\u0627\u0641\u0644 \u06af\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0647\u0627\u064a \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0635\u0641 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0639\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u062f\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u0647 \u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a \u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u064a\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f.\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u0643\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u064a \"\u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0646\u0647\" \u0634\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0633\u064a \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \"\u0631\u0648\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u06af\u0648\" \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0643\u064a\u0641\u064a\u062a \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u064a\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0632\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u062a\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f.\u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0633\u0627\u064a\u064a \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u064a\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0646\u0645 \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u064a \u0627\u064a\u0634\u0648\u0646\u0648 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0647 \u0643\u0646\u0646. \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635: \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0627\u064a\u062f\u060c\u062e\u0637 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u060c\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u060c\u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0646\u0647 \u0648 \u062a\u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a \u0645\u064a\u062a\u0631\u0633\u064a."}, {"userName": "Reign", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46448421-reign", "userReview": "[ multiple personalities  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Skz", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20845271-skz", "userReview": "The best Sidney Sheldon novel by far, and I have read quite a few in my days, when life was all about sneaking novels into the dorms and reading them under blanket covers.
