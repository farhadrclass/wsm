There's a lot going on in this book which begins with murder on a London tube platform. An Oxford professor - exiled from the USA for his long ago Communist past - is framed and put in jail while his adulterous lover and a young lawyer - dying from cancer - join forces to take on the CIA, FBI, KGB, MI5 and MI6 in a bid to prove the professor's innocence. There's a lot of fascinating historical and political detail in the plot, but parts of it just got too fantastical - especially towards the end, when the 2 female heroines attempt to alter the actions of Scotland Yard detectives. If pushed, I might have given it 3 stars, but the story finally fell apart as the author tried to work out a plausible happy ending. Worth a look for anyone keen on conspiracy theories."}, {"userName": "Michael Bully", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46177211-michael-bully", "userReview": "Got totally immersed in this novel and had to finish in one day. For anyone interested in the Cold War spooks and conspiracy and counter conspiracy in the higher echelons of power. American professor now teaching in Oxford, with a background in support of Left wing causes, Tom Wrought is being framed for murder in the 1950's. So many political cliques have a reason for wanting him discredited . His lover and her solicitor become a strong female double act in trying to save him.The plot has so many twists, with even the most supposedly benign characters being potential betrayers. Power politics are shown as being brutal and amoral, with individuals being expendable .The FBI, CIA, British intelligence, FBI, the wars that Finland was embroiled in from 1940- 1945, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, racism and antisemitism in the USA, Mccarthyism, police enthusiasm for a quick conviction, Cambridge Spies,Michael Foot, all feature. There is sharp political comment at times concerning the history of the American Communist Party, the ill treatment of Black soldiers in the US army in World War 2, claims that Ethel Rosenberg was deliberately framed and sent to the electric chair in 1953, how 'Doctor Zhivago' 's publication fitted into the Cold War.Not an easy read, complex and demanding, rarely predictable.A couple of minor niggles. The author seems to confuse Dorset and Devon for the settings of one chapter. He also seems to think that racial discrimination was illegal in 1950's Britain. Annoying typos appear.But overall an outstanding Cold War spy story. Heartily recommended."}, {"userName": "Ethan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448340-ethan", "userReview": "Tom Wrought is being framed. Life hadn't been easy up to this point, but he never expected it to get this bad. A Pulitzer prize and colloquial respect as a historian did little to protect Tom from the hysteria of McCarthy's crusade against communism. Black-listed and humiliated, Tom relocated to Oxford where he found the love of his life Liz. The only problem. . . Liz is married.As the affair of Tom and Liz progresses, the two become soulmates. But the bliss of love is soon interrupted by the sudden murder of Liz's husband. The poor man is pushed in front of a train on the London Underground, and Tom is the prime suspect. The authorities see the event as a cut and dry case of \"the other man\" killing the husband out of jealousy. Despite the clear motive, Tom adamantly proclaims his innocence.Lucky for Tom, Liz believes him. She hires a young lawyer to defend him and to get to the bottom of who would frame him. As the story unfolds, we learn secrets of Toms past that have the potential to unearth an even larger conspiracy of global proportions.In Autumn in Oxford, author Alex Rosenberg crafts a deliberately plotted thriller that is riveting from start to finish. I was reminded of the works of Joseph Kanon, especially The Good German, as I read this historical novel that was full of twists and turns that come with Cold War espionage. The characters are intricately drawn and help to keep the pages turning even when the action stalls. It was particularly refreshing to have two women, Liz and her solicitor, take the reigns of the investigation, especially given the time period of the story. Autumn in Oxford is a novel that could have benefited from one final editing pass, but ultimately the heart of the characters and intrigue of the plot elevate the book into a fascinating and engaging read."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8644428-lynn", "userReview": "Tom Wrought is a frustrated Oxford Don, with a history of being shuffled here and there for various reasons.

As Tom watches in horror, Trevor is pushed off the platform and under the wheels of the oncoming train. Tom gives chase, but loses the man in the crowd.In a matter of a very few days, Tom is unjustly arrested and charged with Trevor's murder! Liz and a solicitor she has engaged to defend Tom, begin the process of unraveling Tom's background. They believe he is being framed, and what they discover will blow you away.

I'm trying to browse through my reading history to see if I've read any spy novels. Apparently, this was the first one. Yes, I do know who James Bond was/is and I actually watched a couple of the movies with my husband (kind of). No, Tom Wrought is not like James Bond. Except perhaps for the steaming affair he's got going with a gorgeous and very bright lady. Her husband gets killed fairly early in the novel, so one shouldn't ponder to much on the fact that she was married. What you should rather ponder on is the fact that if she wasn't married, there wouldn't have been much of a story here. Come to think of it, one can almost say that her marriage licence provided the licence to kill. Yes, Tom is presumed to be the culprit. But did he do it? No.All the pretty ladies shared that sentiment. Liz (the gorgeous not-grieving-at-al widow) hires a solicitor, Alice Silverstone, who harbor a secret of her own. Together they start to unravel Tom's past. Both of them are convinced that he is framed and they frantically search for all the puzzle pieces. Gathering those didn't proof to be half as difficult as getting all the pieces to fit together. As a matter of fact, I'm still a bit confused. The author's Notes at the end of the novel was insightful and I do believe it's time to sit down for a few history lessons. It might be advisable to read Mr Rosenberg's notes and google a few facts and characters before you start reading the actual story. It was a good story, but my lack of knowledge did hinder my reading progress and pleasure."}, {"userName": "Jim Robles", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25525237-jim-robles", "userReview": "The things people - in this case J.

It\u2019s even presided over, in a rather perverse way, by the queen conspiracy theorist of all, J. Edgar Hoover.And once the story gets going, it doesn\u2019t let the reader go.At first, this seems like a simple thriller. A man is pushed into an oncoming train by a mysterious assailant and is instantly killed. But of course it isn\u2019t nearly that simple.Tom Wrought witnesses Trevor Spencer being shoved off that train platform and knows that he is in deep, deep trouble. Tom was on his way to a rendezvous with Spencer\u2019s wife. He knows that he has the obvious motive for killing the man, and that witnesses will eventually place him at the scene, especially since the real killer bears at least a passing resemblance to himself.So Wrought pretty much does everything an innocent man shouldn\u2019t do. He runs out of the station, chasing the real killer. He leaves the scene of the crime in a way that draws attention to himself. He stops to phone his lover to tell her that she should go home to meet the cops, who will inevitably come to give her the \u201cbad\u201d news.He knows that he didn\u2019t do it. So who did? And why?And that\u2019s where the fascinating part of this book begins. Not with the recitation of the beginning of Tom\u2019s affair with Liz Spencer, but with what happens next. And with what happened in Tom\u2019s life long before this little mess. All the events and chances that dropped Tom into the soup at this point in time, and why they have all come to a head now and not earlier. Or later.And all the things that people in high places will do to get Tom both locked up and discredited. The collateral damage of a little murder isn\u2019t even the worst act they commit. But watching Tom, Liz and their attorney unravel the conspiracy, piece by ugly piece, is one hell of a story.Escape Rating A-: In the end, I absolutely loved this book. But it needs an editor. The affair between Tom and Liz is the least interesting part of the entire story. It\u2019s only purpose is to provide the means and method for what follows. And frankly, the reader knows enough about their affair when Tom witnesses the murder that we don\u2019t need the complete rehash. It\u2019s what happens after the murder, and the story that Tom tells of his life before Oxford, that give this story its punch.And what a punch it is. The Red Scare of the 1950s in the U.S. makes for very bizarre reading from the 21st century. Except where it resonates all too clearly.Tom flirted with the Communist Party while he was in college. A lot of people did in the 1930s. Tom was also extremely anti-segregation long before integration became remotely accepted. And an awful lot of very important people in the 1930s believed that any challenge to the American status quo, including calls for integration, were automatically part of a Communist plot.All of this makes Tom an obvious target for the powers-that-be. He\u2019s had the fortune, or misfortune, to be in the right place at the right time to be a witness to history, and to be able to expose the lies and deceits of powerful people. J. Edgar Hoover, in particular, was not known for being merciful to those he perceived as his enemies \u2013 whether they saw themselves as his enemy or not.The story of Tom\u2019s life before the murder is what draws the reader in. And also what provides the motive for the murder. The ways in which Tom ran afoul of people in high places, and the underhanded means they used to strike at him without regard for either collateral damage or irreparable harm to U.S. relations with their post-war allies piles conspiracy on top of conspiracy into an unstable but absolutely compelling house of dirty little cards.The thrill-a-minute chase at the end provides the perfect conclusion."}, {"userName": "Cindy Roesel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581809-cindy-roesel", "userReview": "We\u2019re offering up something different here at Thoughts on This \u2018n That: A novel about murder, espionage and of course, love!

I have mixed feelings, but it mainly boils down to the fact that I do find this book engaging in plot and in characters. The subterfuge behind the main character's arrest to his background and the political connections all makes Autumn in Oxford worthwhile. It doesn't have the adventure of James Bond, but it has the intrigue behind all conspiracy theories, along with the character developments of the three main characters to keep you reading. The back stories that revealed itself throughout the story were spot on most of the time, giving readers reasons and speculations that allows one to thrown in their own theories as well. Despite the fact that our main characters were adulterers, their love went through its ups and downs, and how it sparked the beginning of Autumn in Oxford, catches your attention early on. I enjoyed the theories thrown in, and personally find Alice's character rounds out this story nicely.However, I do think it needs some editing work. I'm not sure why first and last names were used interchangeably, and some within the same paragraph. The general narration of the story is simple and straight to the point, but it can get monotonous at times, not giving enough differentiation between each character's stories.In all, the plot itself interests me enough and even compels me to move forward until the end to see what happens to our characters. If you're a fan of historical fiction, particularly ones focused on political and conspiratorial fiction, Autumn in Oxford is one for you.Scroll on down for your chance to win a copy.

There were so many double-agents that I don't even know if the spies knew whose side they were really on...they were probably just trying to stay alive. This story catches up with a former spy, Tom Wrought, who escaped the US after being blacklisted for having communist sympathies as a student twenty years before. Now Tom is a Pulitzer Prize winning historian who has secured a teaching position at Oxford and is trying to live a normal life. His marriage isn't great and he falls in love with his married neighbor, Liz. The affair is the normal story...but en route to a rendezvouz, Tom witnesses Liz's husband being pushed in front of a train in the London Underground. Within 24 hours, Tom has been arrested. This is where the story gets interested...we know Tom didn't commit the murder so who has enough reason to frame him for the murder. The story then unfolds, providing insight into Tom's introduction to the communist party, the major players, his time at University, leaving the party and then his actions in WWII as a defender of the black soldiers and eventually, a spy. So who wants him out of the way...the KGB, M15, M16, the FBI, the CIA...what secrets does Tom know??? In a race against time, Liz and a young soliciter, Alice, attempt to uncover the truth and save Tom and themselves before it's too late.

Tom Wrought is an Pulitzer Prize winner and author. Though married, he falls in love with Liz, also married with children. Thus the affair begins. So much time was spent on exploring this relationship that I almost set the book aside as I could not see where it was headed. Even when Liz's husband is murdered, and Tom is framed for the murder, it took awhile to get into Tom's background and to explain why he was being framed. The book does get more intersting as Tom's previous life as an employee of the group that was a precursor to M16 is explored. The conspiracy theories and tensions between agencies like the FBI, CIA, M15 and M16 as well as the KGB were interesting though at times a bit confusing. Each agency had their own motives and agendas for framing Tom or for helping him. The most likeable character in the book is Tom's lawyer Alice. She is dying of cancer and finds relief in doing what she loves the most and being part of this very complex case. Having nothing to lose, she takes risks in order to gain her client's freedom.

I especially enjoyed the handwritten journals written in prison."}, {"userName": "Lori Mcmullen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7478595-lori-mcmullen", "userReview": "Infidelity, a lawyer with terminal cancer, and more spies than you can shake a stick at, what's not to like? Alex Rosenberg weaves a tale that spans several decades and continents. Cold War jitters, the Civil Rights movement and a love triangle fought for my attention. Loved the historical aspect and how Rosenberg wove those facts seamlessly into his story. Well done!!"}], "description": "After being blacklisted for having communist sympathies as a student twenty years before, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning historian Tom Wrought escapes America\u2019s Cold War climate to teach at Oxford. There, he falls in love with Liz Spencer, a beautiful married woman. When Liz\u2019s husband is pushed in front of a train in the London Underground, Tom is immediately arrested for the murder. Scotland Yard is convinced it has its man, as he had means, motive, and opportunity.Certain of his innocence, Liz hires a young solicitor, Alice Silverstone, to defend Tom. But they discover that Tom\u2019s former secret work as an American spy made him a number of powerful enemies. Russian intelligence, British counterespionage, and even the FBI all may have reason to frame him. If Liz and Alice can find out who is behind the murder, they stand a chance of freeing Tom, but doing so puts all their lives at risk.", "title": "Autumn in Oxford", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29806081-autumn-in-oxford", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464334793l/29806081.jpg", "reviews": 45, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2545883.Alex_Rosenberg", "name": "Alex Rosenberg"}], "type": ["Historical", "Abandoned", "Novels", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29806081-autumn-in-oxford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29806101-autumn-in-oxford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30306434-autumn-in-oxford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33003570-autumn-in-oxford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25837338-the-girl-from-krakow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10955015-the-atheist-s-guide-to-reality", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1093529.Philosophy_of_Science", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168223.Philosophy_of_Social_Science", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1668689.Philosophy_of_Biology"]}
