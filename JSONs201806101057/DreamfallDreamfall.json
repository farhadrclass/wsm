Well, in a few short days, they\u2019ll be laying us out in a lab, fitting our heads with electrodes, and running electrical currents through our brains until our insomnia is fried into extinction. They\u2019ll be shocking us into normalcy.Yes, I\u2019m scared. But if this is what I have to do to be able to sleep again, I\u2019m ready to sign my life away.\nI had to push myself to keep reading. This one almost ended up on the dreaded \"DNF\" list that I try to avoid if possible. I am happy I decided to keep reading if only for the twist at the end that becomes semi-predictable at a point, though I admit the dream sequences started to get skimmed because it was just so wtf and even bordered on repetitive as they'd fight to survive/escape. It felt like the same questions asked over and over as the characters would reiterate what we already knew. And as we get in a new dream, it starts all over.What was refreshing was Jaime's POV (one of only three). Jaime is a premed student observing the experiment. There is also Cata and Fergus, both subjects in the experimental procedure to cure sleep disorders. Jaime's perspective gives us the opportunity to see what is going on in the lab, while the seven subjects are all comatose. While Cata and Fergus allow us to see two different perspectives within the dreamworld. The only problem with these two is their voices don't feel distinct from one another. We don't know a lot about the characters to start - only that the seven subjects have sleep disorders and fall between the ages 13-19. Through their experiences in the dreamworld and Jaime's in the lab where Jaime has access to each subject's file, we slowly learn about the characters.There is a diverse cast. And Jaime's gender is not mentioned at all. I applaud the author on this decision. I actually hope it never gets brought up because gender shouldn't hold that importance. It is who you are as a person, not what appendage you have between your legs.Here is the thing...I am a huge horror buff. So maybe I'm desensitized to certain horror scenes. But I didn't find myself scared one bit in this book and that's the main thing I was hoping for. It probably doesn't help that I've had some terrifying nightmares that these just don't measure up to. Younger readers may find scenes in the dream sequences to be frightening, but I wouldn't recommend going into this hoping for some scares. It might not happen for you.While this book offers a few very wonderful things, it wasn't exactly for me up until that twist at the end making me interested in the sequel. Jaime's chapters were the most interesting for me. This wasn't quite as Nightmare on Elm Street as I was expecting."}, {"userName": "Ishmeen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24369685-ishmeen", "userReview": "You know your tastes are messed up when your favourite character is revealed to be a psychopath \ud83c\udf1a"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(I received an advance copy of this book for free.

I also liked how we learned more about them as the book went on, and that there were twists in store as information about the teens was revealed.The storyline in this was about seven teens taking part in an experiment to cure their insomnia. During the experiment, which used ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy), there was an earthquake which interrupted the electrical supply, sending the teens into what the doctors thought was a coma. However, the teens all found themselves thrust into a group dream, where they were forced to battle their way through their nightmares together. I did like the action in this book, and I also liked how we had Jaime back in the lab letting us know what was going on outside of the dream world. I thought that the nightmares were quite creepy, and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to battle through them myself.The ending to this didn\u2019t really tie much up, so it will be interesting to see what happens in the next book.6.5 out of 10"}, {"userName": "Maggie \u2618 (Reader in Wonderland)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40477684-maggie-reader-in-wonderland", "userReview": "*3.5/5 stars*\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m scared. But if this is what I have to do to be able to sleep again, I\u2019m ready to sign my life away.\u201d\nDreamfall was actually pretty intriguing read. I liked the idea of this story - Seven subjects suffering from insomnia for different reasons and traumas are being tested for a cure, but... The lab equipment malfunctions and they are all thrust into simultaneous coma and together joined in some kind of dream state, in their nightmares.The concept of Dreamfall was very intriguing one, but it didn't entirely live up to it. While this book was quite captivating read overall, it was also a bit boring at times, with some blank spaces and rather simple plotline going, for the most part, in circles.\nVesper is staring at her like he\u2019s challenging her to do something impossible. \u201cCall it,\u201d he urges.She sighs and says, \u201cAs of seven fifty-five a.m., I declare all seven subjects comatose.\u201d\nThis book is told in first person from 3 POVs - Cata, Jaime and Fergus. Jaime's pov being outside of the dreams so we get to see some scienc-y explanations and what is actually happening in real world in the lab. I liked that all three POVs sounded distinctive from one another. While I enjoyed reading from all of the characters, no one truly stood out for me. They ended up being a bit flat and one dimensional. There simply wasn't enough characterization for any of the them, which was one of the reasons why I couldn't truly connect to the story.The other fact, though not necessarily a bad thing, was that there was no romance. Just a forewarning, because it was kind of breath of fresh air for me. The story is mainly centered around the nightmares and its adventures, lab and the characters as a group. Dreamfall has short chapters and is very easy and fast read. It was pretty enjoyable overall, but nothing especially stood out for me. I'd recommend this book if you want to read something entertaining but average set in (I guess) contemporary world with some science fiction elements, with no romance and a few creepy scenes. \n\u201cA chill goes through me when I understand what he said.

This book was a total mindfuck!!!From the beginning till the end, it will make you guess who is who and what is what...There are so many things I loved about this book! Like really loved!!!1. The plot because its so freaking awesome!!!2. The different psychological illnesses and conditions used by the author to make the different characters' personality. 3. How the author combined realism and fantasy. Trust me only few can managed to create a novel and this book managed to combine the two and ends up to being great4. The freaking plot twist people! It was very unexpected and jaw dropping! 5. Its creepy, weird and surrealistic. But sooo sooo good!!!I honestly adored this book. It was very informative, imaginative and just... brilliant. Honestly, I'm great in guessing about what's gonna happen next or what plot twist will happen. But this book... I don't really know what will happen. I didn't have a single clue about what will happen in every chapter, its like I'm totally blindsided; and that people, is the reason I absolutely loved this book!Every scene will take you by surprise, it will make you guess what will happen next then once you've think of a possible explanation, it will shock you because it'll turn out to be wrong and you'll realize that there is more than meets the eye. OMG!!!Reading this thrilled, shocked, intrigued, and left me wondering what the fuck is going to happen next. It was a cliffhanger but it still worth the wait...

And between the three of them, we get quite a story. There's not much I can say without spoilers, so just know that it's imaginative and eerie and maybe scary for some and absolutely delicious.

However, the equipment hooked up to the teens ends up malfunctioning during the trial and the seven of them fall into comas\u2014or at least, that\u2019s what it looks like to the researchers overseeing the project. In reality though, they\u2019re all dreaming, trapped in one nightmare together. Worse, they\u2019re being hunted by their deepest fears come to life, and in this dream you\u2019ll never wake up if you die.Unfortunately, books like this one remind me of why most YA horror doesn\u2019t work for me these days. As much as I wanted to like it because of its compelling blurb, Dreamfall reads like a made-for-TV movie complete with all the thriller clich\u00e9s and teen drama archetypes. What makes this even more of a shame is that I sense a sincere attempt from the author to make her cast diverse, but none of it really matters in the end because most of the characters are so easily forgotten and expendable. The multi-narrator format that was intended to give us a well-rounded picture of everyone also meant the focus was diluted and no one stood out, and from there things went downhill. After all, I can\u2019t bring myself to enjoy a story unless I first care about the people involved; without that as a basic foundation, everything else just becomes an empty experience.Still, I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I hated the book, because at the very least the plot was fast-paced and fun. However, apart from maybe that twist ending, Dreamfall was entirely unmemorable. It\u2019s only been a day since I finished the book and I\u2019ve already forgotten half the characters\u2019 names, so I very much doubt I\u2019ll be continuing with this series despite things finally getting interesting in the last couple chapters.

I've seen it listed as YA horror, YA fantasy, YA science fiction and I've also seen it referred to as a psychological thriller. IMO it is not science fiction, fantasy or a psychological thriller. I guess it could be YA horror. The book starts off feeling like our world. The only difference being the experiment and the severe insomnia experienced by the teens. But then there is also the dream/scary aspect.The narrators are Cata, Jaime and Fergus. Cata is a 16 year old girl with insomnia and PTSD. Jaime is a premed student observing the sleep experiment. Fergus is a boy with insomnia. Both Cata and Fergus are part of the experiment.The book is about seven teens between 13-19 who all suffer from chronic insomnia. They are undergoing a new electroconvulsive technology to try to cure them. I found the idea of the experiment to be very interesting.I am a fan of the author's Revenants series. So I knew that I wanted to read this book. It started off well. I loved the idea of teens undergoing an experiment to try to cure their insomnia. I actually wish that this was the focus of the book (curing the insomnia). But something goes wrong with the experiments and the dreams the kids experience become the focus of the book.The dreams are supposed to be scary. There are creatures and other scary stuff in them. All the kids end up in each other's dreams. Unfortunately this aspect of the book was not for me at all and I ended up skimming a lot of the dreams. I would have liked more of an explanation as to why this was happening (I guess this will be examined more fully in the next book).What I did love was everything to do with the doctors and the experiment. We get to learn about this from Jaime's POV. I found Jaime's chapters to be very strong and I absolutely loved his/her POV. Apparently we are not supposed to know whether Jaime is a boy or girl (the author discusses this in the acknowledgements). It honestly never occurred to me that Jaime wasn't a girl. I've never seen that spelling for a boy and the character just felt like a girl to me. But apparently half of the people assume that Jaime is a girl and the other half assume that Jaime is a boy. And the author purposely left it ambiguous.The book has a cliffhanger ending and it was a good one. But overall I just didn't enjoy the dreams.Thanks to edelweiss and HarperTeen for allowing me to read this book!"}, {"userName": "\u2728 Kaira \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41536721-kaira", "userReview": "Plot - 5Characters - 4Writing style - 4Romance - 5In which a group of sleep-deprived teenagers got stuck in their nightmares together. This is one of the creepiest books I've ever read, no joke. I can't even read this when I am alone because it gives me chills. Plot - hands down to the author for this. It is utterly genius. This is the type of novel you want your friends to talk about when alone in the dark. The plot twists seriously got me, it's been ages since I was actually shook from the revelation. Man, the last 20 pages were amazing! Writing style - fast paced although there's some boring moments. Right from the page 1, this whole thing got me hooked. Read it in one sitting. Characters - I love them all, okay? Especially the flirt even though the revelation about him. I just wish we get to know more of their backstory and the messages about their nightmares. Romance - minimal romance which is okay for me since the plot was really just amazing. Although I have to be honest, at first, I kinda despite the whole romance because all they do were flirt to each other instead of really paying attention on how to survive this shit. Spoiler: It kinda intrigue me that Sinclair is a psycho but I just hope he'll remain his romance with Cats although I don't think that's possible. Since the day one, I already have a feeling CAta is gonna end up with Fergus which is kinda okay with me because they're cute together. However, isn't it a bit, I don't know, awkward that they only ended up together because they have no choice? Fergus' romantic interest in book 1 was actually imaginary while Sinclair was a psychopath which means he'll probably kill them in the sequel."}, {"userName": "noor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor", "userReview": "4.5 STARSWHAT!????

Unfortunately, these meagre words are going to have to do. This book perfectly achieved its purpose: it creeped me out. This is honestly the first book to ever do that to me. Ever. I am trying to seem more macho than I am, but it honestly takes a lot to actually scare me in books. Even if a book is well-written and engaging, there is always a distance between me and the story that stops me from getting creeped out. It is not real - so it doesn\u2019t scare me. Plum managed to completely erase that barrier though. I do not know how she did it but she managed to capture that surreal feeling of dreaming, of having a nightmare, and make it come alive on the page. The whole book felt like one of those dreams where you know you are dreaming and that the events of the dream are unrealistic nonsense\u2026 but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You have no control. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s got that awful nauseous quality to it and Plum got that feeling on the page perfectly. I was engaged the whole time. The plot had me salivating for the next page. I wanted more. I need more; more answers, more of the characters. I wanted to know what was happening and why. It was absolutely brilliant in that sense. I could not put it down.I also adored the characters. All of them. They were all rich and complex. I loved that they were realistically flawed. Some of them were rude or had a quick temper but it was done it a way that did not make them unlikable, just more human. Their interactions were fascinated and I liked that none of them developed a romance. It would have been so unrealistic. The diversity was so rich and incredibly written. All of the main characters suffered from some sort of neurodiverse condition/s like (PTSD, OCD, depression, narcolepsy) which caused chronic insomnia. I have never read a book with about a character with a sleep disorder before, let alone an entire cast, and I thought that added another layer to the story so effortlessly. There was also a lot of racial diversity so yay for that. My favourite part of all of this was definitely how George called out the other characters when they said judgemental comments. I highlighted so much of her dialogue! I also have to say that the multiple perspectives were incredibly well written. I had no problems distinguishing the different voices and enjoyed all of them equally. Overall?I adored this book and would happily recommend it with all my heart. It was so, so engaging and thrilling. I was sucked into this world and could not stop flipping the pages to see what would happen next. It was so addictive! The cast was also amazing. There was not a single POV I did not enjoy and I felt that all of the characters were fleshed out and realistically flawed, complex characters.

I went from \"hmm I am not sure about this\" to \"need book two NOW, please and thank you\" pretty quickly. It was a slow start- and kind of weird, if I am being honest. I also wasn't sure about the likelihood that parents would sign their kids up for this with it being so unknown, but I guess if you're desperate... I certainly can't judge. The science part of it I didn't fully get- nor do I know if I was supposed to, but it didn't really matter. All that matters is that the author made clear that the stakes are very, very high. This could result in death, this was no joke.The characters were great too, and we got to see inside their minds so much while they were \"dreaming\". And I don't want to say a ton, because I am afraid that I'd spoil stuff, but it was a very unique way to get to know characters. There was some unbelivibility, especially when it came to letting the random med student stay in the room when stuff started going haywire. But, even though it was a little \"off\", her POV was essential, so it didn't bother me. There were some amazing twists too that I definitely hadn't seen coming, and the book kept me guessing the whole time. I am seriously excited for the second book, because I have no idea what the endgame is and I love that! Bottom Line: After a slightly shaky start, I got really, really hooked on this book.

But this book was just...it had such a fascinating premise and it executed it brilliantly in parts (which is somehow how I actually got through a good deal of this book), but there were so many negatives that I couldn't convince my book gut to go with anything else. There's something I love about a good group horror novel. Much of Laurie Faria's Stolarz's horror novels (the only ones that so far have enthralled and not completely traumatized me) are group narration novels in the horror category. This story was pitched as sci-fi horror, and while it didn't say in the summary, I was delighted to find this was a group narration novel. The more, the merrier!Except...it wasn't merry. I didn't connect with literally any character. I thought Cata wasn't horrible, but I mean, I still didn't really enjoy her as much as I should with her being lead person. The only person I actually enjoyed was Jaime and she wasn't even in the creepy Dreamfall!\u00a0Some of the characters were just upsetting as well. One character was mean for literally no reason. They gave him some excuses, but then he routinely said problematic things and constantly made fun of someone. I literally cringed at most of the things that he said.\u00a0Dreamfall was interesting for a bit, but then at some point, it just stopped. It felt like there was too much of a pattern to it, and the things that were supposed to be scary just fell flat to me. It wasn't interesting anymore, and I never felt the tension that I needed to be. When a character died, I was just like, oh, okay. OH, OKAY? How is that a valid response?\u00a0I somehow got through a good half of this because I really wanted to love the concept, but I was routinely disappointed by the characters and the lack of scary, tense plot. I did skim the rest of it, and the twists and turns that were revealed, again, just made me go, eh. Again, it just sounded SO intriguing, but the characters really pulled it down.

I pre-ordered this book back before it came out. It was delivered on release day..... And then what do I do? I sit on it forever and a day. So anyways. I've been having an awful time getting Into any books. I finally found a couple here and there. A sci-fi, or a fantasy. But even some of the ones everyone's been talking about and into, I just can't seem to get to hold my attention.I've read 2 books. And started and stopped about 6 this past month. It's been brutal. And I've been kinda antsy finding something that does it for me (and it's not like these books I try are boring either. I just can't get myself to enjoy them)So back to this book. I finally decided last night that I'm still in a fantasy mood (particularly YA)So I'm looking through my shelves and piles of books. And nothing is catching or pulling at my attention.And I just happen to spot Dreamfall. I can't remember at all what the book's about. But I love Amy Plum, which drove me to pre-order the book to begin with.So I head off to bed (I'm an insufferable insomniac. So the start of bed time for me is around 1 or 2 am. 1 in this case.)Ironic I know, considering what this book is about (It was not lost on me y'all. Not one bit har har)And for once, I start this book and immediately it catches my interest. So fast forward 4 hours. And it's 5 am now.... blurry eyed, about to pass out where I'm sitting up in bed, I turn to the last page and HOLY FREAKING JESUS ON A FREAKING CRACKER!!!!!Like my mind is so completely blown and I have no words, and I'm trying to be as quite in my freaking out as I can, so I don't wake everyone plus my cats up in the house. But I'm silently rocking, mouth open, staring down at this mind bomb of a book.... And trying to figure out if I missed something somehow, because there is no possible way that was the actual end to the book. Like there's got to be a epilogue to the epilogue..... And scouring the internet to find out if this book is going to be a series, because I cannot deal with that ending at all haha. (FYI I believe I figured out that this book is going to be a duology)But let me just say. As crazy that all wound up being..... I loved the book from start to horribly fantastic cliffy end hahaThis book took me on such a roller coaster and I loved it so so much.It's one of those books that leaves you guessing, and just when you get it all figured out.... BOOM!! Something changes, and you're left speculating all over again.But that was the fun part of the book. Never knowing who or what was going to be the bad guy. Or what was real and what was not.I also loved how Amy split this book into the 3 POV's. I always get a little worried when there's more than 2. Books can get messy and confusing when you try to show too many angles.But in this case, it added so much more depth and understanding to the story.The characters grew on me so fast, and I found myself rooting for all of them, and crushed by particular developments concerning a few of them too.But guy! Guys! I had something about the characters pegged so well. And OMG I almost freaked out when I found out I was right.Like you Go Amy Plum! Giving us such unique and interesting characters.This book was a terrifying, and even at times a freaky read. And exactly what I needed in my time of bookish need.Plus it gave me a chance to stretch out all those book mojo powers of mine and take a crack at the mystery. And let me tell you. I was spot on a few times. And other times I was just barely brushing on being on the right track. while a few I was completely not expecting.This book had great in-depth characters that you start to feel and fall for so whole heatedly.

La historia sonaba muy interesante pues supuestamente es un libro perfecto para fans de \"Pesadilla en Calle del Infierno\" y \"Matrix\". El planteamiento es bueno y, de hecho, inicia con una buena secuencia de terror en la que aparece un personaje descarnado persiguiendo a una chica, pero despu\u00e9s de eso, todo es tedio interminable.Mi mayor problema con este libro es que hay demasiados personajes y que no conect\u00e9 con ninguno. Adem\u00e1s, al leerlos, se sienten escritos por una persona mayor que piensa que as\u00ed suenan los j\u00f3venes, pero realmente nadie en la vida real act\u00faa as\u00ed o dice eso. \u00bfNo s\u00e9 si me explico? No le estoy diciendo chavoruca a la autora ni nada, pero la verdad sus personajes s\u00ed son bastante acartonados. Rescato algunos de los sue\u00f1os que tienen descripciones grotescas, creo, que si en vez de jugar con tantas ideas se hubiera decantado s\u00f3lo por una, esta historia hubiera mejorado significativamente.

I really enjoyed her Die for Me series and loved her After the End series and this sounded right up my alley!! This focuses on a group of teenagers who are brought together because they all suffer the same thing... insomnia. Each of them have their other problems, but insomnia is why they are here. They agree to take part in an experimental trial, that sees them being put into a sleep state and their brain being gently pulsed with electricity to help them sleep. But something goes wrong with the trial and now all the teens are stuck in a shared dream world, with no recollection of how they got there or how to leave. Every 20 mins, they are sucked into one of their nightmares, with creatures and things better left in the imagination. What happens if you get hurt here? Can they get out with their sanity?So, this pretty much rocked!! I remember watching a Nightmare on Elm Street when I was young and it absolutely terrifying me. The idea of being stuck in nightmare after nightmare was even worse! The poor kids, they went from dream to dream with only about 20 mins between them. Starting off they are by themselves but eventually they find each other and I loved it. It was like all your worst things come to life!!! *Shudder* The author really put a lot of effort into the details and it showed. Each world/situation they went into was worse as they went along!!The characters were all well written. Each of them have a story to tell and we get to see some of them unravel throughout. Fergus, BethAnn, George, Remi, Sinclair, Ant and Cata are all intriguing and extraordinary characters, that you can't help but like and root for. We see some of the chapters from each of their POVs and it helped create a bond. I'm already so excited to read the conclusion of this and see what happens these awesome characters, even though this isn't out yet!! Anyway, this was an intense, scary and emotional read. I loved reading about the characters, but I also loved reading the \"behind the scenes\" parts in the lab. The author must have done a lot of research into insomnia and sleep studies because the detail in the book was interesting and intriguing. I googled some of the conditions the characters had because I didn't know what some of them were. The nightmare realm was also amazing. The author created some horrifying situations that will give me nightmares ;) Brilliantly written and developed, I can't recommend this enough. I so want to see this as a movie, though I'd be hiding behind my hands for most of it, lol."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68305370-kayla", "userReview": "Dreamfall by Amy PlumTeens that suffer from a illness that makes it impossible for them to sleep without having nightmares have been moved to a clinic where doctors say that they have a cure. when the cure goes wrong and the teens are stuck in their nightmares and have no way out, they must try to face their darkest nightmares.CHARACTERS-I loved these cast of characters.

Dreamfall follows seven teenagers who have signed up for an experimental procedure to help cure their insomnia. But when a small earthquake destroys the lab equipment, the teenagers are catapulted into a shared dream world where their worst nightmares come to life.What's interesting about Dreamfall is that it is partly told through the perspective of Jamie, a Yale premed student documenting the experiment for her thesis. This was an interesting stylistic choice as it gave us the opportunity to notice what was happening outside the dreamworld. The story is also comprised of two other perspectives - two of the teens in the experiment.The flaw of the story is that, at the beginning, it's a bit difficult to keep track of each of the seven teens in the experiment. It takes a little while to adjust to and keep track of all the characters. Additionally, some of the characterization fell a bit flat. Besides having very intriguing backstories, there really wasn't much personality or depth to the seven teens involved in the experiment. Take away the backstories and it would almost feel like they were all the same person. This probably helps explain why it is so hard to keep track of them in the beginning.In the end, while not perfect, this is a book that is unlike anything else in young adult literature. It is pack filled of twists and turns and a unique concept. It's almost reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode and the movie Inception."}, {"userName": "Aline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25210404-aline", "userReview": "DreamFall by Amy Plum *4.5 stars* 12/29/2017. ..\"No one could possibly understand unless they had a sleep disorder themselves. They wouldn't know that being so tired during the day that you can barely function and then wide-awake at night can make you crazy. Literally.\"This phrase from the book defines how I feel every time someone tells me to just close my eyes simply sleep. News for you, it is not that easy. I recently experienced being awake for 40 hours without a drop of sleepiness in me. And reading this book, I learned the extension of this kind of disorder and others that I had no knowledge.DreamFall called my attention right away. Just being from Amy Plum is already a plus, but the conception behind this book is really interesting. The book is very well written, the plot development is great and the pace is fast. Plum found a way to explain disorders like Insomnia and Narcolepsy through Jamie\u2019s POV without sounding too scientific and complicated to us, mere mortals. I really liked the alternative POV\u2019 between Cata and Jamie, one from a character inside of the dream, and another from a character outside of the dream. On the other hand, I found Fergus POV unnecessary and I found very similar to Cata\u2019s. On this book, seven people under twenty years old are part of an experiment to cure their insomnia, but something goes wrong and they stay trapped inside of many of their own nightmares. I liked the variety on the nightmares, they were very distinguished from one another. There was a twist at the end, I honestly didn't see it coming as I was looking into another direction. There are some discussions from reviewers involving Jaimie since we don't know if female or male, I don't know why but I always assumed Jaimie was a male, and I guess we will only know on the next book, seems like the author did leave this reference out on purpose. My guess is that Jamie will be the big twist on the sequel. Another discussion is why a pre-med like Jaimie seemed to noticed more than experienced doctors, and I would like to remind that Jaimie job there was to observe the subjects, meaning he/she was paying closer attention to minimum details that the doctors could oversee regarding all the chaos happening on that lab. I have a theory about one of the subjects but I can't say without spoiling something important. And can I say something about the cover ? It is perfect, it has everything to do with the book, I loved it! I really enjoyed this book.

With such an intriguing premise, it's not surprising just how interesting the book actually is. Cata is an insomniac who takes part in a new experimental procedure believed to be the cure for Insomnia. But things go awry when the machine experiences a failure and Cata and some other teens-Fergus, BethAnn, George(short for Georgina), Remi, Sinclair and Ant.- are plunged into a dreamworld made of their own personal nightmares. Its just as good as it sounds, it was highly entertaining to read about their ordeals and adventures. I love thrilling intense books and Dreamfall is certainly that and more. The different POV's of the many characters are very illuminating, It's easier to get a clearer picture of the whole scenario and it definitely made the characters more relatable.  There are a lot of interesting stuff that happened in it to make Dreamfall very memorable such as a lake full of mucus inhabited by a bluish Gollum(Yes, That Gollum. My Preciousssssss), surviving a genocidal environment, being in a coffin with dead rotten bodies, facing moving murderous statues and creepy red eyed zombie monks and many more great scenes. The Dream world is a very brilliant original idea that made it easier to enjoy reading the book. Filled with so many unexpected twists and turns, Dreamfall is an exciting thrilling ride that every reader has to enjoy.Amy Plum has crafted a masterpiece. After that ending, I certainly wait to read more books in this series.P.S: These might inspire nightmares for you, BEWARE!!!!"}, {"userName": "Cindy \u2729\u263d Savage Queen \u2654", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222333-cindy-savage-queen", "userReview": "So this is said to be  Nightmare on Elm Street  meets  The Matrix And I am down for that!
