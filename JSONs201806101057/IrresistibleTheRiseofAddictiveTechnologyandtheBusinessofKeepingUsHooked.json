Can you imagine the outcry if religious leaders refused to let their children practice religion? Many experts both within and beyond the world of tech have shared similar perspectives with me. Several video game designers told me they avoided the notoriously addictive game World of Warcraft; an exercise addiction psychologist called fitness watches dangerous\u2014\u201cthe dumbest things in the world\u201d\u2014and swore she\u2019d never buy one; and the founder of an Internet addiction clinic told me she avoids gadgets newer than three years old. She has never used her phone\u2019s ringer, and deliberately \u201cmisplaces\u201d her phone so she isn\u2019t tempted to check her email. (I spent two months trying to reach her by email, and succeeded only when she happened to pick up her office landline.) Her favorite computer game is Myst, released in 1993 when computers were still too clunky to handle video graphics. The only reason she was willing to play Myst, she told me, was because her computer froze every half hour and took forever to reboot. (c)Q: Instagram, like so many other social media platforms, is bottomless. Facebook has an endless feed; Netflix automatically moves on to the next episode in a series; Tinder encourages users to keep swiping in search of a better option. Users benefit from these apps and websites, but also struggle to use them in moderation. According to Tristan Harris, a \u201cdesign ethicist,\u201d the problem isn\u2019t that people lack willpower; it\u2019s that \u201cthere are a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job it is to break down the self-regulation you have.\u201d (c)Q: In a 1990 editorial in the British Journal of Addiction, a psychiatrist named Isaac Marks claimed that, \u201cLife is a series of addictions and without them we die. (c)Q: Addiction, to Peele, is \u201can extreme, dysfunctional attachment to an experience that is acutely harmful to a person, but that is an essential part of the person\u2019s ecology and that the person cannot relinquish.\u201d (c)Q: In 1984, Alexey Pajitnov was working at a computer lab at the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. Many of the lab\u2019s scientists worked on side projects, and Pajitnov began working on a video game. The game borrowed from tennis and a version of four-piece dominoes called tetrominoes, so Pajitnov combined those words to form the name Tetris. Pajitnov worked on Tetris for much longer than he planned because he couldn\u2019t stop playing the game...One satisfying feature of the game is the sense that you\u2019re building something\u2014that your efforts produce a pleasing tower of colored bricks. \u201cYou have the chaos coming as random pieces, and your job is to put them in order,\u201d Pajitnov said. \u201cBut just as you construct the perfect line, it disappears. All that remains is what you fail to complete.\u201d Mikhail Kulagin, Pajitnov\u2019s friend and a fellow programmer, remembers feeling a strong drive to fix his mistakes. \u201cTetris is a game with a very strong negative motivation. You never see what you have done very well, and your mistakes are seen on the screen. And you always want to correct them.\u201d Pajitnov agreed. \u201cWhat hits your eyes are your ugly mistakes. And that drives you to fix them all the time.\u201d The game allows you the brief thrill of seeing your completed lines flash before they disappear, leaving only your mistakes. So you begin again, and try to complete another line as the game speeds up and your fingers are forced to dance across the controls more quickly.Pajitnov and Kulagin were driven by this sense of mastery, which turns out to be deeply motivating. (c)Q: Other studies have shown that we\u2019re also driven to build more Legos when the completed products\u2014the fruits of our Lego-building labor\u2014are stacked up in front of us, rather than removed as soon as they\u2019re completed.  The sense of creating something that requires labor and effort and expertise is a major force behind addictive acts that might otherwise lose their sheen over time. It also highlights an insidious difference between substance addiction and behavioral addiction: where substance addictions are nakedly destructive, many behavioral addictions are quietly destructive acts wrapped in cloaks of creation. The illusion of progress will sustain you as you achieve high scores or acquire more followers or spend more time at work, and so you\u2019ll struggle ever harder to shake the need to continue. (c)Q: During the 1990s, psychologist Paco Underhill famously watched thousands of hours of retail store security camera footage. The cameras captured all sorts of shopping behavior, most of it mundane but some of it interesting and useful to the store owners who asked Underhill for help. One of Underhill\u2019s most famous observations was the so-called butt-brush effect. In cluttered stores, where merchandise racks are placed only a few feet apart, customers are forced to squeeze past one another. Underhill\u2019s footage captured hundreds of these unintentional butt-brushes, and he noticed an interesting pattern of behavior: as soon as women, and to a lesser extent men, were brushed, they tended to stop browsing and often left the store empty-handed. Butt-brushes were costing stores a lot of money, so he sent a team to investigate why. Were customers abandoning the store as an act of protest? Were they disgusted by the idea of touching a stranger? In fact, customers had absolutely no idea they were reacting to butt-brushes at all. They acknowledged leaving the store, but almost always said it had nothing to do with the presence of other shoppers. Sometimes they cobbled together good reasons for leaving\u2014they were late for a meeting or needed to collect their kids from school\u2014but the pattern was just too strong to deny. What Underhill had identified was a stopping rule\u2014a cue that guided customers to stop shopping. The rule wasn\u2019t something those customers could explain, but it was there, guiding their behavior all the same. (c)Q: Zeigarnik\u2019s career took off eventually, but her academic life was just as turbulent as her personal life. She was forced to write three doctoral dissertations after the Soviet authorities refused to recognize her first dissertation, and her second was stolen. She had copies of the second dissertation, but was forced to destroy them when she feared that the thief might publish her work and accuse her of plagiarism. For almost thirty years, Zeigarnik wandered in academic purgatory before completing her third dissertation and joining Moscow State University as a psychology professor in 1965. She was elected chair of the department two years later, and held that position for the next two decades, until her death. With mountainous talent and dogged determination, Zeigarnik ensured that the cliffhanger ultimately resolved in her favor. (c)Q: \u201cA few years ago, I hired a girl to slap me in the face every time I went on Facebook.\u201d That worked well, for a while, ... (c)Q: When you set your emails to auto-delete or your office to disappear, you\u2019re acknowledging that you\u2019re a different person when you\u2019re tempted to check your email or work late. You may be an adult now, but this future version of you is more like a child. The best way to wrest control from your childish future self is to act while you\u2019re still an adult\u2014to design a world that coaxes, cajoles, or even compels your future-self to do the right thing. An alarm clock called Sn\u016azNL\u016az illustrates this idea beautifully. Sn\u016azNL\u016az is wirelessly connected to your bank account. Every time you hit the snooze button, it automatically deducts a preset sum and donates it to a charity you abhor. Support the Democratic Party? Hit snooze and you\u2019ll donate ten dollars to the G.O.P. Support the Republican Party, and you\u2019ll donate to the Democratic Party. These donations are your present self\u2019s way of keeping your future self in line. (c)Q: Behavioral architecture acknowledges that you can\u2019t avoid temptation completely. Instead of abstinence and avoidance, many solutions come in the form of tools designed to blunt the psychological immediacy of addictive experiences. Benjamin Grosser, a web developer, devised one of these clever tools. Grosser explains on his website:The Facebook interface is filled with numbers. These numbers, or metrics, measure and present our social value and activity, enumerating friends, likes, comments, and more. Facebook Demetricator is a web browser add-on that hides these metrics. No longer is the focus on how many friends you have or on how much they like your status, but on who they are and what they said. Friend counts disappear. \u201c16 people like this\u201d becomes \u201cpeople like this.\u201d Through changes like these, Demetricator invites Facebook\u2019s users to try the system without the numbers, to see how their experience is changed by their absence. With this work I aim to disrupt the prescribed sociality these metrics produce, enabling a network society that isn\u2019t dependent on quantification. (c)Q: People flock when you turn a mundane experience into a game. (c)Q: There are two ways to approach behavioral addictions: eliminate them or harness them. Elimination was the subject of the first eleven chapters of Irresistible, but\u2014just as DDB did in Stockholm\u2014it\u2019s possible to channel the forces that drive harmful behavioral addiction for the good. The human tendencies that enslave us to smartphones, tablets, and video games also prepare us to do good: to eat better, exercise more, work smarter, behave more generously, and save more money. To be sure, there\u2019s a fine line between behavioral addictions and helpful habits, and it\u2019s important to keep that line in mind. The same Fitbit that fuels exercise addiction and eating disorders in some people pushes others to leave the couch behind during an hour of exercise. Addictive levers work by boosting motivation, so if your motivation is already high there\u2019s a good chance those levers will compromise your well-being. If you\u2019re a couch potato who hates to exercise, a dose of motivation can only help.

There are some fun cocktail-party facts and some reasonable suggestions for changing your own habits, which are fine as \"hey, why not try it, it might work for you.\"It's just not much good as \"scientific evidence proves that...\"[For example: Experimental group improved by a \"dramatic\" 40%, but control group improved by only a \"paltry\" 30%! ... which actually meant that group A improved by 5 points out of 50, and B by 3 points out of 50! ... which is probably a statistical fluke, and even if not, it's certainly not a scientifically interesting difference! Argh.]Also, it's kinda funny that most of the book warns against the dangers of overusing artificial metrics. Then, the last chapter suggests fixing our problems with gamification... i.e. artificial over-reliance on metrics.But again, good fodder for suggesting new approaches. I'd like to apply a couple of these ideas in my teaching, if I can figure out how.Fun facts:* Steve Jobs and other tech titans don't allow their kids to play with the same tech (iPads etc) that they push on everyone else.* Relief vs. reward: addictions involve positive reinforcement (a reward you'll enjoy if you do X), while obsessions and compulsions involve negative reinforcement (if you do X, you'll be relieved of the pressure to do it). Personally I think a lot of marketing etc. is more about relief than reward: it's not that you'll actually *enjoy* having this new product, but rather that you'll buy it to *stop feeling bad* that other people have it and you don't. Same with trying to \"get the complete set\" or rack up all the points in a game: it's not that *having* 100% completion is fun, but that *not having* it feels bad.* Check out the Internet Addiction Test. Many items seem harmless alone, but it's disconcerting once you see how many of them stack up.* \"Addiction\" originally meant becoming a slave to work off a debt you can't pay, back in ancient Rome. Only later did it mean other kinds of tough-to-break bonds.* Addictions are strongly tied to the setting/context/environment, not just the behavior itself. Scientists caused a caged monkey to get addicted to pressing a bar; it returned to behaving like a normal monkey when it \"detoxed\" outside the cage; but when put back it, it'd return to the frantic addictive behavior. So... put physical and psychological distance between yourself and the original setting when you try to break an addictive behavior.* Addictions could be thought of as a hijacking of brain systems meant for good purposes: we've evolved ways to persist in difficult-but-important things (like raising kids), but sometimes these mental systems end up helping us persist in bad things instead.* Adolescence and early adulthood are high-risk periods for addiction: young folks have many new responsibilities but haven't yet built up the coping skills, social support networks, and other healthy ways to deal with hardships. So, try to help your kids build resilience before and during the teen years.* Wanting vs liking (perhaps related to relief vs reward?): It's easy to disrupt \"liking\" an addictive behavior, but once the \"want\" is established it is MUCH harder to disrupt. You can crave something, even if you don't enjoy it when you have it.* \"Don't break the streak\" is a nice motivator---until you overdo it, like runners who try to keep up an unbroken streak of running every day for decades, even when they're sick or injured. The longer your streak, the more willing you are to go to extremes to keep it up. (I wonder: What if these runners didn't reward themselves for unbroken streaks longer than, say, a month? After a month, you start on the next 1-month streak, and just try to rack up many months, whether or not they are continuous. Then if you're sick, no worries, you can take a needed rest day, because it won't break your score by too much...) Also, games like FarmVille apparently use this streak-mentality to make money: if you miss a day, you can pay them (real money) to \"revert the damage\" to the crops you didn't water yesterday or whatever. So, they feed an unhealthy obsession *and* make money off of you: truly predatory!* The Dollar Auction Game: a brilliant little trick. Sounds like it'd be fun to expose my statistician colleagues to this and see what happens. Also apparently a good way to raise money for charity if you bid off something larger like $20 instead.* The Zone of Proximal Development: things you can't do at all are too hard; things you can do alone may be boring; but you learn a lot on the things you can just barely do with a little bit of help. Similar to the state of Flow, when your skill level is appropriate for the task's challenge level. (Right now, my PhD thesis is *not* in either of these states :P but I hope to get back in there soon!) One problem is that games, email, and other electronic distractions are designed to keep you in flow... so, one solution is to disrupt that flow artificially. Use old hardware which makes the experience slow and clunky. Don't keep your smartphone handy at all times. [Are there other suggestions out there?]* Near-wins can be more addictive than genuine wins. In a game of skill, near-wins do legitimately signal that you're almost there, you can nearly do it, just try a little harder next time! But games of luck hijack this too and suck us into spending more time on something useless or harmful (like casino games or lotteries designed to give results that look *almost* like a win. You think to yourself: I got 4 in a row and would have won if it'd just had that 5th one---let me try again!)* Sometimes the hard problem isn't knowing how to start, but how *not to stop.* When you want to build a new habit like regular exercise or healthier eating, it's easy enough to do it for one day, but what are your (unconscious) \"stopping rules\" that make you fall off the bandwagon? (No good answers here, sadly.)* The Zeigarnik Effect: people hate cliffhangers, and they'll better remember unresolved tasks than resolved ones. (See for example the vitriol around the waiting times between Game Of Thrones books...) I wonder: Could we use the Zeigarnik Effect in teaching/education somehow? Assign in-class problems near the end of lecture, and *don't* allow quite enough time to finish, with the hope that the students will mull over the problem outside of class?* Catherine Steiner-Adair's work on parenting: Don't be scary (rigid), crazy (overreacting), or clueless (about your kids' lives, modern tech, etc.)* Self-determination theory: focuses on 3 basic human needs, for autonomy (I'm in control of my own life), competence (I can overcome external challenges and experience mastery), and relatedness (bonds with family & friends). (Again, the process of getting a PhD really dampens down all 3 of these needs a lot of time :P ...)* Don't try to *drop* old bad habits, but *replace* them with better new ones. (So what are some good examples? Not many actual suggestions here.) Or, when resisting something, instead of saying you *can't* do it, say you *don't*: you're not playing the martyr who is forbidden by external forces, but the autonomous person of integrity who chose to take this stand.* Daimler's office emails are set to delete when the employee is on vacation, with an auto-reply message suggesting someone else who can help if the email is urgent. That sounds lovely, but also requires the whole company to buy-in; you'd probably just alienate everyone if you try this alone...* \"Don't Waste Your Money motivator\": set your goal and set aside money every week as you work towards it. If you fail, donate the money to someplace you don't support: an opposing political party or a frivolous cause. But if you succeed, take the money out and spend it \"relationally\"---a meal with friends, a gift for family, etc.---as a double-benefit reward.* Planning fallacy: When wondering whether to take up a new activity, ask yourself if you can afford to do it *today*. We tend to overestimate how much time we can free up later, but we're better if we extrapolate from the amount of time we have today.* Just Press Play: gamified educational environment. Sounds like it's not just gamifying specific computerized tasks, like assigning points and badges for online math exercises... but rather, the offline experience is gamified too, and in particular there are collaborative aspects. There's a \"quest\" which promises a reward to the entire freshman class if over 90% of them pass a certain difficult required course... so they found students were motivated to help each other, even getting help from junior and senior students. Maybe it's worth trying to gamify useful study habits like this.Quotes:* p.3: \"According to Tristan Harris, a 'design ethicist,' the problem isn't that people lack willpower; it's that 'there are a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job it is to break down the self-regulation you have.'\"* p.40, 229, 232, 243: several takes on the idea that kids learn empathy, understanding, and other parts of human interaction by interacting face-to-face. It can be much harder to learn these things when you interact so much by texting, posting on Facebook, etc.---you don't immediately see the impact that your words have on another person.* p.106: \"...it's hard not to wonder whether major life goals are by their nature a major source of frustration. Either you endure the anti-climax of succeeding, or you endure the disappointment of failing.\" Even people who reach incredible successes (like breaking a world record in sports) don't savor the success---they just want to move on to the next goal.* p.114: \"Counting steps and calories doesn't actually help us lose weight; it just makes us more compulsive. We become less intuitive about our physical activity and eating.\" (quote from Leslie Sim)* p.117: \"When you approach life as a sequence of milestones to be achieved, you exist 'in a state of near-continuous failure.' Almost all the time, by definition, you're not at the place you've defined as embodying accomplishment or success. And should you get there, you'll find you've lost the very thing that gave you a sense of purpose---so you'll formulate a new goal and start again.\" (quote by Oliver Burkeman, partly quoting Scott Adams) ... I worry this applies to tenure in academia. I know some folks who sacrificed a lot because they *felt driven* to reach tenure; but in the end, they don't actually *savor the accomplishment* of being tenured. When are those sacrifices worthwhile? Apparently Adams suggests replacing major goals (you get there or you don't) with \"systems,\" i.e. \"something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.\" For him it's creating something small on a daily basis, like a daily cartooning or writing session: \"a steadier stream of low-grade highs... guides to a fulfilling life, day by day...\" For me, this sounds like my project to read one of my grandpa's philosophy books each year---it's about the journey of *reading* itself, not about the destination of *having read* them all.* p.229: \"Remember: once your cucumber brain has become pickled, it can never go back to being a cucumber.\" (quote from Hilarie Cash) ... Once you've been addicted and treated, you can't \"have just one more\" (smoke just one more cigarette, play just one more game of WoW) without massive risk of total relapse. Treatment doesn't erase the addiction and give you a fresh start, allowing moderation; it's most helpful if you avoid the bad thing completely."}, {"userName": "Canadian Reader", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader", "userReview": "I read as far as the fifth chapter in Alter's book and learned a few interesting things along the way. However, based on what I did read, I found the book's subtitle inaccurate. Huge amounts of the first four chapters are dedicated to substance and behavioural addictions, in general, not \"addictive technology\" per se. There was interesting information about the importance of context or environment in addiction. Alter provides the example of veterans of the Vietnam war, many of whom used heroin while overseas but who did not return to the U.S. addicted, as they had now been removed from the context, conditions, and associations in which the drug use occurred. There was also some interesting material about behaviours (including repetitive actions known scientifically as \"stereotypies\") that accompany methamphetamine addictions and dopamine medications prescribed for Parkinson's disease. Some Parkinson's patients actually hoard their meds and even up their doses to ride on the wave of euphoria.Alter writes well enough, mercifully resisting the temptation to describe the appearance or some idiosyncratic tic of the researchers he alludes to or quotes (so common in science and social science writing for a lay audience). He also refrains from supplying the often unnecessary \"comic relief\"used to jolly along nonfiction readers with short attention spans. In spite of the reasonably good writing, however, I just lost interest in the material. A fair bit of it I'd encountered before in other books or magazine feature articles, and when I got to a section about slot machines, my eyes were glazing over. I've never played the slots, so reading about them seemed like a very dull prospect.For me, the take away was that tech designers spend huge amounts of time and money to make users find devices irresistible. Many of these designers don't use the products they or their companies design or produce. They are well aware of the addictive potential in their creations. That being the case, they often set very strict limits on their children's use of technology."}, {"userName": "Michael Perkins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins", "userReview": "Having had a few days to think about the implications of this book, it rather confirms what some of us already know and most are in deep denial about-----social media is the realm of the shallow, the ill-informed and the lazy. Critical thinking skills not welcome. Learning and intellectual curiosity not welcome. Knowledge not required. Honesty and truth always in question. It is our brave new world's soma. It's the drug that does effect our brains and keep us addicted to nonsense and it's a huge waste of time. We do not know those people behind the avatars the way we'd like to think. At the end of the day they're fake when measured against the real world of friends, family, and actual life participation.===============Having just re-read this book, it strikes me as an excellent backgrounder to Infinite Jest. Wallace had it figured out. Addiction was not limited to substances such as drugs. It was much broader, with a strong behavioral element.\"Addiction is one of Wallace\u2019s most persistent themes. He sees the basic shape of it everywhere. Drugs, TV, movies, tennis, sex, house cleaning, grammar, you name it: everything is fair game for loops of idolatrous compulsion. Nothing is out of bounds. Anything can become an idol invested by your worship with a promise it cannot keep. Addiction is, for Wallace, a general name for all manner of head-imploding diseases.\"Miller, Adam S. The Gospel According to David Foster Wallace: Boredom and Addiction in an Age of Distraction============\"Maybe dullness is associated with psychic pain because something that\u2019s dull or opaque fails to provide enough stimulation to distract people from some other, deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient low-level way, and which most of us spend nearly all our time and energy to distract ourselves from feeling, or at least from feeling directly or with our full attention. \u2026 surely something must lie behind not just Muzak in dull or tedious places anymore but now also actual TV in waiting rooms, supermarkets\u2019 checkouts, airports\u2019 gates, SUVs\u2019 backseats. And iPhones. This terror of silence with nothing diverting to do. I can\u2019t think anyone really believes that today\u2019s so-called \u201cinformation society\u201d is just about information. Everyone knows it\u2019s about something else, way down.\" (The Pale King, David Foster Wallace)\"Distraction, rather than being occasional and derivative, becomes perpetual and primary. Rather than being a diversion from the main thing you do, it becomes the main thing you do. But once life is no longer conducted as an entertaining diversion for the head, the body is free to feel, think, and act.\"Miller, Adam S. (2016-02-25).

Rather, Alter parades psychological experiment after psychological experiment after psychological experiment, one after another, again and again, mice pressing levers to receive the orgasm drug, pigeons pecking buttons for food pellets, kittens kept in dark rooms before being put in cylinders with stripy patterns, and so on. The reader it seems, is left to draw her own conclusions.Each time one of these laboratory escapades comes close to being compelling in the context of digital media, Alter swerves away, as if it was his mission to avoid saying anything the least bit original or interesting. The worst instance is with the (very brief) discussion of pornography. In 320 pages of text--about addictive tech, remember--pornography is allocated exactly two pages. And what's worse is these two pages serve only to prop up a half-baked rehash of Freudian theories of repression, in this case, about inhabitants of States of conservative persuasion being more inclined to open their browser for purposes of self-abuse than the good people of, say, Vermont. No mention whatsoever of the modern malaise resultant from constant and early exposure to literally anything you want. No mention of the ways addiction to pornography can compound addiction to digital technology. No mention of the tension between cerebral attempts at self-control and the reptilian brain stem and its unceasing demands. Instead, we merely get the banal (and predictable) observation that societal repression creates urgent needs for release.Any discussion of violence and its appeal is totally absent. Alter discusses video game addiction, but only Tetris and World of Warcraft, and in the latter case, the mechanism of addiction is left untouched in favor of a tedious gloss of one individual's tendency to draw the blinds, give up all efforts to maintain personal hygiene, and play WoW for months on end. One wonders why Alter didn't here turn again to Freud and explore video games as an outlet for aggression. Indeed, leaving both sex and violence as aspects in digital technology addiction unexplored is unforgivable.But, I have to concede, perhaps it's me who's the fool. I did, after all, go into this book looking for an intensive examination of where the hands have come to on the clock, and instead I got a pretty lousy pop-psychology book that offered little of value. I guess the blurb by Malcolm Gladwell on the cover should have given me a clue.

But this beauty really entertained me with some astounding data and a focussed extrapolation of what might become of us if we continue. 'Man's evolution has been hand-in-hand with it's desire to be lazy' - this is a depressing yet awakening fact that we need to realize. As much as people might misuse, abuse or overuse the term 'innovation', it is just a fancy word for us spending less energy to get something done. And our relentless attempt at it, might be the ruin of us.What this book helped me with - habits that has reduced my online time drastically. For example - 1. I have allotted thinking times during which my phone and laptop automatically switch off (IFTTT rocks). 2. I now sleep with my phone in the drawing room and instead take my kindle with me. 3. I have a porn blocker which i haven't disabled for over two weeks.4. I now have started reading less listicles and more essays.5. And the best of them all, I have developed a habit to run. Now all this are a result of my reflection on using products that were made to hook me. It raised the question of rethinking my own set of ethics when I design a product or feature of a product which is often the last thing startups think about - success metrics in companies are now ones like Minutes on Page, Conversion, Retention, etc, which, cumulatively, is just distracting the customer.So if you are someone who ever has, is or planning to make a product for consumers - do give this book a read."}, {"userName": "Hank", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/238875-hank", "userReview": "It's hard to say that I enjoyed this book, because it is disturbing, depressing, and sad...but I loved it and enjoyed reading it so much.

Like Alter, I study the psychology of human decision making (I'm getting a PhD; I went to undergrad where and when Alter got his PhD, which is how we know each other). The further I get into my studies, the harder of a time I have reviewing popular treatments of the field, because so much of the research presented is often review for me. That's less the case here than with other popular psych books I've read recently, though, because I haven't studied addictions very much and am not very well versed in technology. So this was in some ways a refreshing change for me, a pop-psych book where I was learning right along with the lay audience. Alter makes a compelling and sobering case for the ubiquity of at least mild technology addiction, situating the conversation within the broader field of behavioral addiction. There's some nicely-presented, concise history of addictions both chemical and behavioral to set the scene. The technology-specific parts focus mostly on games (with which Alter candidly discusses his own past problems, as well as movingly portraying others' struggles), social media, and shopping. The science is solid and informative, but there's also a somewhat unusual (for a book by an academic, not for pop-psych writers generally) amount of practical advice. As someone with an admitted smartphone use problem (even with that admission, the statistics in this book were sobering and forced me to admit the problem was worse than I thought), I really appreciated the recommendations (the tracking app he mentions, Moment, has already helped me make some positive changes after just a week). I'm reevaluating the way I look at games and apps, and will keep my eyes open in future for ones that seem to foster addictive behavior. Though this and other subjects are heavy, Alter also takes care to include some light, amusing or positive examples. For example, while learning what might make games addictive, I also learned more detail about, and developed more appreciation for, what makes a game good and immersive. The section on gamification for positive purposes was also an antidote to some of the gloom in the book, but I think including some more examples of harnessing \"addiction \" for good throughout the book, rather than just at the end might have helped attenuate the flashes of overly dramatic tone that sometimes popped up (mostly I thought the tone was appropriate given the subject matter). In addition to the sometimes top-dramatic tone, my main problem with the book was organizational. Alter's first book, DRUNK TANK PINK, was great in terms of signposting things, asking one or two questions at the end of each chapter that would be answered in the next one, etc. This book is not quite as well or intuitively organized. This is probably because there are so many different topics, and historical information about each.Apart from these minor issues, I thought the book was great, both informative about the general issues of technology and behavioral addiction (and, to a lesser extent, addiction in general and technology in general) and full of great suggestions for dealing with technology, without coming across as too preachy or too much like a stereotypical self-help book. Even apart from knowing the author, I'm really glad to have read this book, because I learned a lot of interesting information and some really helpful things as well. Format note: I listened to the Audible audiobook, which Alter narrates. He does a very good job (much better than most authors who try to read their own work) and I highly recommend listening. It doesn't seem from the text like there are many things in the print book that you'd miss (e.g., pictures, charts or graphs)."}, {"userName": "Allison Hiltz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison-hiltz", "userReview": "Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Like most people I have a love/hate relationship with technology. I love waking up in the mornings and checking my Twitter feed and the news but I hate how the distraction can make me\u00a0run late. I love the satisfaction of hitting my step goals but I hate that I feel compelled to log what I eat. I love being connected to other people but I hate the guilt that comes with not responding to something right away.\u00a0These situations are\u00a0not unique to me but that doesn\u2019t mean it has any less of a personal impact. Technology, for all of its benefits, has a lot of drawbacks which have been studied more and more over the past several years. Parents who live a distracted life tend to foster that distraction in their own children. Always looking for the next like or favorite on social media can impact self-esteem. And let\u2019s not forget that screen time can interfere with concentration, productivity, and even our sleep.\u00a0We know these things, yet we continue to incorporate more and more technology into our lives, myself included. So why do we do it?Irresistible\u00a0by Adam Alter takes a fresh look at how technology impacts our daily lives and why we let it happen. While he covers the more popular subjects that were mentioned above, he also delves into the psychology and biology behind our obsession\u00a0and how anyone can fall victim to it. Using\u00a0approachable and practical examples that everyone can relate to, Alter analyzes how outside forces and our own biology help\u00a0foster the love/hate relationship.\u00a0From games and apps designed to keep us hooked to the constant elevated heart rate that checking our work emails creates, he covers the spectrum of our obsession and shines a light in how even the most self-aware user often ignores the warning signs.\u00a0There are plenty of articles online about how to step away from the Internet and connectivity, but doing so can do a lot more for your health than\u00a0just improve your state of mind. For example, the average person checks their work email 36 times an hour and opens it within six seconds. What does this mean for productivity when it takes up to 25 minutes to get back to productivity in the first place? Imagine what we could accomplish if we just turned our notifications off.And what about wearables? After reading this book, I stopped wearing my FitBit because I realized I would pace my house at 11 PM in order to hit my step goals. It was tough at first because I like accomplishing things and those little green stars are very rewarding, but in hindsight I see how it\u00a0was interfering with my sleep because I was elevating my heart rate before going to bed.\u00a0Technology is amazing, and Alter does not advocate for giving it up, rather using it more responsibly and being aware of how you, personally, react to it. If you find yourself ignoring your own health for the benefit of a\u00a0step goal, then it\u2019s time to step away. If you find yourself ignoring your children because you want to check Facebook, then it\u2019s time to step away. The repercussions of not doing so go far beyond our personal mental well-being and can impact our health, our relationships, and more. So while I may not be giving up my cell phone anytime soon, I am taking steps to rely on it less. After all, my health relies on it."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1377404-thomas", "userReview": "Page turner.

Who would believe that Kim Kardashian has \"earned\" tens of millions of dollars from her video game Hollywood? There is even a whole page devoted to the force behind the addictive popularity of Earth, Wind and Fire's 1978 hit record - September.  There is even a term- gamification that describes the rapidly expanding practice of morphing health practices, or even lawn mowing services into quasi games where the user earns points , badges, and levels.  Less you think that this is overstating the case, consider the fact that we're all in the game right now. Our salaries, seniority and promotions are only points, levels, and badges in disguise.  At least outright gaming calls it like it is.  Nevertheless, this is a must read. The book inspired me to I install an app on my phone that lets me track my phone usage.

While the book indeed offers a quite grim message it also offers much help and guidance to ways of better managing and creating balance with technology in our lives. Still, it is an uphill battle since much of our most used devices and applications are designed and continuously altered to further hook us. Worse yet, they are becoming more addictive by the minute.

I would change the subtitle to \u201cThe Rise of Behavioral Addiction in the Digital Age,\u201d which more accurately describes the book\u2019s contents. It is not all about screens \u2013 the author discusses exercise addiction frequently \u2013 and it is in no way an expos\u00e9 of the tech industry, as the actual subtitle might lead you to believe. Rather than focusing on how companies suck people into their products, the author is focused on the nature of behavioral addiction itself, how it affects people, and the aspects of technology that most readily create addiction.The book starts off by discussing behavioral addiction generally, whether it\u2019s an addiction to email, social media, gaming, gambling, or exercise. Like chemical addiction, this is often something that fills a hole in a person\u2019s life, and that the person comes to depend on to feel good (if the addiction is the only thing that causes the person\u2019s brain to produce dopamine anymore) but that ultimately is detrimental to his or her life. The author then moves on to discuss elements that can make technology addictive:1)\tGoals: Technology creates goals for us that we might not have formulated on our own, like walking a certain number of steps per day. This is especially true of exercise addictions. One dangerous idea is the Running Streak Association, which celebrates people who have run every day for a period of time (as in years or decades): people who didn\u2019t want to lose their streak have gone so far as to run while the eye of a hurricane was passing over, or while injured or even in the hospital for a C-section.2)\tFeedback: Games tell you how you\u2019re doing and how close you are to your goals; when you post on social media or message boards, you can track how many people liked your post.3)\tProgress: The author talks about the illusion of near wins and the fear of losing, but it seems to me that the illusion of actually accomplishing something is an especially addictive aspect to games and some social media, particularly for people who feel like they\u2019re just spinning their wheels at work or otherwise.4)\tEscalation: This is especially true of games; the game gets harder and you get better at it.5)\tCliffhangers: Discussed in the context of Netflix binges; people don\u2019t like unfinished stories and loose ends. In fact, a story sticks out far more in our memories if we don\u2019t hear the end.6)\tSocial interaction: Keeps people on social media, and playing social games like World of Warcraft.All good to be aware of, but the book\u2019s message tends to get a little muddled. The author talks about \u201cthe addict in all of us\u201d and how the average office email sits unread in the recipient\u2019s inbox only 6 seconds, but then writes at length about a World of Warcraft addict who played 20 hours a day for 5 weeks straight before committing himself to a detox clinic. Detailing such extreme examples tends to make everyday overuse seem like not such a big deal, and repeatedly returning to the clinic and its methodology throughout the book isn\u2019t especially useful for people whose technology dependence doesn't rise to the level of requiring a residential treatment program. Wearable fitness devices are criticized throughout the book for promoting addiction (an exercise addiction psychologist, who unsurprisingly sees the people who are damaged by them, is quoted as saying no one should use wearables ever). Then in the final pages the author acknowledges that a device meant to increase motivation to exercise is likely to be helpful for those who need motivation, though potentially dangerous to those who are already motivated. Given that according to his numbers that 61-67% of Americans, Brits, Germans, Australians and others are overweight, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have slammed the fitbits quite so hard.But suddenly in the last chapter gamification is presented as a solution to everything, when the entire preceding book was about why game addiction is bad. Sure, FreeRice promotes learning and donates ad revenue to feed the hungry, but it\u2019s still a virtual game that creates artificial goals and uses progress and escalation to keep people hooked. Suddenly that\u2019s okay if it\u2019s for a good cause? I thought the point was that we were supposed to try to disconnect and focus on more meaningful things? What is the point, exactly? There isn\u2019t a cohesive thesis here so much as a variety of interviews, studies and observations around a general theme.Still, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make a bad book; it\u2019s informative though lightweight and sometimes confused in its presentation. If nothing else, it will probably make you reflect on the role of technology in your life, which is a good thing to check in on every now and then."}, {"userName": "Cat", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29975286-cat", "userReview": "I just finished reading the book Irresistible by Adam Alter.\u00a0 This book looks at our addiction to technology (smartphones, email, gaming, fitness tracking, etc).\u00a0 It starts by reviewing the research on behavioural addiction (what it is and where it came from), how to create addictive experiences, and solutions for living in a world where abstinence from technology isn't an option.\u00a0 It's different than the other UX books I've read in that it made me think about the ethics of creating addictive user interfaces and what responsibilities we have as designers of these products.\u00a0 Here are the notes I took as I was reading:Addiction is a deep attachment to an experience that is harmful and difficult to do without.\u00a0 Rather than involving substances, behavioral addictions arise when a person can't resist a behavior which addresses a deep psychological need in the short term, but produces significant harm in the long term.Research on rats demonstrated that anyone can exhibit addiction under the right circumstances and it isn't just based on having\u00a0 an addictive personality - eg a probe activating pleasure centre causes rats to ignore food and rest, but when taken out of that environment they no longer show addictive behaviors.\u00a0 This was revolutionary compared to the idea that addicts have brains that are predisposed to substance abuse.Ingredients of an addictive experience: goals, feedback, progress, escalation, cliffhangers, and social interaction.Humans are driven by a sense of progress.\u00a0 When goals are smaller and easier to manage, people will be more likely to act.\u00a0 Goals inspire action because they become fixation points.\u00a0 The problem occurs when people start fixating on arbitrary goals, like getting to inbox zero, where we become obsessed with perfection and spend more time pursuing the goal than enjoying the success.\u00a0 If the pursuit is governed by numbers (eg salary, Instagram followers, marathon time, streaks), goals will come in the form of round numbers and social comparisons, and repeated success will spawn one new ambitious goal after another.Feedback encourages action, whether it be pushing a button on an elevator or even a virtual button that does nothing (eg Reddit's 2015 April Fools prank).\u00a0 When feedback is intermittent rather than guaranteed, more dopamine is released in the brain for each \"reward\" and the draw is bigger (like gambling).\u00a0 Facebook took advantage of this phenomenon via their like button, which gives intermittent feedback about whether your friends like your post.\u00a0 In gambling with slot machines, losses can be disguised as wins when you win back some of the money you spent on a spin (eg win 1 of 15 rows on a single spin would get you\u00a0$1\u00a0win, but cost\u00a0$1.50\u00a0to play).\u00a0 The alluring whirl of lights and sounds can convince you that you won. Similarly to how slot machines measure success using time on device, game designers\u00a0 capture how engaging and enjoyable their games are.\u00a0 Designers use microfeedback to keep gamers hooked.\u00a0 It is important that feedback immediately follows a player's action so the player feels they caused it.\u00a0 Games like Candy Crush use a layer of surface feedback, like sights and sounds, to make it feel real and connect the player to the virtual world. Virtual Reality has the potential to deepen this experience and escalate behavioural addictions.Addictive games help users progress and offer something to both novices and experts.\u00a0 Start with a hook, like the dollar auction game or Super Mario avatar setup.\u00a0 Beginner's luck can also be a powerful hook because it shows you the pleasure of success and then yanks it away.\u00a0 In gaming, this can be achieved by giving rewards quickly early in the game and spreading them out as the player progresses.Although people think they want to make life easier, there is actually research showing people prefer breaks between something pleasant and moderate hardship (examples of people in the lab giving themselves electric shocks to avoid the boredom of sitting alone with their thoughts for 20 minutes, and movie stars getting bored with everything coming too easily).\u00a0 Escalation of difficulty is a critical hook that keeps games engaging long after you've mastered the basic moves - like Tetris getting faster as you progress with time.\u00a0 Another study showed that children learn best and are most motivated when the material they're learning is just beyond their current skill level - called the \"zone of proximal development\".\u00a0 When people enter the zone, they experience \"flow\" - the joy of being able to just barely overcome challenges.\u00a0 In the context of gaming, this sensation is called a \"ludic loop\" where each time you solve part of the puzzle a new incomplete piece presents itself - e.g. Super Hexagon starts up again right away so the player can't wallow in defeat, music starts at random spot so it doesn't feel like as much of a loss - all to preserve the player's flow.\u00a0 Near wins where you're sure you were close to winning are very addictive, sometimes more so than actual wins - eg lottery tickets.\u00a0 People have inherent stopping rules that cue them to stop doing some activity (shopping, exercising, etc).\u00a0 We tend to overlook them because in the short term it's more useful to know how to get someone to start doing something than to continue or stop doing it.\u00a0 Unfortunately technology can disrupt stopping rules and make us less intuitive about what we're doing (eg calorie counting vs healthy eating).\u00a0 Games like Farmville override stopping rules because they are persistently running, with no levels or sessions that tell you when your game begins and ends.Incomplete experiences occupy our minds more than completed ones - such as tasks and songs.\u00a0 We can use cliffhangers to drive behaviour - eg Netflix autoplay function encourages binge watching, organ donation rates affected based on whether people opt in or opt out.People are endlessly driven to compare themselves to others.\u00a0 Facebook and Instagram are addictive partly because of the feedback that comes in through likes and comments; something that isn't available through apps without a social network.\u00a0 People also seek social confirmation - signs that they see the world the way others do, that they are part of a group.\u00a0 E.g. Hot or Not app gives people feedback about whether their version of hot is mirrored by others.\u00a0 Multiplayer games leverage interactions between gamers who share a common purpose to keep people hooked.\u00a0 Making online friends isn't a problem as long as you also make friends in the real world.\u00a0 One study found that gamers aged 10-15 who played 3+ hours/day were less satisfied with their lives, less likely to feel empathy toward other people, and less likely to know how to deal with their emotions appropriately.\u00a0 This is especially alarming when recent studies show kids spend an average of 5-7 hours/day in front of screens.Children are especially vulnerable to addiction because they lack the self control that prevents many adults from developing addictive habits.\u00a0 Hardship innoculation is the idea that struggling with a mental puzzle innoculates you against future mental hardships (like vaccines against illness), so depriving kids by handing them a device that makes everything easier is dangerous.\u00a0 Since some screen time is unavoidable, recommendations for healthy screen time include: parents should encourage children to connect what they see in the screen world to their experience in the real world (\"transfer of learning\"), active engagement is better than passive viewing, screen time should focus on the content of the app rather than the technology itself.\u00a0 A key idea is that it's easier to prevent people from developing addictions than to correct existing bad habits. Part of parenting today include lessons on how to interact with technology and for how long each day.When people try to suppress thoughts or behaviors, they tend to focus on them more.\u00a0 Rather than trying to use willpower alone, it is a better habit to reduce the environmental cues.\u00a0 A key to overcoming addictive behaviors is to replace them with something else (eg a stress ball instead of biting nails).\u00a0 Habits consist of three parts - a cue, a routine, and a reward.\u00a0 Keep the cue and reward the same, but change the routine.\u00a0 Habits can take a long time to form - 66 days on average, but quite variable across different people.\u00a0 Behavioural architecture - redesign your environment so temptations are as close to absent as possible (eg not keeping phone next to you all the time or while sleeping, automatically deleting emails while on vacation, etc) and blunt temptations that can't be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0Not all addictive experiences are bad.\u00a0 The same hooks that drive addiction can also be used to drive healthier eating, regular exercise, retirement savings, charitable giving, and committed studying.\u00a0 Gamification is about taking a non-game experience and turning it into a game.\u00a0 Three common elements include using points, badges, and leaderboards.\u00a0 The risk of gamifying everything is that people can lose the intrinsic motivation to do the right thing - only exercising when it's fun, fees for picking up kids late from daycare become an economic decision, etc."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric", "userReview": "I almost always struggle with assessing that fifth star, and that was the case here. But, this seems an important work even if, at some date not far down the path, some of what Alter has written about turns out to be a bit off the mark. For example, even I gave up \"Farmville\" as a regular time suck quite some time back. But understanding a bit more about tech addiction and gamification seems an exceptionally useful tool to keep at hand as we pick our way through our own daily activities and watch young people development habits, good and bad, in reacting to the world in which we are all placed. I suppose I was hooked when Alter made the claim in the prologue that Steve Jobs would not allow his children to partake of the technology of which he was so proud to have been the designer. Having read Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, I sensed that Jobs was not necessarily evil, but he was certainly complex. The manner in which tech becomes insidious needs to be understood. I suppose it is dangerous to give the Chinese much credit, but at least they make their motives intentional even if almost surreptitious as they seek to further state objectives through control of the technology. Having just watched our own political minders bumble through their questioning of Zuckerberg about \"Facebook\" I suppose we might take some small solace from their ignorance - or should we?"}, {"userName": "Amber Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1345152-amber-spencer", "userReview": "Probably 3.5 stars.

We obsess over our emails, Instagram likes, and Facebook feeds; we binge on TV episodes and YouTube videos; we work longer hours each year; and we spend an average of three hours each day using our smartphones. Half of us would rather suffer a broken bone than a broken phone, and Millennial kids spend so much time in front of screens that they struggle to interact with real, live humans.In this revolutionary book, Adam Alter, a professor of psychology and marketing at NYU, tracks the rise of behavioral addiction, and explains why so many of today's products are irresistible. Though these miraculous products melt the miles that separate people across the globe, their extraordinary and sometimes damaging magnetism is no accident. The companies that design these products tweak them over time until they become almost impossible to resist.By reverse engineering behavioral addiction, Alter explains how we can harness addictive products for the good\u2014to improve how we communicate with each other, spend and save our money, and set boundaries between work and play\u2014and how we can mitigate their most damaging effects on our well-being, and the health and happiness of our children.", "title": "Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30962055-irresistible?from_choice=true", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479719623l/30962055.jpg", "reviews": 467, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6463598.Adam_Alter", "name": "Adam Alter"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Science", "Science", "Business"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30962055-irresistible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31225682-irresistible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33626812-irresistible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30335526-irresistible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923132-irresistible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811497-drunk-tank-pink", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38813255-social-media-screen-addiction"]}
