I love this novel. It is a young adult novel but as an adult I really enjoyed it. As I read this book it is coming up on the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and this is the first time that I've been able to enjoy reading anything about the hurricane without crying. What I love the most about Patty Friedmann's writing and not just this novel but every one of her novels is that her stories and characters may seem far fetched but they are not. These people and places do exist, at least in New Orleans they do. Everything she writes about hits home and it makes her books mean so much more to me. Everything in this novel could very well have happened as so many of us have our own unique stories that happened to us during the time of Katrina. The Elmwood's and all of their family and friends are people that I know and as they say, to know them is to love them and I absolutely love and adore Patty Friedmann! Thank you for another GREAT novel!"}, {"userName": "Patty Friedmann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432538-patty-friedmann", "userReview": "The first real YA Katrina novel--and my first foray into this genra.

They don't believe in evacuation, either - which is how they ended up living in their local Baptist Hospital when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. Summer's little sister, Amalia, was having open-heart surgery a week before the storm... but when Summer's family is forced to evacuate, Amalia is gone. Now they're living with shallow, selfish, rich Aunt Sharon, and Summer's family is convinced she hid or murdered Amalia. With a secret cell phone, her best friend Haydn, and a new friend Robert, it's up to her to find her sister.I had a mixed reaction to this book. On the one hand, the language and several things about drugs and other activities were simply unnecessary. Yes, Summer's parents were strange ex-hippies. Yes, Summer was a 'normal teen.' This doesn't mean a lot of the content really needed to be in there; the story was perfectly fine without it. Another problem I had was the writing; the story is told from Summer's point of view, and her thoughts are often confusing. Half the time you feel like you're a stranger trying to understand a small-town inside joke. Other times Summer just seems fickle or unrealistic. (Example: going from 'I love my baby sister and must find her!' to 'I have to find Amalia because my parents won't pay attention to me if I don't.')On the other hand, the story itself was amazing. It protrays the various facets of the tragedy called Katrina, along with other issues in New Orleans. The events pull you in; whether or not you like or care about Summer's family, something makes you want to know - need to know - if they ever find Amalia. Depending on your feelings towards the Elmwoods, you also end up wondering what happened to Amalia - did someone take her? murder her? who? why? - and who finds her, if she's ever found - Summer? her parents? one of her friends? the FBI?For a compelling and honest story about a real-life tragedy, I give this book two and a half stars.I received this book for free from the author in exchange for this review.

On one hand it was good, on the other it was horrible and it's so hard to explain why. The premise of the story itself is captivating. Detailing the event leading up to Katrina and it's aftermath as seen through the eyes of an average young girl, Taken away will make you want to keep turning pages. The turn off for me, however was the character development, or lack thereof. There just wasn't enough development to make me totally connect with any of the people in the story. They seemed so superficial and well, honestly, I was really disturbed by how RACIST they all were! Is this how it is in New Orleans? If so remind me to NEVER EVER visit this city! I can't imagine living somewhere where money and/or the color of your skin dictates your worthiness. Not in today's society! I thought we were past that. But, if this book is an indication of the \"truth\" New Orleans is not for me. It actually offended me, and alot of you who know me know that I am not easily offended. Ok, so here is my opinion.I felt as if I were reading an unfinished work. There is a good story in here and good characters. I just think it needs a really good, deep rework. More emotion from the parents! A little less snobbery and racism from Sumbie. A little more realism when it comes to the kidnapper. I don't buy that that chick was smart enough to pull that off even in all the chaos of Katrina going on. I give it 3 stars for potential."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101554-kari", "userReview": "Taken Away takes you inside the days preceding and post Hurricane Katrina as seen through the eyes of a fifteen year old girl. Along with her anxieties about the disaster, she also faces a devastating blow to her family unit. Her baby sister is kidnapped from the hospital sometime during the evacuation chaos.I liked the concept for this book. The author did a great job of conveying the desperation that the family felt as they realize their loved one is gone. I also got a good sense of the chaos that surrounded city in the aftermath of the hurricane. But, I just didn't like any of the characters. I really did not like the parents or the decisions that they made. I had a hard time believing that any mother would allow herself to be denied access to her child in the ICU. That just doesn't happen. Then, they don't seem to be very proactive in trying to search for their missing child. The way they treat Sumbie was just atrocious. Imagine actually accusing your daughter of killing her baby sister. That didn't wash with me. I also wasn't left with the sense that anything had changed within the dynamic of the family in the end. So, as I said, I loved the concept, but not the characters."}], "description": "In the midst of the biggest natural disaster in American history--Hurricane Katrina--15-year-old Summer \"Sumbie\" Elmwood's two-year-old sister disappears from the hospital after open-heart surgery and Sumbie is the prime suspect.
