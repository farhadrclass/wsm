Unfortunately, I found See Jane Run to be disappointing at best.The story starts out with great potential--a woman suddenly finds herself in the middle of downtown Boston, alone and with no idea of who she is, wearing a bloody dress and a coat with $10,000 stuffed in the pockets. It could have been the start to a great story full of mystery and intrigue and shocking plot twists, but after the first couple of chapters, the story instead quickly devolves into a predictable and unimaginative plotline.Aside from the main character herself, I found the characterisations to be bland and more than a little cliche. Not only that, but the quintessential Helping Hand character--who most mystery authors introduce toward the beginning of the story and ends up playing a pivotal role during the denouement--makes only a token appearance before disappearing into the ether, never to be seen again.My foremost and greatest complaint about this book, however, is that the dialogue feels rather forced; it reads more like the main body of the narrative itself than anything I would actually expect to hear come out of someone's mouth. For example, the author describes Paula, the housekeeper-cum-jailor, as being not altogether very bright, yet insists on having her say such things as: \"When she persisted...\" Most people--especially people of sub-average intelligence--would never use words like persisted in a normal, everyday conversation.All in all, I found See Jane Run to be altogether disappointing, but interesting enough on the whole to make for an okay read on a rainy day."}, {"userName": "Joanne Harris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris", "userReview": "A decent premise - in many ways rather similar to BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, but preceding it by a couple of decades. I'm a little choosy about my thrillers, and this one is fine in conception, though let down by flat and clunky prose. The third-person narration relies heavily on a very repetitive form of internal monologue, filled with rhetorical questions, which quickly becomes very tiresome: (Who was she? Was she crazy? Had she done something unspeakable? Why couldn't she remember things? Where was her daughter? How could she have forgotten her? Why write in the third person at all if you're going to adopt a running pseudo-commentary anyway, and how long would it take for the reader to start getting really tired of it?) The result is a heroine who comes across as quite passive and very dull, in spite of our being repeatedly told that she is feisty and independent. The other characters are similarly unconvincing - the jealous neighbour, the sinister cleaning woman, the suspiciously saintly husband. A little nuance wouldn't have hurt, and might have led to some actual thrills."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5838986-amy", "userReview": "Better title: See Jane Make Repetitive Errors in Judgment.

I can't imagine why else I'd have picked this one up. The reviews were good, but I'm afraid I have to disagree. It was one of those books that you finish just to prove to yourself that you're right about where it's going. Part of the problem is, of course, that the book is a bit out of date. By now, the themes that probably seemed original back in 1990 have become so outworn and predictable that the book feels like \"Exhibit A\" for the genre. Nonetheless, the story was likely predictable even when it was new. The heroine, Jane, is such a pathetic excuse for a person that it's hard to feel much sympathy for her. And by the end of the novel, when you know what has happened, she's less likable, not more. Given the time in which it was written, one might expect the novel to have a fairly solid grounding in the etiology of certain criminal acts and in the legalities that arise in the story. On both accounts, the plot falls short. I can't explain without giving away too much, but suffice it to say there would be more than one professional criminally liable if the story were true and the psychology behind the central cause of the plot is paper thin. There are also some continuity errors that an editor should have caught. In addition, the antagonist is so over-the-top as to be almost comical.Finally, Fielding's writing was a problem for me. She is very long-winded about things like the decor in a room. What could have been covered in a sentence or two will take a page, with the result that the story moves along very, very slowly. She also spends far too much time on the inner maundering of the protagonist. When your response to the main character is that she should just shut up already, there's a problem. By the time I was less than halfway through, I was skimming whole pages of description and mental anguish just to get to the next actual event in the story.I realize that many people have enjoyed this book and I'm sorry to be such a pill about it, but the fact is, if I'd liked it any less, I'd not have bothered finishing it. I would, however, consider reading one of Fielding's later novels as I'd be interested to see her development as a writer. She certainly has talent, but it's unpolished in this early work."}, {"userName": "Ting", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4765037-ting", "userReview": "I feel cheated by the ending...it almost seemed like she had to rush it to beat the deadline of the script.What a great beginning, awesome climax near the end, then poof."}, {"userName": "J Jahir", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64491025-j-jahir", "userReview": "[ (aunque claro, el que le haya mentido sobre emily, la muerte de su madre, y le haya dado tanto medicamento para que no recordara, se te har\u00e1 sospechoso  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39972744-leah", "userReview": "This book started out exciting and great but was wrecked by the most disturbing and worst ending I've ever read. Who doesn't like a thrilling book where the main character loses his memory, so you can lean back and find everything out by reading? At least that's what I thought. I was ready for a thrilling reading experience but it was destroyed by Fiedlings writing style. It's rather childish and undeveloped. Her hints towards sex, styling and make-up were just purely annoying. This book would've been way better without the detailled descriptions of make-up and the disturbing sex scenes. They didn't even make sense for developing the plot. Seriously, the main character thought so often about \"thrusting penises\" I wanted to hit her in the face!The plot was exciting at first, solving all the riddles around Jane's character but after a while you could guess how the whole plot would go. And you didn't need to be smart for guessing it. You knew from page 1 who would turn out to be the villain of the story, you knew what it was what she wanted so hard to remember. After a while the excitement turned into boredom.The characters were dull chlich\u00e9s with only one major attribute. (Wow, Fiedling, how human) There were the \"Evil One\", the \"First Evil but turns out nice\" One, \"Nice cute daughter without any flaw\", \"Stupid Neighbour\", \"Stupid neighbour family\" and \"Doctor who is the only nice person but travels away so he doesn't take part in the plot\". There really wasn't anything exciting about the characters. Their actions were predictable and so were their dialogues. No one else would ever talk like that! ***MAJOR SPOILER*** I have to rant a bit because the ending was what destroyed the book's charm. Towards the first 300 pages I liked it, found it nice and even interesting. But then Fielding thought a plot twist might sell better so she madee the husband molest the little daughter. It was predictable, disgusting because Fielding felt the disgusting need to described sex between father and daughter. (and I seriously don't know why a writer would do that!) Why??????? (There can't be too many question marks for that question). It was disturbing and unnecessary. She then came up with all the lame chlich\u00e9s about child-rape: the daughter was too shy to admit it, she showed how he touched him on a doll.... bla... blaaah. And even if you want to write about rape, you should NEVER EVER write about an old man ejaculating on a little girl's hand. What's wrong with Fiedling?! Dafuq. ***SPOILER AND RANT OVER*** ****I EXCUSE FOR MY LANGUAGE****Although the book had some flaws it was charming enough to convince a little, to thrille the reader, to excite him just a little. I would call it a \"cute thriller\", advising to read it with your brain switched off."}, {"userName": "Karina M", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18966585-karina-m", "userReview": "See Jane Run, by Joy Fielding was an interesting novel. It was the first I have read about memory loss, and I don't normally read suspense or mystery so it was a new and interesting experience for me to read this book. I felt the book was unnecessarily long, lingering on details of little importance. The dialogue was a little dry for my taste, and the characters flat. However, the plot was interesting. I was not expecting the memories that eventually came rushing back to Jane. Almost all of the other plot twists were rather predictable, as was the ending. The ending also felt rushed, a story that had taken practically 400 pages to unfold seemed to come to a close too quickly. The suspense did make the book very easy to read, and although it is a little longer than I felt it needed to be, it was a very quick read. \u00a0Although it wasn't bad, this book didn't really make me want to read the rest of the author's various works, and I think it will be a really long time before I ever read another Joy Fielding book, if I ever do at all. The story was too superficial, no real emotions ever emerged for me while reading this book in spite of the uncomfortable subject matter it deals with. It was entertaining, good beach reading when you want to be gripped by curiosity and suspense without really having to think deeply or be stirred by the story. Not really my type of book, but I am nonetheless glad that I read it and enjoyed venturing into a new type of story."}, {"userName": "Nina Draganova", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20038488-nina-draganova", "userReview": "\u041e\u0444,\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u043c\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f \u0434\u044a\u0445\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0449\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f.\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433.\u041d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0438 \"\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043f\u044f\" \u0438 \"\u041d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u0441\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\".\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u044a\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0431\u043b\u044a\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u0438 \u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430 , \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u043e. \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430.\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0449\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0437\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u044a\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0442."}, {"userName": "Parham Nooralishahi", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27977671-parham-nooralishahi", "userReview": "It's a good novel, but the story is not rich enough for a book with around 400 pages.

Review lengkap menyusul---edited--- Suatu hari, Jane sedang berjalan di tengah kota ketika ia kehilangan ingatannya. Semua terjadi tiba-tiba. Ia tidak ingat siapa namanya, tak ingat di mana rumahnya, tak ingat apapun tentang keluarga atau identitasnya. Bagian depan bajunya penuh noda darah, dan ia mengantongi uang tunai $10.000 yang entah ia dapatkan dari mana dan untuk apa. Dalam kebingungannya, ia memutuskan untuk pergi ke kantor polisi setelah sebelumnya menyembunyikan uangnya di persewaan loker. Karena ia hilang ingatan, polisi mengirim Jane ke rumah sakit untuk diperiksa. Nah, saat di rumah sakit inilah, Jane bertemu dengan seorang wanita yang mengenalinya sebagai Jane Whittaker, istri dari dokter Michael Whittaker yang cukup populer.Ketika kemudian Jane bertemu dengan suaminya, ia khawatir suaminya akan kecewa mengetahui Jane yang hilang ingatan. Tapi toh suaminya senang dengan kembalinya Jane. Si suami ini bahkan mempekerjakan asisten untuk menemani dan merawat Jane ketika ia berkerja.Tapi hari demi hari, ingatan Jane tak juga kembali. Dan di saat ia makin putus asa, ia tahu ada yang tak benar tentang dirinya. Ada sesuatu yang janggal pada kehidupannya. Jane hanya perlu mengingatnya. Tapi bisakah ia melakukannya?Buku yang saya terima sebagai hadiah arisan BBI Joglosemar 2 atau 3 tahun lalu ini baruuu sempat saya baca sekarang. Itupun karena banyak blog yang merekomendasikan buku ini bagi pencinta thriller psikologis macam saya. Secara keseluruhan, saya suka dengan ceritanya. Alurnya cepat dan terus bikin saya penasaran sama kejadian apa yang sebenarnya terjadi sampai sampai baju yang dikenakan Jane saat kehilangan ingatan itu berlumuran darah. Sayangnya tokoh antagonisnya gampang ditebak, terus endingnya memang agak mengejutkan sih, tapi kesannya jadi kayak dipaksain gitu.Udah gitu tokoh Jane bikin saya gemes bukan main. Udah jelas jelas siapa antagonisnya, tapi dia masih aja sulit percaya. Ya bisa dimaklumi juga sih ya, namanya orang amnesia, ingatan yang penting penting itu malah hilang. Udah gitu jadi insecure, nggak percayaan sama orang lain, juga sama diri sendiri. Kalau dilihat lihat, sekilas saya jadi ingat dengan Novel Before I Go to Sleep, tentang wanita yang hilang ingatan, insecure, kebingungan, dan ending yang nggak begitu memuaskan. Bosen juga sih ya kenapa cerita novel sejenis ini kebanyakan mengambil tema wanita yang hilang ingatan. Hal ini membuat kita sebagai pembaca jadi merasa nggak yakin juga dengan penuturan mereka, karena wanita wanita ini jadi sulit untuk dipercaya. Apalagi di kisah Jane, bajunya berlumuran darah. Bagaimana kalau sebenarnya ia baru saja membunuh seseorang? Bagaimana kalau begini, begitu dsb.Tapi lumayan kok ceritanya secara keseluruhan.

She knows where she is going and what she planned to buy but not her name, her hair color, or her age. The first pages of this book describe what Jane remembers and what she doesn't giving the reader a feeling overwhelming dread and sympathy. Then we learn she is covered in blood under her coat and has a pocket full of money. From there, we follow Jane as she searches for help, finally landing at the hospital where her pediatrician husband, Michael, is well known. Something is her core being tells her she doesn't want to go with the man everyone says is her husband but she doesn't know why. At home memories start to surface. She realizes she has a daughter and asks about her only to be told (at first) the seven year old girl is staying with friends. Meanwhile Michael and her housekeeper, Paula, continue to insist Jane take the drugs Michael has prescribed to help her through this time of despair and insist Jane is not well enough to see her friends. But Michael's story begins to change.My take: This is a suspense mystery that you will not want to put down. The conclusion is a terrible surprise, one that many of us can relate to unfortunately. \"See Jane Run\" moves quickly and the sense of foreboding keeps the reader engages throughout the entire book. It is cleanly written with a good understanding of what people in this situation would feel. The story keeps the reader guessing until quite close to the end and even then the reader wonders how Jane can ever come out of this. One of the things I most liked about the book is how the main character grew from dependency to being independent in just a first short weeks, as if the fire of this crisis made her discover what she had inside all along. By force of will she is able to put things in motion which actually help her when the reader thinks all is lost.

The middle of the book, about 250 pages, was arguably pointless.

It was my very first Joy Fielding novel and I fell in love with not only this book, but her as an author as well. To this day she's one of my favorites and I read everything she writes, often more than once. This one had such an impact on me that I will say I think it's my favorite novel of Joy's and I still stand by that even close to thirty years later! I own it in hardcover and it's one of the books I would recommend to another if they like suspense and a good mind bender. Before Gone Girl and The Girl On The Train, there was See Jane Run.

I knocked it to two because who in the world lets their 4 year olds see the doctor alone?!? I just can't buy that premise on which so much else hinges. It was a interesting, of disturbing, story.
