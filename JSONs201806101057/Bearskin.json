Rice presided alone over seven thousand acres of private nature preserve: he was the caretaker, the science tech. He drove the John Deere tractor. He\u2019d exaggerated his construction experience on the job application, probably one reason they\u2019d hired a guy with his record. That and the fact he was a qualified biological science technician who looked like he could take care of himself. He\u2019d agreed to do the work on the cabin so the owners wouldn\u2019t hire a bunch of carpenters to drive up in the morning and ruin his solitude.the isolation of the location was one of the perks, after all - not only does rice have a record, but he\u2019s also using an assumed name, hiding out from the members of the mexican drug cartel who want him dead after previous entanglements have left a heap of dead and wounded on both sides. cautiously optimistic that they\u2019ve lost his trail, rice immerses himself in his work, giving himself over to the wildness that surrounds him; not in a starry-eyed tree-hugging way, but in a way that studies the movements of the creatures around him, that prowls the forest at night, occasionally sleeping under the stars. and in the way that gets really pissed off by finding the bodies of bears poached on the protected land, baited and stripped of galls, paws, skin, left to rot.time for the caretaker to take care...of business.oh, you know you love me.it's man and nature and crime and protection, as rice begins his own unauthorized investigation into who is responsible for the poaching, making friends and enemies along the way, ultimately risking exposure to the people he most needs to avoid. there are some pretty intense, well-placed scenes.in between those more confrontational scenes, there are quietly meditative ones, building an atmosphere in which there's a great deal of blurring between natural and civilized spaces; rice ventures into nature, but nature ventures right back, encroaching upon what little of the preserve has been allotted to its humans. all the nooks and crannies of rice\u2019s new home are explored by bees, snakes, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, opossums, insects, toads, birds, spiders and even a bear.The bear\u2019s intrusion wasn\u2019t a surprise, exactly. This was nothing more than a new level of permeability in the boundary between wild and domestic, something he had come to accept while living up here.this phenomenon of nature, or wildness, taking back the domestic spaces claimed by humans as civilized is a recurring theme throughout the novel, and it becomes a metaphor for what is to come - rice\u2019s past catching up with him, bringing violence, infecting his new life. The lodge had been assimilated into the meadow over the past hundred years, and despite his efforts to keep the place up, an irresistible osmosis was always at work, the life outside inevitably forcing its way in.change is gradual, but inevitable.the descriptions of the natural world are beautifully written, and although it is not a pretty book, it falls on the \u201cnicer\u201d side of the grit lit divide, in the vein of Fourth of July Creek or Above the Waterfall. there\u2019s ample violence, but it\u2019s neither gratuitous nor gleefully descriptive, and there\u2019s an effort made towards the redemptive; opportunities for rice to retain his conscience and his humanity even in the midst of all this roaring ungovernable nature.a very strong debut with an equally magnificent cover.also, these endpapers:* the part where they proved \u201cthey could do whatever they wanted,\u201d that \u201cnobody could imagine what else they might do.\u201d that freaking part."}, {"userName": "B.A. Brock", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29624584-b-a-brock", "userReview": "Oof. That was a good book. I would have skipped my day job for that one, if I wasn\u2019t so poor. A mix between Thoreau and Nevada Barr, \u2018Bearskin\u2019 was equally surreal and stone-cold present in the moment. In fact, I\u2019m still not sure if our protagonist has a few screws loose or not. I\u2019m thinking so.Rice was relatable, despite his toxic masculinity and stupidity (see toxic masculinity for source of said stupidity). I liked that he was half shaman and scientist, a source of his irreconcilable self. I also like all the animals and anthropomorphism. Good book.

The forest is off-limits to hunters, and Moore's primary job is to monitor the vast acreage for disturbances. It's lonely and exhausting work but exactly what Moore needs, until he discovers a bear carcass left behind by poachers, who sell the gallbladders on the black market. His pursuit of the trespassers will shatter his solitude and resurrect the demons of a past life he's tried to bury. Other characters include Rice's predecessor, Sara Birkeland, who was forced off the preserve after a vicious attack, and a local biker gang that Rice suspects is involved in the poaching. But McLaughlin's most memorable character is the dense ecosystem of the Appalachian forest, which is explored in vivid and often dreamlike prose. These lush, hallucinatory sequences sometimes stunt the momentum of the central mystery, but McLaughlin gets it back for a violent climax. VERDICT This versatile debut is hard to pin down, successfully straddling the line between the evocative erudition of Gabriel Tallent's My Absolute Darling or Tom Franklin's Poachers, and the page-turning suspense of C.J.

McLaughlin has seemingly stepped out of the gate as fully formed mature writer.I can't say enough good things about this debut. McLaughlin has woven a narrative with strands that appear at odds with one another. A bio-scientist who gets involved with a Mexican drug cartel who is knowledgeable of under cover sleuthing activities (though he fails at this occasionally, which is surprisingly realistic as well), and is passionate about trying to save our slowly disintegrating planet. He has woven all of this together seamlessly and made it believable with just a touch of the surreal - also believable. Not to mention the undercurrent of a love story that is as sweet as it is dangerous.McLaughlin's character development is enough to make you breathless. Rice is scary, but he is so hypnotic! His presence alone was enough to make me continue reading. I couldn't have stopped if I wanted to, but I didn't want to. Every other character was compelling as well from the most to the least important. All the characters breathed with life. McLaughlin is a very skillful writer to balance such a complex narrative and populate it with people who scare you to death, yet intrigue you. Along the way he was tackling some very important contemporary themes of race, class, border crossing, conservation, and the differences between man and animal - or lack of.Lastly, his language is glorious. He works at placing the right words next to each other to create lovely sentences. He then places those sentences beside one another to build exquisite paragraphs. His passages evocative of natural landscape and habitat are mesmerizing. He is clearly very fond of the rural Virginia mountain range where he grew up. I cannot tell you how many passages I underlined while reading.  I rarely read thrillers yet found Bearskin riveting. It has elements that will appeal to many types of readers. I encourage you all to give it a try.Thank you HarperCollins for the advanced reader's edition!"}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729756-brian", "userReview": "****"}, {"userName": "Nancy McFarlane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3130731-nancy-mcfarlane", "userReview": "Bearskin is not a typical action filled thriller.

The passages about the woods, plants, animals, and the bristling life contained within a forest were some of the most vivid and engaging I have read in a long while.

It's going to be hard work that puts him in the paths of disgruntled hillbillies, ex-military poachers, and motorcycle gangs. He has to be extra careful, because any scrape with the law could ping his location to the cartel sicario he's been hiding from after a deal gone wrong on the border. Bearskin a punishingly brutal tough-guy thriller which benefits from a unique setting (rural noir? Is that a thing?) and from being surprisingly ecologically-minded.

Rice Moore is a scientist with a dark past--he and a girlfriend funded ecological studies along the Mexico/US border by smuggling small packages southward for a cartel, she turned DEA informant and was summarily brutally murdered while he spent a year in a Mexican prison, after which he hunted down and murdered his girlfriend's killer. At the novel's outset, Rice has landed a job as a caretaker at a remote nature preserve. The reason for his employment has perhaps more to do with his drug-running and prison time than his past as a scientist. The previous caretaker was raped, beaten and run out of town, and the position demands a tough guy who can stand up to the locals. All is well on Turk Mountain until bears carcasses start turning up with their gallbladders and paws removed. The plot from there expands to involve biker gangs and more.
