That\u2019s what you get when you devour this book. Not only was it funny as hell, but it was full of action, and creepiness. Devin is such a great main character that you learn to empathize with and his best friend/cousin Tommy was my favorite though, he reminded me a lot of Evil Ed from Fright Night and that made the reading experience 10x better. I\u2019m excited for the sequel and now that I know it is about vampires, the Fright Night thing will really make sense in the second one. I really enjoyed this one and I will be talking about it more in my September Wrap Up on my channel next week. \uf04aThanks to Sky Pony Press for this copy sent to me for free for review."}, {"userName": "Kerry Cerra", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927038-kerry-cerra", "userReview": "I can't remember the last time I read a book that was this much fun. I laughed my way throughout, and I found myself genuinely trying to foresee the outcome--with no success. Jonathan Rosen has written a hilarious tale that will keep you guessing right up until the end.

This is what is happening to Devin Dexter and his cousin Tommy. When Herb moves in across the street things start going downhill for Devin and Tommy. As Devin tries to convince his parents of his suspisions they actually send him to therapy sessions with no other than Herb. Poor Devin just can't catch a break. Things go from bad to worse on Christmas Eve when Devin and Tommy are kidnapped by Herb and hundreds of evil Cuddle Bunnies set out to attack the city. Can Devin and Tommy save themselves and the city? Or will the evil Cuddle Bunnies take over the world? Do not miss this hilarious yet terrifying book about family, friendship, and overcoming incredible odds.This books is fantastic! If this was to be turned into a movie Tommy would be the best supporting actor. Tommy is absolutely hysterical. He has such a dry sense of humor that will have you laughing all through the book. On the flip side, Jonathan Rosen weaves scary, creepy bunnies into the book and has you on the edge of your seat wondering if the suspense will ever end.

Add in some cuddle bunny toys, a magical potion, and a whiny kid sister who won't take no for an answer, well, you've got yourself quite an adventure! I laughed out loud so many times during this book! There are also thrills and chills galore, for our hero must face down an army of the undead to save his town. Kids are going to LOVE this book, as are their parents, teachers, and librarians. The whole time I was reading this book I kept thinking \"this is EXACTLY the kind of book I would have devoured as a kid\". Jonathan Rosen's book is perfectly balanced between scary and laugh-out-loud silly and is sure to be a crowd-pleaser!

He absolutely loved Night of the Living Cuddle Bunnies. I read this book to him. It had been a long time since we both looked forward to reading together at night. Tonight will be a let down since we got to the end of this book last night.My son was engaged the entire time and always wanted to read more. We talked about the book and his comprehension of it was excellent. It is recommended for ages 8-12 and I think that is right on, except that there are a couple of places that insinuate that Santa is not real, and I know some kids in this age group still believe. I was concerned that it might be too scary for my son who gets frightened easily, but the writing style is light and humorous and he was absolutely fine. I would not consider this book to be scary to the recommended age group.The book is action packed with many physical altercations between the main characters and the cuddle bunnies. Usually it is hard for me to follow fights. I'm just not interested in the fight itself, just who wins, but this author made these exchanges amusing. It is a long book, but never has a long book feel. The pace is steady and the writing style is engaging. With warlocks, magic, evil stuffed bunnies that come to life, lots of humor and excitement, amusing family dynamics, entertaining characters, and a witty writing style, I can see Jonathan Rosen's debut novel becoming a best seller. I rarely give a book 5 stars, but this book is worthy.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1762014-erin", "userReview": "Night of the Living Cuddle Bunnies by Jonathan Rosen is a spooky book full of good humor. The story is about a 12-year-old boy named Devin Dexter whose cousin thinks Devin\u2019s new neighbor is a warlock! No one believes them because well kids make up weird stories and come to odd conclusions pretty often. Strange things are amiss like the popular for Christmas stuffed bunny toys coming to life and behaving in dangerous ways!The characters are believable and quite interesting with all their quirks. Throughout the story, kids will have modeled to them the importance of family and friends while working together to save their town, super soakers may be required!Grab a bookmark (if you can put this tale down), a flashlight, and a snuggly spot, this page-turning book is full of adventure, action, humor, and spooky fun! It\u2019s perfect for kids ages 8-12 years old.-Thoughts by our nine-year-old daughter Melody \u2013Night of the Living Cuddle Bunnies is such a cool story. Reading this kinda large book went by so fast because I really enjoyed it. The characters awesomeness made what was going down far more exciting than expected.The story was really interesting. I\u2019ve never read anything like it before. I liked how the characters worked together to save the day.This story would really make a great tv series and a video game.

Hilarious and timely without trying to be, this is a book you should plan to read in one - long - sitting. Rosen's greatest skill, in addition to brilliant concept, is his taking just enough of a character archetype to orient the reader, and twisting him/her into someone memorable, unexpected, and larger than life.
