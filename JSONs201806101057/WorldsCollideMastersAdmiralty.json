Eric has come to London to hire McKay/Taggart/Knight Security for a secret job. Ian is his sarcastically witty self and Penny and Damon are still happily married. Based on this little intro, I am curious about Eric Ericsson and his colorful background with Ian. I may be checking out Carr/Dubios\u2019s series."}, {"userName": "Carole-Ann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4165744-carole-ann", "userReview": "As an introduction to both the Masters & Mercenaries series by Lexi Blake, and the Masters' Admiralty series by Lila Dubois and Marie Carr, this is enough to tempt anyone!!Fine: I'm up to date (almost!) with the M & M series, so looks like I have to buy into the MA one :) ::Phew:: Menage galore to look forward to!!
