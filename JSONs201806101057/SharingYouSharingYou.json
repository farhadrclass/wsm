What do you get when you combine cheating, love triangle, insta-love, and unnecessary drama? I\u2019m pretty sure my angst meter just shot up.Aside from the writing \u2013 both evocative and provocative \u2013 I honestly can\u2019t say anything else stood out to me in a positive way. Besides the heart-clutching angst, this book also has one of the worst cases of insta-love I\u2019ve ever read. The moment Kamryn and Brody meet, rainbows shine and world peace is achieved. Because that\u2019s how strong and powerful their (insta) love is. There is no avoiding the guilt, the lust, the betrayal, and the hiding around when it comes to love triangles so I didn\u2019t dock stars because of that. My main concern is what everyone seems to be doing these days: \nintentionally making the wife (or whoever the third wheel is) the bad guy.\n My favorite parts in the book were actually the times Brody\u2019s wife came into play \u2013 she\u2019s diabolical yet underneath all the craziness I sense a layer of vulnerability. I genuinely felt something for her character and I don\u2019t think she deserves disgust or neglect here; she just needs professional help. I was tempted to give this 1 star but I also recognize the boldness and the guts the author has to write about a controversial topic such as this one. It\u2019s not easy and though I didn\u2019t enjoy this book that much, I do appreciate the effort and the at-times emotional scenes present. I\u2019m certain this story will garner much positivity and attention from longtime fans of this author and anyone else looking for an extremely angsty and bang-your-head-on-the-wall read.Much thanks to Goodreads \u2018Firstreads Program\u2019, the publisher, and the author for providing me a paperback ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "First time reading Mcadams and based on glowing reviews of her mastery at weaving heartrending love triangles I expected.......something more, instead I got an unremarkable story.It boggles that this is based on a true story and while it's not my place to judge, I don't see an upside to infidelity rather it has a direct correlation to how much YOU love YOURSELF.1.

One I read recently is a historical fiction novel called BELOVED ENEMY that involves a love triangle between the heroine, the hero, and the other woman, who is basically the hero's common-law wife. Rather than being infuriated, I found myself fascinated by the characters, especially the OW, who I ended up liking more than the heroine by the end.I had friends who tried to read Molly McAdams's books and ended up hating them because of the cheating (I guess cheating and love triangles are common themes in her books). I told myself, \"Well, okay, maybe this isn't for me - but on the other hand, maybe it is. I won't know unless I give it the old college try.\"Well, I gave it the old college try... and I'm speechless. Because this book lacked nuance. It lacked subtlety. It lacked depth. This is a book about trash people and their attempts to romanticize their selfish, selfish lust as love.KC \"Kamryn\" Cunningham is racehorse royalty. Her trash parents are trying to force her into a marriage with a trash popped-collar sleazebag, and when she catches them all laughing villainously around a table talking about \"merging\" their racehorse empire, that is the last straw. She flees Kentucky for Oregon where she inexplicably has enough funds to not just rent her own apartment but also buy and run her own bakery, with paid employees. Which... okay.Her friend, Kinlee, is happily married, and in the tradition of happily married people everywhere, decides that what her BFF desperately needs is a boyfran. But KC turns down every guy she ever meets... until she meets this one total hottie at her friend's party: the very married Brody Saco.I'd found everything I'd never even known I'd been looking for...in him. I could feel it in the way I felt like I needed to be closer to him than I already was, [...] the way I was physically aching to know everything about him. And yet, I felt like I knew everything there was to know about him, and we still hadn't said a word (29).She literally bumps into him at a party and immediately decides that they're soulmates.WITHOUT. SAYING. A. WORD. TO. HIM. The next 300 pages is just pages and pages of unnecessary trash people drama. KC tells us, over and over, that she can't stand that he's married, that she's going to wait...but oh, she can't wait, she just can't help herself, she's not that kind of girl, she's not like other mistresses, she's a good person...NO. You a cheater.\"I do not want an AFFAIR. I don't know what something between us could be called, but that word doesn't do what's happening between us justice. But I know that my marriage is over, I know I want you more than I want my next breath, and I know I would be insane to walk out that door and away from you\" (57).Still a cheater.\"I wanted to stay away from him, and I tried to start a relationship with you. But after meeting Brody, it was over for me. There is no one in the world who will ever be able to make me feel what he does just by saying my name. Not a day goes by that I don't hate myself for what we're doing. Not a day goes by that I don't hate myself for breaking up someone's marriage even though everyone already knows it was over\" (199).Cheaaaaaaaateeeeeeeer.The sleaze doesn't even wear a wedding ring and the first time he calls the heroine is after midnight because it's booty call o' clock in his trash people calendar, I guess. Literally everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like some creepy excuse that the womanizing d-bag in a Lifetime movie would say to his mistress to string her along. \"Baby, you know I'll leave her, she means nothing to me, I just can't right now, think about us, think about where we'll be in five years...\"LIES.You're probably wondering about the other woman. Where does she fit into this? Well, the author decided to put KC on a pedestal by making the wife as crazy and unlikable as possible. She drains Brody's bank accounts to buy useless trash. She threatens to commit suicide. She mocks Brody about their child's death and then blames it on him. She lies to her parents that he's abusing her and planning to kill her. They then get a lawyer to blackmail him into staying with her and try to get him fired from his job. Oh, and it turns out that she's been cheating this whole time, too, but with more than one person instead of her #Soulmate, so she's a slut, but KC is the savior of the hero.And that is literally how it's framed. Olivia, the wife, got pregnant so he would marry her, used the child for blackmail to get him to leave the Army, and then leveraged said child's death to force him to stay with her, with threats to harm herself thrown in for fun. All of Brody's relatives and friends have been trying to get him to stray from the marriage for years, despite the fact that he's married, and everyone praises KC when they find out that she's sleeping with Brody because his marriage is \"killing him.\" Throughout the book, everyone talks about how \"bad\" divorce is, including Queen Trash herself, AKA, KC. Which, okay, divorce is not great - but if you're that miserable and you're living in a marriage filled with abuse - you should leave. I know it isn't easy, that sometimes it's incredibly difficult, but it just made me so sick that Brody decided to drag someone else down into that toxic environment with him instead of freaking doing something about it. I thought it was ridiculous how Brody knew that his wife had mental issues, but didn't think about getting her help until it became a convenient excuse for him to leave his wife for KC. Yes, she was \"faking\" having bipolar disorder... but if someone is pulling those kinds of stunts they probably have other issues. Olivia is a trash person but so is Brody for letting these issues fester & cheating.Oh, and then the piece of trash totally goes alpha-ape-shit whenever someone flirts with KC, and when he finds out who she reaaaaaally is towards the end, guess who suddenly gets all preachy about fakery and lies? Like he didn't just spend 80% of the book blissfully swimming in his own sea of deception and lies to cheat on his wife. I'M SORRY I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF THE TRASH.In the foreword and afterword, the author says that this romance is based on a true story (the foreword appears to be written by the couple in question themselves). I'm not sure how many liberties she took with the story - I imagine a lot, hopefully, to protect the identities of those involved - and I'm not going to pass judgement on the author's friends, because, you know - you do you. It's nice that the author stuck by her friends. But these characters, the fictional counterparts, are trash people. I hated Brody. I hated KC. I hated Olivia. I hated KC's family. The only people I liked were Kinlee and Jace and I felt sorry for Aiden, because he seemed like a great guy and it sucks for him that he fell for a trash person. Molly McAdams writes very well, and except for some parts towards the ends where I skimmed, I found myself unable to look away from this train wreck. But man, I hated these characters so, so much and can't quite bring myself to give this book anything higher than a 1*.1 star"}, {"userName": "Kellie Maddox-Ward", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309666-kellie-maddox-ward", "userReview": "Sorry guys can't say yet! - Will post tomorrow..

Sharing You was one of the worst books I have ever read. I know a lot of people have a love/hate relationship with Molly McAdams\u2019 books and after reading this one, I can certainly see why.I knew going into this one that it was about cheating and that I have issues with cheating. However, I had just finished another book about cheating that was done rather tastefully and didn\u2019t feature any physical cheating. I hoped for a similar type of story with Sharing You but that was so not the case. Sharing You was completely tasteless when it came to the cheating aspect and it played a huge role in the story. I kid you not, the two main characters were sleeping with each other within a few weeks of meeting each other, all while one of them was married. I get that you can be unhappy in your relationship but that is no excuse for cheating. How hard is it to get a freaking divorce before you start sleeping with some random chick you just met?Also, let me tell you about the worst case of insta-love ever. Yeah, it\u2019s in this book. Kamryn and Brody bump into each other in the hallway and are immediately drawn to each other and neither of them even know why! They can\u2019t explain it and they don\u2019t even try to. They just immediately decide they have to be together even though Brody is married. I could not even understand why they were together. As the book progressed I continued to wonder what it was they saw in each other. It never became clear to me.As for the whole horrible, manipulative wife situation; it got old really fast. Molly McAdams painted Olivia as this horrible villain that nobody could possibly like and I guess she figured that that would help readers justify the fact that Brody cheated on her. It didn\u2019t. Brody kept saying he was going to leave Olivia but that she was depressed and suicidal and he couldn\u2019t leave her until he got her help. Then he decided that she was just manipulative and he was going to leave her without getting her help. Then he decided not to leave her because she really did need help. This went on and on and on. The book could have been so much shorter if Brody would have just made up his mind to leave Olivia.Oh and don\u2019t even get me started on Kamryn. She was the whiniest, neediest, most annoying character ever. All she did was cry. Holy crap I have never read a book with more crying. And it was always over the same things. Brody had to go home to Olivia, she didn\u2019t get to spend enough time with Brody, she couldn\u2019t tell anyone about her and Brody, etc. Maybe if you weren\u2019t sleeping with a married man you wouldn\u2019t have these problems. I felt absolutely no sympathy for her. She was just annoying to read about.Overall, I\u2019m amazed I even finished Sharing You. I honestly can\u2019t tell you why I kept reading. There is nothing about this book to redeem it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this even if you had nothing else to read. Skip this one and try something else by Molly McAdams."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12432215-jenn", "userReview": "I hope I'm not being too subtle."}, {"userName": "Christine Wallflower & Dark Romance Junkie ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11641363-christine-wallflower-dark-romance-junkie", "userReview": "I may have lost the plot"}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "DNF at 35%I rarely hate a book, this one is special.

Here you have a guy, Brody Saco, who married his high school sweetheart because she got pregnant. Then tragedy strikes and six years later, he finds himself trapped in an unhappy marriage with an unstable and psychotic wife.And as luck would have it, in comes the light to his dark and depressing world, and he finds himself succumbing the second chance to redeem himself and fall in love.So who\u2019s this mystery lady that has stolen his heart and given him hope at redemption? Why, she is: Kamryn Cunningham.So... Kamryn or \"KC\" as she goes by.Having been born into wealth and privilege, Kamryn is what you could say, belongs to the royal family of the racing world. But, when your life is made up for you and controlled, even your future spouse and place in life, a girl has got to take matters into her own hands. So what does she do?  She runs away across the country and disguises her identity to start over on her terms. Ingenious, huh?But when one of your best friend\u2019s brother in law catches your eye and just so happens to be married, will this end well for Kamryn and Brody or crumble to pieces? Read and you will find out!My thoughts: It\u2019s kind of like I said in the beginning of my review, I can actually see scenarios of what goes on here happening in real life minus Kamryn going into hiding from her own family and trying to hide who she is.For Brody\u2019s marriage and wife going down the destructive path: well, first thing\u2019s first: it\u2019s easy to picture a guy \u201cmanning up\u201d to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and feel that it is his duty to marry the woman that you knocked up. It\u2019s what a lot of guys do these days. As for Brody\u2019s wife: YES, she is over the top and bat sh*# crazy like many needy and overzealous wives or girlfriends BUT she does have her reasons. You can't COMPLETELY hate her for it. She just needs help.And LASTLY. As for Brody getting involved with Kamryn: as the saying goes, \u201cyou can\u2019t help who you love\u201d or who you let into your heart. He and his wife were not \u201cgellin\u2019\u201d and when he found someone who could make him happy (and vice versa), he went for it. Reluctantly, in the beginning of course.

Kamryn's friends are trying to set her up with a guy (super hot of course,) but she declines and blows him off because she can't get Brody off her mind (at this point, I don't think they had even said one word to each other.) I wanted to bang my head against the wall. Insta-love is a total turn off for me...and that's why I originally put this book down.After going back to it, I decided to pull through and finish it. I'm not a quitter, and the writing wasn't bad...it's just that everything was over the top. I felt like I needed a bottle of wine just to get through it (and not in a good way.)Brody is married, of course, and his wife is the worst kind of person. Manipulative, psychotic, dramatic...I literally wish she was a real person so I could grab her and shake her. Kamryn knows that Brody is married and decides she still can't live without him (this is after the 3rd time they've seen each other.)They both feel terrible about not being able to stay away from each other, but yet they still partake in an extra-marital affair. Brody goes to Kamryn's house to \"hang out\"... They kept telling each other they were going to take things slow, but on the 3rd consecutive night of Brody going to Kamryn's, they decide they can't do \"slow\" and end up having sex.After that, everything basically imploded. The wife continued to manipulate Brody. He would tell Kamryn he was filing for divorce and then never go through with it. So many things were working against them. I honestly felt like throwing my iPad for 90% of this story because it was all so stupid and overly dramatic. This is the soap opera of books.Normally, I like a little bit of drama, but in true Molly McAdams style, everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. At some point you have to sit back and ask yourself \"why?\" It was all too much. After about 2/3 of the book, I ended up skimming the rest. Brody was a good guy in my eyes...not too possessive, but he was a complete pushover when it came to the wife.When Brody and Kamryn would get together, Brody's wife would inevitably call him, screaming at him for not being home and he obviously had to go tend to her to keep the affair secret, but then Kamryn would cry and beg for him to stay. HE IS MARRIED! YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO! Brody couldn't very well stay with Kamryn when his wife was getting suspicious. Not to mention the fact that Kamryn and Brody had unprotected sex from the beginning just because they both told each other they were clean. What kind of person has unprotected sex with somebody they just met? I literally couldn't wrap my head around it.Not to mention this entire book builds up for \"is he going to file for divorce or nah?\" and when he finally files for divorce, we get a couple chapters of Brody and Kamryn being together, but never find out what happened with the divorce proceedings?!?! Not that I cared at that point...I just didn't understand why all of the buildup for nothing?This book is a 1 star for me. Too much drama and insta-love."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10770279-beth", "userReview": "4 Runaway StarsRemember when you were a kid and wanted to run away from home? You would pack a bag with the essentials like a book, a clean pair of socks, and a box of Captain Crunch. Then you would head out to the great unknown. Until dinner time. And then you headed home because you had made your point. They knew you meant business now. Kamryn is having the same issues. She decides to run away from home. Except her issues are a little bigger. She is miserable at home. Her rich, successful parents treat her like one of their racehorses to be sold and used as a brood mare. ...as the only daughter of the perfect power couple, I was expected to be perfect as well. Kamryn can't allow that to happen. She has already given them 6 years of letting them be in charge. Now she really does mean business. And she is running away to prove it. Brody is living a nightmare. He is married to his high school sweetheart who is anything but a sweet heart. In fact...she is bat-shit-crazy. Notice the handcuffs on the cover. Those aren't for fun and games. Those are the emotional and mental handcuffs that keep Brody tied to her and freakin' miserable. When Brody and Kamryn meet it is the stuff of Disney movies. Birds sing. The sun comes out from behind the clouds. Squirrels dance in the mist. Ok, so there aren't actual dancing squirrels, but you get the picture.....they are meant to be. This was fairy tale shit, this kind of thing didn't happen in real life. Except, it just had. And the man was married. Stop the dancing squirrels. He is MARRIED. As in Taken. Attached. Legally bonded to another. Don't forget the bat-shit crazy part. And the wifey is not the only one feeling a bit of the Cra-Cra. Kamryn does not want to be that woman. It is not in her to be the \"other woman\". She knows that is wrong. And Brody? He has been eaten up with guilt for years. So this just adds to the Guilt Pudding that going on in his head. ...I want you more than I want my next breath, and I know I would be insane to walk away from you.This is not going to be your typical romance read. The happy endings possible here are at the expense of others. Is the wife really crazy or just the most manipulative bitch ever? Can all the parents really be that self centered? And the friends and family that do care for Kamryn and Brody....how are they going to handle the moral dilemma? I predict this book will get a lot of people talking. There are some elements of the story that many people do not want in their reading. But they will miss out on another Molly McAdams fan-tab-u-read. We are all a little older and more mature here, so I am going to say pack your shredded wheat instead of Captain Crunch, even though the Captain is the bomb, and run away to your favorite quiet spot for a few hours of reading pleasure.

They see each other and instantly fall in love without knowing a thing about one another. A little unbelievable for me, but whatever.Then, they dive head-first into an affair. They both feel guilty...but not that guilty or they wouldn't be doing it. I'm not defending Brody's psycho nut job wife, by any means. Olivia was as manipulative as they come, but it isn't like KC or Brody really put any effort into trying to fight their attraction, so the guilt was a little hard to believe.There were several elements that seemed to be built up really big and then just fall flat. I anticipated that Aiden would become more of a contender, but he didn't. There was a lot of drama and threats toward Brody if he filed for divorce. He did. Nothing came of it.

First encounter they decide they want to pursue a relationship with each other.....but he's already MARRIED!!! He tells her he will leave his wife, he only stayed because she has been unstable after losing their child. I gave up when he sleeps with Kamryn and immediately leaves when his wife calls. This quote sums up what I disliked about the book. Never once in the five years had I thought of leaving Olivia. Through all the bullshit, heart-ache, and grief, I'd remained faithful to a wife whom I no longer loved....and who had probably never even loved me.....because I felt like I owed it to her. But the second I saw Kamryn everything in my life changed. To find someone who could change me so completely before I even heard her speak was a gift that I would have been blind to not accept.

How can two people who have never met or known each other exist before fall this deeply in love just 2 seconds after they first met?

I haven\u2019t read a Molly McAdam\u2019s novel since the disastrous time I had with Taking Chances but I still wanted to give this author another try. So when the opportunity came to read Sharing You, I jumped at it, even though it did take me a little while to get to it. I\u2019m just going to say it, I didn\u2019t hate Sharing You but I certainly didn\u2019t love it either. I actually liked the characters but it was the plot of the story I had an issue with. I just don\u2019t think it was very believable. It\u2019s one of them that unless you\u2019ve experienced something like it \u2013 insta-love, insta-attraction, fate, whatever you want to call it \u2013 first hand, you\u2019re probably not going to believe the story. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t believe in fate but I am an unbeliever of insta-love especially from the first moment you meet someone because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced nor, do I know anyone who has experienced it for themselves. This is the story for Sharing You \u2013 two characters meeting and the first time is so intense that they know they\u2019re meant for each other regardless of the obstacles in the way. I know the author has written this story about witnessing a couple go through the same thing and I applauded her, but I feel like she\u2019s written a story not many people will relate to, therefore many people may not enjoy it. Like I said before, I did actually like the characters despite the insta-love. Kamyrn and Brody have both have difficult lives and I could definitely sympathise with it. It\u2019s one of the reasons I kept reading. I wanted to see how their relationship developed after their first meeting and more so how the story ends. The cheating part of the story didn\u2019t really bother me. Brody was in an unhappy married were he was manipulated by his wife; I do wish he had the strength to do the right thing because of how unhappy he was. In all, Sharing You wasn\u2019t the best story I\u2019ve read but it\u2019s one I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve read and I still haven\u2019t written Molly McAdam\u2019s off completely yet, despite my issues with the story.

Many of you know Molly's books Taking Chances and Stealing Harper were the first books ever to make me ugly cry. I am not a crier when it comes to books, I am a visual person so movies will set my tears off easily as opposed to a book. But sure enough, those books by McAdams finally crack me open. I was devastated and had the worse emotional book hangover ever. I loved the books but admit they were painful. So of course I was already imagining Sharing You tearing me apart emotionally. Thank goodness it didn't. Everything within the pages I was able to handle and enjoy every page I turned.Sharing You is the story of Kamryn, she leaves everything behind to move away from her life to Oregon. Where no one knows her or her past life. She opened a bakery and alters her name a bit, so they don't recognize she is that Kamryn Cunningham, Horse-racing world royalty. She could care less about all that, since its brought her nothing but heartache and nightmares. She just wants a fresh start and do what she loves to do, Bake. KC as those have grown to know her in Oregon, keeps avoiding the suitors that her best friend keeps trying to set her up with. Then one day when she visits her best friends house where once again she is trying to set her up, KC practically runs into her best friend husband's brother. KC's world has just rocked to epic proportions. She can't deny the gravitational pull she has towards Brody. But fates have different plans, because Brody is married. Cue pouty face while reading at this point, lol. Yea he is off the market. Problem is that Brody might be married, but its a unhealthy marriage since the beginning. Brody's wife does not care for him and lives this fantasy life without Brody in the equation. Why hasn't he divorced her? Well Brody holds himself accountable for a tragedy in their lives and believes he is the one that has to work at getting is wife help. It's extremely dysfunctional and has torn away at Brody's life. Picture two magnets in your hands and they are north and south polarities, its almost impossible to keep them apart from connecting with one another. Well that would be KC and Brody, they fight and fight the pull, but the force to pull them together is much stronger then their fight. Sharing You affects may lives in this book, and you might not agree with certain situation that take places and others might leave you crushed, but I promise you will love this story.

She landed in a smalltown called Jetson and opened her own bakery and went just by the name of KC. Here she meet Kinlee and her husband Jace and for the next eight months, she lived to blend in and had strict rules. That all went out the window though , when she met Jace's brother Brody Saco. She felt this instant soulmate connection with him and he felt the same , the problem though is that he is married to Olivia. Brody and Olivia were high school sweethearts and when Olivia fell pregnant , Brody did the right thing and married her. All was going well until the accident and their son died. Now for the past five years Brody and Olivia have been going through the motions and living in a hate relationship. I hated the character Olivia as she was a right manipulative cow , as the story goes on we see that Olivia envies the Cunningham Family and wants to be just like the daughter Kamryn. What she doesn't realise though is that Kamryn wants the exact opposite and is happy living her simple no-strings and no-fuss life . During the majority of the book , we read as KC and Brody can't keep their hands off each other and start to work a plan of action which involves Brody divorcing Olivia's sorry ass. What will happen though when Brody realises KC's true identity and blames her for the way Olivia has turned out and lumps KC in the same box of spoilt rich brat whose family will look down on him and like Olivia she will grow to resent him for holding her back. Can KC share her inner thoughts with Brody and let him know the truth , that she is nothing like that and that she wants her forever to be with Brody , the Bakery and her newfound friends ?As always as a reader, Molly McAdams is one of those authors who you can't help but love her books to pieces as they target edgy situations but examples of true soulmate love that us girls swoon at as we read through the pages."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829373-heather", "userReview": "Nobody does a love triangle as well as Molly McAdams!

If you're not a fan of infidelities, well, the blurb for the book tells you this book had it so this may not be one for you. But for me, while I don't condone cheating under any circumstances, it had it's place in this story and brought a different perspective to the romance between Brody and Kamryn.Brody and Kamyrn were both dealing with different things in their lives when they met. The attraction and feeling of coming home between the two of them was instant. So immediate that when it happened in the story it felt like you were standing in the room watching it happen. It was that tangible. But we knew Brody was married, no matter how unhappily, and Kamryn wasn't the type of person to break up a marriage. She may lust for him, but she wasn't going to be that woman. So I was torn when they gave into their attraction. On one hand, I wanted them together, but on the other I wanted Brody to do the right thing and be rid of Olivia before they started anything. But timing isn't always perfect and you can't always control your feelings, I get that. And we knew how each of them struggled with the decision they made. Brody hated putting Kamryn in the situation as the \"other woman\" while he tried to get his wife help and Kamryn hated being the other woman and breaking up a marriage she knew was basically over. As they struggled and fought to keep what they had, it did allow for (as a reader) to truly understand that these two were meant to be together. I may not agree with how they started their relationship, but being together definitely brought life back into each character. Brody becoming more the man he was before and Kamryn able to rid herself of her Kentucky racing roots and just being herself. And when you see this side of Brody and Kamryn it's hard to not to like them together and want them to figure this out.Evil has a new name and it's Olivia Reynolds Saco. She was freaking crazy and the main reason I wanted to chuck my Kindle across the room at various points and time. Holy mother of God, this woman was pure evil. She was manipulative, vindictive and borderline psychotic. They way she controlled Brody by using his grief was hateful and made me wish she was real so some sort of bodily harm to could to her. I wanted this woman to suffer for what she put Brody through. Actually, both her and her sadistic parents. That's my only regret with this book. Just divorcing the crazy bitch wasn't enough for me. Brody deserved to get some kind of justice when he finally rid himself of the Reynolds clan. Sure, he got the love of his life, but that just didn't seem like enough (yes, I'm blood thirsty and I'm not embarrassed to say it).This was another great Molly McAdams book. She always managed to evoke such emotions from me as a reader, that I enjoy discovering what kind of ride I'm going to be on. If you don't mind the infidelity, this is absolutely a book you should read. At it's core, it's about overcoming your past and fighting for your future, something that this couple definitely needed to do to get that much sought after HEA."}, {"userName": "Brandee - Brandee's Book Endings", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3762989-brandee---brandee-s-book-endings", "userReview": "NOW LIVE: Amazon: http://amzn.to/1sVrQOLI went into this one blind without reading the blurb .... just signed up to review. I really enjoyed this quick read. It was not super heavy, I liked the characters (most of them... the ones i was supposed to) and liked the story. Afterwards I read the blurb to get a feel for what others may think. I know there are those who cannot stomach cheating in a book, but with reading this one, I could not see it as really cheating.... At least not in a normal circumstance. Star-crossed lovers, Love triangle, conniving wife and infidelity. Well, that makes it sound really bad! LOL Rest assured that if anyone can pull these topics off without you totally losing your mind, it is Molly McAdams. This book can be read as a stand-alone and does not have a cliffhanger.Even though it drives me mad and I can\u2019t deal with the angst \u2013 it is my guilty pleasure and I just can\u2019t help myself to read them and get totally wrapped up in the drama they cause. Cheating\u2026 another one of those no no topics, BUT, AGAIN, Molly made it work. Once you read and are in the middle of everything that brings them to that point, I don\u2019t think you will be minding that much anymore.As many that have read a Molly McAdams book already, they are probably worried about their hearts being RIPPED out of their chests and take stock out on tissues since you expect the whole ugly cry, but this is not one of those books.While I did read the Sharing You Prequel \u201cSharing Firsts\u201d that was in the Fifty First Times sequel \u2013 and you get to meet the majority of the characters in this series briefly, I did not read Capturing Peace yet, as I did not realize that it was a prequel novella to Sharing You, however I understand that we met the male main character Brody in that Novella \u2013 as he was one of the characters in the story, but it is not necessary to read Capturing Peace or Sharing First before reading Sharing You. I was not lost at all \u2013 so I think you can start with either book first.I really enjoyed this book even though it did have cheating, I totally did not feel bad about it \u2013 and I don\u2019t think you would either! There is so much more to the story than cheating, so don\u2019t worry. The chemistry and connection between Brody and KC and you will want them together too.This is a well-written book and you will sympathize with the characters and will be hoping that everyone gets their happily ever after \u2013 well except one particular woman\u2026..I can\u2019t wait to read more about these characters, now I have to go back and read Capturing Peace! So, if you love a good angsty book with a love triangle, this book is for you and you should definitely pick it up!"}], "description": "Twenty-three year old, Kamryn Cunningham has left all she\u2019s ever known and moved to a small town where no one knows her name, who her parents are, or her social status in the horseracing world.

Kamryn fights the instant pull between them because there\u2019s a detail she can\u2019t dismiss. Brody\u2019s married.To say that twenty-six year old, Brody Saco has had a rough marriage would be an understatement. After marrying his pregnant girlfriend, he spends the next six years in a relationship filled with hatred, manipulation and guilt involving a tragedy that happened five years earlier. When he keeps running into his sister-in-law\u2019s best friend, Kamryn, he can\u2019t ignore that she makes him feel more with just one look than his wife ever has; and soon he can\u2019t continue fight his feelings for her.When staying apart proves to be too difficult, Brody and Kamryn enter a relationship full of stolen moments and nights that end too soon while they wait for Brody to file for divorce. But the guilt that comes with their relationship may prove to be too much for Kamryn, and Brody might not be strong enough to face the tragedy from his past in order to leave his conniving wife.", "title": "Sharing You\n      \n          (Sharing You #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17305444-sharing-you", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1395888429l/17305444.jpg", "reviews": 522, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6436698.Molly_McAdams", "name": "Molly McAdams"}], "type": ["New Adult", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17305444-sharing-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18883434-sharing-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18655881-sharing-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15739018-taking-chances", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16122163-from-ashes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607319-stealing-harper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17264459-forgiving-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17860194-deceiving-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40494988-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
