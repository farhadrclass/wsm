This book was so shallow I'm surprised it came from Debbie Macomber. The story line was high school at best and the Jo Marie saga is just that. A never ending saga that is repetative and honestly has become boring.The two guests at the Inn in this installment had no depth and were one dimensional. I almost felt like this should be a YA book. All the books lately seem to have the same plot. Girl dislikes/doesn't trust/is out for revenge on boy. Boy has no clue as to why. Something happens and they end up together. I'm all for happy endings but some twists and turns to bring interest to how we get there is what makes a good book.Sad to say I'm done. I cannot justify my time reading a go nowhere series that is so light it could float. Ms. Macomber has come a far ways from the Cedar Cove series that stole my heart years ago. Unfortunately she's gone the wrong way."}, {"userName": "Dixie-Lee Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23130566-dixie-lee-campbell", "userReview": "I just finished Silver Linings.

I received this ARC for free through Goodreads First Reads. TO MY PLEASANT surprise, the Silver Linings is a heartwarming story about forgiveness and healing. It is uplifting and will leave you feeling warmed and comforted.Innkeeper Jo Marie Rose has always been fond of her handyman, Mark Taylor, but in a platonic way \u2013 or so she thought. When he reveals that he is in love with her, she comes to realize that he means more to her than she\u2019s willing to admit. As she struggles with her newfound feelings, she welcomes two visitors. Coco Crenshaw and Katie Gilroy are in Cedar Grove to attend their 10-year high school reunion hoping to confront old ghosts and find closure.There are several reasons why I didn\u2019t rate this book higher. 1) Jo Marie\u2019s story is told in her own voice. Whereas Coco and Katie\u2019s vignettes are done in third person. This was distracting and the transitions were jarring. 2) The story centers mostly on the events at the high school reunion with too much immature high school-like dramas. 3) Coco\u2019s confrontation with her ghost was short-lived and anticlimatic. And, her encounter with an old crush immediately following her \u201chealing\u201d was a little too picture perfect.Despite these things, I couldn\u2019t put the book down. And now I know why. Somehow and somewhere, Katie wiggled her way into my heart and I couldn\u2019t help but adore her warmth, depth, and sacrifice. Oh, you are tricky Ms. Macomber, but in a good way.Katie\u2019s story is my silver lining. She came to the reunion with her heart in her hands to find forgiveness from the one person she\u2019s ever truly loved \u2013 James Harper. Ms. Macomber could not have written a character more perfect and sweet than James. Now 10 years later, Katie needs to let him know why she broke his heart. She needs him to understand. She needs his forgiveness. Can the boy she loved, and still loves, forgive her?\u2026of all the girls in school, he\u2019d chosen her. He\u2019d loved her \u2013 deeply, profoundly loved her \u2013 more than anyone before."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23016460-amber", "userReview": "When Mark leaves Cedar Cove for good, it breaks Jo Marie Rose's heart that he never cared about their friendship or anything.

I have never read any of this author's book, and after reading this book I want to go back and read all of the books in this series. Well written, this book made me cry all throughout and had many surprising twists and turns. What I thought would happen, especially at the reunion, didn't happen. It continues the story of Jo Marie and tells the story of guests Coco and Katie. Jo Marie finally decides it's time to move on, only to discover that she has to mourn the loss of someone else. Coco and Katie attend their high school reunion with the hope of confronting and reconnecting with people from their pasts, except things don't go the way they each envisioned. It was nice reading a love story that doesn't have the gratuitous sex and the excessive language. I was kind of disappointed with the way Katie's story ended. I felt like it ended too soon.

This is definitely a novel with heart. Macomber takes readers back to the beautify Rose Harbor in for a story packed full of emotion & discovery. Jo Marie\u2019s brief narration of her new life also makes this a good starting point for new readers to the series. The reason for the name of the inn is fantastic. With just two words Macomber connects the entire novel (and the series) together. It sets the scene for what has happened and what will happen. I really enjoyed how this novel wasn\u2019t a rushed weekend of rejuvenation. These characters took much longer to get there. Being able to follow each of them throughout their journey truly inspired me. I really enjoy how Macomber focuses not only on Jo Marie\u2019s life but also on those of her guests. The intersections of everyone\u2019s lives gives a sense of continuity. The different tone of the writing as Macomber writes about the three major characters\u2019 current life events really makes each of them stand out. I love how their stories weave together. My final thoughts on this one? Oh my goodness! Mark! Macomber has me so fully entrenched in this world and the lives of her characters that my heart is pounding out of my chest & I\u2019m dying to see how this all plays out."}, {"userName": "Amanda McGill", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32377593-amanda-mcgill", "userReview": "The fourth novel of the Rose Harbor series. I really enjoyed reading Debbie Macombers novels. You knew what you were going to get and it was nice to revisit old characters. I feel that I need something more from a novel now and I think I am giving up on Cedar Cove for now. Silver Linings brought you back to Cedar Cove and the Rose Harbor Inn. I found this novel to be disappointing. The 2 guests were in their late 20s back for a high school reunion. They still added like they were teenagers and I got quite annoyed very quickly. I didn't like the story line with Jo Marie since it didn't really progress. It got quite boring. Overall, this is a perfect novel for fans of the series and Debbie Macomber. However, I no longer think I am either. *Side note: It really bothered me that Macomber spelt Lizzie Mcguire as Lizzy Mcguire, but that's just me :)"}, {"userName": "Vi~Inkvotary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36290462-vi-inkvotary", "userReview": "Inkvotary4,5 starsDebbie Macomber YOU ARE KILLING ME!

Jo Marie learns that Marks decision is final and that his preparation are going on while she tries everything to keep him in Cedar Cove. Not happening, that I can tell you. The author kept her beautiful writing-style in this novel as well and it was a wonderful journey to see how all the different relationships were unfolding and going on.

Just ick. The Jo Marie/ Mark saga once again drags on and on. The guests at Jo's Inn were annoying as hell. Seriously, you're 10 years out of high school and you still want revenge on a boy? Grow up. High school sucked, move on.It was so bad, I couldn't wade through it and I finally skipped to the end, just to have it done with.I've long been a Debbie Macomber fan, up until now, I've read every book in her multiple series. The ending of this book ended that. It pissed me off enough that I will probably never read another book by this author.First there was the oh so convenient HAE for the stuck in high school girls. But what really left a sour taste was the cliff hanger ending for Jo Marie and Mark. What I have always liked about book series is the fact that we get to meet the same characters throughout, but each book is its own stand alone chapter that furthers the series. With this series, not only has there been little to no progress with the main characters, now it feels to me that the author isn't sure enough of their appeal and her writing to believe that readers will pick up the next in the series because they want/need more, so she had to forcefully create that need with a cliff hanger.But as far as I am concerned, Jo Marie can continue being a wishy-washy widow, wringing her hands and Mark can fall off that cliff and stay/die in Afghanistan!

I felt the relationship between Jo Marie and Mark hard to believe since I think he would have just told her the truth about why he had to leave. The story of Katie and James also seems off, that she would wait ten years to find James and tell him what happened is unrealistic.

Award-Winning author, Debbie Macomber  returns with her much awaited charming Cedar Cove Rose Harbor Inn series, with the fourth installment, SILVER LININGS\u2014a heartwarming story of second chances in this idyllic town of special unforgettable characters. Having read all the previous books in the Rose Harbor Series,a delight to catch up with familiar characters. Recommend reading all! When First They Met (Rose Harbor #0.5)The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1)Lost and Found in Cedar Cove (Rose Harbor, #1.5)Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor, #2)Love Letters (Rose Harbor #3)Jo Marie  is settling in with her bed and breakfast inn business, she purchased after her husband, Paul was killed in action, serving his country. We met mysterious handyman Mark Taylor who seems to intrigue Jo, and also a comfort to her, at the same time. They have become good friends, even though he is not forthcoming about his past, very rough around the edges. Now, he has shared  his feelings for her and she is starting to care, when he abruptly decides he is selling his house and leaving town with no reason. Mark does not think he is good enough for Jo Marie and she deserves better. Jo Marie is shocked by his behavior.

Both women are living in the past regarding past loves and hurts. Things are not as simple as they had anticipated.Best friends Kellie  (Coco) Crenshaw and Katie Gilroy are back in town for their ten-year high school reunion. Angry, and ready to face this guy from the past. They both have expectations, while nervous about reconnecting with their past loves. Coco wants to confront a guy who broke her heart.

In addition, we visit with Peggy, Bob and some familiar characters who drop in.Fans will enjoy learning  about Mark\u2019s mysterious past, at last. As always, enjoy returning to the stunning waterfront town, of Cedar Cove. So excited about the Hallmark series returning and the cast of characters in this charming idyllic town- drawing you back time and time again. I love the Puget Sound area- the last time I was in the area, stayed at a charming inn overlooking the water; what beautiful scenery! Debbie always brings life to her well-developed characters; hope, renewal and lives which connect. Appears with the cliffhanger ending, there will be another installment, so looking forward to seeing what is next in store for Jo Marie! I enjoyed Jo and Mark\u2019s story more so than the high school crushes. In addition to the paperback book, I also purchased the audiobook, which I thoroughly enjoyed narrated by Lorelei King (one of my favorite performers),  and the author, Debbie Macomber\u2014 for an engaging experience.On a personal side note:  Most of my followers of my blog and Goodreads\u2019 friends are aware, I seldom read women\u2019s fiction, and chick-lit, as lean towards thrillers, mysteries, and psychological suspense. There are a few authors, I have read for years, and remain a faithful fan-- Debbie is one of them--she never disappoints.  I devour books about bed and breakfast inns, since I have been a consultant for inns and hotels, traveling nationwide for the last 20 years. Set in beautiful spots, I have worked with investors, and private owners, before purchasing the properties, with city review, business planning, marketing, interior design, websites, staging, and photography. An array of clients, from small to large properties (so much fun). Having been an onsite innkeeper for many boutique historic properties\u2014 B&B inns, cottages, suites, and cafes. (A lot of work; however, rewarding). There is always plenty of juicy stories, drama, and lots of unique special people, you meet along the way. When traveling, I prefer to stay at quaint charming inns, and still have a few inn clients, facilitating their online marketing and websites, which keep me connected!

This read will leave you with some high emotions where one may find themselves laughing to even finding some sad moments.I liked how this author was able to give us a good story involving Jo Marie and her handy man, Mark which ended up with some surprise that will keep your attention turning the pages getting answers [wanting to know what is up with Mark]...oh well...I guess we will have to wait for that answer to just what secret is Mark keeping from Jo Marie?Then there were Jo Marie's best friends Kellie and Katie who have return to Cedar Cove for their 10 year HS reunion. Would they be able to 'face down old hunts and find a sense of closure?' Now, to me I will say this was to me some what strange in how all that comes out but OK..with each one having a problem they hope to solve at this reunion. Now, will this happen...or will they leave this reunion with broken hearts?All of this author's characters seem to come alive as the reader will be presented with such a well written story that will keep you turning the pages. This was quite a interesting read where you will find a story of 'letting go of the past and embracing the unexpected.' I did like the way this author was able to tie these three stories together where the reader will be able to see how they come together by the end of the read where they may find healing and comfort. \"Silver Lining\" can be a standalone read but I think it's best to get the other three series for a better understanding of what has gone on earlier. If you are in for a read of love, forgiveness and second chances then you are at the right place and I would recommend this novel for you.
