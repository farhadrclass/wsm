And even though it\u2019s spoiler free, I still feel gross posting it so early because this book doesn\u2019t come out until 2019. So, I scheduled it on my blog for August 27th, my birthday, and I will also post it on here then too. Because I honestly can\u2019t think of a better way of celebrating than sharing my love for this once in a lifetime series. But I promise you this: you don\u2019t want to miss out on this book.

After all, the strength of this series is in a large part in its plot twists and turns. So I'll keep the story details to a minimum I guess.It's 5 months after the ending of the The Cruel Prince. Jude is mostly preoccupied with keeping Cardan on the throne and under her control for a time much longer than a year and a day. Both goals are hard to achieve - there are various factions scheming to take the crown from Cardan, and he himself isn't too thrilled to be a puppet (well, unless this puppet makes out with his puppeteer, then he seems to like it just fine;0). Indeed, it is much harder to hold on to power than to usurp it. The structure of The Wicked King mirrors that of its prequel. It's kind of slow (on drama) in the beginning, with Jude trying to balance all the players in her game. I was entertained, but also a bit tired out by Jude's frenetic, restless search for solutions to multiple problems (that girl gets no break!). I wanted some rest and a bit more... meat in the story maybe, some more world-building, flash-backs or deep back stories, anything to divert me from Jude's constant state of anxiety. I never got that break. What I did get was more drama and heartache closer to the end. That ending was a real punch in the gut, and I loved it (I do like to suffer and be mad though). Kudos to Holly Black for holding my attention way into the 3rd book of this series. I am not sure what I want the ending to be exactly at this point. I am going to settle for JUDE+CARDAN=FRVR for now? P.S. Publishers need to stop releasing ARCs so early. OMG! So much longer to wait for The Queen of Nothing. (yes, first world problems, I know).P.P.S. Some people in this series are incorrigibly crap!

To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.", "title": "The Wicked King\n      \n          (The Folk of the Air #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032887-the-wicked-king", "average": 4.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520620414l/26032887.jpg", "reviews": 256, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25422.Holly_Black", "name": "Holly Black"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032887-the-wicked-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38237340-the-wicked-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46777.Tithe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12813630-the-coldest-girl-in-coldtown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578940-the-iron-trial", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/283494.Ironside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
