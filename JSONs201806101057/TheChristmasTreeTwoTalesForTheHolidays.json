{"ratings": 23, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Mj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706631-mj", "userReview": "The Christmas Tree: Two Tales for the Holidays is a small Christmas book, in both length and page size. It has 64 pages and includes a 6-page introduction and 2 short stories. I was looking for some Christmas books and found this one by David Adams Richards. He is a Canadian multi-award winning author, who grew up in the province of New Brunswick.The stories seem very autobiographical and take place in Richards\u2019 hometown near the great Miramichi River. One short story, Carmichael\u2019s Dog took place when Richards was between 6 and 8 years of age. The other called The Christmas Tree took place when Richards was in his early twenties and returned to this childhood town to visit his mother for Christmas.Richards\u2019 6 page introduction is very reflective of a time gone by and a neighbourhood and community that no longer exists. It was my favourite part of the book and worth reading at Christmas just for Richards\u2019 reflections. He grew up in a small community of houses in New Brunswick where people knew every one and helped each other out. Tough kids of all ages, and many cats and dogs played outside together in the elements - in winters skating or walking on outdoor ice with harsh winds blowing or playing in snow, either building snowmen or snow forts or tobogganing down nearby hills.The stories are simple. They are straightforward and without surprises. They provide real insight into the period Richards grew up and the culture and locale of his surroundings. There are wonderful black and white illustrations included inside - 16 in all by Vince McIndoe. He has used either a charcoal pencil or pen and ink and although simple, the illustrations are wonderful additions that elevate the story. They really enhance the sense of time and place. The cover, which I assume was also done by McIndoe, is a lovely, detailed multi-coloured painting of a man and boy dragging a Christmas tree through the snow. I have only rated the book 2 stars because of the book\u2019s brevity and an expectation of more complex stories. Many reviewers indicated they liked Carmichael\u2019s Dog best. This story however could have taken place anywhere. My preference was the short story entitled The Christmas Tree. In it I think Richards really created the wonderment of Christmas for a visiting boy, created some magic in finding the perfect tree and fully made this region of Canada come to life.In his Introduction, Richards explains that \u201cI am asking myself today what Christmas is, and why does it last, even for those of us who grew up in worlds now gone, and I have found out that many people believe, and perhaps they are taught to, that it is because Christmas is a time of happiness.\u201dUpon more reflection about his childhood and the other children he shared this time with, Richards concludes: \u201cChristmas is not happiness - but something much greater. It was something else far back then, along the side streets leading down to the rocks, and the cove, with whispers of woodsmoke trailing out in the cold evening air. For all those children it was not happiness. It was always more life affirming, even against the odds that were pitted against us then and now, and for all time - so looking back we look forward into the eyes of children forever with the understanding that they are and must always be in our care.Happiness - no. It is, only for a moment, Joy.\u201dPerhaps my 2 star rating for the book\u2019s brevity is too harsh but I am comparing it to other Christmas books. The Introduction itself, is sublime in its simplicity, and insight and vividly shows Richards\u2019 love for his roots. The book is worth reading for the Introduction alone.However, together the introduction and two stories would make for wonderful, quiet reading on one\u2019s own (adult or middle grade) during the holiday season. It would also be a good choice to read aloud to friends and family when stopping during the hectic holiday period. It is the perfect start for a catch-up visit, some brief time together reading Richards\u2019 reflections, which are likely to become a great jumping off point for everyone sharing some of their own reflections and stories."}, {"userName": "\u2740 Susan G", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7820199-susan-g", "userReview": "In these two short stories, David Adams Richards, weaves stories of Christmas that bring readers back to a simpler time. \u00a0They combine the wonder of boys, days spent the outdoors and the joy of the Christmas season.In the first story, Carmichael's Dog, the boys find a cute puppy, its' tail frozen into a snow bank. \u00a0They rescue it, bring it home and plan to hide it as a Christmas surprise for their mom. \u00a0The second tale describes the blustery, December weather of New Brunswick as the brothers head out in an old car to find the perfect Christmas tree. \u00a0The weather worsens and they realize their planning is incomplete when they find the optimal tree.Both stories are heartwarming, set in New Brunswick and have happy endings. \u00a0They are easier to read than the despair of Mercy Among the Children yet share the same sense of hope and resilience that David Adams Richards describes."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23497556-samantha", "userReview": "This book was really cute.

These stories are of his river, the great Miramichi.\"The Christmas Tree\" captures the tradition of finding the perfect Christmas tree in the snowy woods of New Brunswick. A neigbourhood child joins the group as they make their way to Christmas Mountain and experiences the magic of the festivities.\"Carmichael's Dog\" is a heartwarming tale of days when snow beckoned young boys. On Christmas Eve, rosy-cheeked from a day of sliding on cardboard, two boys find a small, chubby black puppy stuck in the snow bank, simply waiting for rescue.The Christmas Tree: Two Tales for the Holidays is a delightful book to give and receive, and will become a traditional holiday read for many years to come.The book was published in 2006 when the author, David Adams Richards was 55 turning 56. He includes an introduction of 6 pages that reflects back on his childhood when his neighbours led a different kind of life and his neighbourhood in New Brunswick was significantly different - a close-knit town rather than a much expanded city. The 2 stories included in this book are auto-biographical in nature. Carmichael's Dog took place when it looks like Richards, judging by the illustrations, appears to have been about 6-8 years old. The Christmas Tree took place, according to the published story, when Richards was in his early twenties and returned home to visit his mom. Both stories for Richards are reflections of real events in times gone by.", "title": "The Christmas Tree: Two Tales For The Holidays", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1801233.The_Christmas_Tree", "average": 3.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344358587l/1801233.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16255269.Vince_McIndoe", "name": "Vince McIndoe"}], "type": ["Holiday", "Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1801233.The_Christmas_Tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
