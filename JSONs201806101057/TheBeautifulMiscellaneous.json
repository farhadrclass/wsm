I am no stranger to the work of Dominic Smith. Last year I read The Last Painting of Sara De Vos and absolutely loved it. The Beautiful Miscellaneous is not a new novel; it\u2019s new to Australia, but it was actually published in the US in 2007. It\u2019s interesting to note this, because you would think that being an earlier novel \u2013 I think this was his second \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be as good as his more recent work, but this is not the case.\u00a0I adored The Beautiful Miscellaneous. Really loved it in a want to see it turned into a movie and give every one of my friends a copy kind of way. It\u2019s profound and touching and exquisitely written. Dominic Smith paints with words. He strings them together and creates a masterpiece that you can see and feel, the imagery is so vivid. I felt that with The Last Painting of Sara De Vos, and I felt that with The Beautiful Miscellaneous as well. It\u2019s not something you can learn; you\u2019re either a literary artist or you aren\u2019t.\u00a0Very early on in this novel I had occasion to ponder over the prose.\u00a0\u201cI wonder if we all carry our deaths packaged inside us \u2013 the time, the date, the manner \u2013 bundled and inert. Maybe what I carried all those years until the accident was not shrewd intelligence or the strange light of genius but the glimmer of my own death. Maybe that was what my parents were really looking at when they stared into my eyes and sensed something extraordinary.\u201dNathan Nelson\u2019s parents want him to be a genius. But he\u2019s not. When he is seventeen, he is seriously injured in a car crash and he wakes up from a coma different. His brain is no longer the same. He\u2019s developed what doctors suspect is a condition that attaches sensory experiences to his thoughts and consequently he has enhanced memory skills. His father now believes this is Nathan\u2019s chance to be the genius he was always destined to be. Of course, without even reading the novel, you know this is not going to be the case, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is the journey: the relationship between father and son, and the transition of Nathan from boyhood into adulthood. Both of these are defining factors of the novel, separate but also intertwined because Nathan\u2019s relationship with his father, and his mother to a lesser extent, are serious inhibitors to his ability to grow up and get on with his life. We see this build throughout the novel and as Nathan\u2019s life enters a stagnant phase, much to his mother\u2019s distress, as an observer looking in from the outside, we see all the reasons why he reaches this point with perfect clarity and the deepest of sympathy.\u00a0There are shades of John Green that come through in this novel. Given this is the story of a seventeen-year-old boy, there are scenes that remind me a lot of Paper Towns, particularly those that include Nathan\u2019s close friends. Dominic is spot on with the teenage wit and sarcasm, the emotional incompetence and the struggle of being loyal to your parents even when they are crushingly embarrassing. There is a scene towards the end of the novel when Toby, Nathan\u2019s blind musical prodigy best friend, jumps up (carefully, because he\u2019s blind) onto the roof of Nathan\u2019s car. They are stuck in a traffic jam, caused by Nathan\u2019s car stalling due to old age, and are being assaulted by a barrage of horns and insults. Toby stands on the roof of the offending vehicle and with his cane (remember that he\u2019s blind) he begins to conduct the bleating horns. This is one of those scenes within a novel that you never forget. It\u2019s brilliant, funny, poignant, all the things a memorable scene should be and it\u2019s entirely representative of what this novel is all about.\u00a0I was a bit nervous about reading this novel, despite also being excited to have received it. I was concerned that it might be overly scientific, given that Nathan\u2019s father is a physicist and the subject matter is all about kids who are gifted and geniuses. It does lean heavily into physics, but in an entirely accessible way, and I have to say that I simply do not understand physics at all, but I still wasn\u2019t overwhelmed by the content of this novel and the inclusion of so much physics did nothing to detract from my enjoyment of the story. I can\u2019t say I learnt anything physics related, my brain just seems to refuse the subject as if it\u2019s a completely different language, but I sailed along happily just absorbing the details within the context they were intended.\u00a0After Nathan had his accident and his new memory skills emerged, Dominic Smith began to include throughout the text at key moments somewhat random facts that Nathan had memorised. Yet their randomness was very much by design; each \u2018fact\u2019 was directly linked to an emotion Nathan was feeling within that moment, ready for you to decode. I thoroughly enjoyed how Dominic did this. It was clever and complimentary and really stood out to me as a unique little \u2018extra touch\u2019.To finish up with, I want to share this line, one of my favourite from the entire novel:\u2018The night felt cracked open, alive with possibility.\u2019How divine. So much said with so little words, but like I said above, a literary artist. Dominic Smith is firmly cemented in as one of my favourite authors. After two exquisite reads, I have full certainty now that any novel of his that I pick up I am sure to enjoy. I highly recommend this novel to readers who appreciated stories about life, family relationships, friendship, love and the universe. It has all of this and more. It\u2019s also set in 1987 and has some pretty cool 80s moments that fellow children from that era will appreciate.Thanks is extended to Allen and Unwin for providing me with a copy of The Beautiful Miscellaneous for review."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784513-danielle", "userReview": "I really, really liked this book to begin with, but it was kind of steadily downhill from the accident on (the turning point that takes place about a third of the way in). I actually wished I had stopped reading it, because the last third of the book was just disjointed and not nearly as well written as the first. It was an interesting premise, but the execution was lacking. I liked it much better when it was just the non-brilliant son trying to be happy with who he was.

His father Samuel had for years, to no avail, tried to coax out Nathan\u2019s genius, only to discover that his son was average, normal, unremarkable.But after the accident, Nathan\u2019s parents send him to a special school for special children, including: a teenaged girl who is \u201cmedically intuitive\u201d and can diagnose cancer, tumors, multiple sclerosis, by the tone/timbre of one\u2019s voice; a blind, sex-obsessed piano prodigy; a savant who can\u2019t tie his shoes but knows what day of the week 12 October 1843 fell on; and a man who replicates citiscapes in his head and then builds them.The Beautiful Miscllaneous explores how the children\u2019s gifts isolate them from the rest of the world, and how their parents\u2019 expectations shape and preclude certain paths before they (the children) have any say in the matter. It\u2019s a beautiful novel that verges on poetry at times, on account of the narrator\u2019s synesthetic descriptions and the writer\u2019s rhetorical brilliance.

The first hundred or so pages, the build-up to the accident you already know is going to occur, are like a pleasantly held breath, full of anticipation; unfortunately, once the accident happens, and Nathan\u2014now gifted with synesthesia (one of my favorite rare-in-life-but-awesome-in-literature neurological phenomena!) and an accompanying enhanced memory\u2014reenters the world, the book turns into a much more straightforward father-son narrative. It still contains a lot of beautiful imagery, but it's basically a coming-of-age story (it seriously almost-concludes with the protagonist losing his virginity), and it's not different enough to set it apart from the 85 billion other coming-of-age stories I've read."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/388552-meg", "userReview": "wow.one of those books you can't stop thinking about.an intriguing read.I can't wait to pick it up and read it again."}, {"userName": "Theresa Smith Writes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25352638-theresa-smith-writes", "userReview": "There is so much to say about The Beautiful Miscellaneous yet I find myself struggling for words.

The night felt cracked open, alive with possibility.\" One of many passages I underlined, I start with that because protagonist Nathan Nelson's experience in the car that night is just what this novel delivers to the reader. Aliveness with possibility. Dominic Smith is my new favorite synesthesia writer. He has done a beautiful thing with this novel, incorporating numerous layers of \"difference\" into Nathan's unusual upbringing as the son of a brilliant (if awkward) particle physicist and a supremely patient homemaker. As an adult he confesses, \"Normal was something I knew nothing about. I'd grown up with a particle physicist, an astronaut, and a woman who kept house with the pluck and verve of a gymnast.\" At this stage, Nathan is desperate to fill in some gaps, hopefully to learn what a \"normal\" family might look like, even while the reader is desperate for Nathan to dig deeper into his own background and to uncover a few truths yet to be unearthed closer to home. 'The Beautiful Miscellaneous' features a teenage protagonist who aches to be more normal and at the same time, he wishes to be more unusual, more gifted, more likely to please his physicist father who's on the look-out from the time of his son's birth for proof of genius. However, Nathan suspects that his intelligence is only slightly above average, and as a result, he fears he will ultimately disappoint his father. In fact, as a boy, he tests the waters of disappointment by purposely losing a highly competitive science bee while his parents watch. The coming of age story Smith weaves into this novel is lovely. Nathan begins to understand his parents' personas through the clarity of youth, and part of the joy of this novel is witnessing the awkwardness of his parents' relationship with one another and with others. Collision is an important theme -- Nathan is nearly killed in a car accident that does kill his grandfather and induces Nathan's unusual synesthesia. But as much as collision is a theme, so too is an odd inability to connect, much less collide. Discovering Nathan's entree into adulthood through the awkwardness of missed connections is almost more powerful than the focus on accidental connections, induced collisions in physics, and crashes and conflicts in philosophy. Between father and son, we see miscommunication sometimes caused not by \"mixed messages\" but by \"missed messages.\" Yet, by the novel's end, Smith delivers a clarifying view of Nathan's situation that sits well with the reader. Especially as Nathan's relationships evolve with highly gifted friends Teresa (who can see and diagnose disease) and Toby, a blind musical prodigy, this connection/collision/lack of connection theme comes to light. In fact, light, darkness, and vision is another continuing trope. The ability to see at all, (Toby) see \"through\" or more deeply, (Teresa) see colors and sounds where others might not,(Nathan) or see from great distances (Whit, the malaprop-loving astronaut) are beautifully rendered. And we really can't help but fall in love with Nathan's dad, right alongside Nathan, as this young man finally figures out his father.Grateful for the recommendation that led to me this one, I definitely will look for Dominic Smith's other works."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39797-rose", "userReview": "I agree with a lot of the other comments on this book. I only made it to halfway in... and what a beautiful half a book it was!I laughed out loud at various parts of the book - usually they involved the description of the narrator's exceptionally dorky father - or should I say \"socially challenged.\" The author excelled so well at constructing a character without going through the motions of telling you about the character. Example: he didn't write, \"the dad is dorky,\" but he told you about all of these hilarious, but believable instances where the dad just didn't get how your average non-genius acted. I loved this! In fact, I'd recommend reading the beginning part of the book only for that.But once the plot changed and the stilted teenage romance and dialogue started showing up, I put the book down. I feel bad for doing that, and maybe someday I'll stick it out just to say I've read the whole thing.

The first half of this book had me well and truly invested in the story. The relationship between Nathan and his socially awkward physicist father was frequently very funny and extremely well written. Nathan's father's well intentioned but seriously misguided attempts to coax the genius out of his son was equal parts sad, poignant and funny. The momentum of the novel faltered slightly when Nathan was sent to the research school for gifted children as I was particularly enjoying the father son relationship to that point. However the relationships that Nathan develops with some of the other gifted children was still very well realised, particularly his developing friendship with Toby and Teresa. The novel slightly unravelled for me with Nathan's decent into what was at one point described as a nervous breakdown, following a significant event in the family. It seemed to drift somewhat, perhaps to represent Nathan's sense of being lost. Overall I did enjoy this exceptionally well written book where the author clearly had a good knowledge of particle physics outside of his extensive research."}, {"userName": "Ginny", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7893808-ginny", "userReview": "The feeling this book gave me is a kind of breathless sadness. Nathan tells his story in a sort of removed narrating with occasional sparking sentences like fireworks. I feel like I see into his world and feel as he does as I turn the pages and isn't that why we read books in the first place? I felt like this story is pretty relatable. We all have someone close to us who lives in their own world and have times when we just can't understand a parent or two. Probably the most relatable thing though is how lost Nathan was throughout the whole book. As a child, he did everything his parents told him to do then as he became older, he became more rebellious and began to look for his own pathway. It can be hard sometime and you can feel like maybe there isn't anything for you after all, that the universe made a mistake and you just happen to be the odd piece out, the one whose life doesn't have meaning or purpose but eventually, he found something he liked to do.

The son, Nathan, is simply average, and grows up considering himself a disappointment. Then one day Nathan suffers a head injury in a car accident and develops a photographic memory and synesthesia: the extraordinary ability to taste words and feel colors. So far so good, especially because Dominic Smith is an excellent writer and his narrative is vividly descriptive. I was intrigued by how his newfound gift would satisfy his father's expectations, and curious about the phenomenon of synesthesia... but then Smith took the story in other less interesting directions, taking unnecessary detours and adding irrelevant characters. Sadly, the story unfolded much as Nathan did: in a bland, average way.

Not an ARC or new release like usual--this book is ten years old--but a rerelease no doubt due to the author's successful last novel, The Last Painting of Sara de Vos.And though it's not in dire need of my review, there being over a hundred here already, I will say that I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would, given how it opens. When characters start talking about when and where they were born, what their parents were like, etc., my interest usually starts fading away. But I don't abandon books, not usually, and I'm glad I didn't this time, for The Beautiful Miscellaneous becomes, well, almost beautiful at points, as the slow passage of years gives the characters time to feel lived-in and rounded, their edges blurred into their environment.

I ran. The star shines still. \"The Beautiful Miscellaneous\" is the story of a boy whose father is a physicist, a genius of science, forever frustrated with his sharp but not quite genius son. Can a car accident and a coma make a father happy? Well, in this case, it gives him hope of having that prodigy child he's wanted all along. When young Nathan comes out of his coma, he finds his brain injury has actually caused a condition called synesthesia, the ability to perceive words with several senses at once, not only hearing them, but also tasting and seeing them in varied colors. Alongside this interesting linguistic ability, Nathan has also developed a prodigious memory. Newly hopeful, his father sends him to the Brook-Mills Institute for Talent Development, where he meets a collection of off-the-wall young characters, each with their own area of talent or skill. A sense of tension weaves throughout the story, as Nathan is caught between his desire to be accepted as he is, a mostly average kid, and wanting to please his father, surely the smartest man he's ever known. Yet technical intelligence is one thing, and an emotional and social intelligence quite another. A scene of father taking his son for a \"special treat\" on his birthday, ending in a trip to an accelerator, perhaps heaven for a physicist, but a sore disappointment for a kid who can't help daydreaming about the normalcy of an amusement park is almost unbearable in its disconnect between these two. Such are father-son relationships, too often, a balance between expectations and acceptance, the wish to impress, the falling short, and the final moment of truth, when one learns to love another human being in all their varied quirks and skill sets and idiosyncrasies, a blend of light and shadow, strengths and weaknesses. An example of Smith's rich writing and storytelling appears in the developing not-quite relationship between Nathan and Teresa, another resident of the school for the oddly talented. Not quite a love story, it is more the hormonal rush of two adolescents who perhaps find a wary, somewhat bored acceptance in each other they cannot find in the world of the \"normals\" outside. Neither is mature enough for love, but their hormones drive them to explore the cautious boundaries of first lust, careful to never show each other the vulnerability that leads to a more mature intimacy until much later in the book, when Teresa asks older Nathan, \"Do you ever still think about kissing me?\" Writes Smith: \"I sat close to her on the floor, our knees touching. She took my hand and placed it on the top of her stomach; my wrist brushed her bra support, a plastic rib that later I would tell Toby was the 'the edge of the known world.' For a moment I was lost, dislocated. Oddly I thought about my father and Whit, about men. Why had no one mentioned this? Surely they had experienced this one moment of confined bliss, been forced into a submissive silence--sinners now in church. Whit spinning in space, my father peering into an electron microscope the way an astronomer stares at distant planets and hydrous stars, men continuing their lives but surely living for this unbridled moment... a genius or prodigy in love or lust laid himself bare, like a castle in ruins.\" From such ruins rise new and wonderful connections, the intimacy of two persons baring skin and souls as much of a miracle, or more, than a physicist exploding electrons. The mind stretches often in the most daily human activities. When the ruins are the walls that keep two apart, their dust is the nutrient on which new relationships are built. Smith's mastery in capturing such miracles is what gives his writing, too, color, taste, and a scent for more such great stories to come."}, {"userName": "Lesley Battler", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11154194-lesley-battler", "userReview": "I agree with the \u201cmeh\u201d contingent about this book.I thought the book would be electric and unexpected, something like Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, only with the intriguing twist of placing a relatively average boy as the narrator, trying to understand and gain some acceptance from his savant father.The book started well enough. Smith set up an interesting father-son dynamic with Nelson craving the kind of father Samuel can 't be for him. Misunderstandings and lost opportunities are clearly and delicately rendered. I thought one of the highlights of the book was the scene where Samuel takes Nathan to California. Nathan wants to believe his father is taking him to Disneyland. Instead, he ends up at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, and a good time is had by all. What fuels the scene is that Samuel was giving his son the best gift he could imagine. The reader can feel for both characters.At age 17, Nathan is seriously injured in a car accident and experiences momentary clinical death. He is in a coma for several weeks. When he wakes, it is discovered that the accident has caused him to develop an eidetic memory and synaesthesia, which gives him the ability to see words in colour. Nathan's accident has, in fact, turned him into the extraordinary specimen, if not quite the true genius, his father always wanted.Nathan is taken to the Brook-Mills Institute for Talent Development where he is encouraged to perform tricks. Here he meets an array of young savants; Toby the blind concert-pianist, Arlen, the crime-solving psychic and Teresa, the medical intuitive. And this is where the book went south for me. After setting the stage for an amazing inquiry into the possible limits of science and the conscious mind when faced with abilities or qualities that don't fit the paradigm, the entire narrative deflates.The great dialogues that could have centered around what can or cannot be explained by science never happen. Instead, the narrative rambles on, debouching into a trite LSD party. Characters who should have been fascinating, e.g., Toby, Arlen, Teresa and even Darius, are woefully underused (although Teresa fights hard and almost comes alive from time to time). The letter written by Nelson's father to God, revealed to Nelson by the psychic detective, seems to have no real consequence.What went wrong? My best guess is that the dysfunctional family template rolled over the quirks that might have made this an original, thoughtful book."}, {"userName": "Sarah Beth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth", "userReview": "\"Being less than brilliant with a genius parent is like being the bum who stares, midwinter, through the restaurant window at the plump diners inside. There was my father, on the other side of that window, eating food so delicate and sumptuous it made my teeth ache. The seat opposite him was empty and expectant, but I never made it past the glass\" (13). At heart, this novel tells the age-old story of discord between father and son and unfulfilled expectations. Nathan Nelson's father is a physicist and a genius and expects greatness from his son. Yet Nathan knows himself to be of only average intelligence and resents the pressure placed on him by his father. Nathan's father gradually accepts his son's ordinariness, until an accident gives Nathan extraordinary memory and synesthesia. Once again, his father renews his efforts to make his son something special and orders him to \"Stop squandering what you have! Do you hear me? Take your place!\" (170). I was intrigued by this depiction of a frustrated father-son relationship. I sympathized with Nathan, who knows early on that he will only disappoint his father's dreams, and yearns to be accepted as he is. Yet I also felt for Nathan's father, who clearly can't relate socially to the world the way his son can, and merely wants his son to be as special in the eyes of the world as he is to him. Meanwhile, Nathan's mother seems content to expect very little from her son, and accepts his averageness early on:\"She knew it wasn't a cathedral we were building; it was a chapel at best, maybe a shanty made of driftwood\" (50). The second half of the novel was, frankly, bewildering. The plot takes a nosedive and flounders. Nathan's future goes off the rails, his old elementary school fellow nerds become hippy commune members, his mother lives with his father's best friend. The second half of the book was implausible at best. I like that Nathan seizes his own vision of his future, but I don't think the plot had to dissolve and all his early plans had to crash and burn for him to make his own choices for his life. This is the story of Nathan navigating his way through a less than perfect childhood. \"I'd been raised in a household where my father ignored me unless he was holding up an intellectual hoop for me to jump through, and where my mother's dream of family solidarity was all of us sitting in the kitchen eating pad thai while playing gin rummy\" (117). Yet its also about accepting unrealized potential, and living with an ordinary life, a life that is not great or extraordinary, but quiet and simple."}], "description": "Nathan Nelson is the average son of a genius. His father, a physicist of small renown, has prodded him toward greatness from an early age\u2014enrolling him in whiz kid summer camps, taking him to the icy tundra of Canada to track a solar eclipse, and teaching him college algebra. But despite Samuel Nelson\u2019s efforts, Nathan remains ordinary.Then, in the summer of 1987, everything changes. While visiting his small-town grandfather in Michigan, Nathan is involved in a terrible accident. After a brief clinical death\u2014which he later recalls as a lackluster affair lasting less than the length of a Top 40 pop song\u2014he falls into a coma. When he awakens, Nathan finds that everyday life is radically different. His perceptions of sight, sound, and memory have been irrevocably changed. The doctors and his parents fear permanent brain damage. But the truth of his condition is more unexpected and leads to a renewed chance for Nathan to find his place in the world.Thinking that his son\u2019s altered brain is worthy of serious inquiry, Samuel arranges for Nathan to attend the Brook-Mills Institute, a Midwestern research center where savants, prodigies, and neurological misfits are studied and their specialties applied. Immersed in this strange atmosphere\u2014where an autistic boy can tell you what day Christmas falls on in 3026 but can\u2019t tie his shoelaces, where a medical intuitive can diagnose cancer during a long-distance phone call with a patient\u2014Nathan begins to unravel the mysteries of his new mind. He also tries to make peace with the crushing weight of his father\u2019s expectations.The Beautiful Miscellaneous is an extraordinary follow-up to Dominic Smith\u2019s critically acclaimed debut, The Mercury Visions of Louis Daguerre.
