Byrne is just too interested about too many different things to stick with one topic, and that was fine with me. He bounces giddily between reflections on city planning, geography, history, contemporary art, cultural anthropology, music, etc. The section about Manila and Buenos Aires in particular are extremely interesting, I had no idea about the weird personality cult/pseudo-religion that had developed around the Marcos's, or the bizarre hodgepodge of musical styles that developd in latin america in the last 30 years. I always think of Byrne being kind of a spacehead, but he's refreshingly down to earth, almost pragmatic here. It also made me kind of jealous. Byrne, while maybe not a 'super-star,' is an extremely intelligent, cool person who gets to spend a lot of time with other extremely intelligent, cool people. I wish I could hang out with the guy who invented the powerbook, or fatboy slim, or the city planner who made copenhagen the most bike friendly city on earth. David Byrne should write more books."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125646-jeremy", "userReview": "Several reviewers have covered elements of this book including...-its discursiveness (it is indeed, a pastiche of blog-like musings and observations)-the fact that it is only tangentially about the subject alluded to in the title, the bicycle -the fact that David Byrne is a liberal Renaissance man whose thoughts are generally more interesting and insightful than those of the average world citizen (sure, fine... I was a Talking Heads fan too, and even a liberal in most scenarios)I've seen few reviews that cover what to me wound up being the essential aspect of this book: it is cultural/political snobbery by a writer who ought to be more aware than not everyone in his audience is a part of this enlightened, fortunate elite. (DISCLAIMER: I only read the first 80 pages. Perhaps the tone changed later in the book. But given the random-snippet aspect of it... I think I got the gist.)Yes, I hated Bush too, and think America can learn some things from its neighbors, and agree that the lowest common denominator has in many cases weighted humanity down. But pervasively and persistently throughout this book (though sometimes subtly), David Byrne takes sneering potshots at the philistines whose fingerprint is visible everywhere he looks. While he may be right in many cases, his curmudgeonly take on things is made all the more irritating by his role as an exalted cultural arbiter. He seemed uninterested in bringing into the fold readers who do not already revere him. These 'masses' he takes issue with are, in fact, the majority."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248060-rebekah", "userReview": "What a complete disappointment. I was so looking forward to reading weird random bicycle musings by David Byrne, but alas, his brain these days is less interesting than my own. I guess he's good at putting his thoughts into the ambiguous and metaphorical terms well-suited to song, but when he tries to spell them out in writing and \"back them up with supporting evidence,\" well, he should leave it to those who understand the supporting evidence well enough to say something meaningful and interesting. He talks a lot about city planning and sprawl, really interesting subjects, but comes off like a college freshman home for the holidays spouting his new-found wisdom without totally understanding how all these little facts he picked up actually fit together. He still seems like a nice guy, just maybe not as omniamazing as I once thought.After going into Pendragon every day for a week asking \"is the David Byrne book in yet?,\" I couldn't see how I was going to bring myself to return it. So I went to the Shattuck location. The girl with pink hair asked why I was returning it and I said \"it's really boring!\" She agreed, she said every time he comes out with a new album or art book or whatever, she thinks \"yeah, David Byrne, that guy's cool!\" and she always ends up disappointed.

I\u2019ve read David Byrne\u2019s blog for years, and much of the blog content ended up in the book. He has this way of writing that is amazingly informative without being pretentious. He\u2019s just really, really cool. And that shows in a seemingly effortless way. This isn\u2019t just another boring travelogue that leaves you feeling frustrated that someone would take the time to explain all the reasons why you should or shouldn\u2019t see a place. Byrne treats every with the same amount of attention and analysis and you are never left with a feeling that he\u2019s particularly proud of himself for having accomplished such an extensive list of journeys. One of the reasons (excuses) I never finish books is because I\u2019m such an active reader. I like to jot down ideas or topics that interest me, sometimes pausing to research them further. To demonstrate how interesting and influential David Byrne is, I will list some of the things in his book that I jotted down for further exploration. Trapped in a Closet (a video piece)Mercedes Sosa (performer)NYC 5 Boro Bike TourBenado Paloubo (performer)Loop Station (band)Susana Baca (performer)Extra Action Marching Band (San Francisco band)Silvia Rodriguez (performer)Flip and Manilla Envelope (Jessica Zafra magazines)Marcos TasadaySurvival Research Labratories (art performance organization)Enrique Penalosa (innovator of Bogata bus system)\u201cThere and Back Again\u201d (article in the New Yorker)Young@Heart Chorus (elderly chorus that covers Talking Heads)FuseProject bike helmet (designers)The Life and Death of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs (book)Whether or not I\u2019ll actually ever research all of this is another story. The point is that reading Bicycles Diaries is a worthwhile substitute for actually biking around a city and spending the day experiencing life the way David Byrne does."}, {"userName": "Tosh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133661-tosh", "userReview": "A neither or nor type of book for me. A lot of times David Byrne writes about the obvious, and other times he is responding to something that is interesting and he has something to say about it. The title is not really what the book is about. Although there is some bicycle riding stuff - but mostly it is Byrne commenting on pop and political culture of various areas of the world. On one level it is sort of like getting a post card from a distant land and Byrne is noticing stuff because he's an outsider of that world, but some times it is not that interesting, and Byrne is by no means an original thinker. Roland Barthes he's not! But then again he's an intelligent guy (and he can write) and this is a book not about personalities but mostly landscapes and architecture. In a way it is sort of like a Situationist drift, but mostly he is traveling from point A to get to Point B. And rarely does he get lost, but again, his observations on people are kind of simple and not that interesting. Byrne's main interest is how the city is laid out (especially when concerning bicycling) and how that affects the landscape and its people (as a population). So yeah, this is a book that yells out 'travel essay' and for those who are hoping for some insight into his music world - well, there is really none. A quick and easy read, and actually goes well with the various bus rides."}, {"userName": "Bernie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1064484-bernie", "userReview": "I ride my bike to work nearly every day that is above 20 degrees and not raining or snowing. I also ride to other places and take long trips on my own or with my wife on our tandem. I LOVE to bicycle! My daughter knows this too, and that it was very thoughtful of her to select this book to give to me as a Christmas present. It was a thought-provoking book whose conclusions gave me pause even when I disagreed with some. As a bicyclist myself, I like that he focused on the act of bicycling\u2014the enjoyment itself-- rather than promoting cycling as a way to exercise and stay in shape or a way to be green, and superior to others. Bicycling, I know, and Byrne acknowledges, is not practical for most people, and for even for those that it is, most people cannot or will not make the sacrifice. But the book will spur some people to try it out\u2026 and that\u2019s a great thing. It is obvious that Byrne loves to ride.\u2026. it\u2019s an activity that he says keeps him centered and sane\u2026.. it\u2019s like a regular mini vacation. I agree. Throughout the book, Byrne makes some keen observations regarding human nature and our social condition. He uses bicycling, as he observes in his introduction, first, to find out about cities, and more specifically, to explore, and make hypotheses about the types of \u201csocial animals\u201d that live and create different cities. Secondly, his cycling travels are a \u201ckind of self-examination, with the city functioning as a mirror.\u201d Byrne\u2019s book succeeds in his first objective, to shed light on the humans who live and create cities. He succeeds also in his second objective too--- to examine and explain himself. Unfortunately here, there is much to be critical of. He offers unwarranted criticism of the automobile and the businesses that brought us this liberating invention. If he were honest, he\u2019d have to admit that it was the automobile, and more specifically the road building it spurred that give us bicyclists the pavement we need to ride. When I ride, I notice the beauty\u2026. the arrangement of the clouds as the sun peaks through, the Canadian goose flying overhead, or the groundhog sniffing cues from the wind. Byrne does this too, but apparently not in America. In American cities, including my own beloved Columbus Ohio, he only sees decay, abandonment, and Marxist alienation. Even Niagra Falls is described as \u201cmighty weirdness\u201d.  American suburbs might be peaceful concedes Byrne, but they are boring and hurtful. As he bikes by, he imagines that its youth using razor blades to cause themselves enough pain to over come their \u201cfeeling deprived\u201d environment.  Capitalism is seemingly embodied by George Eastman who lived and even, imagines Byrne, slept with his mom until he commits suicide. In smaller towns, creative repression by the church is the rule, and football coaches are the only \u201cwise men\u201d Elsewhere, \u201cwhite financial hegemony\u201d ensures that minorities and the non-conventional are kept in place. His anti-Americanism and cultural elitism is so relentless that by the end of the section on American cities Byrne himself writes of his sorrow in having painted such \u201ca bleak picture\u201d of America. No kidding. I thought to myself that if Byrne\u2019s rides are always this depressing, why does he bother to continue doing it? Also, I thought about what fundamental assumptions Byrne holds that point him towards such analysis. He partially answers this question later when he points to what he calls two big self-deceptions people make: 1. that life has meaning, and 2. that each of us is unique. Surprisingly though, Byrne has not yet hit his low point\u2026..moving to Europe, he spends five pages complete with pornographic photos, on a man he seemingly admires, sexual predator Otto Muehl. I almost quit reading at that point but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because the book greatly improved thereafter, with only occasional and odious jabs at the market, America, Christianity, George Bush ,Fox News and of course how Mr. Obama would save us from all those things.. But ignoring that, I enjoyed is observations on: The bright side of urban neglect; surveillance in the Communist era, reparations, public perceptions of bicyclists, art as exploitation, how markets spontaneously organize in efficient manners (undercutting his other anti-market statements and underscoring his economic cluelessness); violence in sexually segregated societies, the media, art and music. His last section on New York and the bicycling tip in the appendix were interesting too.If you keep in mind Byrne\u2019s sometimes extreme biases, it\u2019s a book well worth reading. I gave it four stars."}, {"userName": "Carola", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22865327-carola", "userReview": "Me encant\u00f3 este libro. \u00a1Quiero ser amiga de David Byrne! Pensamos muy parecido. Ay, qu\u00e9 ganas de rodearme de artistas como \u00e9l. Definitivamente, me animar\u00e9 a conseguir \"How music works\". De ni\u00f1a, la bicicleta y yo \u00e9ramos una sola.

Although I vaguely knew that he continued to work as a solo artist, I did not follow this phase of his career. Bicycle Diaries is the first of his books that I have read.The book is about using a bicycle of course, but more importantly it is about how architecture, urban planning (or mis-planning) and people make the places that we live and work in habitable, desirable, or just plain awful. This collection of essays looks at several cities within and outside the US and how their patterns of life, traffic, and industry (including tourism) affect the people who live and work there.As in his songs, Byrne\u2019s authorial voice brings humor, wit, irony and sarcasm to his topics. But he also has a strong advocacy for bicycling that shines forth in each of these essays. He genuinely likes to ride and believes it can be good for many people. And he is not some pie-in-the-sky industry mouthpiece; Mr. Byrne rides his bicycle for basic transportation and for enjoyment in what he acknowledges is one of the least hospitable cities on the planet.He writes from both long experience and from keen observation: he has bicycled in many cities over three decades. Places that I have travelled to in Europe and Asia he has cycled in and I am envious. I travelled mostly for work but did not have the smarts or luxury of bringing a bike with me. He does not see bringing a bike as an option, but rather as an integral part of his travelling. So, he does and we get to read about them in this gem of a book.As the product of an artist of many media, the book is not some plain, printed artifact. It has particular design elements (no spoilers here) that add a nice touch and the contents range from actual bike rides to meeting artists and discussing the evolution of art. Because it is a diary that focuses on his bicycle experiences, we get views into the activities that the bicycle helped enable. I found this material as fascinating and a rewarding as his thoughts on urban cycling.Since the book is now a few years old, things have changed in Boston, New York and other US cities: bike share programs have become viable and popular in the land that loves the automobile. But except for these later advances, he is remarkably well-informed about urban cycling issues, advocates, and methods. For those that would like some practical advice, there is also an Afterword that covers a few essential items.Beyond my own love of bicycling, I found this book to be warm, engaging and thoroughly enjoyable. I learned a few things about places I\u2019ve been and more about places I have not travelled to. I even learned a few tidbits about the author himself.Three stars for writing and quality. Five stars for his insights into the utility and pleasure of urban cycling. Four Stars (4.0) overall. I strongly recommend it \u2013 even if you only want to discover his musings on cities and arts."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38412-keith", "userReview": "I asked the library to get this book something like half a year ago, as soon as I found out it was coming out. when it finally was released and the library had a copy for me I got it and devoured it. I'm a fan of david byrne, as much or even more of his work after the talking heads, and I'm a fan of bicycles, so a book full of david byrnes musings about riding a bike through a bunch of different cities around the world seemed like a winner to me, and so it was. While it may seem a bit silly... rock star tells us his opinions about stuff... whoopie... Byrne is a much more perceptive and original thinker than a lot of the rock stars out there, so there is much in this book that you can really sink your intelectual teeth into. There are plenty of things to get you upset, such as how Robert Moses destroyed large portions of many of our cites with his freeway plans, chopping up central cities with interchanges. And there are a lot of laughs as well, and inspiring moments and some great writing. \"Golf courses are not green\" is one little gem that sticks with me. Bicycle Diaries would make a lovely companion set with Andrei Codrescu's Hail Babylon, which is another volume of impressions of various cities, all, or nearly all american in Codrescu's case. It seems unlikely that humans will leave the cities, at least without a catastrophe to drive us out, so we should work on making them a bit more liveable, and a bit more friendly to the world at large, and David Byrne has some good ideas in that direction, and no it's not just \"everyone should ride a bike\", it'll take more than that, and 100% bike ridership is not possible or practical... it'd be beautiful to see, but I don't envision it happening in this country.there's also a flip animation of a bicycle zipping back and forth on the bottoms of all the pages, and the cover is beautiful."}, {"userName": "E Sweetman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2941390-e-sweetman", "userReview": "I loved this book. It was a quick read, very interesting and now I AM DYING FOR A FOLDING BICYCLE! I know I can pay better attention to life around me and see interesting things in typically boring places. I know I'll be able to find a concrete box building with just one metal door and a lightbulb affixed to the side of it as its only decoration fascinating if I am riding on a folding bicycle. I just know it.The lovely character of this book is that you feel as though your alongside Mr. Byrne. He recorded his thoughts as he rode around cities while he was touring. It sounds so glamorous but though his writing we learn there is little glamour on the road and there is less glamour on two wheels--which is the beauty of this book.David Byrnes leisurely rides through cities like Detroit, Niagra Falls, Valencia, CA, Sweetwater, TX and Columbus, OH. We get a good looks at small parts, get a great feeling of the vibe and interetingly, he is a terrific teacher of city and highway infrastructure! America is a car-nation, that is for sure and David Byrne is a brave adventurer to venture into the heart of some of these places. It's a beautiful, rare and honest view of some of the places in America you'd probably never ever care to see.He takes his bike to Europe and South America, the Phillipines and Australia. There he gives us glimpses of people, places and life that just can't be experienced from a hotel, a tour bus or a tourist attraction.I knew I would love this book because it's about travel and a bicycle.

Well, wait, ok, fine: maybe some parts of this book are more universal than others, him being David f*@#-ing Byrne and us just being plain-old us, but if you can get past the blas\u00e9 attitude he adopts towards the glamor of his own life, these represent some revealing and sometimes even affectingly intimate windows into the life and brain of DB."}, {"userName": "James Cridland", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4176755-james-cridland", "userReview": "I knew that David Byrne had something to do with music, but didn't actually know more than that (shhh) - 67% of the way in, he drops into the narrative that he was, of course, one of the founders of Talking Heads.Impressive, then, that this book isn't called Road to Nowhere: it's a meandering and rather self-indulgent book; part travelogue, part social commentary, part political activism; part back-slapping prose - all using the construct of a bicycle trip or two.Byrne, who lives in New York, has meetings all around the world and usually goes to them on a bicycle. And, as any cyclist knows, you see (and smell) an awful lot more of the places you're in if you're on a bicycle than if you're in a car. Partially, therefore, this book is an interesting travelogue of a rock star and artist; we get to know what Chicago is like, London, Berlin, and many other places.Partially, too, it's a commentary on the way we live these days. Byrne is clearly an activist on behalf of the bicycle, and of sensible town planning (railing against the type of single-use town planning that has blighted many cities across the world).It's a little all over the place as a result - literally as well as in terms of structure. He clearly lives a charmed life; and whether he's in Sao Paolo or London he seems to know the places to go to and has friends who show him the way; but he spends much of his time cycling in a vague way and just seeing what happens. Commentaries on planning, on transport, and seemingly anything else that occasionally comes to mind, weave through this book in as unplanned a way as his travels. Photos accompany the text - though Byrne appears not to take very many photographs himself. (They appear decently enough, if in black and white, on Kindle).I can never resist a good travelogue. This isn't one, to be frank; but it is an interesting read from someone I think I understand a little more now - albeit living a world which I'll never really inhabit.

The connecting thread is Byrne's bike, which he takes on his travels with him. There are lots of tangents along the way, everything from where he ate to the history or politics of the country visited, but there is something compelling about it all. The writing is conversational and Byrne is not afraid to express strong opinions. Not all will agree but the goal is not to incite or outrage, merely to consider. Far more interesting than I initially thought it might be."}, {"userName": "Francesca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7657371-francesca", "userReview": "Interesting book with some good points though boring in some parts.

David Byrne is a multitalented musician, writer, filmmaker and all-around artist. He's probably still best known for his performances with the band Talking Heads, even after all these years, but that's only been a small part of his long and illustrious career.And he really walks (or rather rides) his talk. In Bicycle Diaries, Byrne goes on another world-wide tour, but it's not about the music this time. Or, at least, the music takes a back seat. This time, Byrne talks about bicycling, which for him is not just an affectation or an occasional indulgence\u2014cycling is his primary mode of transportation when he's at home in New York City, and often when he is on the road as well. So this book is about that, and about urban planning\u2014especially about bike-friendly urban planning and why that's necessary, illustrated with examples and numerous photographs from the world's cities, ones that get biking right and ones that don't.I somehow missed David Byrne's visit to Portland's Bagdad Theater in 2009, when he came to talk about this book to great acclaim. Nor did I ever get a chance to see him perform with Talking Heads. Apparently I just missed another appearance at the Bagdad in October 2012, too, this time with Carrie Brownstein from Sleater-Kinney and Portlandia. I did see him on stage once at the Oregon Zoo, back in 2004, playing with the Tosca Strings from Austin, Texas. That show was incredible; I should have been seeking him out more often all along, obviously, and now I'm looking forward even more to reading his new one, How Music Works.His prose here is lively but straightforward\u2014many of these pieces are more like blog posts (Byrne does have a blog, by the way, at http://journal.davidbyrne.com/) than literary essays. Few individual quotes jumped out at me until very late in the book. Here are a couple of good ones, though:The myth of neutrality is an effective blanket for a host of biases.\u2014p.213 (London)I realized that at that time I was more interested in irony than utopia.\u2014p.221 (San Francisco)I want to compare this to James Howard Kunstler's enormously influential The Geography of Nowhere. Though that particular work is not actually mentioned here, as far as I could tell, Kunstler's analysis of the relative merits of Detroit, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon (which last Byrne doesn't actually mention either!) definitely reached many of the same conclusions that Byrne does regarding how devastating high-speed freeways, suburban sprawl and car culture in general can be (and usually are) to a city's health.Byrne does mention some other books about cities, though, that I've read too\u2014I noticed in particular his quote (on p.259) from E.B. White's thoughtful though all too brief Here Is New York (which I own, a gift from a similarly thoughtful cow orker), and his recognition of the urban wisdom of Jane Jacobs (p.285 et seq.).Bicycle Diaries is both a travelogue and a work with a definite agenda, but it's also full of pointed asides and extended ruminations about architecture, sociology and politics, outsider art, the likely nature of artificial intelligence, and of course about music too. I don't think it's hyperbole to say that Byrne is a genius, and his interests have never been boring or confined to a single discipline or genre.This makes the book more interesting as well\u2014while it is autobiographical, Byrne's stance here is relatively modest and unpretentious. He's not falsely modest\u2014he's well aware that he occupies a position of privilege, and he isn't shy about naming the influential people in whose circles he travels\u2014but it's not so much about Byrne himself as about the places he's been, the people he's met and the things they've done. Of course, Byrne comes back to New York City in the end, as is both understandable and appropriate. Seems he's found himself a city to live in."}, {"userName": "Stan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/294959-stan", "userReview": "This is a book of David Byrne's musings while riding his bicycle in cities around the world. There is nothing particularly earthshaking here, but it is fascinating to observe this obviously brilliant man's open, active, free-ranging mind as he considers, well, whatever comes to mind. He describes his ride through Detroit as heartbreaking. He argues that what we build says something about who we are, and to some extent shapes what we become. He is saddened that old architecture is being replaced by modern, \"functional\", soulless buildings. He touches on the meaning of beauty, and what makes art art; the evolution of language; and the life of Imelda Marcos. He wonders whether there is actually something in our DNA that results in 3rd world marketplaces the world over being eerily similar. He suggests that today's Power Point presentations are a form of contemporary theater, less objective and more performance than is generally acknowledged. Here is one of my favorite examples of his thought processes, as he considers the typical method of grouping objects in \"curiosity cabinets\":\".....were often grouped.....by whatever criteria seemed appropriate, be it shape, material, or color. There would be, for example, a mass of bulbous objects from various parts of the world and then some sharp, pointy ones grouped together. Many of these objects had nothing to do with one another except for having similar shapes. Hardly what one would think of as a rigorous, enlightened scientific method of categorization. But thinking back on it, I would suggest that, yes, in a truly enlightened world all green objects are in a way related somehow, more than by just being green, and maybe they are related in a way we don't understand yet, just as all hexagonal objects might share a common trait as well. These crazy groupings might someday be seen as not completely arbitrary.\"In his days in Talking Heads, Byrne sang, \"There's a party in my mind, and I hope it never stops.\" The party may have wound down to a mellow discussion of ideas, but his mind is still a pretty cool place to visit."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "I am passionate about cycling, not in a macho or, heaven forbid, a lycra-clad way, it is quite simply my favourite mode of transport for getting from A to B. If I can use my bicycle then I will - and frequently do.If I rank my preferred ways of travelling it goes:BicycleWalkingRunningTrainBusCarFerry, boat etcAeroplaneRather wonderfully David Byrne feels the same way (although he is more extreme). We are cut from the same cloth - not a statement I ever expected to make. David takes his bicycle everywhere and, like me, it is his primary mode of transport. This book is a celebration of bike riding - of the rewards of seeing the world at bike level. It gives the reader an insight into what David saw and thought as he pedalled around cities which include London, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Manila, New York, and San Francisco.I had a feeling I was going to love this book and instead I merely enjoyed it. Like How Music Works, which I read very recently, I was expecting a bit more. That said, if you like Mr Byrne - and really, why wouldn't you? - there is much to enjoy. He muses on all manner of wide and varied subjects, many of which are only tangentially linked to the city covered in each chapter. Ultimately what is most impressive though is the mere fact that he takes his bike everywhere, folded into a suitcase, and then, no matter how easy or difficult, he uses it to travel around every city even where very few others cycle. The arguments in favour of cycling are so compelling that it is a wonder why it is not the most prevalent form of transport for anyone trying to travel around a city, that it isn't, is down to short term political thinking and vested interests. I hope one day the majority of the world will follow David Byrne's lead.

I think he would make a fine travel companion because he has such regard for the people and cultures of the places he visits. In fact, I backed into this book in an unusual way. When the author visited my home city, Pittsburgh, he went to see the Maxo Vanka murals, a set of remarkable paintings in a Croatian Catholic church in an off-beat location. It\u2019s the kind of place the locals don\u2019t even know so well, in part because it\u2019s hard to find. My niece came to visit the murals because she learned about them from David Byrne! If that\u2019s what Byrne saw in Pittsburgh, then I had to be respectful of what he found in other places. He is not a conventional tourist.The down side is that the book is mostly a collection of unconnected travel anecdotes, in which he focuses on the issues particular to each place (great places like Sydney, Manila, Buenos Aires, Berlin). He despairs of those places designed around highway systems and lauds the humanizing spaces accessible on his beloved folding bike. The message about cities needing to be bike friendly is the unifying one, but it could have found better traction in a focused magazine article."}, {"userName": "Karima", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88244-karima", "userReview": "The author is arguably most associated with his role as a founding member and principal songwriter of the American new wave band Talking Heads,(active between 1975 and 1991.)

While very little of this book is literally about things seen from a cyclists point of view, his views on cities designed for driving and the privatisation of public spaces are linked to that perspective. I don't think he is critical enough, sharp enough about accountability for urban decay in the US. He's too mild mannered! But what can you do but be grateful for a broadly anti-colonial anti-corporate voice? There are loads of tangents about art, language, the Anangu in Australia where he hits one of a few bum notes, seeming to let White Australians off the hook and the obligation of owning their muck because he got to like them!

Since the early 1980s, David Byrne has been riding a bike as his principal means of transportation in New York City. Two decades ago, he discovered folding bikes and started taking them on tour. Byrne's choice was made out of convenience rather than political motivation, but the more cities he saw from his bicycle, the more he became hooked on this mode of transport and the sense of liberation it provided. Convinced that urban biking opens one's eyes to the inner workings and rhythms of a city's geography and population, Byrne began keeping a journal of his observations and insights. An account of what he sees and whom he meets as he pedals through metropoles from Berlin to Buenos Aires, Istanbul to San Francisco, Manila to New York, Bicycle Diaries also records Byrne's thoughts on world music, urban planning, fashion, architecture, cultural dislocation, and much more, all conveyed with a highly personal mixture of humor, curiosity, and humility.
