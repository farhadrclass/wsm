Everything about this book's packaging - the cover, the blurb - screams Sci-Fi! Saving the world! Action! Angsty love! No wonder every negative review of it I've read says - Well, I expected Numbers to be this, but it turned out to be that, so I am totally disappointed.Let me tell you what this novel actually is about. Numbers is a story of two poor, rough British kids who find themselves on the run when, thanks to Jem's ability to see every person's death date, they flee the scene of a bombing and are accused of causing it. Their flight is not necessary and maybe even stupid. But Jem and Spider are the kids of the lower class, children of addicts who maybe dabble in crime, and they do not have much faith in authorities (and rightfully so). They think that escape is their only way out. The other important driving force of the flight is Jem's knowledge that Spider's death is only mere days away. She can't allow her friend spend his last days in jail. The two are hiding and hoping for a better future for themselves.Jem's ability has an almost allegorical meaning here. It is not a super-special world-saving power and it doesn't have much bearing on the story. This ability is more of Jem's personal burden she has to carry. It has shaped her worldview, forced her to stay away from people, to never let anyone in. What is the point of getting attached if she knows when their lives will end? I loved almost everything about Numbers. The development of the relationship between Jem and Spider was so sincere and well done in its progression from reluctant camaraderie to genuine young love between two outcasts. I enjoyed Jem, closed out and vulnerable and funny. (Special thanks to the reader of the audio version - she was fabulous and truly brought Jem to life.) Spider is a male love interest I rarely see in YA lit - he is not particularly attractive, he is flawed, and yet infinitely caring and kind. Finally, I appreciated the main sentiment of this story - we all are walking clocks counting down the remaining minutes, hours, days, years of our lives. Knowing that everything ends should not stop us from enjoying what we have now.My only negative is that I wish the story was not so sad."}, {"userName": "Ruth Belano", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643183-ruth-belano", "userReview": "Review before finishing the book:I am so sorry to my friend who willingly spent her money just to buy me this disappointing book for Christmas. When I read the overview, I was like, \"This is going to be a great book!\", and so, I spent months craving for this book because I don't have the time to buy and read it, until my oh so good friend gave it to me as Christmas gift. I was so excited to read it!! but...It.was.horrible. The plot was just so irrelevant to the supposed main idea of the book. The ending was so predictable.. Okay, start from the beginning. Jem is a troubled child under foster care who doesn't want to get emotionally attached to anyone because of her ability to see other people's death dates when she looks into their eyes, blah blah blah. Then she meets Spider, a guy who finally understands her, lets down her guard and takes a chance, blah blah blah. The back of the book was way more interesting than the story itself.So the London Eye explodes right after they left the area (they ran away, she predicted it, obviously), so the police got suspicious and they're being hunted, accused of being terrorists. And that's where the interesting part ends. The rest of the book comprised of their runaway and hiding from authorities and civilization. It was booooring. I didn't care about the characters all that much. The only character I liked was Britney, who played a minor, short role in the book.Personally, I was expecting something more exciting after the explosion. Like, there would be another terrorist attack, and Jem and Spider would get caught, but they found out about Jem's abilities (somehow) and she would be used to help stop the future terrorist attack. Or something. Or maybe even reveal Val to be some sort of former agent or something. ANYTHING. Anything that doesn't involve running away over and over. It was just so... repetitive. Okay, maybe I'm like this 'cause I just finished reading Eve, which was full of surprises (AWESOME BOOK). I wanted more from the story, I don't get how the rest of the events relate to her ability. I mean, it's just so pointless to have that factor in the story if the author isn't even going to make it useful. It's like.. \"I can see the person's death\" WOW and as the story progresses.. SO WHAT NOW??I don't recommend this to anyone. The sort of love story part here isn't even sappy. I'm so so so so so sorry Christa!! Thank you, though!! I tried, but it was just so boring... It sucked, really. I didn't even get into the the characters.. Sooooorry. Anyway, I'm going to try to finish for the sake of finishing it."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "I was pleasantly suprised by this book, I really liked the story and the exploration of the underclasses and labelling in society. The questions asked about the current justice system in Britain and whether or not the police are simply looking for a likely candidate to blame, are often a question faced in reality. The exploration of racial issues also gives insight into a dark world where the police see a black boy (or girl, but less so) automatically as a criminal or at least a suspect.The plot intrigued me as soon as I heard of it. The protagonist, Jem, has been able to see the numbers all her life, as soon as she looks into someone's eyes, she knows the date they will die. The numbers have always been absolute and unchanging. But one day she sees the exact same numbers on everyone waiting in the London Eye queue and flees, knowing the tragic fate of the passengers. The Eye becomes subject to a terrorist attack and the only CCTV footage shows Jem and her friend Spider running away from the scene. Instant suspects, the two attempt an escape, heading for a seaside town of Spider's childhood.The story idea was very good, it seemed fairly original to me unless someone better-read would like to correct me. The focus on the lower working class was insightful but, most likely, exaggerated. I find it stereotypical of the author to paint every one as a drug-dealer or criminal of some kind, all with a low life expectancy to go with it. Some of it may be an accurate depiction of the struggles faced when you aren't born into wealth and opportunity but I grew up in a very mixed-class English town and the only difference between those defined as 'working class' and 'middle class' was their income. Neither were criminals, neither lacked education or ambition.The race issue, however, can still happen and the author made her point very effectively by the way that the police assume without question that Spider must be a criminal.The love story is something I didn't expect and when it first happened I didn't expect to get into it either. Actually, I became rather absorbed. Jem is such a strong character, I like how she is the one to pull Spider out of the river instead of waiting for him to come to her rescue (Twilight, anyone?); and how the two are partners, equally helping each other and sharing one another's strengths and weaknesses - there is no damsel, no knight in shining armour, they are both equals who have been labelled by society since they were young kids.The ending, well the bit just before the ending, made me cry. I felt unexpected emotion for the characters and was left with no doubt as to whether I would read Numbers #2. And even if that bit before the ending hadn't been enough, the very last line would have been the cliffhanger to seal the deal. I was very impressed."}, {"userName": "Annie Z", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4735385-annie-z", "userReview": "Reading this book was agonising.I wanted to like it so much. Jem\u2019s ability is great. The message of the novel is interesting. The concept holds so much promise, but gets seriously bungled up due to the shoddy writing, silly characters and insipid plot. I didn\u2019t like the writing\u2014it felt kind of messy to me. In my opinion, the story is told in a very dull way. I don\u2019t know, it had the potential to be interesting, but it fell flat in that area.And the characters! They are such complete idiots! Jem is such a frustrating protagonist. The whole \u2018bitter\u2019 thing is understandable, given her sad history, but after a while it gets kind of annoying. There were a few moments in which I actually liked Spider, but overall he\u2019s pretty irritating too (or maybe I\u2019m just an irritable person?).The decisions the characters make are just so incredibly stupid. Neither Jem nor Spider seem to have the ability to think things through rationally so they just rush headlong into disaster. They don\u2019t even seem to THINK before making rash decisions (like fleeing from the police for no reason, or having unprotected sex\u2026). There are consequences for your actions!Practically the whole plot is based on their stupidity. Seriously\u2014why did they flee? WHY? If they had acted sensibly, the whole mess would have been wrapped up without so much hassle. Yes, I get that they have issues with the social system. I get that they mistrust the authorities. But honestly, going on the run? Who does that? What does it solve? Their actions just\u2026 defy logic.I will admit that I only skimmed the last fifty pages. And, er, wow. That ending with Spider\u2026 it\u2019s ludicrous. If it was intended to be shocking or sad, it failed epically in those departments. So overall: I really don\u2019t like this book. What a waste of a good concept. (And apparently, it\u2019s a series!

A book that reminded me that, while it might take a while, you need to give a book a chance...it just might turn out to be something you adore!This book also carries with it a strong message, everyone dies, that's a fact...but it's not how you die, or the date of your death that matters \u2013it's who you are UNTIL that day!

Not because of the writing or... a lack of talent from the author's side. No. I just hated the characters so much that I couldn't help but feel tortured throughout the story.I mean, if you don't like the characters, you're doomed to dislike the book in general.Alright, let me try to explain this without being rude.The main characters are so dumb, that the only people I sympathized with in this story were the police chasing them.There simply isn't a real reason for them to run away. Not one. And that nullifies the entire plot, doesn't it? It's kind of like when you watch a movie, and at the end the main character wakes up and you find out that it was all a dream. You get so angry that you want to scream, because that ending means you've wasted 2 hours or more of your life on a story that didn't matter. A story that didn't have to happen.That's exactly how I felt about this book.The best parts were when people confronted the main character, Jem, and asked her why she was running. She could never really give an actual answer, could she? One thing she said was: \"I don't like cops\". Great. Wonderful. That's why I'm reading this book? Because you don't like cops? Then she went on about how the police weren't going to believe them because of their background. But it's so painfully obvious that this is a pathetic attempt from the author to make the story make sense. It doesn't work, because the police made it clear that they wanted to talk to them about being witnesses. Not terrorists.Why would I want to read about someone who complains about her having to run away from the police and sleep on the streets, if she didn't need to do so in the first place?I growled. I shouted. I pulled my hair. I hated these characters to the point where I wanted them to jump off that roof top.I'm sorry. But that's how I feel.And don't get me started on that silly ending...."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "Jem has an unusual gift--when she looks people in the eye, a set of numbers pops into her head. When she was younger, she thought nothing of this. However, when her mother dies of an overdose, the numbers suddenly make sense to 6 year old Jem: the numbers are the month, day, and year on which the person in question will die.Now 15 years old, Jem has lived a tough life in inner-city London. Shuffled from foster home to foster home and understandably withdrawn and guarded because of her secret, Jem keeps to herself and avoids making contact with anyone else. Kind of tough to make friends when every time you look at them you\u2019re reminded of the date they\u2019re going to kick it, right? All of this changes for Jem when she meets Spider, an energetic boy from the wrong side of the tracks who forces his way into Jem\u2019s life. The problem? Jem knows that Spider will die in two weeks unless she figures out how to manipulate the numbers. Things don\u2019t get any easier for the two when they are spotted fleeing the scene moments before a terrorist attack on the London Eye. Now on the run, time and fate seem to be forcing Jem and Spider into dangerous situations that will surely result in Spider\u2019s rapidly approaching expiration date.I really enjoyed that Rachel Ward took some risks in this young adult novel. These are not the spoiled, beautiful teenagers that populate so much of this genre today. Life for Jem and Spider is grim and gritty, a lifetime of disappointment and failure all mapped out for them as victims of cyclical poverty and its associated pitfalls. They\u2019ve both been in trouble with the law, and the reader can see how their inherent distrust of a system whose deck seems to be stacked against them leads to one poor decision after another. They\u2019re also both stubbornly obtuse to the fact that they are as much perpetrator as victim in the downward spiral that is their lives. The one fault that consistently nagged at me was that Jem\u2019s gift is forgotten for entire chapters and seems almost secondary once the characters are on the run. From that point on, it\u2019s a typical chase narrative with Jem and Spider struggling to stay ahead of the mounting manhunt. I was just expecting a little more of the plot to hinge upon Jem\u2019s ability and was disappointed when it didn\u2019t. If I had such a power, I would seriously be messing with some people\u2019s heads. However, because of its strong characterization and one hell of an ending, I enjoyed it enough to give the sequel a shot when it becomes available.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "I've been going back and forth on how I wanted to rate this book, and I'm still not sure it's worth a full three stars, but that's what it's going to get from me at least for right now. I guess I was expecting something more\u2026 maybe different from Numbers by Rachel Ward. It wasn't really creepy, dramatic, suspenseful nor intriguing at any grand or significant scale. The story just shifted my suspended reality from here to there with no consistent path or flow, but I never really lost interest, so I guess it worked out okay.The story is about Jem, a fifteen year old girl who's been tossed back and forth in the foster care system after the death of her mother, which I believe was around the age of 4 or 5, not 100% sure, but she was young. Anywho, the creepy, well not really creepy, but unique thing about Jem is that she can read peoples' numbers when she looks into their eyes. Those numbers reveal the date of the person's death with an uncanny accuracy. So, Jem never really forges any relationships with people for fear of what she'll learn about them. This all changes when she meets Spider, a boy that somehow captures her attention and begins to make her feel emotions she doesn't quite know what to do with. The story takes off, well not really takes off, but progresses, not that either, but you get it, when Jem and Spider are at the London Eye and Jem notices the people around her at the station share the same number. Predicting something is about to happen, her and Spider take off before a b0mb eventually detonates. Jem and Spider are caught on camera fleeing the scene and making them potential suspects. Lots of other stuff happens, but not really.There were a couple things to note about this book. One, Jem and Spider are both fifteen and the author detailed an event that I didn't think she needed to describe so vividly considering the age of the two characters. Not going to say much about it, just that yes I know that stuff happens, but does it really need to be spelled out and gloried? I'm not passionate enough about what she wrote to take a stance one way or the other, just simply surprised that she did\u2026 that's all I'm saying about that. Second, the last few sentences really gave me cause to screech WHOA, but after 300 pages or so of bland, her final wow factor seemed a little late in coming. Lastly, the language is really foul, but I wasn't too vested into the story to care too much, so I just wanted to simply mention\u2026 the language is foul. That's all.Overall, just an okay read that really had a ton more potential that I don\u2019t think the author took advantage of. I guess if this story really grabbed my interest and the characters moved me to compassion, I'd have written a better review, but not really, so I\"ll just blame my crappy review on the June gloom here in Cali..."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4131916-zoe", "userReview": "Okay, so, usually, I try to be nice about reviewing a book, because writing a novel is hard, but I did not like Numbers. Like, at all.I thought it was a really cool idea, that Jem could see the date of people's deaths, but I feel like that wasn't really the most important part of the plot. It was like, \"hey, this girl and her boyfriend are on the run from the police, even though they really didn't do anything wrong, but since they were suspiciously running from the scene before a terrorist attack and then were suspiciously running from the police when they were looking for them, they are now thought to be terrorists. Stupid society. Oh, by the way, whenever the girl sees someone's eyes, she says the date of when they will die.\"And so there was really no point of the seeing date thing at all. The author could have done the same story without it. I mean, they wouldn't have been running if she hadn't seen the dates, but there could have been a different reason they came up with. The other thing that bothered me\" WHY could she see the DOD? I mean, don't go all, \"There doesn't NEED to be a reason, it's fiction,\" on me, because, yes there does need to be a reason. Why can Harry preform magic? He's a wizard! Why do the X-Men have crazy powers? They're mutants! Why can Percy do all that stuff he does? He's like a demi-god, or whatever. (I'm running out of examples, but you know what I mean.) So I'm expected to believe that Jem was just born with this random ability that has no real purpose in the story?Also, I didn't like the characters.

If I could, I would definitely give 1 and 1/2 star rating. But only because I wanted to see how this author could possibly ruin a completely awesome idea some more. It had promise and then she whisked it away.I stayed up to finish this until the wee hours of the morning and have to say that I was pludging on because I not only wanted to see how it ended, but because I wanted to see how the predictable, but sad ending was said and laid out to me.Mind you, I read the description here on goodreads.com and ventured a guess that this was going to be awesome. I was sorely mistaken.I ended up reading the inside cover, describing what the book is about, which I usually yield from doing because sometimes it ruins the book completely. I shouldn't have done that either.Both of them got my hopes up and I was truly disappointed with this book. I surely thought that this was going to go a different route. One, I did not know it was mainly going to be placed in London, I thought it was just a trip that Jem went on. Two, the second main character's name is Spider. C'mon. Three, there was just so much that Rachel Ward could have done better with this book!!! Four, I knew the ending. Totally predictable, almost to the point that I did not want to finish reading it, but was curious to see the name she would pick. Sorry if that gave it away.So for a scrawny, white fifteen girl old year who sees numbers, which is the date you will die, she ends up getting all of the walls she put up knocked down by a 6'4 black teenager (?) that just can't sit still. Total opposites attract here. Not saying interracial relationships are bad!!! I'm just saying their backgrounds, and personalities did NOT mesh together or go together. But whatever.They end up being chased after a terrorist bombing explodes at the Eye of London. They are seen running from the scene because Jem sees the date flash in everyone's eyes, which then ensues the high speed race, sometimes on foot and other times in a car, across all of England. The miraculous part is that Tattoo Face finds them just so easily, and the police and all of England have no clue, only suspicions. Totally idiotic. And then the side remarks about Val, Terry/Spider's nan, can see auras, but only after losing her husband. What? Ok, just throw that curveball in there. Glad Jem can relate to someone....other than Spider, who I did not like at all. I just could not even fathom liking him. Too erratic and too spastic to even make me see straight.I guess overall, this was not the book for me. I thought that once she confessed to someone, particularly Spider, that he would turn her in, Jem would be sent to the FBI/CIA or what have you in London, England and she would turn into this awesome spy or something of that sort.Not her getting pregnant with Spider's baby, having a mental breakdown, Spider dying, and Jem being totally uncontrollable with the loss of the only friend and person she truly loved and ever known. Dumb Dumb Dumb. Saw him falling from a mile away! And why was he the only one on that roof? No one else made it past the four locked doors? C'mon. And her losing sight of her numbers while pregnant? Man, she should've gotten knocked up a long time ago! And that whole stint with the daughter of the police officer? OMG! Could you get any more side tracked with what your book is about?! It's called numbers for gosh sakes! Stick with it! Ward's tangents were just too much and the concept was cool, but the execution was horribly planned to tell the tale. I'm surprised someone actualy published this.I expected more. I wanted more. But it was not delivered. I won't even bother picking the next one in the series.

Numbers is the story of Jem; a fifteen year old girl who has spent over half her life orphaned and bounced from family to family in the foster care system. Therefore, it almost goes without saying that she is a troubled girl with issues a plenty. In addition to the crap load of, well crap life has piled on her; Jem sees a number whenever she looks someone in the eye. That number is always there, always the same, and it is the date that person will die. As a result, Jem grows up learning to avoid looking anyone in the eye, shuns friendships and attachments, and barely skates by in school. Her philosophy is you\u2019re born, shit happens, you die. Everything is random; nothing is for a reason or has a real purpose. How can she think otherwise when she knows someone\u2019s death date has been predetermined from the moment they are born?Regarding the numbers Jem sees, I think a case can be made for the numbers being real as well as it all being a figment of her imagination. Jem has always seen the numbers, but she didn\u2019t figure out what they are all about until she discovered the body of her junkie mother. Suddenly, six (or seven?) year old Jem is alone and sees death everywhere, in the eyes of everyone she sees. Under ordinary circumstances, facing death at a young age (let alone something as traumatic as Jem\u2019s experience) is going to influence a person. So, considering what has happened to her, it it any surprise that Jem turns out to be an antisocial loner obsessed with death? Under the disguise of mental illness, Jem may be a very perceptive girl who is able to sense when someone has an illness, or when someone is living a life so dangerous that it will be ended before their due time. I hate to play the \u201chysterical female\u201d card but if Jem has a sense that Person X will die today, and they do, does that make her prophetic? Or it is a coincidence? Perhaps she has had that sense about others, yet they lived so we are not privy to those experiences? I should probably stop this line of thinking in this review though, because it is fairly clear that author Rachel Ward intended for Jem\u2019s numbers to be real. However, what added to my enjoyment of Numbers is the fact that they could also be explained away by life circumstances, mental illness and stress. I can\u2019t help thinking of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake and Madapple, both of which drew a fine line between reality, magic/paranormal, and mental illness. As so many people have mentioned, this isn\u2019t the sci-fi story it is marketed as. It is a fast moving, engrossing and plot driven book. It is also a very sweet story of friendship and growing up. Numbers completely captivated me from beginning to end. Admittedly, we are thrown a pretty big teaser early on and I have no impulse control. None whatsoever. Needing to know what will happen next was a large part of my drive to finish this so quickly. Even so, I look forward to reading this again, and seeing if the story is just as compelling the second time around (although I have a feeling it will be.) The ending is one of the best I\u2019ve read. It left me with a punched in the gut feeling, and good or bad, it\u2019s hard not to appreciate a story which makes the reader to feel anything so profoundly."}, {"userName": "Andrea Hussey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4653174-andrea-hussey", "userReview": "plot spoilersDid Not FinishI really debated quitting on pg. 2.

The word giraffe was used, along with the phrases gangly and lanky, and he had BO. Yep, those are top quality traits in a romantic interest. And I hate the cussing these teenagers are doing, as well as the smoking, drugs, and living on the streets. That\u2019s not my idea of a good book at all.

That was really mean, and I don\u2019t like mean characters. And then when she realized his death date was set for Christmas, she said it would forever be spoiled for his family, and said it would \u201cserve him right, the cruel bastard.\u201d That was cruel. And you should direct that word to yourself, not the guy who\u2019s actually trying to make a difference in your pathetic life.There were several phrases used that only someone living in England would know. A little clarification wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Like, she said Spider went to the bog, which I assumed was the bathroom, but didn\u2019t know for sure because I don\u2019t live in England. You can\u2019t write and have only the people that live in your area know what you\u2019re talking about. A dictionary would\u2019ve been nice.I also didn\u2019t like how she kept calling people retards. And when she said she finally got with someone, it would have to be someone descent, not like Spider. He would have to be at least an 8 out of 10. Who is she to have such standards? That\u2019s really conceited. I wish I knew what she looked like but the author has deemed it unimportant to give readers a physical description of the character we\u2019re reading about, even though it\u2019s page 41. It\u2019s unbelievable that you wouldn\u2019t let us know what the girl looks like. And I just found out very recently that she was 15. Thanks for finally tossing that out there. Do you realize how important these details are? Any reader knows that you visualize what you\u2019re reading about, but it\u2019s kinda hard to do that when you have no details about the character\u2019s appearance. Idk what her hair color is, eye color, anything, just that she\u2019s small and white. So I\u2019m just envisioning a faceless blob at this point.At the party Spider offers her pot, and that was surprising because she asked him if he did drugs and he said he didn\u2019t. But I guess she didn\u2019t consider it drugs because she said it wasn\u2019t heavy. That was so distasteful. Jem was a spoiled, distasteful, careless brat that bemoaned her solitary, poor life but then did things like pull out a knife at school and somehow find no fault with herself, blaming others, and trash all of her stuff and yet insist she had nothing, when she had brought that state into being entirely on her own. Yeah, that makes sense.Finally, on page 60, after she stole someone\u2019s milk, obviously proving that she had learnt nothing, and was no closer to redeeming her ways, I had to do something I haven\u2019t done in a really long time: I flipped to the back of the book. Spoilers ahead:The ending was so messed up. I wondered how she was going to save Spider from his demise, yet I saw the author had no intention to ever do that. Spider is dead, and she\u2019s spreading his ashes over the sea, and somebody gets his ashes in their eye I think. Really great stuff. That\u2019s a sure-fire way to create a really crappy novel: just have one of the couple die off in the end. And to top this trashy story off, she gets pregnant at 15, and 5 years later her kid has the same gift as her. I guess they\u2019ll be in the next book, and their love interest will die. What a colossal, disgusting waste of my time. Drugs, violence, poverty, drinking, cussing, and teen pregnancy. That makes for great reading."}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124284-misty", "userReview": "4.5I think you have to take the book synopsis with a little grain of salt. I went into this thinking it was going to be sort of post-apocalyptic, with this huge cataclysmic event that Jem knows is coming, and that it was going to be all about that. Really, though, it's all about Jem. The attack is fairly small, comparatively, and really is more a catalyst for the action, and not the action itself. It's a story of self-discovery as much as anything.And I didn't find this a bad thing.The book is much more a study of human nature -- in all its harsh realities and surprising glories. There are so many things working together to make Jem's story what it is: powerful and genre-defying and unflinching. There are elements of a coming of age story, dashes of romance, gritty urban fantasy and thought-provoking sci-fi. I truly loved a lot of the choices Rachel Ward made in this book, because I never really felt like she was holding back. She doesn't write down to her audience or pander. Jem's voice is always authentic and utterly human, by turns filled with wonder and triumph, and hopelessness and despair. Her voice and her journey -- fantastic as it may be -- is so human, in fact, that she is at times frustrating and yell-at-able in the way that truer characters can be.I found myself so invested in Jem and her emotions, and I really felt it as she slowly opened up and grew as a person. And lest that sound really sappy and boring, I also really loved how on the edge of my seat I was through this whole book. There is a constant layer of tension and worry that pervades the story. I truly worried for Jem and Spider, and I loved that Rachel Ward never took the easy way out, or lessened her story with quick fixes and deus ex machina moments (well, there is one that comes to mind, but I actually liked it. It was very human for a deus moment... It worked.)And through all of this there's this kick-ass concept of the numbers Jem sees, and what they mean realistically and philosophically, and what Jem's responsibility is, if any. It was all handled really, really well, in ways I wasn't always expecting, and I have to say, I ended up respecting Ward as an author and being far more impressed by this book and its unflinching human-ness than I ever thought to be. All this from a debut.And if that sounds at all like your thing, I'd suggest you read it."}, {"userName": "doctor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13387642-doctor", "userReview": "Now, if I were rating this up to the point of the explosion, a couple chapters after, and the possible potential that this book could have had- it would have gotten a 4.

It got me all excited about a girl who could see death dates (which wasn't as creepy as all the comments said on the back, hello people, haven't you seen Death Note?) and how her world was ready to explode, plus the fact that she was getting close to someone who would be dying soon. Wouldn't it have been interesting if Jem realized she had the potential of changing fates and time? Of learning how to harness her ability.We're not even told why she has the \"sodding\" thing (oh, points for this being so british it hurt, and in the good way. Reminded me of Misfits.)And then they had to off my favorite character! WTF? What did Spider ever do to you, Ward? Except make your dumb wet towel of a character happy?

I don't care if Jem and Spider are fifteen years old, and if that is a way to ilustrate their social background. I understand it, but i don't have to like reading it. In fact it became painful to do it. But i'm more than thirty years old. So shame on me, for deciding to read it. I'm perfectly aware that this is a YA book. But i never read something like that. Something that made me, almost on the first pages of the book want to give up on it. Because the characters just felt flat, as cardboard. They had no depth.Fortunately for me, the author, decided around one third of the book, that Spider should start talking in whole, complete sentences.Thank you. Talk about change of personality...Let's talk about Jem, the leading character...so, Jem looks at \"you\" and sees when you're going to die....interesting concept....does it go anywhere?No.Does one find out WHY?No. But one could say that the Lord's ways are misterious.

Jem's and Spider's world is not a kind one -- their story represents all those underprivileged, disenfranchised kids who fall through the cracks to end up working dead-end jobs, addicted to drugs, serving time, or dead. It's not a pretty picture, and while Ward is writing from a clearly British perspective, I feel it's not all that different in Canada either -- born into poverty, drugs, and violence and most likely that's where you stay. That cycle is a vicious one and very hard to break.But this rip-roaring page-turner is more than just a social critique of the English class system, it's a story of a young girl with a very unusual problem -- once she makes eye contact with you she knows the exact date of your death. That's a great hook and as soon as I heard about this book I just knew I had to read it. It doesn't disappoint. Jem is wonderful -- prickly, antisocial and with a huge chip on her shoulder, but lovable nonetheless. She's been \"through the shit\" and has every right to be weary and leery. It's only until she meets Spider that all that begins to change for her. Oh how I love the gangly ADHD Spider, who jitters and jives to the music in his head, never able to quite shut up or sit still. What I love about this book is that it forces us to contemplate our own mortality (terrain most teens eat up and are comfortable with) but grown-ups often run away from. If each of us started our lives knowing exactly when we were going to die, would it change how we live? Would any of us want to know? I'm fairly certain I wouldn't. I know it's going to happen \"someday\" but it's freeing to not know exactly when. Knowing would somehow suck the life out of the time that's left, rather than make it more precious. I think. And you gotta respect a book that makes you think. Oh, and did I mention that there is a sequel on the way ...

Her mom was a junkie who died of an overdose. She\u2019s been moved from school to school, and in fact cuts school regularly. She has no friends, and avoids people. But that\u2019s not why she\u2019s a moody loner. Sort of like the kid from The Sixth Sense, Jem doesn\u2019t exactly see dead people, she sees numbers. When she looks someone in the eye, she sees their death date. That\u2019s not a spoiler, it\u2019s in the blurb on the book jacket, and it\u2019s a great hook. I totally couldn\u2019t wait to read this book.Now, about those death numbers... I got a little hung up on this concept. Seeing actual numbers like on a digital clock seems weirdly computerish to me, whereas you\u2019d think if you could sense something psychically about a person\u2019s death, you would sense it in some kind of organic way, a weight of the years, or the shortness of time. But numbers? Plus, Jem didn\u2019t even know what the numbers signified when she was little. What\u2019s going on in her brain? Is there a digital gauge up there somewhere? That was distracting.Setting that aside, I related well to Jem, with her feeling of always being on the outside, and I was really happy when she made a friend despite herself. Another outsider, Spider gloms on to her, he\u2019s a gangly black kid who should bathe more often.Certain events lead to Jem and Spider becoming \u201cpersons of interest\u201d to the police, and they go on the run, at which point the story becomes more a standard thriller than anything to do with special powers. I was okay with that, because I liked the characters, and I liked how their relationship developed. But I was left at the end of the book with a lot of questions, which I\u2019m hoping will be answered in the sequel. How did Jem get this ability?

One minute I had decided that I wasn\u2019t going to read it anymore and then I would decide that I wanted to see how things played out. I went back and forth, back and forth the whole book.I was really intrigued by the whole plot of this book. A girl who sees the date someone is going to die whenever she looks into his or her eyes. Why can she see this? What does she do about it? How does she deal with it? I was interested to see what direction the author was going to take with it.The language was my biggest issue here. The amount of F words coming out of these characters mouths made me stop and put the book down on several occasions. There were also a lot of slang words, which I just find hard to follow sometimes.Jem is a very confused character; she is burdened with this unwanted knowledge and doesn\u2019t really know what to do with it. She keeps everyone at a distance, and tries her hardest to avoid eye contact with anybody. I really wasn\u2019t able to connect with Jem at all, I hardly ever agreed with any of the choices that she made, and kept getting mad at her the whole time.As for romance, Jem and Spiders friendship does develop into more of a relationship but it\u2019s a weird one. When Jem decided she liked Spider as more than a friend is beyond me. I felt like she spent most of her time criticizing him and then all of a sudden she decides she\u2019s in love with him.

[\u2026] Wir ziehen es vor, den Tod zu vergessen.\u201c(S. 321)Inhalt:Wenn Jem jemandem in die Augen sieht, sieht sie eine 8-stellige Zahl. Schon als sie klein war, hat sie diese Zahl gesehen. Aber erst am Todestag ihrer Mutter hat sie verstanden, was sie bedeutet. Die acht Ziffern zeigen das Todesdatum eines Menschen.Dieser Fluch isoliert Jem, sie traut sich nicht, zu irgendjemandem eine Bindung aufzubauen, dessen Tod stets vor Augen, musste sie daher von Pflegefamilie zu Pflegefamilie wechseln.Terry, genannt Spinne, ist der erste, der sich nicht von Jems abweisender Art abschrecken l\u00e4sst. Er krallt sich so lange fest, bis sich Jem ihm verbunden f\u00fchlt. Nur gibt es bei ihm ein gro\u00dfes Problem. Seine Zahl. Bis zu dem Datum sind es nicht mehr viele Tage.Die Ereignisse \u00fcberschlagen sich, Jem ist gemeinsam mit Spinne auf der Flucht, das Todesdatum r\u00fcckt immer n\u00e4her.Zum ersten Mal will Jem etwas dagegen unternehmen, um ihre erste Liebe zu retten.Meinung:Irgendwie wei\u00df ich nicht, wo ich anfangen soll. Normalerweise mache ich mir w\u00e4hrend dem Lesen Notizen, fasse kurz zusammen, was mir aufgefallen ist, eine Art Zusammenfassung. Als ich \u201eNumbers\u201c begonnen hatte, kam ich aber irgendwie nicht dazu.Denn von der ersten Seite an \u00fcbte Rachel Wards Deb\u00fct einen unglaublichen Sog auf mich aus. Obwohl ich von den Charakteren, allen voran der Protagonistin Jem, irritiert war, konnte ich nicht von dem Buch lassen. Ich war fasziniert von Jems Authentizit\u00e4t, den klaren Aussagen. Sie erz\u00e4hlt in Ich-Perspektive in Gegenwartsform, ich wusste nie, was als n\u00e4chstes kommt.Jem treibt sich gerne irgendwo herum, wo sie alleine ist. Sie kann nicht stets die Zahlen der Menschen vor sich haben, den Tag ihres Todes. So bleibt sie lieber f\u00fcr sich und geht den anderen aus dem Weg. Nicht so Spinne, der ihr nicht von der Pelle zu r\u00fccken scheint und f\u00fcr Jem Tag f\u00fcr Tag etwas mehr wie ein Freund wird, obwohl Jem gerade zu ihm keinen Kontakt m\u00f6chte, weil es bis zu seiner \u201eZahl\u201c nicht mehr lange hin ist. Aber das kann sie Spinne nicht sagen. Niemandem erz\u00e4hlt sie davon.Ab dem ersten Kontakt mit Spinne und der Nennung seiner Zahl spekulierte ich \u00fcber seinen Tod. Lag es lediglich an der gesellschaftlichen Unterschicht, der die Charaktere angeh\u00f6ren? Eine Schicht, in der Banden, Drogen und Gewalt zur Tagesordnung geh\u00f6ren? Genau diese Besonderheit der Charaktere war anf\u00e4nglich mein gr\u00f6\u00dftes Problem mit \u201eNumbers\u201c. Es brauchte ein paar Kapitel, bis ich mich mit der Art der Protagonistin, ihren negativen Zukunftsaussichten und auch ihrer sehr einfachen und Slang-m\u00e4\u00dfigen Ausdrucksweise klar kam. Handelt es sich doch hier um Personen, denen man auf der Stra\u00dfe nicht wirklich begegnen m\u00f6chte, von denen man den Blick abwendet, wie Jem selbst so sch\u00f6n sagt.\u00dcberwindet man diese H\u00fcrde jedoch, versucht, sich in die vorgegebenen gesellschaftlichen Strukturen einzuf\u00fchlen, erlebt man Charaktere der besonderen Art, die eine gro\u00dfe Bandbreite an Emotionen weitergeben und ihren eigenen Charme besitzen.Der Schreibstil bzw. die Erz\u00e4hlsprache von Jem ist dem Bildungsniveau der Protagonistin angepasst und macht ihre Schilderung der Erlebnisse authentisch. Sie ist es nicht gewohnt, Gef\u00fchle zu haben oder auszudr\u00fccken, daher mag die Geschichte dem ein oder anderen kalt vorkommen. Wer aber zwischen den Zeilen liest, sich mit ganzem Herzen auf Jem einl\u00e4sst, wird \u00fcberrascht sein, wie viel Gef\u00fchl in ihr steckt.Wie eingangs bereits erw\u00e4hnt, \u00fcbte der Plot, seine vielen Kapitel und die besondere Erz\u00e4hlweise einen Sog auf mich aus, dem ich mich nicht entziehen konnte. So st\u00f6rte es nicht, dass Rachel Ward die Spannung nur sehr langsam, aber kontinuierlich ansteigen und ihrem H\u00f6hepunkt entgegenstreben lie\u00df. Seite f\u00fcr Seite fesselte sie mich mehr, ich fieberte \u201edem Datum\u201c entgegen, stets die Hoffnung, dass sich alles zum Guten wenden w\u00fcrde.Das Ende von \u201eNumbers \u2013 Den Tod im Blick\u201c ist passend und emotionsgeladen und erkl\u00e4rt nun auch den Klappentext der Fortsetzung, die ich zum Gl\u00fcck bereits hier habe.Urteil:Rachel Wards Deb\u00fctroman \u201eNumbers\u201c liegt eine fantastische Idee zugrunde. Durch den Blick aus den Augen einer gesellschaftlich unteren sozialen Schicht erh\u00e4lt diese Facetten, die bei 08/15-Buch-Charakteren niemals in der Art aufgetreten w\u00e4ren. Abzug gibt es lediglich f\u00fcr die Eingew\u00f6hnungsphase in diese so untypische Welt und ihre Sprache. Daher sehr sehr gute 4 B\u00fccher f\u00fcr \u201eDen Tod im Blick\u201c.Wer sich nicht davor scheut, einer etwas anderen Protagonistin zu folgen, Teil ihres traurigen Lebens und ihrer miesen Zukunftsaussichten zu werden, sollte unbedingt zu \u201eNumbers\u201c greifen. Die tolle und tiefgr\u00fcndige Idee der Autorin wird auch euch \u00fcberzeugen!Die Serie:1. Numbers \u2013 Den Tod im Blick2. Numbers \u2013 Den Tod vor Augen3.

Jem) and Terry (a.k.a. Spider, nicknamed for his constant and ungainly motion). Jemma is a child of the foster care system who at age six found her mother's dead body after a heroin overdose. All her life, she has learned not to form attachments because the people she loves either don't love her in return or they all leave. Jem goes through life making as little eye contact and no physical contact whatsoever with the people around her. This is a protective strategy that has served her well given the fact that for as long as she can remember, when she looks into another person's eyes she sees a number written there (e.g., 12152010). She quickly learned that a person's \"special number\" is, in fact, their death date. Spider, in contrast, lives with his Gran, who provides a constant source of love if not direction, supervision, and/or material support. At the same time, it's also the story of children who are processed through a series of systems (e.g., the school system, the foster care system, the prison system) that seem to care little about their ultimate welfare. Jem and Spider's teacher, Mr. McNulty (aptly referred to as the Nutter for his trigger-hair temper), is a classic example given that he's already written his entire class off and daily instills in them a pervasive sense of their own worthlessness. This might sound like a terrible concept for a novel, but it's really quite clever. While a bit obvious, Jem and Spider's unlikely friendship quickly develops into a much deeper and abiding relationship. Over the course of the story--which takes place in only a few weeks--a number of individuals are able to slowly scale the previously unreachable heights of Mt. Jem as a consequence of Spider's ability to break her protective emotional shell. The story is set in 2010, but with a different set of numbers it could just as easily have been set any time in the past or future. What's so very effective is that the plot and sparse description (just enough to paint a great image in the reader's eye but not enough to call attention to itself) nicely juxtapose past and present--Jem's, humanity's, Britain's, etc. I had selected this from my library's new fiction shelf, so wasn't even aware that it was young-adult fiction until the user-friendly font size registered in my mind. But by then I was hooked! This is a good story, with a good mixture of creep factor, danger, and eccentric yet still highly likeable central characters. What truly does make it YA fiction, though, is the sometimes incredibly frustrating fact that the main characters think, act, and react to things--and fail to foresee the likely (if not obvious) implications of certain actions. That is, Jem is truly a 15 year old and not a 30-year old in a 15 year old's body. In that regard, I think that Num8ers will draw--and possibly retain--a strong young-adult following.One final comment bears mentioning. It was not until sitting down to write this review that I see that this is to be the first novel in a series. Yikes! In my estimation, this totally detracts from the chill factor at novel's end. I won't spoil it for you, but read the book and consider these two different courses (i.e., stand-alone story vs. first in a series) and see if you don't agree. I wouldn't suggest that this fact should dissuade readers from the book, but I do think that it greatly lessens the ending's punch."}, {"userName": "Camilla", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4589066-camilla", "userReview": "Just by glancing into someone's eyes, Jem can see the date of when that person will die.

Now, the police have footage of Jem and Spider running from the scene, and they must leave as soon as possible, because the accusations are far from true.The plot thickens, Jem and Spider are in enough trouble as it is, now they are escaping the accusations. This is the adventure of two teens doing everything they can to escape and survive in the meantime. They come along trouble during the way, meet new people and over come problems. Spider does everything he can to keep them safe, and so does Jem, but she is also keeping track of the days until the unthinkable happens.This was a very captivating book that left me hooked from the start. The emotions were very strong, and you felt them a long the way, leaving you attached to the characters and always hoping for their safety. The plot was amazing, and the characters were unique. They weren't regular characters from books talking about prom, going on dates or going out with a mysterious guy or girl. These characters went through a lot, and reading about their struggles was very powerful and heartbreaking. It isn't your typical romance either, which was great for a change. Overall I really liked this book, and I'm so glad I read it!!*There is quite a bit of swearing and some other things, so I would reccomend this book for ages 14+."}, {"userName": "Katelin R", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13932101-katelin-r", "userReview": "I would recommend the book \u201cNumbers\u201d by Rachel Ward to a friend because the book has a very unique and engaging plot. In the beginning of the book Jem (one of the main characters) says, \u201cThere are places were kids like me go. Sad kids, bad kids, kids that are different. Any day of the week, if you know were to look you\u2019ll find us.\u201d (1) This part of the book really hooked me. I wanted to know more about the main character. Will he/ she get into a lot of trouble? Why is he/she bad and sad? Also in my book Jem and Spider get into trouble with the school and the police are looking for them. When they run away Jem says, \u201c He was fizzing with energy, loving the buzz of it all running away, driving through London.\u201d (89) This part of the book showed me that spider was enjoying running away with Jem. I had to keep reading when I got to this part in the book because I wanted to find out weather Jem and Spider will get caught by the police or not, or Will someone turn them in? , Maybe they wont get caught at all? Towards the end of the book Jem and Spider fall in love with each other. Jem can see people\u2019s death dates so she knew when Spider was going to die. \u201cI\u2019d drawn him back to me on the fifteenth of December: 12152010.I saw the number and somehow I knew its message would come true.\u201d This part of the book gave me chills. Thruought the book I started feeling emotions for the two main characters Jem and Spider. When I read this I thought how would I feel if I was Jem? I also wondered if the date that Jem saw would be true or false.\tSome people may not want to recommend this book because the two main characters in the book smoke and get into trouble with the school. They run away and there is teen sex in the book. Even though the main characters in the book smoke, run away, and get into trouble with the school a lot, I would still recommend the book. I would still recommend the book because it told me a lot about the characters. It also helped me understand the plot of the book better. This is why I would recommend the book \u201cNumbers\u201d by Rachel Ward to a friend."}, {"userName": "Mafi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237043-mafi", "userReview": "3,5 \u00e9 a pontua\u00e7\u00e3o correcta. Em N\u00fameros- Luta contra o tempo conhecemos a vida de Jem, uma adolescente de 15 anos que desde que se lembra, quando v\u00ea uma pessoa, n\u00e3o importa a idade dessa, v\u00ea um n\u00famero. esse n\u00famero que v\u00ea \u00e9 a data em que a pessoa vai morrer. Ela sempre viu os n\u00fameros mas nunca se tinha apercebido o significado destes; apenas quando a sua m\u00e3e morreu \u00e9 que conseguiu decifrar o enigma dos n\u00fameros. Claro que tudo isto \u00e9 um grande fardo para Jem, que n\u00e3o consegue lidar com esta press\u00e3o e com a consci\u00eancia de saber quando a pessoa vai morrer. Por isso mesmo, ela n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito dada a relacionamentos. Acreditando que os n\u00fameros nunca erram, trava amizade com Spider, um rapaz da sua escola e certo dia, decidem visitar o Eye Ferris Wheel mas quando est\u00e3o na fila, Jem apercebe-se que todas as pessoas tem o mesmo n\u00famero, ou seja v\u00e3o morrer naquele dia. Assustados decidem fugir daquele local e o pior acontece quando ouvem uma explos\u00e3o no s\u00edtio onde estavam, \u00e9 um ataque terrorista. Sendo as ruas de Londres patrulhadas e vigiadas, a pol\u00edcia atrav\u00e9s das c\u00e2maras suspeita do casal, e a partir daqui Jem e Spider s\u00e3o o principal casal suspeito do ataque. Bem eu gostei bastante do livro mas apenas de algumas coisas. O conceito est\u00e1 bem constru\u00eddo, \u00e9 uma ideia interessante mas depois n\u00e3o gostei muito como a hist\u00f3ria se desenvolveu. A Jem n\u00e3o \u00e9 das melhores protagonistas, por vezes \u00e9 um bocadinho chatinha e depois a maneira como eles se tornaram suspeitos e s\u00e3o perseguidos pelo Governo Brit\u00e2nico \u00e9 um bocadinho fict\u00edcia demais. S\u00f3 porque um par de c\u00e2maras de vigil\u00e2ncia os viu a correr do local, minutos antes do ataque...n\u00e3o \u00e9 motivo de serem considerados terroristas. Pelo meio desta fuga h\u00e1 o romance de Jem e Spider, pol\u00edtica, racismo e o n\u00famero de Spider que vai ser decisivo para a hist\u00f3ria..."}], "description": "Ever since she was child, Jem has kept a secret: Whenever she meets someone new, no matter who, as soon as she looks into their eyes, a number pops into her head.

The two plan a trip to the city. But while waiting to ride the Eye ferris wheel, Jem is terrified to see that all the other tourists in line flash the same number. Today's number. Today's date.
