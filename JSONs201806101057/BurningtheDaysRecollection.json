Salter\u2019s glory is the anecdote, the stray, sketched memory, his way with a line. The city was black and gleaming, wonderfully cold.I think I will come to appreciate Burning the Days as I do Edmund White\u2019s The Farewell Symphony, as a rich deposit of scenes and memories, indifferently structured, a book I will re-read many times but never in sequence. I know I\u2019ll return to the indelible opening, a cold Sunday taxi ride \u201cthrough grim Sabbath neighborhoods\u201d to visit his grandmother:My father and I made these journeys together. My mother never came. Up the West Side of Manhattan along the river, vacant Sunday morning, looking out the window, the endless drab apartment buildings on one side and in the distance, gleaming, the new George Washington Bridge. Cigar smoke, fragrant and sickening, fled past the top of the glass window near my father as he sat musing, sometimes humming softly to himself. Over the driver\u2019s radio came the impassioned words of the fervent anti-Semitic priest who broadcast every Sunday, Father Coughlin. His repeated fierce phrases beat against me. These were lean times.Salter originally published \u201cThe Captain\u2019s Wife\u201d in Esquire in 1986, and at his editor\u2019s insistence it became the germ of Burning the Days. I love the chapter for its account of drowsy, licentious, quasi-colonial postings, the diversions alcohol, gambling, and the seduction of other officers\u2019 wives; a society defined equally by duty and dissolution.In the Pacific the war had ended but its vast, shabby landscape remained. In Manila Bay the water was the color of rust from sunken ships. Unidentified masts and funnels were sticking above the surface. Manila was half destroyed; the tops were blown off the palm trees, the roads were ruined, the air filled with dust\u2026Theft was an industry, deserters coming into barracks before dawn to steal what they could. There were incomplete rosters, slack discipline. Men were threatening to shoot officers who were too conscientious. On Okinawa a corporal was driving a nurse around to the black units in an unmarked ambulance. She lay on a bed in the back, naked from the waist down. She charged twenty dollars."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "This is a memoir; it doesn\u2019t even come close to being an autobiography. Presentation of events is not in chronological order. The readers gets only snippets here and there of the man\u2019s life. He is in no way providing a general outline of his life. He is telling us of people he has met and those moments in his life that mean much to HIM. In my view, he is writing more for himself than for us. The book grew out of an article he wrote for Esquire; he was in fact hesitant about writing it. We are told in passing that he was married and had four kids. At the end, again in passing, we are told he is divorced. Nothing is said of his second wife or his child by her. He does manage to convey in just a few lines the grief he felt at the death of one of his children. The lack of a time line and an unclear usage of pronouns lead to confusion and a disjointed feel. He knew his life, but we don\u2019t. He knew who he was referring to, but we don\u2019t. A number of times I was confused about exactly who the author was speaking of.We are warned right from the beginning that the book will not be complete:\u201cIf you can think of life, for a moment, as a large house with a nursery, living and dining rooms, bedrooms, study, and so forth, all unfamiliar and bright, the chapters which follow are, in a way, like looking through the windows of this house. Certain occupants will be glimpsed only briefly. Visitors come and go. At some windows you may wish to stay longer, but alas. As with any house, all within cannot be seen.\u201dAnd he says this:\u201cA writer cannot really grasp what he has written. It is not like a building or a sculpture; it cannot be seen whole. It is only a kind of smoke seized and printed on a page.\u201dExcept, isn\u2019t a book written for the public, for the readers? Shouldn\u2019t he have made an attempt to explain to us the most significant decisions of his life? He fails to explain clearly why he left flying, twelve years in the U.S. Air Force, the last six years as a fighter pilot. Or what drove him to became then a film script writer and author. Or why he later adopted his pen name, James Salter, as his legal name. He was born as James Arnold Horowitz (1925 \u2013 2015). What is discussed then? His childhood in NYC. His education at West Point, following in the steps of his father. His flying. It is particularly here that Salter\u2019s writing shines, and with brilliance! You do not have to be in the least bit interested in \u201cflying\u201d to grasp how it feels to be up there in the air; this is so astoundingly well conveyed through his words. His unremarkable achievements as a film script writer unfortunately turns into a list of those he met-- famed actors and actresses and producers and directors. There is a lot of name dropping. He speaks of the background to some of his books, the authors he met and who inspired him. I found this more interesting and has resulted in my adding a few more books to be read. Women, pretty women, seductive women, they attract him, and so he writes about them too. He sees a woman and what he sees is her body. It is the body that attracts him; rarely is there talk of a woman\u2019s intellect. That is who he is, or let\u2019s just say this is the extent to which he dares to reveal himself. I do think that by the end of the book I have a sense of who this man was, his personality. I do think I understand how his life at West Point, in the Air Force, as a fighter pilot and rubbing shoulders with famed celebrities did shape him. How could it not? Still, I found it all rather sad; I do not believe he ever felt up to notch, although he does not say this.There is something that sparkles when Salter turns to a subject that he knows well. When he rabbles off details about a famous person I found the writing a bore, but when he ventures into an area where he dares to speak of his inner emotions, be it sex or flying or streets in Paris or that sense of closeness or lonesomeness all humans feel, the writing becomes pristine clear and strong and totally wonderful.The audiobook I listened to is narrated by LJ Ganser. I wasn\u2019t all that enthralled in the beginning; I thought he was reading too rapidly and with too much umpf being given to the important words. By the end I was very pleased. I think a narrator and a listener must get into the flow of a book before one can properly judge the narration. The narration I have given four stars. He does not destroy the French language, and there is quite a bit of French in the book. Salter travelled, and he did see the world, or at least what he chose to see. Personally, I prefer Salter\u2019s fiction over his non-fiction.**************A Sport and a Pastime 4 starsLight Years 4 starsAll That Is 3 starsBurning the Days: Recollection 3 stars"}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "As long as the Jew endeavors to deny his nationality, while at the same time he is unable to deny his own individual existence, as long as he is unwilling to acknowledge that he belongs to that unfortunate and persecuted people, his false position must daily become more intolerable. ... In spite of enlightenment and emancipation, the Jew in exile who denies his nationality will never earn the respect of the nations among whom he dwells. ... Mask yourself a thousand times over, change your name, religion and character, travel throughout the world incognito, so that people may not recognize the Jew in you; yet every insult to the Jewish name will strike you, even more than the pious man who is permeated with the spirit of Jewish solidarity and who fights for the honor of the Jewish name. Moses Hess, Rome and Jerusalem, 1862I read an essay on the work of James Salter three years ago that made me curious. He was born in 1925 (making him five years younger than my parents); following in his father's footsteps, he went to West Point and turned himself into a fighter pilot and officer, and then, after his first book was a hit, he quit all that to write. And he legally changed his name, which was originally Horowitz, to his pen name. The writer of the essay said, too, that nearly every one of his novels contains an antisemitic passage. I was reading that essay before I had read (and reviewed) another book that had answered some of my questions about that era and was still trying to figure something out. (See that other review here.)The present book is James Salter's autobiography. I read it in part because I remembered a review that said it was the only readable thing he wrote. That review I remembered turned out to be an Amazon review, but that I had forgotten, and Goodreads reviews by friends contest that opinion. Nevertheless, this is what I read--perhaps a good thing, considering my quest. I had the MP3 audio CD and the paperback.He only mentions the issue of his Judaism in two passages of his autobiography. He did feel exposed by his name. He must have felt despised, since he did say that, if he was to be despised, he wanted it to be by inferiors. Thus he touches on the pressure on minorities that Ta-Nehisi Coates (Between the World and Me) is rejecting in our present day and age: the pressure to be \"twice as good\" in order to be equal.The first half of the book focuses on his being reshaped and forged into West Point material and a top gun and officer in do-or-die fashion. I shared some of the flying passages with my husband, whose dad was Air Force. The exploits were thrilling and horrendous, and the mentality so different from now--the warrior mentality--not only the exploits but the hunt--the chalking up of kills.Then the author makes his major decision to leave the military and write, and thereafter he focuses on his work and life--to some degree--but often on those he meets: writers, actors, directors, ...women..., and on the places he went. Overall it isn't deep, the writing and reading isn't moving, or, rather, when it is, it doesn't stay that way. He knew a lot of people and he was there in the scene, but it's hard to see beyond the celebrity status of the big names. There are major life events and there are gems and rich veins, but they play out, being too widely separated...and cool to the touch.It used to be that officers and war heroes were part of high society. Later, in the '60s, that had eroded. In fact, the way we think about war changed. The author recounts attending a parade, maybe Memorial Day, as a reservist, I think, during which no one so much as bothered to applaud or salute. At a high cost he had transformed himself to meet society's demands as he perceived them, only to be caught out in the long run as society changed.Perhaps I'll read one of his novels later. Surely they and not this autobiography are his main legacy. Nonetheless, I'll say I found the present book to be well-written but not fully penetrable. Moreover, the second half of the book in which he focuses so much on the famous people he's known to some extent takes the form of a celebrity autobiography.James Salter is known as a \"writer's writer,\" or as the essay I read first says, a writer's writer's writer. In other words his works are well-regarded critically but not widely read. I myself hadn't heard of him before I read that essay I mentioned. Is it possible to write full-out while hiding? I do know it's possible to do a family genealogy in order that a secret remain hidden. But a novel?I ended up with two copies of this book, and one I gave to a friend, around my age, also a Jew, who had a military career himself. I hope eventually to hear his thought on this book.Here's a little news item from September 2016, while I was reading the book. Not that the author recounts pranks like this; after all, he was at war....James Salter died last year (2015)."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron", "userReview": "A colleague got me reading novels again after a long period by recommending \"The Hunters.\" Not long afterward, I was reading \"Solo Faces,\" stunned in both cases by Salter's crystal clear prose and the wrestling with themes of personal integrity. It has taken me a while to get round to his memoir \"Burning the Days,\" which I found myself gulping down in two days and one long night of a holiday weekend. It has been a revelation.Salter's novels are case studies of what I'd call male mythology. The heroes of \"Hunters\" and \"Solo Faces\" seem trapped in hyper gender roles, testing always both a kind of grace under pressure and an ability to endure physical and psychological extremes. \"Burning the Days\" turns out to be a celebration of those values, where to be a man is to embark on a long, lonely journey of proving that one is both like and better than other men.The book is his own story of emerging from a fairly nondescript youth in New York to the life-transforming experience of West Point and a career as a pilot, along with the getting of a kind of worldly wisdom during times spent in Europe, especially Paris. His life as a writer introduces him to literary circles in New York and abroad and an international community of filmmakers and film stars.Through it all, Salter focuses often on the men around him who earn his respect. He marvels at the particular integrity that makes each of them admirable. He elevates each of them into a kind of pantheon, and when all is said and done, he hopes that his own life warrants him a place among them. By contrast, the women who pass through his life are remarked upon for their beauty and intelligence, but beyond that they are walk-ons in this book about men. Readers may be taken by his old-fashioned glamorizing of women, or they may take exception to it.Brilliantly written, the book is compelling for what it sets out to do - provide a remembrance of things past that not only captures moments and people in vivid detail but bathes them in a melancholy glow - like richly detailed sepia photographs."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james", "userReview": "James Salter calls his memoir a \"recollection\" as it is more a collection of scenes and episodes selected from throughout his life than it is a typical memoir. Published in 1997 when he was a youthful seventy-two it includes some fascinating vignettes of youth, middle age and beyond, all told with his signature narrative style that is both precise and beautiful.Several of these episodes were particularly memorable in my reading. He grew up in New York City. But he tells of an unexpected sojourn at West point early in the recollections. As a young boy he had a poetic bent and he had been accepted at Stanford, looking forward to heading west. His father who had graduated from West Point had arranged a second alternate's appointment for him and, improbably, both appointees ahead of him were unable to attend so he received notification that he had been admitted. He comments, \"Seventeen, vain, and spoiled by poems, I prepared to enter a remote West Point. I would succeed there, it was hoped, as he had.\" His four years at West Point were difficult and he is honest about his difficulties, but he gradually found his true self and upon graduation in 1945 he would enter the Army Air Corps which he would call home for a dozen years, becoming a fighter pilot. His experience as a pilot would provide material for his first novel, The Hunters.Salter displays an earnestness and life in his telling is a serious undertaking, a gesture toward glory and immortality through love and a kind of private ethics revealed in the large and small choices that add up to tell a story. He excels as a writer with a devotional purpose, though not religious in a modern sense. Instead, there are ancient, perhaps unspoken, tests to pass. Salter was a cadet at West Point and an Air Force fighter pilot during the Korean War, and in his prose about flying, we see his guiding assumptions: \"It was among the knowledgeable others that one hoped to be talked about and admired. It was not impossible\u2014the world of squadrons is small. The years would bow to you; you would be remembered, your name like a thoroughbred\u2019s, a horse that ran and won.\"Pilots were the elegant gladiators of the twentieth century, their battles were distilled examinations of mettle and will. Some of these pilots, friends of Salter, became astronauts later in their careers. Two of these friends, Virgil Grissom and Edward White were killed on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral in 1967.He jumps ahead to other moments in his life, writing having become his profession following the service career. Salter has written about fighter pilots and mountain climbers but also about poets and novelists, notably in two fine short-story collections, Dusk and Last Night. He was officially credited with eight screenplays according to the Internet Movie Database, only one from his novels (The Hunters) and one other that stands out and is highlighted in his recollections, Downhill Racer, a film from 1969 based on Oakley Hall's novel and starring Robert Redford. Only a few pages are devoted to this episode but it is a fascinating one about a beautiful life, dining with the Redfords, and discussing his idea of writing a film that would be about something which he described simply as \"the justice of sport.\" And he includes a few moments about his most famous novel, A Sport and a Pastime, choosing to comment on the passage from the Qu'ran that provided the title for that book.I would compare this memoir to some of the best I have read, Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory and Gregor von Rezzori's The Snows of Yesteryear come to mind. James Salter's achievements have been compared to those of Flannery O'Connor, Paul Bowles, Tennessee Williams and John Cheever by Michael Dirda, book critic for The Washington Post. This is an opinion that I share as I recommend his work to fellow readers. Salter has written about fighter pilots and mountain climbers but also about poets and novelists, notably in two fine short-story collections, Dusk and Last Night."}, {"userName": "Doria", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037274-doria", "userReview": "Once more, I am reading a book that I picked up initially on the recommendation of my late grandparents' journal entries. And once more, I have found a winner. This is a tremendously well-written book, and I say that not merely because Salter describes my grandfather (Robert Phelps) with such tender affection towards the end of the book that it brought me to tears. Salter's writing is intimate, prescient and reverent; he holds me in thrall with his words, so that the twin chasms of time and physical distance that lie between us vanish. It is as though he wrote this book - his autobiography - just for me. Under his pen, the lives of ordinary people become exalted and beautiful, however he writes honestly and unflinchingly, so that we come to see that his unerring eye is that of truth: the lives of ordinary (even tawdry) people really ARE exalted and beautiful. Puccini had it right, and so does Salter.

Maybe my fault, no one wants to play the blame game, but possibly Salter forgot to put any sense of his own personality in his recollections, his style is so elegant it almost erases the warts and dirt of the author, the fun stuff. These reminiscences end up being more like portraits of people he's known along the way, and a lot ot them seem kinda lush and preppy, writers, artists, pilots, Robert Redford, moments remembered, some of them beautiful, breathtaking, full of summers gone by and youth waaay gone, i really liked the Paris stuff. Salter can be a smidge the misogynator, none of the great writers he writes about are women, though he does remember their wives. And not much of this really stuck. Gosh though, what Salter can do with a sentence.."}, {"userName": "Mark Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469580-mark-watkins", "userReview": "I recently reviewed the books I read last year. Some great stuff, but also too much \u201cbookish junk food\u201d. I\u2019m committed to reading better this year.Some time ago I was wandering through a used bookstore in Manchester by the Sea and stumbled across Burning the Days, the memoir of the writer James Salter. The well known book reviewer Michael Dirda of the Washington Post famously wrote \u201che can, when he wants, break your heart with a sentence.\u201d. I opened the book to a random page, and found:I cannot think of it without sadness. I think of the day-long, intimate hours in her apartment with the same record playing over and over, phrases from it like some sort of oath I will know til the day I die.OK it\u2019s two sentences. Salter is an amazing writer, and behind that lies a fascinating, complex, insightful man. Burning the Days tells the story of his life, from the early days of learning about sex through to his early 70\u2019s. The transience of all things is lurking on every page, but the book rings out with its joys as well.In youth it feels one\u2019s concerns are everyone\u2019s. Later on it is the clear that they are not. Finally they again become the same. We are all poor in the end. The lines have been spoken. The stage is empty and bare. Before that, however is the performance. The curtain rises.His description of becoming aware of sex is priceless. After a friend tells him stories, this:Months later one noon, looking through the magazines in a cigar store, I came across a pamphlet with blue covers. Some had placed it there, concealed behind a magazine; it was not part of the stock. The provocative title I have forgotten, but as I began to read I underwent a conversion. \u2026fairly trembling with discovery, like someone who has found a secret letter, I hid the precious thing. I was going to try certain things, and all that I had read, in time, I found to be true. Years afterwards, at a luncheon, I sat next to a green-eyed young woman, a poet, who declared loftily that you learned nothing from books, it was life you learned from, passion, experience. The host, a fine old man in seventies, heard her and disagreed. His hair was white. His voice that the faint shrillness of age. \u201cNo, everything I\u2019ve ever learned,\u201d, he said, \u201chas come from books. I\u2019d be in the darkness without them.\u201d I didn\u2019t know if he was speaking of Balzac or Strindberg\u2026. but in no particular order I tried to think of books that had instructed me, and among them, not insignificant, was the anonymous twenty page booklet in blue covers that described the real game of the grownup world.At The Hawaii Project, we often say Books Change Lives. And they do.His time at West Point was equally formative.The most urgent thing was to somehow fit in, to become unnoticed, the same. My father had managed to do it, although, seeing what it was like, I did not understand how. During his studies at West Point, a number of books figure prominently. But one book changed his life.There was one with the title Der Kompaniechef, the company commander. This youthful but experienced figure was nothing less than a living example to each of his men. Alone, half obscured by those he commanded, similar to them but without their faults, self-disciplined, modest, cheerful, he was at the same time both master and servant, each of admirable character. His real authority was not based on shoulder straps or rank but on a model life which granted the right to demand anything from others. An officer, wrote Dumas, is like a father with greater responsibilities than an ordinary father. The food his men ate, he ate, and only when the last of them slept, exhausted, did he go to sleep himself. His privilege lay in being given these obligations and a harder duty than any of the rest. The company commander was someone whom difficulties could not dishearten, privation could not crush. It was not his strength that was unbreakable but something deeper, his spirit. He must not only have his men obey, they must do it when they are absolutely worn out and quarreling among themselves, when they are at the end of their rope and another senseless order comes down from above. He could be severe but only when it was needed and then briefly. It had to be just, it had to wash things clean like a sudden, fierce storm... I knew this hypothetical figure. I had seen him as a schoolboy, latent among the sixth formers, and at times had caught a glimpse of him at West Point. Stroke by stroke, the description of him was like a portrait emerging. I was almost afraid to recognize the face. In it was no self-importance; that had been thrown away, we are beyond that, stripped of it. When I read that among the desired traits of the leader was a sense of humor that marked a balanced and indomitable outlook, when I realized that every quality was one in which I instinctively had faith, I felt an overwhelming happiness, like seeing a card you cannot believe you are lucky enough to have drawn, at this moment, in this game. I did not dare to believe it but I imagined, I thought, I somehow dreamed, the face was my own. I began to change, not what I truly was, but what I seemed to be. Dissatisfied, eager to become better, I shed as if they were old clothes the laziness and rebellion of the first year and began anew. To the anonymous poet mentioned above: yes, Books Change Lives. If they are good enough, and if we let them. On my reading, I was struck by how much this fictional company commander resembles the Leonidas of Gates of Fire, by Steven Pressfield, of which I\u2019ve written elsewhere.The first phase of Salter\u2019s life is military, eventually becoming a pilot, and Burning the Days chronicles that life in ways that are by turns comical, heartwarming, and searing. This phase of his life leads to his first novel The Hunters, and flying the Korean War, and his true tales from that time open a window into the military experience few books can match.The success of The Hunters eventually drives him to leave the Army and write full time. He discovers Paris. This leads him to write A Sport and A Pastime, an erotic chronicle of Paris, with an unreliable narrator. He goes into movies, writing screenplays for a number of films, most of them unsuccessful (I\u2019ve recently become aware of how many writers of that era put food on the table by writing screenplays\u200a\u2014\u200aSteven Pressfield is another). His stories of the movies, the stars, and set locations are thought provoking as well as interesting.And always, there are the books. The books he\u2019s writing, the books he\u2019s reading\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve picked up 3 or 4 books other than his own, that meant something to him.What a fascinating man and life. A fighter pilot, a man\u2019s man, a serial womanizer it seems, and yet deeply introspective and caring. An aesthete, intimately aware of the transient nature of all things. Burning the Days is simultaneously elegiac and joyful, and will give you insightful perspective on life."}, {"userName": "Ritinha", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7700111-ritinha", "userReview": "In spite of Salter\u2019s superb mastering of the sentence, one can only read so much about military life and flying sequences.The second half is quite more what I wanted and truly expected from this memoir.But what truly swept me off my feet were the parts in which Salter dealt with the great, unique and overwhelming accomplishments of others, ex-army colleagues that at one point shared the same status and then were set off to the race for space.Salter approaches this inner and deeply human feeling of failure and deep convulsion that might resemble envy with deep and admirable honesty.

This collection of memories -- which Salter declines to call an autobiography or a memoir -- has the same incandenscent prose, sensuousness, attention to place, and meditative character as do the novels. The book might be better read as a novel than as a work of nonfiction.Roughly the first half of \"Burning the Days\" covers Salter's early life and his military career. Salter (b. 1925) spent his youth in New York City. He attended a private school in New York City where one of his companions, for a brief time, was Jack Kerouac. Salter describes how he envied Kerouac for publishing his first novel \"The Town and the City\", which Salter praises, before he himself was able to publish a book.Salter's father had graduated first in his class at West Point, but he became an entreprenurial and ultimately unsucessful businsessman. At his father's urging Salter entered West Point at the age of 17, when the two applicants ahead of him proved unable to attend. Undisciplined, unmotivated, and hating the rigors of West Point at first, Salter ultimately came to love the rigors and dangers of the military life. He was accepted to flight school and after some misadventures became an accomplished fighter pilot. The most memorable part of \"Burning the Days\" describes Salter's love of the Air Force, of flying, and of his comrades. Salter himself became a combat ace flying hazardous missions in Korea.In 1957, Salter resigned his military commission to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. The second part of \"Burning the Days\" tells a story of dissolution marked by determination to succeed. Most of this part of the book takes place in Europe as Salter offers portraits of other writers, particularly Irwin Shaw, actors, such as Robert Redford and Vanessa Redgrave, and directors, famous, such as Roman Polanski, and little-known. While he ultimately achieved recognition as a novelist, most of the book describes Salter's efforts to succeed as a screenwriter and director for Hollywood. The book is told in a poetical, melancholy style, as Salter recollects his many sexual experiences, while his wife generally remained home in the states, and those of his companions. The book includes many short portraits and telling stories of people, descriptions of France and Rome, and of the dinners, bars, nightlife, and decadence that Salter captures in his novels. For all its glamor and sex, Salter expresses dissatisfaction with this period of his life. It lacked the purpose and selflessness of his years in the Air Force. Salter expresses his sense of shame at what he thought he had become at many places, especially when in 1967, two of his former flight comrades, astronauts Gus Grissom and Edward White, died on the launchpad in 1967 at a fiery accident at Cape Canaveral. Yet during these years, Salter wrote a small amount of ecstatic prose. At the end of the book, Salter, the teller of the tale, has mellowed and aged. He expresses the \"great desire to live on.\"The story is told in the lyrical, highly-charged style of Salter's novels. Events and people move in and out of the story with an intense and dizzying rapidity. The recollection does not follow a strict chronology as Salter moves back and forth in his life as an event at one time brings to mind an event at an earlier or later time in the author's life. While the book is full of death, frailty, and wasted life, Salter tells the reader that \"the gods\" interest him more than human weakness. (Preface). In addition, change in one's self, and indeed, the lack of self, forms an important theme to this book. Thus Salter, begins life with a Jewish identity he does not wish to pursue. (p. 54) He enters West Point with no clear idea of purpose. Only when he enters West Point and understands that its training is designed to susbsume all concepts of individuality to something greater -- the good of the service and the nation -- does Salter find meaning and happiness. He loses this sense of meaning in the rootlessness of his life after he leaves the Air Force only to recover it again in writing and reflection.\"Burning the Days\" is a beautifully written and almost too rich account of the life of a great American novelist. Readers who have enjoyed Salter's novels and stories will recognize the books in the author's recollections.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby", "userReview": "\u201cI wake in the darkness and lie there.

It seems to be an inclination. I do not worship gods but I like to know they are there. Frailty, human though it may be, interests me less. So I have written only about certain things, the essential, in my view. The rest is banal.4 It is difficult to realize that you are observed from a number of points and the sum of them has validity.25 (prep school) Horace Mann, was in Riverdale...the overriding ethic was that we were responsible for our own destiny and for fulfilling our obligations to society. p. 27 Cocteau\u2019s dictum, whatever you are criticized for, intensify it. p. 195 Years later I heard him [Irwin Shaw] give some advice: never be in awe of anyone. He was not in awe of Europe. He tossed his coat on her couch.p. 203 In the end the self is left unfinished, it is abandoned because of the death of its owner. All the exceptional details, confessions, secrets, photographs of loved faces and sometimes more than faces, precious addresses, towns and hotels meant to be visited given the time, stories, sacred images, immortal lines, everything heaped up or gathered because it is intriguing or beautiful suddenly becomes superfluous, without value, the litter of decades swirls at one\u2019s feet.p. 207 He never mentioned women, but it was impossible that so grand, so errant a nature should not be drawn to them, and there was also the theme of that first, central story, \u201cSummer Dresses.\u201d The great engines of this world do not run on faithfulness. \u201cMany?\u201d I often wanted to ask him. I doubt he would have been revealing.p. 210 [His friend Irwin Shaw approaches him at a party after Salter made Shaw\u2019s story into a crappy movie]\u201cThat was a lousy movie you made.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to argue. It would not be long before he lay beneath the surgeon\u2019s unbrilliant knife.p. 292 It is beyond conquering. You may taste it, even reign for an hour, but that is all. You may not own the beach or the girls on it, the haze of summer afternoons, or the crashing, green sea, and the next wave of aspirants is outside the door, their murmuring, their hunger. The next tide of beautiful, uninformed faces, of perfect limbs and an overwhelming desire to be known.p. 293 I recognized him immediately: the suicidal face, fine black hair, curved nose, thin lips, a face as perfect as an animal\u2019s, as sleek. ... He was almost always alone. It was because of the dream that one night he would meet the woman of his life there, and he didn\u2019t want to be with anyone else at the time. It was a misconceived idea; you are always with someone else....He didn\u2019t speak to her mother except through the children (\u201cTell your mother she\u2019s a murderous bitch\u201d)...p. 294 ... his excesses were deeply ingrained and his talents inseparable from his flaws. Heroin was among his pleasures.p. 311 ...which was high on the list of places he did not disapprove of...p. 312 It was to his house one would hurry in case of grave danger. He would know without hesitation what to do (John Masters).p. 316 The seasons passed in majesty: summer\u2019s inescapable heat, the storms of winter, the leaves of autumn which in a single night fell from the elms along the road. A few days later I drove through. In the great arcade a wave of yellow leaves was rising, driven into the air again by wind, as far as one could see. It was, unknown to me, a foretelling of what was to come, the time still far off when the beautiful debris would rise again and I would write about those days.p. 319 He had a keen appetite for gossip, without which most conversation is flavorless, and a great personal modesty.p. 345 (Nedra) Hers was a singular life. It had no achievements other than itself. It declared, in its own way, that there are things that matter and these are the things one must do. Life is energy, it proclaimed, life is desire. You are not meant to understand everything but to live and do certain things.p. 346 take the time to write down twenty lines a day.p. 347 There are certain houses near the river in secluded towns, their wooden fences weathered brown. Near the door in sunlight, stiff-legged, a white cat pulls itself up in an arc. Clothes on a half-hidden line drift in the light. It is here I imagine the wives, their children long grown, at peace with life and now drawn close to the essence of it, the soft rain flattening the water, trees thick with foliage bending to the wind, flowers beneath the kitchen window, quiet days. Men are important no longer, nor can they know such tranquillity, here in perfect exile, if it can be had that way, amid nature, in the world that was bequeathed to us.p. 349 I wake in the darkness and lie there. The aftertaste is not bitter. I know, just as in dreams, I will die, like every living thing, many of them more noble and important, trees, lakes, great fish that have lived for a hundred years. We live in the consciousness of a single self, but in nature there seems to be something else, the consciousness of many, of all, the herds and schools, the colonies and hives with myriads lacking in what we call ego but otherwise perfect, responsive only to instinct.

In reality I tried to forget her and what had happened....Who consoles us (Qui nous console)\u2014either weather or time (le temps). In the country there was both.p. 352 (the end) We drove to dinner at Billy\u2019s. Very few customers. Then back to the house before midnight, where we made a fire, drank toasts, and read aloud from favorite books. I read the last speech in Noel Coward\u2019s Cavalcade, the one in which the wife toasts her husband. They have lost both their sons in the war (1914-1918) and she drinks to them, to what they might have been, and to England. Kay read from Ebenezer Le Page. Karyl, the last part of Joyce\u2019s The Dead, where the snow is falling on all Ireland, also from Anna Karenina, Humboldt\u2019s Gift, and the Wapshot chronicle. Dana read Robert Service, Stephen King, and Poe, something long and incomprehensible. Perhaps it was the drinks. \u201cAs the French say, comment?\u201d Kay remarked.\tThe fire had burned to embers, the company was gone. We walked in the icy darkness with the old, limping dog.

He went to West Point, mainly because his father had before him, became a fighter pilot and flew missions in many places, including the US, France, North Africa and in Korea during the Korean War. Later he worked in the film industry and wrote stories and novels.His descriptions of learning to fly and his experiences as a fighter pilot are outstanding. He remembers many fellow flyers, their characters and idiosyncrasies. Some survived, others did not. His work in film was less successful, in part because much of it is a process outwith the control of the writer. For example, he has a script which might make it into production provided one of three actresses agrees to star. None of them does, so that\u2019s where it ends. After he has dealt with his life at West Point and as a pilot, a main subject of interest is writers and agents he knew. We meet many of them first hand \u2013 Irwin Shaw, for example \u2013 and others by way of anecdote. Unlike the part of the book concerning flying, some of this ground has been covered by others, but it is interesting nonetheless. And with respect to Irwin Shaw, the account of his name-change given in this book differs radically from the article on Shaw in Wikipedia. (I would go with Salter.)Sometimes referred to as girls, women feature lot in this book. Salter was into women in a big way. But it is striking that one main area of a biography, the writer\u2019s family, is dealt with in the most cursory manner. He refers to his wife, briefly, on page 130 of the Picador edition: \u2018Ann Altemus, good-looking, unspoiled, she was from the horse country in Virginia.\u2019I suspect that the character Vivian in his novel \u2018All That Is\u2019, was based on Ann Altemus, but with a little reversal. Vivian is also into horses and belongs to the Virginia society set. She agrees to get married in a strangely passive way, as if she had nothing better to do at the time. In real life, Salter married Ann Altemus in an equally passive way, the match having been made for him by another woman, Paula, a woman he tells us he loved. Salter quotes someone as saying that the trouble with marriage is it lasts too long. However that may be, the couple divorced. I read elsewhere (not in this book) that they were married for twenty-four years, had four children, and that he later married again.Why does he give us so little of his family life? There may be a clue on page 323, where he says: \u2018To write of someone thoroughly is to destroy them, use them up.\u2019 But if that is the explanation, then he uses up Irwin Shaw, Robert Phelps and one or two others besides. So the more likely explanations are that he doesn\u2019t want to explore this subject, or that he does but feels unequal to the task.Salter seems to believe that some sort of immortality may be obtained through writing. \u2018Life passes into pages if it passes into anything.\u2019 (Page 216) Even if true, that will be no consolation when you\u2019re not there to see it.This book is written unusually well, though occasionally it is dense and so allusive as to be cryptic. There were sections I read several times and, even then, wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d really got the point. A very good book, but not to be read quickly."}, {"userName": "Jason Bergman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708605-jason-bergman", "userReview": "A wonderful, unconventional sort of autobiography. It's subtitled, \"a recollection\" and that's an accurate description. Salter leaps around in time, telling the complete stories of people he meets. Partially due to his colorful life, and partially due to its length, this typically means we find out how everyone dies. Which is a little sad, but you get used to it.Burning the Days is effectively divided into four parts: his early life in New York, his days as a fighter pilot, his time as a screenwriter, and finally his life as a novelist. Some of these I felt like I'd read before. His novels The Hunters and Cassada are so autobiographical that out of context I would have had a hard time telling which book certain passages were from. Similarly, the last portion shows how his life clearly influenced Light Years, All That Is and Dusk and Other Stories. I point this out, but I don't consider this a negative. I adore Salter's writing, and reading where life and art intertwined was one of the joys of this book.Salter is a treasure. He has little regard for most of his work, constantly comparing himself to other writers. I respectfully disagree.

Towards the end, it's mostly just character portraits: famous movie and literary figures, many of them unknown to me. Probably what I'll remember are his spare, lyrical descriptions of flying and the Korean War. Also a certain glamour and melancholy, an era that is no more.

I find that I don't have to concentrate so much with memoirs or biographies, but just pay attention to the juicy parts--and Salter could have supplied more juicy parts given the number of affairs he hinted at.The thing that fascinates me about Salter is that he was in the military, even if it was sort of an accident. He's such a sensitive, elegant guy that I can't imagine him being the slightist bit brutish or macho.

Pick up any of his books, open at random, and begin reading, irregardless of plot, character development, or subject matter. You'll be rewarded. He's like Proust in that respect. Reading Salter's short declarative sentences is a little like building a wall brick by brick, each adding its own mortar of emotion until finally something powerful is realized. The steady beat of his elegant sentences holds you in thrall to his quiet confidence as a writer. He's always a pleasure to read, always a pleasure to revisit."}], "description": "In this brilliant book of recollection, one of America's finest writers re-creates people, places, and events spanning some fifty years, bringing to life an entire era through one man's sensibility. Scenes of love and desire, friendship, ambition, life in foreign cities and New York, are unforgettably rendered here in the unique style for which James Salter is widely admired.Burning the Days captures a singular life, beginning with a Manhattan boyhood and then, satisfying his father's wishes, graduation from West Point, followed by service in the Air Force as a pilot. In some of the most evocative pages ever written about flying, Salter describes the exhilaration and terror of combat as a fighter pilot in the Korean War, scenes that are balanced by haunting pages of love and a young man's passion for women.After resigning from the Air Force, Salter begins a second life, becoming a writer in the New York of the 1960s. Soon films beckon. There are vivid portraits of actors, directors, and producers--Polanski, Robert Redford, and others. Here also, more important, are writers who were influential, some by their character, like Irwin Shaw, others because of their taste and knowledge.Ultimately Burning the Days is an illumination of what it is to be a man, and what it means to become a writer.Only once in a long while--Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory or Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa--does a memoir of such extraordinary clarity and power appear. Unconventional in form, Burning the Days is a stunning achievement by the writer The Washington Post Book World said \"inhabits the same rarefied heights as Flannery O'Connor, Paul Bowles, Tennessee Williams and John Cheever\" --a rare and unforgettable book.", "title": "Burning the Days: Recollection", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174628.Burning_the_Days_Recollection", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320499886l/174628.jpg", "reviews": 77, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11298.James_Salter", "name": "James Salter"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Biography Memoir", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174628.Burning_the_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25704591-burning-the-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2139434.Burning_the_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26250138-burning-the-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2737231-burning-the-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12535073-quemar-los-d-as", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18943289-burning-the-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20754594-burning-the-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114511.A_Sport_and_a_Pastime", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330444-all-that-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174622.Light_Years", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18757.Last_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174621.The_Hunters"]}
