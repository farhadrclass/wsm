Update: I'm past the halfway point and the book is now a martini topped with marshmallows poured over a steaming pile of dog excrement. Update the second: I retract my earlier statement, as it is demeaning to the martini. Martinis are fabulous and should never be associated with dreck like this. It is, however, like marshmallow-dotted dog poopie, as it is cloyingly sweet, fluffy, and a real stinkeroo.Update the third: WARNING. I am not going to mark this review as spoilerific, because I'm assuming that after the above comments no one wants to read the book anyway. And if you do still plan to read this, well then, you're an idiot and deserve to be spoiled.Adriana, Leigh, and Emmy are best friends in New York who are about to turn thirty. Adriana is the wealthy daughter of a former supermodel (even though the term \"supermodel\" wasn't really coined until the nineties), has no job, lives in her parents' NY penthouse apartment, and sleeps with any man who looks at her. Not because she's insecure, mind you. She's just that beautiful. Leigh is a book editor with the perfect apartment and sportscaster boyfriend but she's suffering from panic attacks and some kind of strange OCD-like symptoms. Emmy is a serial monogamist who has just broken up with her boyfriend of 5 years.The girls decide to shake things up. Adriana pledges to settle down within a year, Emmy wants to whore it up all across the globe, and Leigh wants to do something (she just doesn't know what).The novel alternates between characters. Adriana whines about no one taking her seriously, Leigh whines about her job and her boyfriend, and Emmy whines both about wanting to have random sex and not thinking she can go through with having random sex.The biggest problem I have with this book, beyond the basic boring insipdness of the plot, is that Weisberger doesn't seem to know her characters. They are not only underdeveloped but they constantly contradict themselves. Adriana is oh-so-cool that men want her and women want to be her, yet she very uncooly gushes over Salma Hayek, \"Brangelina,\" and, inexplicably for someone who doesn't want children, Angelina's son Maddox.Leigh isn't in love with her boyfriend (who later becomes her fiance) but Weisberger makes a point of telling us that while she doesn't want to have sex with him, she isn't repulsed by his touch, either. The significance of this revelation is never explained. When she later and very predictably has sex with one of the married authors she's editing, she feels exhilarated in one sentence and in the next, with no explanation for the mood change, is angry/shamed/insecure. She is so upset that the author is married, yet when it is revealed that he only married his wife so she could get her green card, she no longer cares that he has no plans to get a divorce.Emmy insists all over the place that she's ready to give up her monogamous ways and slut it up with at least one man from each continent (she travels for work) but this isn't really what she wants to do, nor is she very good at it. Later, one of the girls comments that Emmy has slept with every strange man she'd met over the past year, when in reality she only slept with three. She's also so unaware of herself that she can't figure out why she scares off a would-be one night stand by asking him if he wants children.It would have been much more interesting if Weisberger had given a reason for these inconsistencies, such as the characters having an internal struggle over doing what they want to do and doing what everyone expects of them. I suspect this was Weisberger's intention but she never really made it clear which version was the facade and which was the real girl, especially in Adriana's case.It also wasn't very believable that these girls were best friends. When Leigh calls Emmy to tell her of her engagement, she tells Emmy flat out that she doesn't think she's in love with her fiance but all Emmy wants to talk about is the proposal and the ring. A real best friend would have jumped all over it and told her friend that she shouldn't marry a man she doesn't love. It also isn't believable that Emmy and Adriana wouldn't confide their problems to each other.There are also huge holes in the action. The three girls go on vacation to Aruba, ostensibly to give Emmy the opportunity to sleep with someone, but the narrative ends just as she meets someone and jumps ahead several days, and the result of their Aruba trip is only mentioned in passing several pages later. The lengthy description of their flight to the island is utterly pointless.The ending is so contrived and predictable that one can only assume Weisberger was up against the deadline, couldn't figure out how to end it, and just wrapped everything up without any creativity whatsoever.I'm pretty pissed off that I paid for this book, and that I've contributed to its sales as it will surely be a best seller. I can only hope that people will begin to see that The Devil Wears Prada was an anomaly, and that Weisberger can't write interesting fiction."}, {"userName": "Opal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796131-opal", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVED \"The Devil Wears Prada\" and \"Everyone Worth Knowing.\" I live in NYC and love reading about places I've been to, or places I've heard of. I understand what it's like to work in NYC. I could not wait for this book to come out, and even splurged and bought it before it was out in paperback. I am on page 115 and I'm completely regretting it. The most annoying parts are the following:-Otis, Emmy's ex-boyfriend's African Grey parrot or bird that he left behind. I cringe every time I read about him. Hearing him constantly yelling out demands and criticisms is beyond boring, and I could care less what it eats. Who let's their boyfriend brutally dump them, and then say, \"Sure, I'll take care of your pet that I hate.\" What kind of person leaves their pet behind? If she loved it, I'd understand, but she hates it so why doesn't she sell it or give it to a pet store so that someone can love it, give it attention and not constantly be covering it with a towel? There have been two long passages about Otis already in this book, and the worst part was when Emmy decides to travel and dumps the bird on her friend Adriana. The fact that the bird can shout out that Adriana is a \"Fat Girl\" and her actually contemplate losing weight makes me furious.-Adriana's use of the word querida in EVERY sentence. You can open the book to any page and find it. Since she is Brazilian, I assume that this is Portuguese for something. Upon translating it, I found that it means \"wanted\" rather than what I thought, which was \"Sweetie\" or \"honey.\" Can someone please enlighten me? Do Brazilians use the word querida to mean something else? Otherwise, her saying, \"Yes, [wanted], I'd marry you in a second,\" just doesn't make sense. All I'm saying is that I don't know why she says it, why it's the only Portuguese word she ever says, and why she says it in EVERY sentence. I'd kill my friend if she did this.This doesn't even start with the fact that I can't identify with any of the girls or why they are friends. Adriana, the only thing the novel has her ever thinking about is how beautiful she is, how people look at her, how everyone loves her, how 8 men wanted her, etc. It is sick. Leigh knows she's not in love and gets engaged anyway. This may be understandable at 22, but she's 29, get ahold of your emotions. And Emmy, allowed herself to be with a man for 5 years who wore her thongs and cheated on her so many times he gave her STD's - come on. It is just something disgusting I don't want to read about - again, she's 29 and I'd hope she'd be thinking of a future and realizing that this was NOT the man. I try never to give up on books, but we'll see how much farther I can get it."}, {"userName": "Jaye", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/276713-jaye", "userReview": "Absoulutely one of the worst books I've ever read.

I'd seen the movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\", and to be honest, that was pretty rubbish storyline-wise, but I thought hey, I'll give her a chance. So I saw this book, thought it might be a laugh. Gave it a go.One of the first things I noticed was that every time I picked it up, I wanted to put it back down again about a minute later. It was that unreadable, clearly. But I did get through it. Although I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.It had the potential to be quite a good book. You read the blurb, and think ok, this could be good. If a really good author had written it, it could be really good. But nope, it was written by this one. Then again, I bet the blurb for the Devil Wears Prada looked good as well.Adriana was quite honestly the most annoying person I've ever met. I was begging she would get pregnant or get an STD and maybe, just maybe, think \"oh, maybe being a slut ISN'T the best way to spend your life as a 30+ year old\". I thought that might've been what the author was going for, this woman you're meant to laugh at. But things continue to play out for her, and she soon becomes a columnist. Oh come on, a columnist! It's like the bloody Wag diaries all over again. And then a movie comes. Come on!I wanted to slap Emmy for being such a pushover. Seriously, she was absolutely pathetic. And Leigh... Leigh could have been a likeable character. Kind of someone you could relate to. But then she gets proposed to and doesn't have enough backbone to say \"err, no, actually, I'm not ready\". And has an embarrassing sex scene with some bloke she hates. And then you just want to slap her as well.Not only that, but the entire book promotes the idea that being a slut is the only way forward. It really isn't. It made Adriana look pathetic. Yes, querida, it did. I bet she'd be having sex with that bloody parrot given half a chance.It also has such pointless moments. Like when they randomly went on holiday very briefly. Smack bang in the middle of their working lives, for some reason, they just go on holiday, and you learn about the plane trip. And that's it, really. It just ends and suddenly, everything's back to normal. I'm sorry, but what? Why would this still be in here?The ending was appalling. It collapsed completely. Perhaps her editor saw it and thought \"you better end this quickly... hurry up!\"Speaking of editors, it's dead ironic that one of the characters was one, and was complaining about a book that was poorly written. But the funny thing was that she didn't have the guts to really tell him it was bad, because he was such an acclaimed author. This, to me, sounds like exactly what must have happened when this book was being published. Weisberger's editor didn't have the guts to tell her \"umm, your book stinks\" because she was so well known and loved after The Devil Wears Prada. So the gutless editor just let it get published, and the book went down.I guess my experience with Laura Weisberger hasn't had a good start. But if I see another book with a shoe on the front sitting on the bookshelf, I'm steering clear of that.I guess my review turned into a bit of a rant.

This is the kind of crap that makes me want to burn books and then back over their ashes with my car.

I quite enjoyed \"The Devil Wears Prada\" and wondered what the author was writing now. I wish I hadn't.Now I suspected as much, but I still had to double check to find out that Harry Winston was an American jeweler, and the Harry Winston empire is known for diamonds. Uh Oh. Quick plot synopsis (some minor spoilers): three women, each around 29. They are friends. Leigh is an overachieving and not overly successful editor at a publishing house who is dissatisfied with her romantic relationship, so she screws the author of the book she's editing. Adrianna is Brazilian American. She doesn't work, lives in her parents' apartment in Manhattan and literally screams and throws tantrums when they want to stay in their own apartment when they come to visit. Emmy has recently been broken up with after a 5 year relationship. The guy, Duncan, leaves her to be with a 22-year old virgin cheerleader (??) and Emmy is surprised and upset even though they guy cheated on her throughout their relationship. Her solution? To take a job traveling and have sex with as many men as she can.Now, I appreciate all kinds of literature, and this includes what we call 'chick lit'. I loved Bridget Jones, The Shopaholic series, and many more. I even like teen chick lit, like Gossip Girl and the Au Pairs. It's all good, silly fun, and can even be clever in some cases.Unfortunately, this is not the case in terms of \"Chasing Harry Winston\". Technically, the book didn't work. It jumped all over the place and ended abruptly. It seemed as though Weisberger was trying to write like Candace Bushnell, with less than desirable results. Even though it was a short read, I found myself finding it hard to get through it; The three main characters are superficial in terms of character development and still unlikeable. They are always talking about how 'old' they are and bitching about not having a 'rock' on their finger. Leigh has a boyfriend who seems like one of the only decent characters in the story, yet she cringes at the thought of being with him any longer. He proposes to her, and instead of telling him she doesn't want to marry him, she acts like a bitch for months, and then cheats on him. Lovely. Adrianna doesn't contribute to the story. We just hear about how hot she is and how she could get any man even though she is 'almost thirty'. The author has stereotyped her ethnicity to the point of ridiculousness. It drove me nuts. She said \"querida\" in almost every sentence she uttered. You know, because that's the way all Brazilians have to speak. I found the book more than a little insulting as a woman. It's unsettling that Weisberger has fed the false notion that a woman is virtually useless once she turns thirty if she hasn't landed a man and a rock. Emmy's character is absolutely obsessed with getting married and having a baby. In one cringe-worthy scene, a waiter asks if she would like anything else, and Emmy replies, \"A husband? A baby? Some sort of life? Any of THOSE on the menu?\" How embarrassing. What decade are we in here? A woman's sexual liberation is great as well, but when Emmy decides to sleep with people to get over her boyfriend, all she does is refer to herself as a slut, calling her new way of being the 'Tour de Whore\" (ew). Thank you, Ms. Weisberger, for giving us another nice big step back. If a man had written this book, people would have been outraged!I guess I don't have to say that I don't recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Liisa", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1084654-liisa", "userReview": "By page nine, I had already laughed out loud and at page 38, I already LOVED \"Chasing Harry Winston\" by Lauren Weisberger.It's the story of three best friends: Emmy, Adriana and Leigh and a year in which they plan to change their lives.

[This being particularly true regarding Leigh, a rather crass character who I could never quite relate to and was constantly bothered by..] And yes, if you let the book, as well as the absurdity of the bird one girl inherited from an ex and felt bad getting rid of (any rational, real-life person would sell the damn thing), get you down - well, you probably wouldn't open yourself up to any type of good conclusion.Yet, I found myself re-thinking this book a couple days after I read it, and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. There's somethign about Weisberger's characters in which I can find a little something I relate to in each one of them, and it's always nice to know you're not alone - even if the one you're relating to isn't really real.

Hell, let's me be honest, these women's lives don't even really fit at all into what the average Manhattan woman's life looks like. Also I beg the question: If The Devil Wears Prada was autobiographical as we've been led to believe how can she paint herself as this intelligent, thoughtful young writer fresh out of an Ivy League school who should be working for somewhere serious like The Washington Post or New York Times when in realty what Lauren Weisberger resorted to writing in the end are cheap paperbacks with different colored pumps on every cover and titles like Chasing Harry Winston and The Devil Wears Prada?Me thinks someone painted themselves a little to well and their boss a little to ungraciously."}, {"userName": "stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86145-stephanie", "userReview": "it was okay. i don't know if it's necessarily weisberger's fault - it's that after  The Devil Wears Prada, i expected so much from her. and she hasn't delivered that blend of sarcasm, satire and naivety that made me like the first book so much. this is the story of three girls who make a decision to basically change their lives in one year - the chronic commitment-phobe will be engaged, the serial monogamist will go on a \"fuck tour\", and the one in the perfect relationship will do . . . something. sound like sex and the city minus miranda? yeah. it's a little too perfect, a few too many cliches, and way too many moments where adi exclaims \"quierda\". i wanted to like it, i really, really did. but i read it quickly and it was both because i wanted to get it over with, and because i just didn't care about the characters. they were so one-dimensional and stereotypical, it would have made me grit my teeth and pull out my hair if i cared that much. as it was, i brought it back to the library the day after i got it. so glad i didn't crack and buy this one before it came to me."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197349-heather", "userReview": "I read (and watched) \"The Devil Wears Prada\" several years ago and I liked it so when I came across this one, I decided to read it too.I didn't expect this to be a literary gem by any means, and in that respect it did not disappoint. I would definitely classify this as a mindless, quick \"beach\" read. Around page 66 I started to feel like I was losing brain cells yet at the same time, I couldn't seem to put it down either. Part of that was because I didn't want to start a book in 2012 and have it count towards my 2013 goals so I was trying to end the year with a clean slate. And part of it was because there were some ways in which I could actually relate to two of the three main characters.\"Chasing Harry Winston\" is about three best friends living in NYC who are about to turn 30. Emmy has always dreamed of the perfect wedding, the perfect husband, the perfect children, the perfect life. Adriana, a trust fund baby and the daughter of a former Brazilian model, has never needed anything other than her looks to get through life. And Leigh has it all: the awesome apartment she saved up to buy herself, promising career with a prestigious publishing firm where she's on pace to become one of the youngest senior editors, and a boyfriend who worships her-who just happens to be the city's most popular sportscaster.The book starts with Emmy's boyfriend of 5 years leaving her for his 23-year-old personal trainer-whose services she paid for. Newly single, she decides to take the promotion her boss has been offering her which will allow her to travel around the world to scope out new menu ideas and locations so he can expand his restaurant business. During a conversation with Leigh and Adriana over drinks, it is decided that since she's only been with 3 men in her life, she needs to use her travels as the opportunity to stop seeing every man as husband material and just have a series of \"affairs\": one from each continent, except she gets a pass for Antarctica. This becomes a bet with Adriana, who vows to stop sleeping around and find a husband. They have a year to complete this challenge. Leigh wants to participate but her life is perfect so there's nothing she can think of to change in herself.Leigh's story was the one I was most fascinated with. I was curious to see if she would realize that her \"perfect\" life was really not so great after all-mainly, her relationship with Russell, whom she was dating because everyone else thought was wonderful and whom she did love but was clearly not in love with. She was also the one I could actually relate to-mostly because she's pretty neurotic about some things and because she worked hard to get where she was in life. Adriana made me glad I'm not a bored socialite but she was the one who seemed to grow up the most in the year of their challenge. I found Emmy's struggles of trying to be happy for those around her (Leigh getting engaged, her sister and brother-in-law having a baby) even though she was jealous they were getting the life she always dreamed of to be realistic. The book did have a cute, but tidy ending. The three girls didn't exactly end up with their idea of \"happy ever after\" but all three were clearly heading in that direction.The one thing I hate more than anything when I'm reading a book is obvious typos. I have to say they are much more glaring when one of the characters is supposed to be an editor! I also felt the pop culture references were way overdone. There was a lot of \"name dropping,\" but in the form of companies vs people-to the extent I found myself wondering if \"Us Weekly\" was a paid sponsor. Overall, this was a quick, fluffy read and I'm glad I didn't devote more than a couple of days to it."}, {"userName": "Kristan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433307-kristan", "userReview": "OMG! This book was terrible; boring, shallow, bereft of heart, or story for that matter. Lauren Weisberger wrote one of the greatest chic lit stories of all time; The Devil Wears Prada, then begins her downhill slope with Everyone Worth Knowing to end up and the very bottom of the mountain with this piece of trash. I'm going to rename Lauren Weisberger, Picabo Street, for her ability to maneuver the Downhill, only with not as much grace - and certainly No gold medal waiting to be awarded. Ms. Weisberger obviously just wants to ride the Sex and the City lift, why else would she write her own version of 3 women navigating life in NYC - one, Adriana, just so happens to get a column for Marie Clare, while another, Leigh, is a book editor.Emmy would be Carrie Bradshaw, Leigh would be Charlotte and Adriana is, of course, Samantha. Lauren Weisberger, the author, even mentions Candace Bushnell in her book when describing the Samantha/Adriana character's future job. I don't know why I completed this book; why does anyone watch with shocked amazement as an Olympic athlete fails to live up to the hype they were imparted with before leaving for the Olympics. Why do we gape at car accidents? Why do we follow fire trucks? Why do we watch the news? The same logic can be applied to this complete disaster of a book.Everytime I feel like writing a book of my very own, I think of the hard work involved, the years that countless authors before me spent at college being groomed for writing. The years spent at their college newspaper writing about the football team's latest defeat or the controversy over a Sorority's latest antics and I think how I could never compete with that kind of discipline -having never actually obtained a scholastic degree of my own. Then I read a book like this which makes writing even a mildly interesting novel seem effortless.I'm sorely disappointed with \"Chasing Harry Winston\". Usually I can tell how good or bad a book or movie will be simply from its title; I should have known. Any title touting the name of \"Harry Winston\" was going to be a pathetic waste of my middle class time."}, {"userName": "Lauren Fidler", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2072335-lauren-fidler", "userReview": "oh, lauren weisberger. why must you write such ugly people. not physically ugly, naturally. since all three of these BFF 4 evas are gorgeous in their own ways. there's leigh, who we start off with, who is like a totally neurotic version of andy from the devil wears prada. and emmy who reminds me of bess from nancy drew, even though she's supposed to be flat chested and skinny. and adriana the brazilian goddess who puts both the other girls to shame.i don't know. the premise here is a bit iffy. leigh is almost always on the outskirts of the main action. while her friends make life-changing resolutions, she just thinks of things she'd like to change. oddly, her suffocating paranoia and prickliness aren't the top things on her list. no, no, she wants to get rid of the amazing, hot, rich man she feels is suffocating her with his endless understanding. right.the other girls are just as awful. the brazilian is worried that, at 30, her looks are fading fast and she best use her tried and true brazilian methods of seduction to hook herself a real man. a husband! and the poor not-fat fat one has been dumped by her asshole-loser of a boyfriend and decides to go on a world-wide excursion to sleep with as many men as humanly possible. considering she is a serial monogamist, this proves to be difficult for her - even after she swears she gets the hang of it after some creepy poolside sex after her sister announces she's pregnant.yup. we be dealing with some major sluts and assholes here.whatever. it's a quick summer read that makes you briefly remember your tumultuous youth while simultaneously making you wish you were both younger and richer. then, you realize how incredibly insane all these women are and you silently rejoice at your good fortune to be happily settled and wrinkly.2.5 stars. i liked it much better than devil wears prada but not enough to read it again."}, {"userName": "LaFleurBleue", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8956777-lafleurbleue", "userReview": "Bad, very bad, awfully bad.There's just nothing to redeem this book. It's one of the very very few books I feel should be all burnt, to avoid anyone else the displeasure to read something this bad. Even years after, I still remember the horror I felt all through this.I'm not a huge fan of chick lit, but some of it can be enjoyable, relaxing and fun. It is none of the three.The three, supposedly heroine, girls are tarts and there is no nicer way to describe them; none has anything that might be likable, their only dream in life is scoring the biggest diamond; it does not really matter whom from, as long as it's big and expensive.Each time one object is mentioned the author felt forced to mention a fashionable and/or outrageously expensive brand.The plot is weak, several scenes are stupidly stupid. And the overall did not held any interest and was boring.That was my first and last book from this author. I'm sincerely surprised that she could write something that was remotely acclaimed, like The Devil Wears Prada, which I wanted to read and decided not to, after this failure.I would not even recommend my worst enemy to read this book."}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1020274-hope", "userReview": "All the \"nice guys\" got to me! That nearly every man (even one night stands?) seemed to be overly considerate and romantic and unbeliveable in the least kinda wanted to make me gag a little. I suppose that is the kind of men to expect in chick lit, though? Altogether it was a very easy and quick read. Not the best or worst. A mostly predictable plotline, and characters that are one-dimensional take away from the enjoyment. Having said that, it was a fun story about fabulous neurotic characters (who while annoying, you do want to root for) and their fabulous neurotic fairytale lives.

Emmy is newly single, and not by choice. She was this close to the ring and the baby she's wanted her whole life when her boyfriend left her for his twenty-three-year-old personal trainer - whose fees are paid by Emmy. With her plans for the perfect white wedding in the trash, Emmy is now ordering takeout for one. Her friends insist an around-the-world sex-fueled adventure will solve all her problems - could they be right?Leigh, a young star in the publishing business, is within striking distance of landing her dream job as senior editor and marrying her dream guy. And to top it all off, she has just purchased her dream apartment. Only when Leigh begins to edit the enfant terrible of the literary world, the brilliant and brooding Jesse Chapman, does she start to notice some cracks in her perfect life...Adriana is the drop-dead-gorgeous daughter of a famous supermodel. She possesses the kind of feminine wiles made only in Brazil, and she never hesitates to use them. But she's about to turn thirty and - as her mother keeps reminding her - she won't have her pick of the men forever. Everyone knows beauty is ephemeral and there's always someone younger and prettier right around the corner. Suddenly she's wondering...does Mother know best?These three very different girls have been best friends for a decade in the greatest city on earth. As they near thirty, they're looking toward their future...but despite all they've earned - first-class travel, career promotions, invites to all the right parties, and luxuries small and large - they're not quite sure they like what they see...One Saturday night at the Waverly Inn, Adriana and Emmy make a pact: within a single year, each will drastically change her life. Leigh watches from the sidelines, not making any promises, but she'll soon discover she has the most to lose. Their friendship is forever, but everything else is on the table. Three best friends.
