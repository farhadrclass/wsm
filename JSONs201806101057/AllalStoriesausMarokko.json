If you aren't yet scared of Arabs, this'll do the trick. In truth, if you haven't yet learned to be afraid of all people and simultaneously in awe of their beauty, Paul Bowles can show you the way.The following is lifted from \"The Sheltering Sky\" and were some of the first words I heard that made me reckon with mortality:\"Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don't know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It's that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don't know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.\""}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris", "userReview": "This is the first collection of Paul Bowles' stories, published in 1979. Since then, he wrote more stories, and other collections have been issued, but this book launched Bowles to worldwide recognition.It includes all the unforgettable seventeen stories from The Delicate Prey and Other Stories (1950). I have read that set several times and they always are fresh and shocking, in a good way. How did the best of these stories, \"Pages from Cold Point,\" get past the censors in 1950? Read that one for the eerie, detached, cold narrative voice much like Poe used in his poetry...oh, and read it for sexy Racky, too.The other twenty-two stories included here, written after 1949, are not quite as good. Four or five relate experiences while high on kif and can be ignored, but the others support Bowles' reputation as one of the best short story writers of the twentieth century."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161077-will", "userReview": "Beautiful, just beautiful. And scary. The best in here, to me, are \"A Distant Episode,\" \"The Fourth Day Out from Santa Cruz,\" and \"Pastor Dowe at Tacate.\" Three of my all-time favorite short stories, and they're all in this one, beautifully bound book. Amazing. I love the sense of alienation that Bowles's characters evince. These stories all feel cold and frightening, yet beautiful. Many of them proceed through a sort of dreamy reality that makes the pacing seem ethereal at times, like a dream, and it adds to the feeling of alienation, making us, the readers, feel alone along with the narrators, who are in constant peril. These are stories to get lost in, stories that exist outside of time. These are nightmares written down."}, {"userName": "Tosh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133661-tosh", "userReview": "Paul Bowles is a very cold creepy writer. And that's what makes him wonderful. The unique way he reads 'culture' outside of the European/American existence is both fascinating and superb at the same moment. An unusual writer in a rather special time in literary history.I much prefer his short stories than his novels. I just like his concrete intense energy in telling of these strange tales. The Beats had a great admiration for Bowles, because I think he traveled not only locations, but also head wise as well."}, {"userName": "Suzi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028025-suzi", "userReview": "If you want a taste of Paul Bowles that's wonderful and disturbing... read his collection of short fiction. His genius is in taking us away from what we feel is normal--our preconceptions of who were are--to ourselves and to the ones we love. What happens when human beings are in a totally alien world. where one cannot assume anything, let alone the direction the breezes blow at night and through your room. And what pestilence and open sore and medieval stasis awaits around the next bend? Always a journey with so many writers. And place. If you want to get a good taste of being in an \"alien\" culture... where your mind cannot jump ahead knowing what is next, because you DON'T know what is next, and you don't know what motivates some of these characters in these strange stories. If you am one o'dem folks who likes to be transported away away on a magic carpet to somewhere not here, no 7 11's, no t.v., no help thy neighbor, no constancy that you recognize, nothing is up but that is down. Paul Bowles leads us into nooks and crannies of the world and of ourselves we did not know existed."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262868-david", "userReview": "\"The Delicate Prey\" may very well be the most perfect short story I've ever read, whatever the hell that means. I guess that every word not only sounds and feels and looks as if it belongs but that the story as a whole is one I simply cannot forget and will always reference as a model short story--that impossible moment when the way I read, what and whom I read, was forever changed."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764075-andy", "userReview": "One of my favorite collections of short stories.

I'd like to read more--maybe The Sheltering Sky.My recent binge of binge-watching shows on Netflix (including Seasons 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Shameless) has cut into my reading time over the last couple of months, so I moved through these stories more slowly than usual.Bowles lived an unusually interesting life and excelled in both music and writing.

I actually came across it in my workplace's \"donate for charity and take a book\" bin..and by a quarter of the way through I felt that surely someone bought it with the best of intentions, but were defeated by the onslaught of...pessimism? depression? that this book so masterfully produces. So it ended up in the charity bin.Well, another man's trash......I enjoyed most of the short stories of Bowles, I absolutely loved a few of them, and I genuinely disliked maybe one or two.I agree with most of the reviews on here, Bowles seems to me to be just about as accomplished a writer as you can get. He writes with conviction, a passion, and at times the story is just so surreal (and short!) you rely on the author's mastery of the English language, when your mind does nothing but shout \"what.am.I.reading?!\".There were times, though, that I felt Bowles overdid it....I'm talking in particular about two tales towards the end of the book, where for some (still to me unknown despite my research) reason, Bowles omitted all punctuation. I mean it's a grand total of 6 or 7 pages, it's not exactly a tome of text.....But it's unbelievably daunting, and extremely tiring to have to read such walls of text, not to mention it's hard to follow whatever storyline there may be.Skip 'em you say?Blasphemy! I'm the kind of guy who likes to savour his books...I'm one of those guys who actually stopped to try to make sense of the maps / lineage lists in the LOTR series. I'll be damned if seven pages of pure rambling puts me off reading every single page of that book!Reoccurring themes? Morocco. Middle east. Kif. Sun.So long as you don't expect to be spoon-fed a happy ending, you should be able to enjoy this collection of short stories.Most of the tales deal in one way or another with a character's mental approach to a situation, quite often the surreal...not only does this mean 'tasty morsels for the imagination', but it means that really, you take away from it what you will.It's the kind of book to keep within reach at home; I don't often read collections of short stories, so perhaps this is why I struggled...I tried to read it on my daily commute. Personally I prefer to approach a long journey with an ongoing storyline, and characters who wake up with you every morning..so yeah, I'd say keep this one at home, to occasionally pick up and mentally jet off to Morocco every now and then.I'd recommend it to a friend."}, {"userName": "G", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1674068-g", "userReview": "I find it interesting that the last two books I\u2019ve read \u2013 as well as the one I\u2019m about to start \u2013 have been based in or (in the case of Collected Stories) have had a large number of stories set in North Africa. While it has been unplanned, it has presented an interesting through line and a sense of consistency.That said, how is this collection? Many reviewers say that collections of short stories are hit and miss. While that\u2019s a clich\u00e9, it is certainly true for this collection. In particular seemingly kif inspired, stream of consciousness stories lack direction and purpose. There are also some pretty brutal and vicious passages, but for the most part they are integral to the stories and not inserted for shock value.I think Bowles is a terrific writer based on this collection. Strikes aside, the majority of the stories here are hits, and a few he knocks over the fence. \u201cThe Circular Valley\u201d and \u201cThe Time of Friendship\u201d are particularly strong. I plan to add \u201cThe Sheltering Sky\u201d to my list of books to seek out."}, {"userName": "Patrick McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/678506-patrick-mccoy", "userReview": "The Collected Short Stories of Paul Bowles: this collection certifies Bowles brilliance. I have enjoyed his novels, but these fascinating short stories reveal him to be one of the greatest American writers of the century, perhaps the most under-rated American writer. I like the fact that his stories are often set in exotic locals like Morocco, S. America, Mexico, and Thailand. He is also good with stories about expats as well as those written form the point of view of locals, some of these stories comes across like parables.There are several memorable stories, but \"A Distant Episode\" in particular is brilliant. It's about an ethnologist who goes to study a distant tribe and is drugged fed mushrooms, has his tongue cut out and made to dance before the tribe. His later stories lose none of his precision in story telling either; it is a solid body of work. Highly recommended, however buy the paperback it?s a bit of a doorstop at 657 pages."}, {"userName": "R.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184928-r", "userReview": "Just got tired of the \"Arab bandits are sinister, American tourists are stupid, the Moroccan nights are sultry, the marketplace tea is hot and bitter blah blah blah...\" Maybe it's because Bowles was a composer first and foremost that his writing comes across as, I dunno, subliminally mathematical - lots of dots of 1s and 0s are connected until, I dunno, he typed THE END. Maybe some other time, but not right now. I'd bet dollars to donuts his novels are better, but this collection is just Humorless Dave Eggers (Global-Conscience Phase)...Or, yes, perhaps, yes, I'd just rather read about Amish brides right now."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245028-jeff", "userReview": "Paul Bowles was a bit of a polymath: a talented composer, much admired by Virgil Thomson and Aaron Copland, who showed promise in both classical and popular styles, who chose instead to focus on fiction, after the success of his novel The Sheltering Sky. I'll leave discussion of his complicated personal life to others, along with speculation on whether his wife Jane Bowles was the more talented author.

It's one of the strangest scary stories I've ever read -- b/c truly nothing happens. Every time I read it I try to work out how Bowles managed to convey such horror -- he did it so subtly it's almost impossible to figure out.
