Do you understand?\u201d\nMongolian fantasy with ghosts and riddles, anyone?Well, this was pretty damn fascinating! I've been putting this book off because I've been so disappointed with almost every YA fantasy novel I read lately, but this was like nothing I've read before. It's a strange and stunning combination of the Mongol Empire, the Italian opera Turandot, and Persian fairy tales. I should point out that this contains a lot of fantastical elements and the author acknowledges all the liberties she took in the note at the end. If you're looking for an accurate historical depiction of the Mongol Empire and the Song dynasty-- this isn't it. Many of the characters, though, are based on real people.Bannen splits the narrative in an extremely compelling way. In the present, Prince Khalaf, a descendant of Genghis Khan, attempts to solve the three riddles presented to him by Turandokht, the daughter of the Great Khan. If he succeeds, he will get to marry her. If he fails, he will die. This is all told from the perspective of Jinghua, a Chinese slave who we soon discover is in love with Khalaf. Jinghua's narrative then skips to the past, filling in the events leading up to that moment.From what I can tell - as I'm only slightly familiar with the opera Turandot - the author sticks fairly close to the original, with the exception that she focuses more on the character of the slave girl. In this book, Jinghua is given far more depth and agency, and the author develops an interesting backstory for her that gives the tale another layer. Jinghua also considers what it is to be a woman or girl in this time (the 13th century), especially one who is enslaved, and laments the obsession with beauty that sees unattractive girls viewed as worthless.It's quite romantic, to tell you the truth, but I did not mind so much. The love story is balanced out by a good amount of action and political intrigue, and I liked how Jinghua's attraction to Khalaf is based on his personality, not his looks. Khalaf is also flawed, even cowardly at times, allowing for more complexity of character than is usually afforded to YA fantasy love interests.There's so many stories within the story, too. The Bird and the Blade feels like a beautiful celebration of poetry, songs and stories from all across Central and East Asia. There are many quotes and retellings of tales from authors such as Rumi, Saadi, Nizami and Qingzhao. And just when you might be thinking the quoting is getting a little sappy, we have Timur to snap us back to reality:Fired by love, he called her his life, his pearl, his dew-petaled flower.\u201cThis is the sappiest piece of rotting carrion I have ever heard,\u201d Timur interjects.And we must talk about Timur because he might be my favourite character in the whole book. At first, I hated him, but over time the author develops him into a really funny source of cynicism. I just adore that kind of grumpy but lovable character. He really is a cantankerous old goat, but it is so refreshing in an otherwise pretty dramatic and serious story. Also, my new favourite phrase is: \u201cGo suck your used tea leaves!\u201dIf anything, I think the book would have benefited from more female characters and positive female relationships but I guess, sadly, women at this time mostly existed behind the scenes so the depiction is probably fairly accurate. I still liked how the author gave a minor female character in the opera her own voice and story here. A very impressive multilayered book.Some extra notes: \u27bd This is a standalone.\u27bd You do not need to know the opera Turandot to enjoy the book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "ARC provided by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\u201cNow, cold and exhausted, a girl disguised as a boy, tottering after the losing end of a battle, I have to second-guess that assessment. It seems to me that I\u2019ve made some choices\u2014some very bad choices\u2014that have led me to this moment.\u201d\n\nThe Bird and the Blade is a completely enthralling and heart-breaking YA fantasy debut. I enjoyed this so much, and I was completely teleported and captivated every time I opened this book up. Plus, this is a story about the descendants of Genghis Khan\u2019s sons, mixed with the Italian opera Turandot, and that\u2019s one of the most unique concepts of any story I\u2019ve read in 2018. And this might not be the most historically accurate novel out there, but I loved reading about the Song dynasty and the Mongol Empire.Genghis Khan had four sons, who had trouble deciding who would rule after their father. Well, this story centers around a prince from Jochi\u2019s blood line. Jochi was the oldest of the sons, who ended up not being the ascended ruler, but still ended up being a great military leader, and his great, great grandson is no different. That is, until his men are killed, and he and his ruling father are forced to go into hiding with a girl who has many secrets. And I fell in so in love with that secret keeper. Jinghua is now a companion to the Prince Khalaf and his father, Timur, but she was once a slave for the them and their entire family. Khalaf always showed her kindness and during a split-second decision, Jinghua goes into hiding with these two royal men. And while traveling she teaches him many things from her culture, including the language. \n\n\u201cCruelty is easy to repay, my lord. Kindness is another matter.\u201d\n\nWhile they are traveling and hiding from their enemies throughout the Mongol Empire, they find out about the daughter of the Great Khan, Turandokht. She is so desired among all the princes for her hand in marriage, she has set up a contest for every royal suitor, where they must answer three riddles correctly given to them by herself. And if they answer any incorrectly, they will forfeit their lives. Khalaf wants nothing more than to try his hand at the riddles to marry Turandokht and restore the glory of his people, or die an honorable death trying. And this story is told from present time where we first see Jinghua witnessing Khalaf being told the first riddle that will decide if he dies or moves on to the second. We are then teleported back in time, and we get all these puzzle pieces that slowly start to fit together. From Jinghua and Khalaf before they were forced into exile, to Jinghua with her family before she became a slave, to Jinghua falling in love with Khalaf slowly but ever so surely. And this beautiful story that is equal parts heart-warming and heart-wrenching slowly begins to take form. This book puts the spotlight on a discussion about the beauty standards for women that we've endured for all our pasts and still in our present day. Like, how so many people feel like beauty is all that that women have to offer. And how we will pit girls against one another and created all this ugly jealousy, when we should be using that energy to uplift and support and celebrate all women. \n\n\u201cHer beauty doesn\u2019t make you ugly. Her intelligence doesn\u2019t make you stupid. Her value doesn\u2019t make you worthless.\u201d\n\nOverall, this is the highest three star rating I\u2019ve ever given a three star book. I loved this and was completely enthralled in the tale. I just really disliked the ending, which I suppose if I knew about Turandot before going in, I would have been better prepared. It completely broke me, and I know how beautiful it is when I take a step back and reflect upon it. But, I just really didn\u2019t like it when I read it. But this really is such an impressive debut, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Megan Bannen does next, because they created such a brilliant standalone that really impressed me. Trigger and content warnings for slavery, kidnapping, heavy war themes, mention of rape, graphic deaths, graphic violence, torture, gore, loss of a loved one, and self-harm.

That\u2019s a first for me. I read retellings of fairytales often enough to consider it one of my favourite genres, but I admit I know nothing about operas. But that\u2019s okay. You can still understand the story perfectly. And I did. It really isn\u2019t that complicated. The setting is original and the culture different, but it comes down to kings (\u2018\u2018kahns\u2019\u2019) fighting for power and a certain prince who wants to save his and his father\u2019s kingdom by taking part in the riddles competition to gain the hand of a powerful princess. Slave girls who get rescued by boys who become their love interest is nothing new, but I simply adored the author\u2019s writing, 1st person POV choice and dimensionality of the characters. I went into it expecting the competition to be the main attraction, wrongly so. The characters do think about it and, yes, it is part of the storyline, but this is about a slave girl (Jinghua), a prince (Khalaf) and his father (Timur) who travel through cities, to find allies and escape enemies.It is beautifully-told. I especially enjoyed the interactions between Jinghua and Timur. While she and the prince have lovely passages together, which lead to a slow-burn romance, I am a sucker for love-hate relationships. Timur is a grumpy and authoritarian old man who hates the idea of keeping a slave girl who can\u2019t fight, but his opinion of her changes when he notices her intelligence and goodness.Jinghua is no Celaena Sardothien. On the one hand, she has a great heart, ambition, and quite a lyrical way of viewing the world. On the other hand, she has low self-esteem, limited courage, and lets her heart cloud her judgment over and over again. Also, she doesn\u2019t want to learn how to fight, thus making her a target in combat and heavy weight at times. Jinghua may be the main character, but I refuse to believe that she is the hero of this story. Prince Khalaf is. She is hardly even a sidekick, mostly just there for the ride. She never undergoes a character development, but she does make realizations about herself while helping Khalaf achieve *his* goals, which eventually become hers as well.A gripping and romantic story that is better than the majority of YA fantasy books that get published every year, so cheers to that!Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Cindy \u2729\u263d Savage Queen \u2654", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222333-cindy-savage-queen", "userReview": "Can't tell if the synopsis implies a love triangle or not..."}, {"userName": "Aila", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25674512-aila", "userReview": "Okay let me explain about about the DNF status. This book was by no means bad. The writing was totally riveting, the first person POV narrative from Jinghua was intriguing, and the research is really well-done. Like, I read 15% into the book and have to commend the author on her knowledge about the Song/Yuan dynasty, and her placement of the Chinese songs and phrases. (Yay!) I was SO into it when I stopped. The story jumps immediately into action with Jinghua witnessing her love, Prince Khalaf, volunteer to solve riddles that would allow him to marry Turandokht, which would help him with political prospects. The main romance is linear as Jinghua and Khalaf's affection to each other stays true (while Turandokht is mainly there for political reasons), and from what I've started to read of it, it's very sweet and lovely.BUT. Why did I DNF then? There's a whole backstory to this. (Get ready everyone.)When I first saw that this book had a Chinese main character, I was like \"Ooh, interesting.\" I was a bit wary starting because sometimes Chinese stories don't get done right by white authors, but from what little I did read, Bannen did a pretty good job with the culture. It's much more drawn out and integrated than the opera this book was based on, Turandot. I was also excited to see her rendition of the story. Before reading, I looked up the synopsis of Turandot because I don't have much opera background and I loathed it. It's the story of a prince who solves these riddles and marries this bitchy princess (the name of the opera) while the slave Chinese girl who has been SUPPORTING HIM THE WHOLE TIME dies by suicide because of her unrequited love. I was NOT having it. (Not to mention the racist and sexist implications of the original narrative, because honestly, of course old European men during that time with yellow fever could perpetuate such stereotypes and fetishization in an opera.)So obviously, I was like \"In this retelling I bet the Chinese girl gets what she deserves... aka a Good Ending.\" Lmao @ my naive thoughts.Full review (rant?) closer to release date."}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "Loved this so much!

All suitors must solve 3 impossible riddles to win her hand\u2014and if they fail, they die. What will she do\u2026?The short review...I quite enjoyed this book! I read it fast because I was totally engrossed in Jinghua's story. I enjoyed the subtle touches of culture that it being set in the Mongol Empire provided. I loved that those details were tight, no extraneous information was dumped on us. There also wasn't a lot of explaining. I liked that we were thrust into the story and had to go along with what was happening. The writing, something I rarely talk about in and of itself is quite excellent. I would totally read this author again just due to the way she uses words to characterize and to express the character's deepest selves. I don't want you to think this was full of swashbuckling fun though there are battles with weapons. It is certainly a quiet book. It's about knowing a person and falling for them. It's about going the distance even though the only pro is that its what your heart is telling you to do. Some might equate quiet with slow. I didn't find it slow for even a second though there are many revelations piled at the end... it was quiet. Heartfelt. A story of its time. Almost a fable or a myth. We start off with a nobody slave girl who crushes on the nicest of her master's sons. And we find she has the heart of a queen.Cover & Title grade -> A-Having read the book I do think this is a good cover. I am still puzzled about \"the Blade\" part of the title but while that wasn't clearly stated like \"the Bird\" was I do believe I know who it is referencing. I think the bird feathers tipped in red is just the message you need to start with and end with. It's spot on to the story and quite gorgeous in its simplicity. The modern chrome title also fits the slight modernity the story has having been written for modern people and not in ancient times. YES! What makes the story so rich?-Poetic Male and Singing FemaleI loved how a mutual passion for the arts and philosophy brought these two together! They go back and forth sharing with each other... it is a romance made from real life and emotions.-Collision of CulturesKhalaf is a Mongol Prince. Jinghua is a slave from a nearby conquered nation. They were raised with different religions and different beliefs and different situations. Yet they work to find common ground.-Language, Riddles, Stories and SongsThese are all woven into the story! It makes for a quieter story than one with supernatural powers but compelling and lush with culture and life.-Dreams of the PastFamily plays a huge part in the story. Khalaf's father in the present and Jinghua's brother in the past. These are woven into the choices the pair makes and informs their decisions and what their future will be like! What might (probably not) be a turn off?-Lovesickness.Some may call it instalove, but whatever term you put to it you may be annoyed by it. I felt like it was one of those moments when you're having a tough time and someone is kind and you can't help really liking them after that even though you haven't quite gotten to know them yet. Don't worry, plenty of falling in love happens after that.-Modern Language in moments.Every once in a while someone bursts out with a clearly modern phrase or idea. Like time is counted like it is shown in the story. I didn't mind it a bit. It happened rarely and when it did I understood it was to save us from excruciatingly vague terminology that we don't understand today. So thank you Megan!!-No twists.This may be open to some interpretation but to my mind there were none. There are some revelations nearer the end about motivations but to me the story read more as \"damn good foreshadowing\" than twists. And I liked that! It wasn't about shocking us (oh how rarely we are shocked in real life!) but about telling a story that struck us in the feels...As a Writer...Why 4 stars if even the negatives weren't such a negative to me?! Well this is clearly labeled as a YA novel. And there are some themes here that don't work well with YA readers... Loose plot where characters are more important. An old fashioned girl who doesn't want to rule her boy with an iron fist of control. A poignant ending that doesn't really qualify as a happy ending. If this were an adult novel I would have totally 5 starred it!! As a writer your audience matters... and while I don't think compromises necessarily need to be made it will effect the overall rating of your story.The Bird and the Blade is a quiet story of heart. It follows two characters that make you fall for them and have you rooting for them... a long life of happiness in a world that doesn't really allow that... Sometimes we are at the mercy of the times and what we can capture will have to sustain us! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Authenticity\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Writing Style\u22c6 \u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Plot & Pacing\u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 World BuildingThanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.

Because this was extraordinarily heart-wrenching as well as engaging and absorbing and completely amazing.I am wrecked. This book was glorious.The first sign that this was just an amazing read was that I devoured the whole thing in one day. This is a 400+ page book and I just blew through the ARC so quickly.It wasn't just one thing that was keeping me hooked--it was the whole story in general. I think one of the most important parts is how original this whole story and concept was.This isn't your standard white medieval fantasy, and there's actually zero magic in this whatsoever. It's one of those \"labeled-as-fantasy-but-not-actually-fantasy-just-badass-historical-fiction\" novels, which I always adore because you don't need magic to make a great fantasy novel.Literally everyone in this book is Asian. So shoutout to my fam! The sheer amount of Asian culture portrayed in this novel was fantastic and I just loved reading all of the characters who were helped portray my family's culture in literature.Yes, I might be a little biased that we're finally getting more Asian fantasies, but who can blame me? I did initially have a couple reservations because this is being written by a non-Asian woman, but I think Bannen did a great job with the representation and really researched everything well.Obviously, she took liberties with the story, but I love how she kept enough historical context and hints to keep it grounded in the time period. For instance, Bannen let Jinghua, the main character, call Timur, the guy who is kind of like a grumpy adopted grandfather to her, \"old goat,\" even though this would have never happened in that time period.Yet, in keeping this affectionate term, Bannen gave the novel more than she took away from the history, and the relationship between Jinghua and Timur was fantastic and adorable and #famgoals. Timur is literally the GOAT (ba dum bum crash).But anyways, back to the Mongols. I loved how Bannen managed to easily convey all of the history to the reader without making it feel info-dumpy. Like, the Mongols and Chinese dynasties are all really tough and their politics are complicated, but Bannen incorporated it seamlessly and managed to relay to the reader about how the Song Dynasty and Mongols interacted & how the Mongol Empire worked.If only Bannen had written all of my AP World History textbooks, maybe then I would have done better in that class.But even beyond the fantastic premise, this was just a fantastic book in general.The way Bannen conveyed the story was lovely to read and I thought the alternating from 1281 (short chapters about a trial) and 1280 (what led them to getting there) both fit really well, and if you pay attention, you can solve the trials based on the backstory attached to it. (Pay close attention to what's printed at the top of your pages...)It was a little weird for Bannen to have jumped way back in time to 1278 for around 50 pages, but in the end those 50 pages ended up being very much worth it, and I really love how they pushed the story further.And when it pushed the story further along and forced it to continue, it was like it set off a nuclear reaction of just a bunch of emotionally-wrecking and mind-blowing plot twists and events.The ending gutted me and I'll be crying myself to sleep tonight, even though I have no tears left after sobbing them all out reading this book. I should probably go drink some water.But it was so heart-wrenching, and this is actually based off of the opera Turandot, which I'll have to check out, but I don't recommend you read the summary of the opera unless you want to spoil the book's ending for yourself.I just really loved reading it and the plot was engaging and the pacing complemented it and helped it move along all the way to that ending who we shall not talk about.And with all this raving about the plot being so amazing, you're probably expecting terrible character development, but it's not! It's really not!I adored the characters, and not just the \"old goat\" relationship.Jinghua is really, really complicated. For a couple minutes after reading this, I didn't like what she had done. I found it oddly controversial because I didn't agree with her actions on account of love.But on the other hand, I keep battling with myself over her actions because I also felt like she still had justification behind her actions besides just love.And now, half a week later, I still have no idea if I condone Jinghua's actions or not, and I really love this. This book is making me think--like how The Female of the Species made you think about Alex's actions. I'm thinking about Jinghua's actions and the merits behind it.Was it her way of showing she had agency despite being a slave? Was it something else? I may never know or understand, but I think this is a truly marvelous book that totally blew me out of the water.This debut is one I'd highly recommend even to non-fantasy fans. I am absolutely stunned by it and think it's something everyone should read both to enjoy and to think. This is a wonderful novel rich in culture, steeped in technique, and something that I will definitely want to reread.Thank you so much to Megan Bannen for sending me an ARC of her debut, and to The FFBC and Harper Collins and Edelweiss for the digital review copy as well!Blog | Instagram | Twitter"}, {"userName": "Keri", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59584031-keri", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 4.25 starsWell, this book is going to haunt me for a while. It was a gut-wrenching read and left me tearing up at the end (and I never cry over books!). Megan Bannen crafts a beautiful, 13th century Mongolian inspired setting with gripping characters and an enthralling spin on the opera Turandot. After staying up late to finish this book (because of course nessun dorma when they read this book), one of the first things I did the next day was go back and reread the beginning. I adored this book and I can\u2019t wait for others to read it! (prepare for the gushing)First off, can we just talk about how awesome the idea of this book is? As I mentioned before, it\u2019s a retelling of the opera Turandot (and various other super similar ancient stories and poems). But instead of taking the perspective of the protagonist Prince Calaf or Turandot, the tale is told from the perspective of a side character (the slave girl). I love when authors do this! It brings new twists to light to such classic tales and this is exactly what Bannen did! Even though I knew the plotline going in (from Wikipedia, lol, tho I would love to see the opera some day!), I was completely engrossed in this tale, gasping at the new depth that was woven into this retelling.One of the first things that impressed me about this book was the structure of it. The Bird and the Blade alternates between short scenes of Prince Khalaf attempting to solve Turnadokht\u2019s riddles and long sections that provide backstory on Jinghua and Khalaf leading up to these events. Though at first it confused me, I grew to love this structure! I find backstory scenes to be either hit or miss and this book definitely made the mark! Both the riddle scenes and the backstory were equally compelling and I found myself continuously greedy for more.Another element that I adored was how Jinghua and Turandokht were such perfect foils of each other. I won\u2019t elaborate on that because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but aahhhhh, this component killed me. Although I do wish that Bannen had found a way to flesh out more of Turandokht\u2019s character. That could have been really interesting.Additionally, something I loved about this retelling was how Bannen interwove snippets of Turandot into the lines of The Bird and the Blade. Given that I\u2019ve only listened to the aria \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d (you\u2019ve probably heard it too. It seems like the majority of opera-singing contestants on talent shows sing this aria), I can only speak for that song. There are at least two different lines spoken in the book that come directly from the English-translated version of \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d and when I read them I squealed with delight! I adored these hidden Easter eggs and I\u2019m willingly to bet there were a ton more that I didn\u2019t catch.Though this book enthralled me, I will admit it wasn\u2019t perfect. I found Jinghua\u2019s instant attraction/obsession with Khalaf kind of confusing. It was offsetting how present Jinghua\u2019s voice was in the narration. And additionally there was a plot twist at the end about Jinghua, that although surprising, came off as clich\u00e9 and weak to me.Now, I can\u2019t complete this review without devoting a paragraph to THAT ENDING. I obviously won\u2019t give any spoilers, but know that it wrecked me. This book grabbed all my feelings and just squeezed, but I\u2019m not sure I was completely satisfied with the ending (and not just because I teared up. I mean quality/plot-wise). Certain results seemed rather stupid and kind of dramatic in hindsight and I wish the author had put an even greater twist across the end. (lol I hope this paragraph was vague enough for you all).Overall, The Bird and the Blade captured both my mind and my heart (Megan Bannen, can you at least give us some sort of companion book, pleaseeeeee?). Already, I\u2019m itching to go back and reread this book. I do want to address that even though this book is classified as fantasy, it\u2019s really just historical fiction with a slight magical realism twist (a ghost). Regardless of that, I would recommend this book to all YA/historical fiction/fantasy/Turandot lovers!

Those books who have such captivating characters? Those books that you still think about even though you finished it a while ago? This is that kind of book. As soon as I read the synopsis of this book, I knew it was going to be great, and I wasn't let down in the slightest. Even from the very beginning I was entranced and literally did nothing except read for an entire day. (no regrets) Khalaf is such an intriguing character, and Timur is hilarious. It is very rare for me to not be annoyed at the female main character in a YA book; often times, there's just something about them that annoys me, but I had no complaints about Jinghua. The characters were so well developed that they seem to come off the page. The plot was unique, and I loved every moment of the book.The romance is the slow-burning type, and it makes sense when you take into account the time period this book takes place in. The fact that the romance took a while made the book so much better, and had me bawling at the end. I had trouble reading the last ten or so pages because I couldn't see through my tears, and I've been re-reading some of my favorite parts ever since I've finished the book; I've been telling everyone I know that they need to go out and read this book when it comes out. This is a stellar debut novel, and genuinely hope everyone can see this book for what it is.

My head hurts from how hard I was crying so when I settle down I\u2019ll write a proper review but I don\u2019t think I can articulate my love for this book properly, but this book is going on my favorites shelf and Megan Bannen now has my undivided loyalty because she\u2019s a fantastic writer and wow I really need to step away because I\u2019m still crying bye"}, {"userName": "Kathy Martin", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122948-kathy-martin", "userReview": "THE BIRD AND THE BLADE was an excellent historical fiction novel set in the Mongol Empire around the year 1280. It's star is Jinghua who is a young woman with lots of secrets. She is a slave in the Kipchak Khanate. When the Khanate is overrun by the il-khanate she chooses to go on the run with the deposed Khan Timur and his only surviving son Khalaf who is both kind and brilliant.As they flee ahead of both the il-khanate's forces and soldiers sent by Turandokht, the daughter of the Great Khan, Khalaf and Jinghua fall in love. A more hopeless love would be hard to imagine since he is a prince and she is a slave and considering that Khalaf's one road to restoring his position in society is to win the hand of Turandokht. However, Turandokht is not making the task easy. Any suitor has to answer three impossible riddles. Failure means a gruesome death.The story is woven between the contest of riddles and how Jinghua and Khalaf got there. It is filled with romance and danger and a twist I didn't see coming. The Author's Note talks about her inspiration coming from the opera Turandot which, since what I know about opera could be written on the smallest Post-It Note with plenty of room to spare, came as a surprise for me. Some of the plot elements are certainly operatic in nature. I also enjoyed the poetry and songs that were part of the story.I enjoyed the setting which takes place in a time period and part of the world unfamiliar to me. I also loved the relationship between Khalaf and Jinghua. I thought Jinghua was an intriguing character who was quite mysterious. Part Six answered quite a few questions I had about her past. Fans of historical fiction and romance will enjoy this story."}, {"userName": "Angelica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16201093-angelica", "userReview": "Well, I'm conflicted.Review to come closer to the release date!"}, {"userName": "Susana Zemlyakova", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41960043-susana-zemlyakova", "userReview": "5 stars for The Bird and the Blade This book wrecked me. It is a bit hard to put in words how I feel having just finished it. I think I can say it is the same as watching your dog get run over while winning the lottery. Megan Bannen is a very talented storyteller. I was not familiar with the story of \"Prince Khalaf and the Princess of China\" but from the author's closing statement I understand that this is a retelling of that story from the view of the princess' slave. Even without having read the original tale, this retelling was beautifully done.  \"It brings with an explosion and ends in a whisper.\" It may be cheap for me to use a quote from the book to describe the book. But that is it. That sums up this story perfectly.I am so grateful to have been given an early galley of this novel. I learned so much about the Khan empire and the beautiful lands through Jinghua's eyes. I felt her love and her fears. Her anger and desperation. I laughed at her sarcastic quips. All three characters were beautifully developed. Including the cantankerous Timur.I'm keeping this short because I don't want to give too much away but do yourself a favor, preorder this one. You won't regret it. I received a digital ARC courtesy of Edelweiss and HarperCollins for an honest review.

A few things were clear though, Bannen is talented. The prose is beautiful. The characters are great. I definitely have a new book boyfriend in Khalaf, who is one of the sweetest most intelligent love interests I've seen in a long time. The main character, Jinghua is interesting and is even more so by the end. But the one who steals the show is Khalaf's cantankerous father, Timur. In a book with such serious consequences, I more than one time laughed out loud at his dialogue. The setup is intriguing, and the beginning is phenomenal. Where it drags is in between where Jinghua, Khalaf and Timur do a lot of traveling and talking about politics. I wanted to focus more on the princess (she was really interesting!) and some of the other characters who we only see in small segments. But the last 20% moved at a lightning pace. I liked how the author melded history and the Turnadot opera as a retelling. Overall, definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Emily (Falling for YA)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788621-emily-falling-for-ya", "userReview": "After reading:I cried ugly tears last night as I finished The Bird and the Blade.

I had just read \na really fabulous book\n right before I started this one, so I was high key nervous since it has been actual\u00a0ages since I have loved two books in a row. Well, my streak was broken, because guess what? Loved this one too! And now I shall tell you all the reasons why!  The setting/time period were so unique. Have you read about the\u00a0Mongol Empire circa the 13th Century? Yeah, me neither. And of course I ended up down a Wikipedia hole after I finished the book because it was all so very fascinating! \n   I adored the characters. It's a relatively small cast of characters, but they're incredibly well developed. I connected with Jinghua from the start. She was smart, she was funny, and I couldn't help but feel for her plight. I equally loved Khalaf- he was the best kind of prince. Kind, but also extremely intelligent, and it was very easy to understand why Jinghua developed feelings for him. His father Timur is basically a crotchety old man, but deep down he's more than that. He may be stuck in his ways, but he does have a big heart if a person can crack the tough facade. His interactions with Jinghua were some of my favorite parts of the book. \n   The romance was really lovely. Like I mentioned, it was easy to see why Jinghua became enamored with Khalaf. And it's heartbreaking to see her love him from afar, always knowing that they were too different for it to ever be a \"thing\". And, she was equally certain that he'd never feel the same for her, as she was his family's slave. \n   I found the writing to be fabulous. One choice I loved was that the author injected some informal, current language into the book, and it somehow worked. For me, it felt like when Jinghua would think like we'd think today, it helped the reader relate to her more. And the times current-speak was used in dialogue, it helped to inform the reader that she'd become comfortable with the person she was talking to- such as in the progression of her relationship with (and delightful quips and banter with) Timur. \n   Feels, so many feels. I was not okay after reading this book. The author made a lot of gutsy choices, but they really fit with the tone of the story, and I appreciated them. I had a lot of feelings throughout the book. I definitely laughed, the light hearted moments really helped especially in such a tumultuous situation. I felt so, so much sympathy for Jinghua's lovesickness. I mean, been\u00a0there, you know? I was definitely appropriately nervous during the tense scenes- and there were a good amount of those, too! \n   The story itself was very entertaining. It jumps between past and present, so we see what Jinghua is feeling as Khalaf attempts to solve Turandokht's riddles, but we also get an amazing look into what led them all to this point in time. \n   \nBottom Line: \nI loved this book so hard. I want to read it again, and I am jealous of everyone who hasn't because they get to, so there you have it."}, {"userName": "Jessie  (Ageless Pages Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863162-jessie-ageless-pages-reviews", "userReview": "A really fun historical retelling of the 18th century French opera Turandot set in the 13th century Mongol Empire.

That is, until Prince Khalaf returns home and gives her reason to believe he alone has the power and wisdom to one day rule. When the Prince and his father, Timur Khan, lose their army/home/family to enemy forces, Jinghua makes a last attempt to control her fate by following and serving them. Along the way, Prince Khalaf determines his only hope to restore the kingdom is by forging a marriage alliance with Turandokht, beloved daughter of the Great Khan. Only, Turandokht is like ice, and does not want to marry. She kills any potential royal suitor who cannot answer her three riddles, and attempting to do so is now considered a death sentence. As Jinghua, Timur, and Khalaf try to escape death and figure out how to save the kingdom, mysterious pasts are revealed and a greater story comes into play. Who is Jinghua? Why is everyone so hellbent on getting to Timur, if he has nothing left? Does Khalaf even want to be Khan, or can he be?For a story set in this time period, with all of the intricacies of the government at that time, I *know* this book could have been incredibly confusing. The author wrote in such a way that everything was so clear and accessible, which I loved. This book is considered YA, but could definitely get some crossover with more adult readers. I won't get too into it, but there IS a romance, and it is written so perfectly that I was re-reading sections just to experience it more than once. The time periods flip throughout the book so you have the 'present' with the riddles, the past showcasing the fall of the family, and eventually Jinghua's past. This is just such a SOLID read and I highly recommend it! If you're scared of the history aspect, don't be. This is a character driven novel and you will fall in love with the characters and their relationships, with the time period being a fascinating backdrop to it all.

The Prologue into Part One confused me a bit because of the timeline, but I quickly wrapped my head around the story of the book and once I picked the book up after a good night\u2019s rest I loved the flow Bannen picked. Like I said, the timeline is a little wonky at first, but it fits the story being told perfectly. The Prologue is two character\u2019s meeting for the first time, and the beginning of Part One is the beginning of the climax of the book. The novel then switches between the journey leading up to the climax, and little snippets of the climax. You slowly discover bits of information about the three main characters, the recent history of the empire they live in, and LOTS of fun poetry/riddles. I wouldn\u2019t want the book set up any other way!What I really love about the novel is how seamlessly the story flows. It feels natural, even though this specific story didn\u2019t occur. The topic is obviously well-researched to make the plot feel so smooth. The Bird and the Blade is actually a retelling of \u201cPrince Khalaf and the Princess of China\u201d a story about how a great king must be a competent warrior and extremely wise. A Princess tells 3 riddles that must be answered in order to be married, a Prince and his slave respond to the call- that\u2019s as vaguely specific as I\u2019m going to get so that I don\u2019t spoil anything not given away at the beginning of the book! Basically, I really enjoyed how this non-mongolian story was able to be transplanted into the chaos of the Mongolian/Song turmoil and was able to use historical East Asian events to portray this new rendition of a Persian story.Furthermore, the characters and their development in this story felt so natural. It\u2019s amazing what traveling across a continent in close quarters will do to a small group of travelers. Namely, a Khan in exile, a Prince in exile, and their slave. The POV is from the slave, and the father-son dynamic seen from the outside was stellar. Jinghua (the slave) is full of mystery and creates a compelling main character, even for the parts of the story when you know practically nothing about her. This is definitely one of my favorite books of the year and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves history, riddles, and intricate relationships (romantically and familial)."}, {"userName": "Mary Nguyen (fox & wit)", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65136088-mary-nguyen-fox-wit", "userReview": "This is book has a lot of strange TMI commentaries about pooping and whipping penises out.

For all her low confidence and belief that she\u2019s nothing more than a slave, she\u2019s actually quite courageous, quick witted and when the situation deems it necessary, has quite the strong back bone. She definitely grows throughout the book.At first I couldn\u2019t understand the back and forth narration between events in time but it actually was well done rather than straight linear narration. I think it adds that bit of anticipation between each riddle and unveils information nicely.I wasn\u2019t expecting the ending at all and while I cried, I loved it.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER FOR THOSE NOT AWARE OF THE ORIGINAL OPERA.Yes, she commits suicide at the end but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bleak and anti-feminist as everyone thinks who didn\u2019t finish the book.To me it\u2019s all in the detail. She didn\u2019t die because of unrequited love. Her death was certainly not pathetic. Her sacrifice was noble but more so, the way I read it was she wanted to be with her family especially her brother. She says \u201ctake me home\u201d and I think this means everything. She talks about how displaced she felt the entire book and that she could finally be HOME and with her beloved brother and family was so wonderful and important beyond her staying in the world of the living.Also hell yeah diverse representation!
