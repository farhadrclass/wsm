Yay! \"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City\" is probably the most important book that I have ever read!!! If you are to read one non-fiction book this year it should probably be this book!!! This should be required reading in high school! I learned about poverty and poor renters, the eviction process, and scumbag landlords.This book is about 8 families in Milwaukee. These are both Caucasian and African American families. The book is broken down into 3 parts. They are real life stories. These stories are so unbelievable that they read like fiction. I cannot do this book justice. The reason I read it was because of my friend Shelby. She wrote a phenomenal review. Here it is. Please check it out:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... Many of these families were spending up to 80 percent of their income just on rent! This left little money for anything else. The system was meant for families to spend up to 30 percent of their income on rent. It's truly unbelievable and eye opening!I listened to the audio version. I would say the narration is about 4 Stars. I wish there were two narrators instead of one. The different voices all started sounding the same after awhile. In all fairness, this is a tough book for a narrator to tackle and when he was telling the story and not doing the individual voices he did a great job. The one character I identified with the most was Scott. I think it's because he made me realize this could happen to me. Scott was making 80k a year as a nurse at one point but became addicted to pain killers and then his life spirals down from there into harder drugs and homelessness. Although there is hope for him, I'm not giving spoilers so you are going to have to read the book to find out what happens to him. His story made me realize this could happen to anybody! Even if you have never been part of the welfare system you can still end up homeless.This is not a happy book but it is a very important one!!! The author is Sociologist, Matthew Desmond, and he is an amazing person, too. Please read this book and tell your friends about it. There needs to be changes made to the welfare system in the United States. People should not be living in filth and squalor like this with little chance of moving up. Children should not be shuffled around from school to school, either. The author suggests a universal housing voucher program made cost efficient. We need change in the United States and we need it now!"}, {"userName": "Roxane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane", "userReview": "The brutal truth of poverty in America is far more devastating than any fiction ever could be. In evicted, Matthew Desmond brings rigorous sociological research and ethnography to Milwaukee's inner city. This book is painful and necessary and eye opening. I am ashamed of how little I knew about poverty and eviction. This book is fucking depressing and hopeless and excellent. We have got to do better. Also the segregation! And racist ass Ned who made his biracial stepdaughters say \"white power\" while their mom hoped it wouldn't scar them. What???"}, {"userName": "Carol. ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol", "userReview": "It is no surprise that \"Evicted\" was the University Wisconsin-Madison's Go Big Red book read for 2016, a book chosen by the chancellor and worked into campus-wide discussions and events. Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it examines the lives of a number of people who deal with eviction and the property owners. To those outside the state, it might be less obvious how state politics have played into the background of many of the people in Evicted but suffice to say, the once-independent State of Wisconsin has fallen on conservative and judgemental times.At any rate, for non-fiction book littered with references, it is extremely readable. Done in a more ethnographic style, it reminds me of Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. Read these two back-to-back and I will  guarantee you will go to bed thankful. Like Enrich, Desmond tried to 'walk the talk' by living in the trailer park he writes about by renting and living close to the subjects of the book, and by tailing the landlords as much as possible. The last chapter of the book before the footnotes is an 'About the Project' section that details his own history, his goals and his structure in writing the book. I actually think it should be the first chapter, as it lends explanation and context to his sources and the style of writing. For those who might be scared off by the voluminous footnotes, I recommend peeking at them-many are actually commentary or elaborations on some of the personal details. Definitely not one I would have wanted to read on Kindle.Unlike Nickel and Dimed, much of Desmond's material will be controversial, perhaps only serving to reinforce stereotypes about poor people. In some ways, perhaps, this might be one of those books that says just about as much about the reviewer as the subject. Being entirely honest with ourselves is hard, right?, and it's easy to judge many of the people in the book. Issue one, the simple one: people without resources have high stakes and no cushion when they indulge or make mistakes--as we all do. For instance, I have a fat pile of COBRA paperwork waiting for me to read through it, and recently I spent $50 on chocolates for gifts for my personal references. If I didn't deal with the COBRA paperwork, I'd probably be fine (unless I got in a traumatic car wreck), because I have prescriptions stocked, generally good health, financial resources and a job that will cover me in a month. If a person in Evicted forgets to attend a caseworker appointment or forgets to file a change-of-address, they're screwed, because they will get no food stamps that month and have no saved resources to cushion them (how can you save money when you only have $40 extra dollars a month) Desmond does a decent job of making the costs of human indulgences clear, showing that the disabled, dishonorably discharged vet has exactly $40 dollars a month after rent, or that eating a lobster tail dinner means a month of ramen noodles. Issue two, the complex one: One of the most BRILLIANT and amazing things I've read this year was an interview with Bruce Perry, psychologist about the long-lasting effects of childhood trauma. Read it: here The essay talks quite a bit about what kind of constant physiological stress that does to the human brain, and how it changes learning and relationships. Physiological stress can result in more (or even less) reactive brain than one that has only smaller, more intermittent amounts of stress (leading to the million-dollar question of how to we teach resilience?) A body that is always on alert because of safety issues, or a body that is always hungry is not one that will be in an environment of optimal function. You see where I'm going with this? A majority of people in this story sprung from poverty. They were born into it, had their brains wired by it, their coping skills and expectations structured by it. They were set up to 'fail' by traditional society. Patricia's kids, the ones who are sharing a mattress on the floor in the living room? Probably not going to be doctors and own the latest McMansion. Not because they aren't capable of it, but their ongoing circumstances are going to continue to set them up to fail (changing schools every time they move, missing school due to issues with housing/resources, stress caused by having to find new housing every six months, the violence in the places they live, the lack of trustworthy relationships built where they live--because how can you build them when you keep moving?), and thus the cycle continues. Desmond actually demonstrates impaired coping from ongoing stress when he shows how Arleen initially tries to deal with Crystal's generous but irrational moods and how Arleen eventually responds from a place of stress, anger and pride that makes the housing situation even worse. I'd even argue that Arleen was never set up to succeed in the first place from her childhood.Issue three, the other complex one: addiction, that ongoing, ever-present itch. People will argue that heroin is a 'worse' addiction. I don't know; you live long enough, you see addictions come in waves, like fads. Meth was the rage in Wisconsin about ten years back. Heroin is the hot drug these days. Scott is the poster child for addiction in this book, a former nurse who got caught using and spiraled down. You know how many sanctions are applied quarterly to nurses who use some kind of substance? I'd say over a hundred, at least. WI Department of Regulation publishes a list of nurse sanctions and addiction-related issues are by far the most common (alcohol and drugs). This is a horribly complex issue, and though Scott manages to rally after eviction, he falls again. Now he's straight (at the moment), thanks to a supportive recovering-addicts residential housing program that also employs him. You want to know about the homeless I meet? Frequently addicts of some sort. There are housing programs and shelters, but you have to be sober to get in, or stay sober for long-term housing, and many addicts aren't willing to leave their addiction. There aren't good answers for this one. The trailer park Desmond lives in shows a little what a group of addicts living together must be like, how one of the residents goes door to door looking for a fix and knows he'll find it.Issue four, the last complex one: mental illness. Way back in Reagan era (haha, I know you kids don't remember that), there was a huge movement to 'de-institutionalize' people with severe mental illness. There are reasons for and against, but the upshot is that each community has to deal with how to care for a population that may not be able to adequately care for itself. An excellent article gives some of the facts and figures that my own experience has demonstrated. I'd say about half of the people I've had to take care of with schizophrenia have stopped taking their medication, which is part of what lands them in the hospital. It's a well-known and vicious cycle (for people who are able to get access to medication): meds make people feel better and in control, so they decide to stop the meds because they are feeling so great. OR, the medications make people feel shittier, so they stop taking them. Either way, the result is uncontrolled mental illness. Desmond has a poster-child for this one too, Crystal, who despite a consistent SSDI check and support from her faith community, frequently ends up evicted due to fighting with other tenants.What is less easy to see is how many of the people in the book are political pawns. Newly imposed trailer park management and local police response to 'nuisance' properties show how political stances have real and unintended consequences contributing to eviction. The City of Madison was dealing with this in the past several years as well, finally forcing one of the local 'slumlords' into cleaning up his properties that resulted in many being placed on the market. He--like landlords in the book--argued he was providing housing for people too poor to rent elsewhere, unable to get housing due to criminal history or prior evictions latest story. All of that said, somehow the slumlords have squeezed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of their properties (I think the Madison one has a portfolio of over SIX million dollars, much like the trailer park owner in Evicted) while letting the tenants live in conditions you'd be furious to see at the local shelter.Desmond has a few suggestions. First, is more research, because good policies should be informed by reality. His studies were one of the few looking at eviction and poverty. More documentation should be done on it's effects in the neighborhood and on longer lasting effects. He mentions people who are evicted end up having higher levels of material hardships for up to two years after eviction. His immediate suggestion is better court advocates and legal aid (which is being cut) for those facing eviction so that they can help prevent evictions and further needless homelessness. His ethical suggestion is that we recognize housing as a basic human right, not a mechanism of exploitation. As I mentioned in my own Madison example, while the slumlords may claim they are providing at least some kind of housing, they aren't doing it as a public service. His solution is expanding housing vouchers for all low-income families, not just a small number--are eligible for a voucher that can be used for anywhere that is \"decent, modest and fairly priced.\" I'm not sure Desmond is recognizing the things he experienced with Sherrena the landlord commenting on how taking voucher families was a pain because the buildings had to be up to code. This is the part where I also think he is ignoring the roles that addiction and mental illness play in housing as well. Still, he's offering something as a solution, and in an area that has the potential to negatively impact both individuals and communities, it's worth trying a solution or three or twenty til we can get it right. Overall, an excellent book that provides much information for consideration and discussion. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy", "userReview": "I recalled that last year that author Roxane Gay was asked what was \"the last book that made you furious?\" She said: \"'Evicted,' by Matthew Desmond. My God, what that book lays bare about American poverty. It is devastating and infuriating and a necessary read.\" So true. (I continue to think this book says oodles more than Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis about poverty, class, and the American Dream.) I try to remember to sing this last stanza of Pretty Boy Floyd, the song by Woody Guthrie, the week we work on poverty in Introductory Sociology:Yes, as through this world I've wanderedI've seen lots of funny men;Some will rob you with a six-gun,And some with a fountain pen.And as through your life you travel,Yes, as through your life you roam,You won't never see an outlawDrive a family from their home.Often this shocks students to consider the inhumane way we regularly treat each other, and that the \"it's just business\" attitude can drive many families into homelessness and shelter living. The lyrics focus us on the nature of criminality, and whether acts are ethical even if legal, etc..The best type of qualitative, sociological analysis, Desmond tugs at our heartstrings until we ache with relentless story after story of people who are evicted from their homes. Having a secure place to live provides us with human dignity, and most developed countries guarantee a place to stay by virtue of the fact of being a member of that society. Not so in the wealthiest country in the world. In the US, we can still remember Ronald Reagan with his arm around a homeless man, agreeing with him that most people who are homeless choose to be so. We tend to blame people for their own circumstances quite resolutely. The cover is this book is powerful enough. Indeed, I had it several days before realizing the picture was one of a wall of vacated home, showing the lighter places once pictures were taken off their hooks. I had a number of students star at the book cover as it was here on my desk for quite a while, and they often asked about the picture, also slow to recognize it. Our hesitancy to come to recognize and come to grips with the pain of a family, often, losing a home speaks volumes in itself. Desmond brings us into the lives of many in Milwaukee during the time directly after the '08 crash and in the midst of the major home foreclosure crisis, and while he garners some sympathy for landlords, who reasonable only want to get paid for rent, what is clear is that no one can live a productive much less meaningful life while worrying how to provide shelter for yourself and your family.I was reminded of Michael Moore's lament that increasingly the working class became \"the Man\", the landlord, as Rustbelt workers with good-paying jobs through the 70s rented out basement apartments and invested in rental real estate. Moore claimed this further separated the psychological perspectives as well as the actual living circumstances of the working poor (renters) from the lower middle class (increasingly landlords themselves.)Please let me end with Hana's great review of Chain of Title: How Three Ordinary Americans Uncovered Wall Street's Great Foreclosure Fraud that you can find here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... it is horrifying to learn that Trump has just appointed Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary, who personally benefited from the corruption of the foreclosure crisis in California. In the US, we must be vigilant with ongoing \"crony capitalism\" that continues to gather the wealth of the 99%. More and more I'm reminded of that old saying by Mellon the capitalist that it's during economic downturns when money flows back to its' rightful owners."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Many thanks to my local friend- Cindy - for putting this book in my hands.  WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE\u201cSherrena and Quentin always planned their vacations so that they were back before the first the month, when their days went long with eviction notices to pass out, new moves to manage, and rents to collect. Because most of their tenants didn\u2019t have bank accounts, collecting rent was a face-to-face affair\u201d. \u201cWhen Sheriff John walked into a house and saw mattresses on the floor, grease on the ceiling, cockroaches on the wall, and clothes, hair extensions, and toys scattered about, he didn\u2019t double-check. Sometimes tenants had already abandoned the place, leaving behind dead animals and rotting food. Sometimes the movers puked. The first rule of evictions, Sheriff John like to say, is never open the fridge. When things were especially bad, when an apartment was covered in trash or dog shit, or when one of the guys would find a needle, Dave would nod and say \u2018Junk in\u2019, leaving the mess for the landlord\u201d. \u201cArleen\u2019s children did not always have food. Arlene was not always able to offer them stability; stability cost too much. She was not always able to protect them from dangerous streets; those streets were her streets. Arleen sacrifice for her boys, feed them the best she could, clothed them with what she had. When they wanted more than she could give, she had ways, some subtle, others not, of telling them they didn\u2019t deserve it. When Jori wanted something most teenagers wanted, new shoes or a hair products, she would tell him he was selfish, or just bad\u201d. \u201cThe Hinkstons expected more from their landlord for the money they were paying her. Rent was their biggest expense by far, and they wanted a decent functional home in return. They wanted things to be fixed when they broke. But if Sherrena wasn\u2019t going to repair her own property, neither were they. The house failed the tenants, and the tenants failed the house\u201d. While my heartstrings were being pulled - yanked & twisted .....my mind was in a tug-a-war. Poverty in America is horrendous....sad....ugly....and real. The stories in this book made it clear - families are living in filth, families are hungry, they are being uplifted time and time again - ( the poor innocent children: breaks your heart).

Within these pages, the business and culture of evictions is dissected down to the very dollars and cents that uphold this thriving industry. The judicial system and the role it plays is scrutinized, and the lives of 8 families are put on intimate display for readers to bear witness to. Within the pages of Eviction, Desmond paints a clandestine portrait of the precarious lives of those living at and below the poverty line in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the time of his research. The survey into this little-known world is done first hand, with the aid of a tape recorder, and thus is the most personal and complete look at modern American poverty that I have read in a long time. Here, readers will follow the desolate, the addicted, the impoverished and the \u201clords\u201d who shape their lives in these dangerous and volatile social environments called homes. This book unveiled some of the most stunningly accurate vernacular and dialogue that I have seen anywhere, non-fiction or fiction. (Note to self: if you want to really capture the essence of a culture, use a tape recorder.) With this simple technique, Desmond was able to capture the true personification of the frustration and despair, of their interactions and intentions, and, hence, the dialogue told a story all of its own within these pages. It told a story of where these people came from and how they truly related to one another on a human level. He captured the true swag of these neighborhoods, the soul and essence that can\u2019t be seen at first passing glance out of a car window. The research in Evicted was expertly incorporated so that it read as fluidly in narrative as a fiction novel, and it was incorporated throughout, which was great, because it allowed the reader to absorb the information with illustrations of narration to make it easier and faster to digest. It also allowed for a read that wasn\u2019t leaden with factoids, reading like a dry and tedious text book. The lives he chose to chronicle and exhibit were harrowing and demonstrative of humanity\u2019s capacity to fail and to survive, to overcome and to find comfort in community. It also pulled back the curtains on this booming industry that both exploits the poor and treats them as expendable members of society. In Evicted, Desmond dissected a truth that goes back to the Civil Rights Movement when Fair Housing laws were enacted. Stirring and emotional, this read holds a shiny mirror to the face of America. Similar to the PIC (Prison Industrial Complex) the eviction process, nay culture, is a vicious and debilitating cycle with ripple effects into communities. This expos\u00e9 displayed how crime and evictions go hand-in-hand, each leading to the other with alarming frequency, a form of institutionalized parasitism on the poor at the hands of the judicial system and slum lords (in the instances where there are, in fact, slum lords). Here, Desmond portrays both the crimes that lead to evictions and the evictions that foster a bed of crimes. This work really appealed to me when I read its blurb, and it did not disappoint. It was not a traumatically graphic read, but it was all consuming. Vignette after vignette portrayed the mental and emotional anguish that living at the poverty line heaps on it dwellers so that the only reprieve came in the form of spirited dialogue and intimate conversations between those he chronicled and their family and friends and from the research that clarified the stats behind their suffering, which was interspersed throughout. Other than that, there was no reprieve from the grief, struggling and suffering and, in a way, I think that that was not only the point of this read but, in many ways, an intellectual profit to the reader. Within these pages, those who could never in their own everyday lives imagine such hardships will be transported over the imaginary line that exists in all cities: the line between the haves and the have nots. That is a line that everyone should cross at some time, so pick up this read preparing to take a journey. Evicted gained itself a strong 4 stars. ***** I received a copy of Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City from the publisher, Crown, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.The Navi Review | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Wow, this is a powerful look at what it means to be poor in America. The book follows eight families in the Milwaukee area, all facing eviction problems. Some of the families are white, some are black, some have children. All of them struggled to pay the monthly rent, which seemed ridiculously high for the broken-down places they got. Families have watched their incomes stagnate, or even fall, while their housing costs have soared. Today, the majority of poor renting families in America spend over half of their income on housing, and at least one in four dedicates 70 percent to paying the rent and keeping the lights on. Millions of Americans are evicted every year because they can't make rent.Matthew Desmond, who is a sociology professor at Harvard, spent time living among the families and following their routines. He also interviewed and followed two landlords. His research and writing took years, and it shows in the quality of his work.I listened to this book on audio, but I'm glad I had a print copy to refer to because there were dozens of amazing passages I marked. There were things in this book that made me gasp in shock. Several times I swore at the injustice of it all.* In the end, Desmond offers some possible solutions to improve the housing and eviction problems in this country. Evicted reminded me of two other great books about class and poverty: Nickel and Dimed by Barbara Ehrereich, in which she sees how challenging it is to work and survive on minimum wages; and Behind the Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo, which follows poor families in a slum in Mumbai. Evicted is a worthy addition to the research on poverty, and I highly recommend it.*What Made Me AngryI'm going to rant a little about some of the issues I learned from this book. One part that made me drop the F-bomb because I couldn't believe the insanity of it, was how tenants in the inner city can actually be penalized and evicted if they call 911 \"too many times.\" In this book, a young woman named Crystal hears a neighbor woman being beaten by her boyfriend, and Crystal calls 911. But the Milwaukee Police determine that too many 911 calls have come from Crystal's apartment, and they notify the landlord (in this paragraph I'll call her a slumlord, since she exploited her tenants and did next to nothing to make the urban properties livable). The slumlord tells police she'll evict the tenants, which is eventually what happens. Desmond says this problem happens ALL THE TIME. He says battered women face a devil's bargain: \"Keep quiet and face abuse, or call the police and face eviction.\" What. The. Fuck. Oh! I almost forgot the most enraging part. At one point, the Milwaukee police chief held a news conference to address the high number of women who've been killed in domestic violence incidents, and he expresses disbelief at how few of the victims contacted the police department. You've got to be fucking kidding me. Guy, it's your department's own backward policies that are helping to kill those women!I was also furious about how the slumlords exploited their impoverished tenants, and refused to invest any money in the properties to make them livable. It was deplorable behavior. And the fact that the slumlords claim they're helping the tenants, and trying to do good in the neighborhood, is seriously questionable.There was also an eye-opening section on the \"poverty mentality,\" and how those who are deeply impoverished aren't necessarily poor because they throw money away, but they throw money away because they are poor. Those in deep poverty lack hope that their situation will ever improve. Their argument is: What's the point of saving a few dollars by denying myself a few luxuries (such as cable TV, or a nice dinner) if I'm always going to be broke, and always struggling to make the rent? They're trying to live \"in color\" for just a little bit. Of course, it's easy for those of us with a financial safety net and loved ones who could help us in times of trouble to look down on those at the bottom and frown on them. But unless you've been so low that you have no hope for tomorrow, it's difficult to judge those in deep despair.Great Passages\"Evictions... [embroil] not only landlord and tenants but also kin and friends, lovers and ex-lovers, judges and lawyers, dope suppliers and church elders. Eviction's fallout is severe. Losing a home sends families to shelters, abandoned houses, and the street. It invites depression and illness, compels families to move into degrading housing in dangerous neighborhoods, uproots communities, and harms children. Eviction reveals people's vulnerability and desperation, as well as their ingenuity and guts.\"\"If incarceration had come to define the lives of men from impoverished black neighborhoods, eviction was shaping the lives of women. Poor black men were locked up. Poor black women were locked out.\"\"It was next to impossible for people to survive deep poverty on their own. If you could not rely on your family, you could reach out to strangers, make disposable ties. But it was a lot to ask of someone you barely knew.\"\"There was always something worse than the trailer park, always room to drop lower.\"\"Substandard housing was a blow to your psychological health: not only because things like dampness, mold, and overcrowding could bring about depression but also because of what living in awful conditions told you about yourself.\"\"Poverty could pile on; living it often meant steering through gnarled thickets of interconnected misfortunes and trying not to go crazy. There were moments of calm, but life on balance was facing one crisis after another.\"\"The home is the center of life. It is a refuge from the grind of work, the pressure of school, and the menace of the streets. We say that at home, we can 'be ourselves.\" Everywhere else, we are someone else. At home, we remove our masks.\"\"The persistence and brutality of American poverty can be disheartening, leaving us cynical about solutions.

After reading Evicted I was left with one reaction . . . \nIf you really want to provide yourself a justifiable excuse to hate the human race, this is the book for you. Evicted follows the lives of several people living in poverty and trying (or not, as the case may be) to get ahead. From Sharrena \u2013 the slumlord, to her tenants Lamar \u2013 a man who lost his legs when they froze while he was high, and Arleen \u2013 a woman who already lost children to the system, but is trying to hold on to her two youngest, to Tobin \u2013 the owner of a trailer park and Lenny \u2013 the \u201cproperty manager\u201d of sorts, to Scott \u2013 a former nurse who got addicted to drugs and couldn\u2019t stop the downward spiral, to Larraine \u2013 the resident looney tune of the park. Matthew Desmond immersed himself into the lives of these people \u2013 living with them rather than just conducting a few interviews and going back to his comfortable lifestyle. The story he presents is one that reads like a novel rather than non-fiction. Filled with dialogue and experiences rather than statistics it was a truly un-put-down-able read and it allowed me the opportunity to confirm what I\u2019ve known for quite some time now . . . \nEvery single person in this story was despicable in at least one way, shape or form and made it impossible to ever really feel sorry for them. You want to side with the landlord who is getting screwed over by tenants who don\u2019t pay the rent, but manage to buy dope, smokes and booze \u2013 but at the same time you want to kick her ass for charging people to live in uninhabitable conditions (literally, a house she was charging $600+ for was CONDEMNED). You also want to feel for the mother who has $20 left to her name after paying rent \u2013 until she opens her mouth and proves she believes she is owed something for doing nothing and takes advantage over and over again of ANY generosity shown to her. You feel for Larraine, because obviously she is in need of some mental health services \u2013 until she becomes one of the oldest clich\u00e9s in the history of the food stamp recipient who spends her entire month\u2019s sum on one lobster and king crab dinner. I could go on and on . . . \nThe lesson to be learned here is glaringly obvious. The system is broken. It\u2019s been broken since the Five Points were built in the 1800s and it\u2019s not getting any better. Evicted didn\u2019t spend time getting preachy or even offering up more than a couple of suggestions on how to potentially relieve some of the pressure on the impoverished.

He gave them rides to look for houses, he even loaned them small amounts of money at times. He admits that he misses living in the trailer park among them. This book. I hope more people get it and read it. I've been on a \"smart book\" kick lately and I've starred them all pretty highly but this one is just amazing. Desmond knocks it out of the ballpark. You can tell he puts his whole heart into telling these stories.Now the stories..they are real people: You have to keep reminding yourself of that as you read this book because no one is perfect, they all mess up and the writing is so good that you feel like you are just reading a really good work of fiction.Set in Milwaukee, he tells the stories of families.Lamar, who has no legs. Takes in all his \"boys\" from the neighborhood and they work to help him just try and get ahead.Scott, a nurse from the trailer park. He gets addicted to drugs and ends up homeless because he can't see past the addiction and feels so overwhelmed with all that he would have to do in order to just get clean and hopefully get his nursing license back.Scott had gotten high with Pam and Ned shortly before they received their eviction notice and had moved in a hurry. Scott figured they had gotten what was coming to them. In his old life, before the fall, he might have been more sympathetic. But he had come to view sympathy as a kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9, a sentiment voiced from a certain distance by the callow middle classes. \"They can be compassionate because it's not their only option,\" he said of liberals who didn't live in trailer parks.Vanetta, she is waiting on her court case because she and a friend robbed some women at gunpoint because she needs to support her children.Sherrena and her husband, landlords in the ghetto. They get frustrated with the people they rent to and sometimes try and help but it's a vicious circle. They feel like the people they try to help just want to take and take. They don't want to have to spend out the money to fix anything in their properties because why bother? It's just going to get destroyed again.Tobin, runs a shabby run down trailer park. He doesn't have time to listen to excuses. Just give him the money.Arleen, she had lost her older children to foster care and is struggling to hold on to her remaining two but it seems like the odds are always stacked against this woman. She broke my heart. It seemed like when things would go well for her that it was just a matter of time. When Jori wanted something most teenagers want, new shoes or a hair product, she would tell him he was selfish or just bad. When Jafaris cried, Arleen sometimes yelled, \"Damn, you hardheaded. Dry yo' face up!\" or \"Stop it, Jafaris, before I beat yo' ass! I'm tired of your bitch ass.\"You could only say \"I'm sorry, I can't\" so many times before you began to feel worthless, edging closer to the breaking point. So you protected yourself, in a reflexive way, by finding ways to say \"No, I won't. I cannot help you.\" So, I will find you unworthy of help.Larraine, she frustrates the people around her with her inability to manage what little money she does get. \"My aunt Larraine is one of those people who will see some two-hundred-dollar beauty cream that removes her wrinkles and will go and buy it instead of paying her rent.\"To Sammy, Pastor Daryl, and others, Larraine was poor because she threw money away. But the reverse was true. Larraine threw money away because she was poor.This book gives perspective. We need some changes in welfare reform.

A beautifully written and involving set of individual family case studies, this sociological work casts light on a problem that has developed over time and has not been well understood to date.Desmond is able to involve his readers in the lives of the people he describes in Milwaukee, Wisconsin because he includes many details of their circumstances which we may recognize. The decision-making and determination of these folks to get out of the cycle of eviction they face is not flawed. They work with imperfect tools and face a constantly renewing mountain to climb starting from a new lower low with each instance of rent non-payment and subsequent eviction.Addiction doesn\u2019t appear to be the most common cause of eviction, at least among the people whose stories Desmond shares with us, though it does figure in the lives of many families he describes. Lending money to addicts is a constant drain on everyone\u2019s scarce resources. Neither does wild over-spending appear to be a common cause of poverty. Desmond will argue that wild overspending on inappropriate items is a result of poverty, not a cause.Hard as it is for us to admit, exploitation by landlords appears to contribute hugely to reasons low-income tenants cannot be free from the cycle of eviction. The slumlords to whom Desmond introduces us extract outsized profits from very low-end housing without necessary inputs like plumbing, painting, repairs. This leads to families not valuing their abode, children being placed in unsafe conditions, and adds to the burdens of rent-payers.Recognizing that renting out housing at the low end of the market is not a charity, we must still condemn excessive profit at the client\u2019s expense. What are excessive profits? If these notions are not universally recognized, they need to be challenged in court. Desmond points out that most tenants facing eviction do not show up in court to challenge charges against them or to raise property maintenance issues. These huge, messy problems involve individuals with extenuating circumstances. Sometimes the problems appear circular, and insoluble.Desmond will argue that housing should be considered a basic human right, like clean drinking water, protection for elders, and universal education. Desmond\u2019s proposal may cause catalepsy among libertarians. Conservatives for small government might agree, however, that we don\u2019t want to live in a country where people are living and/or dying on the streets, unable to free themselves from a cycle of dependence. I think we all can agree with that. The question remains: what is the best way to evict people from poverty?Desmond suggests a universal voucher for all low-income families in his epilogue, but I won\u2019t repeat his argument here. You need all the pieces to make sense of what he is proposing. It helps to see the scope of the problem by reading the book\u2014no hardship because it is so well written\u2014but you can also just go to the Epilogue. I do want to point to a couple of interesting observations he makes earlier regarding fixes made so far to address poverty and homelessness but which developed unexpected consequences.People using vouchers are allowed to use those vouchers in any community in states that accept vouchers, which means low-income renters could try to escape the inner city which can be dangerous and unkempt. However, prospective tenants often encounter a reluctance on the part of landlords to rent to families with children, pets, or smoking habits. Renters themselves don\u2019t like the greater adherence to immutable rules that are common in more upscale locations, and the lack of leniency in the case of under-payments.Currently landlords in low-income housing areas do not want to accept housing vouchers and rent assistance in most of their properties because \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to deal with the program's picky inspectors.\u201d There are legal limits to the degradation on a property which accepts government-issued vouchers. This is true everywhere, but those on housing assistance get checked on. This \u201cgovernment interference\u201d some conservatives (and slumlords) decry. So much for the market policing itself.The option of \u201cworking off the rent\u201d is only taken advantage of by male tenants, Desmond found. This option should have appeared more possible for women as well, it seems, but it parallels the phenomenon of exchanging sex for rent which appears to be an exclusively a female option. Desmond did not encounter this among his interviewees.Among interviewees who were evicted, few felt pity for others in similar circumstances: they often felt \u201cit was their own fault\u201d for unsound choices they\u2019d made and were disinclined to help. This included Christians and church-going neighbors, though examples of times they\u2019d helped in the past were evident. Evicted tenants were reluctant to ask family, or were refused if asked.This is one problem among many in this country. The world is changing utterly, and fast. We need to fundamentally rethink how we want business and government to run going forward. Looking back nostalgically is the wrong solution, I am convinced. Perhaps something like an offer for free college but also a requirement for national service could be brainstormed. If we sent youth out to be witnesses in these problem areas, have them suggest & develop solutions, and follow through, e.g., gaining new skills building better housing, repairing old housing stock, using their legal skills attending law court for strapped tenants, I think both sides might get something from the experience. Sociologists, finance, nursing, social welfare, law, teachers...everybody has something to offer those without resources. One of the most heartbreaking results of this cycle of evictions is its effect on the children. Trying to round up the children for schooling each day when they have been displaced so many times--we know how difficult that would be. Some of the children are watching a parent hauled off for doing something illegal under pressure to round up enough cash to keep themselves housed. Violence explodes suddenly and cannot be controlled. The children need more attention, and protection.The problems that befall individuals and families are inconceivable to those among us without similar constraints. Religious groups could ramp up their services and showcase their empathy and yet not feel as though they were laboring alone in the wilderness. We can see how that has impacted their outreach in the past.Does it make any difference if low-income people live among wealthier neighbors? I believe it could allow them to see how others live, what other choices and opportunities are out there, and allow them to get help from neighbors in the normal way we all do. Dilution of the problem\u2014is it coercive if we eliminate \u201clow-income\u201d housing altogether?

Rodeo.Super interesting and frustrating and appalling and unbelievable and believable and terrifying and infuriating and heartbreaking and......well, you get the idea. The first part of this Pulitzer Prize-winning book brings together a handful of characters (landlords and tenants) in a poor Milwaukee neighborhood and tells their stories - what brought them to where they are, what keeps them stuck in poverty, what options (if any) they have. Desmond does a really good job of choosing his characters - there's a good variety of circumstances and personalities that give the stories life and heart. No one is all bad or all wrong, and no one is all good or all right. The next part of the book, after the stories have been told, is called \"Epilogue\" and offers facts and statistics about housing and offers some solutions. I'll be honest, this was pretty dry. The next part of the book was fascinating - called \"About This Project,\" the author reveals that he implanted himself in this Milwaukee neighborhood and lived amongst his landlords and tenants for a year to gather their stories and study their plight. Finally, there is 60 pages of footnotes that provide the studies, data and details behind the scenes.It's a scholarly piece of literature with a big, heavy heart. I don't know how this situation, in reality, can ever be fixed given the current state of US politics. All we do is argue, accuse, rant and point fingers - the collaboration and bipartisan cooperation that would have to occur to implement real solutions in our cities will probably never happen in my lifetime.

As rents increase where property values stagnate or decline, the poorest have to spend 70-90% of their income on housing. With such a small margin of income, a single crisis - illness, car crash, emergency repairs - can send the residents into eviction. Once that happens, it becomes exponentially harder to get housing anywhere else. This is not only a book of statistics - it follows the stories of a few families as they struggle to survive. You want desperately for them to get better. To get clean, to have a landlord call them back, to get a real job.

It helps, too, that Desmond is never heavy-handed in the way he delivers information. Yes, his point is to shed light on a particular social issue, but I never felt like he was taking sides or forcing his beliefs on me. He really lets the facts speak for themselves.And, truthfully, I don\u2019t think I had ever stopped to consider, as Desmond puts it, \u201chow deeply housing is implicated in the creation of poverty.\u201d He says, \u201cNot everyone living in a distressed neighborhood is associated with gang members, parole officers, employers, social workers, or pastors.

It\u2019s immersive sociological reporting at its finest\u2014at the height of the recession, Matthew Desmond moved into some of the poorest sections of Milwaukee and immersed himself in the lives of the people who had little choice but to live there. He tells the stories of the tenants and the landlords in their own voices, with such clarity and precision that it\u2019s almost easy to forget that this is not a novel. This is real life, and it\u2019s an incredibly important work. The truth is that poverty, homelessness, and the constant threat of eviction are issues that are nearly impossible to understand unless you\u2019ve been there yourself and too many of the people making policies on these topics fail to grasp the realities of poverty. I think particularly of a piece on poverty by Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2014he was trying to point out the ways in which the welfare system is abused by saying that more than 90% of people below the poverty line have refrigerators. And all I could think was even the shittiest apartments I\u2019ve ever seen have come with a refrigerator. Just because someone is renting an apartment with a refrigerator does not mean they bought the refrigerator.. How can you criticize the poor\u2014let alone help them\u2014if you don\u2019t have even the most basic understanding of poverty? Before I got my MA in English and started working in books, I was actually a psychology major. When I told the internship supervisor at my high school what I was thinking about studying in college, she suggested that I do my internship at a residential homeless shelter nearby. And even though I ultimately decided I didn\u2019t have what it takes to work in a field like that, my semester there was a real eye-opener. The thing that stuck with me the most was how easy it was to become homeless due to even one small setback and how hard it was to climb back out of it and stay out of it for good. A man came to us because a back surgery depleted his bank account and cost him his job. Several women arrived because they left an abusive partner and had nowhere else to turn. Several had lost everything to an addiction they were battling to keep under control. Too many were simply unable to find or hold onto a job for long enough to pay rent--sometimes they were irresponsible, but sometimes they were just unfortunate. Desmond has filled this book with similar stories. His subjects run the gamut: a nurse who lost everything to an addiction to the opioids he used to battle chronic pain and grief, the no-nonsense manager of a trailer park, a single mother spending as much as 80% of her meager welfare check on rent for an apartment with no functional plumbing, the slumlord who evicts the family a few days before Christmas after one too many second chances, a man with no legs who performs various maintenance duties for his landlord in an attempt to reduce the amount of back rent he owes, a woman who spend every extra penny she manages to scrounge up on luxuries you might deem unnecessary \u2013 the proverbial lobster dinner on food stamps. (Side note: I appreciate that Desmond points out why people in abject poverty will sometimes engage in spending habits that drive outsiders insane, which is also something that I\u2019ve seen many, many, many times in my own life: if you so rarely have an extra $100 lying around that its occasional presence is notable, you don\u2019t expect that you\u2019ll ever be able to save enough to amount to anything so you figure why not spend it on something that it going to make things just a little brighter, even for the length on a lobster dinner? I know that\u2019s a sticking point for so many people who are opposed to public assistance programs. I get why it\u2019s so frustrating\u2014but I also get why people using public assistance do things like that.)Desmond doesn\u2019t too much time advocating for a particular solution, but his epilogue argues for increasing the reach of housing vouchers and suggests that he\u2019d be in favor of programs like the one that Utah has used in recent years to make drastic reductions in their homeless numbers: Surprise\u2014housing the chronically homeless costs the state less than when they\u2019re on the street. Even bigger surprise\u2014once they have a home, they are more able to focus on solving the problems that contributed to their homelessness in the first place and they\u2019re more likely to get off the public assistance that wasn\u2019t assisting them all that much to begin with. Anyway, this is a phenomenally well-researched, well-written book that is going to make you angry. You\u2019re going to be angry at the tenants who make bad choices, angry at the landlords who won\u2019t make repairs because they know they can serve eviction papers and someone else will pay for substandard housing, angry at the system that allows these situations to perpetuate. It can sometimes be hard to keep the many stories straight, but Desmond doesn\u2019t bog his reader down with too many numbers (his stats and methodology are included in the extensive notes and the epilogue). For such a big book, it\u2019s an easy read.

The so-called \u201cfamilies\u201d are distended making it hard to get a grip on them. Their stories are not related one by one, but all mixed together which leads to confusion. I did not feel for these individuals nor their plight. I empathized with none of them, in fact they annoyed me. All of them had been dealt a bad hand in the card game of life, but they could not possibly be viewed as guiltless innocents either. They had made seriously poor choices.

Matthew Desmond ends the book by revealing the vast reporting and research he put into Evicted, as well as by suggesting effective and tangible strategies to combat poverty and income inequality within the United States.I would recommend this book to everyone. It disturbs me to consider how the events in Evicted could happen to anyone if they had been born into more unfortunate circumstances. It is easy to blame poverty on poor people's \"lack of willpower\" or their \"laziness,\" but in reality it is our fault and our government's fault for not taking the steps to eradicate the societal factors that contribute to eviction and homelessness.

I was deeply touched, enlightened, profoundly depressed, and humbled by this work. Although I, as other Americans, are frequently exposed to statistics about poverty, these are but abstractions that only serve to reinforce the distance between the poor and the not (we can just make our donation to the Red Cross and feel like we've done our part). Unlike other academic books I've read on the subject, Desmond paints an intimate portrait of daily toils, constant crisis-mode, domestic violence, addiction, human dignity, familial and communal bonds, and other facets of poverty (in relation to evictions, homelessness, sub-standard housing). By presenting a human-focused perspective on poverty, Desmond's work adds depth to prior structural analyses, but more importantly, challenges current arguments that demonize the poor (i.e. \"the poor are lazy\" - not a statement I would have ever agreed with, but sadly, a common trope in current US political discourse).Chapters alternate between the trailer park and project housing, and include voices of both landlords and tenants, weaving a complex tapestry that is not limited by preconceptions (i.e. \"landlords are bad\"). For the most part, Desmond tells these families' stories, but there is also much to learn here (for those of us not versed in the matter) on housing policy in the US, and on the ways in which housing problems are inextricable from poverty. Desmond makes a strong case that a stable home is (or should be considered as) a basic human right, for a home is \"the center of life, the wellspring of personhood\", the place where civic life begins, \"allowing us to plant roots and take ownership over our community, participate in local politics and reach out to neighbors\".I highly recommend this book to all Americans, especially those who have never experienced poverty. --[For me, the revelations presented by Desmond were a powerful punch in the gut. For the past 6 years, I was the only white person living in my section 8 development in DC (I was provided a unit due to the teacher-fire-fighter-police exemption - I wanted to live in my school's neighborhood). In retrospect, I deprived someone else of housing. In retrospect, when I called the cops on the man beating his girlfriend in the apartment above me, I could have been responsible for their eviction. In retrospect, I had virtually no clue about anything, because, outside of the roaches and rats and raccoons, the poverty didn't seep through my doorway. I'm now in the suburbs (because a house here is about the same price as a closet in DC)-and wishing that I had read this, or had some clue, many more years ago.]* I won this book through the Goodreads Giveaways program - and I am so very grateful that I did, because I don't think I would have made it a priority otherwise. As it stands, this may be one of the most memorable and perspective-altering books I'll read all year."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Blankfein", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8904243-jennifer-blankfein", "userReview": "Visit https://booknationbyjen.wordpress.com for reviews and recommendations.Living paycheck to paycheck comes with ongoing pressures and struggles, but in Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, Matthew Desmond introduces us to the poorest of the poor, people lacking basic needs, food, clothing and shelter. The downward spiral is devastating and our system offers little hope for getting ahead. Simply stated, when tenants miss work to take care of their children, their pay is docked, and then, unable to afford food and ultimately rent, they get evicted. From homeless shelters to other dilapidated hovels or trailor parks where the landlord refuses to put money into repairs because tenants are not paying the rent, these people, highest percentage of them black women with children, are constantly struggling as they are thrown out on the streets.In order to write this book, the author immersed himself into the life of poverty as a tenant in Milwaukee where he studies the trends eviction play in our society. There are many contributors, government subsidized housing, food stamps, shelters, employement opportunities, education, drugs and crime, that all play a part in the successes and failures of the evicted.When speaking about the tenants:\u201cRent was their biggest expense by far, and they wanted a decent and functional home in return. They wanted things to be fixed when they broke. But if Sherenna wasn\u2019t going to repair her own property, neither were they. The house failed the tenants and the tenants failed the house.\u201dIn regard to the nearly hopeless situation for moms with kids searching for housing:\u201cIn 1980\u20261 in 4 rental units was available to families without restrictions (extra deposit and monthly surcharges per child). Eight years later Congress finally outlawed housing discrimination against children and families, but\u2026the practice remained widespread. Families with children were turned away in as many as 7 in 10 housing searches.\u201dBravo to Matthew Desmond for tackling this topic with tons of research. This extraordinarily brutal and honest book is winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and is a must read in order to understand eviction, the toll it takes on tenants in the downward spiral of poverty, the landlords\u2019 exploitation of the poor, and an economic system that is in desperate need of repair. Desperation leads to drastic measures for both renters and landlords and our system has not done enough to provide realistic options to protect and nurture human life."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "This book won the Pulitzer, and the National Book Critics Circle Award, and I can absolutely see why.

It's rare that a non-fiction book reads like a novel but Desmond does a terrific job here of keeping it readable though it's plenty real. The number of people evicted from their homes and jolted into the serious upheaval of losing their possessions and their security is shocking at over a million per year. I had to read the statistics a few times to even fathom such high numbers. The book should be read by everyone so we can be alerted to how broken the current welfare system is and how to some degree it effects us all.

Harvard sociologist Matthew Desmond spent months living in several different neighborhoods in Milwaukee's inner-city. This book focuses on a handful of people -- some white, some black, some single parents, some married with kids, some single -- who were all evicted during Desmond's time in the city. Desmond gives readers an extraordinarily balanced, though bleak, view of the situations. The landlords are not completely slumlords, and the renters are not saints. In that messy \"in-between\" the reader will need to come to his or her own conclusions about what is just and what is unacceptable. On a personal note, I will say that I listened to the majority of this book in the days after the 2016 Presidential Election. This is a somber, sobering book. The problems that exist seem enormous and intractable. I was already feeling despondent and, as a result, this book deepened that funk. While the topic in this book is incredibly important, I'd recommend saving it for a time when one has the mental energy to give this book its full due."}, {"userName": "JanB ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb", "userReview": "This is what poor looks like in America and it\u2019s not a pretty picture. There\u2019s no question we have a flawed system, and the cycle continues with no way out for those who are caught up in poverty and substandard living conditions. There are no heroes in this book, neither the tenants or the landlords. There are situations that will break your heart, and situations that will infuriate you. It\u2019s easy to judge the poor but unless we\u2019ve walked in their shoes I think we\u2019d do better to try and understand how and why it happens, and what we as a society can and should do to remedy the problem. The poor that are described in these pages have no safety net, no mentor, and no family support. It is literally impossible for them to escape. No one escapes poverty alone. The system is rigged against them, and, by far, the majority who end up evicted are women and children. They don\u2019t always make wise choices. But, still, even when I was angry or disgusted, I thought\u2026there but for the grace of God... The author, who is a sociologist, not only did research for this book, he actually lived among them. He didn\u2019t just interview them, he immersed himself in their lives. I didn\u2019t learn this until the epilogue and I wish I had known that beforehand. The epilogue was outstanding.Highly recommended. It certainly opened my mind - and my heart. And that's why it gets 5 stars. It should be required reading by everyone."}, {"userName": "abby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478099-abby", "userReview": "This recently won the Pulitzer, and it's well deserved. It's been a year since I read this, and it still sticks out in my mind as one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read.The one lesson I took away from this book above all else was that for everything I thought I knew about poverty in America, I actually knew very little.The rate of rent is becoming an epidemic, especially in low-income areas, and evictions have added to a cycle of poverty that seems impossible to escape. Having an eviction on your record limits the pool of landlords willing to rent to you, leaving you to the mercy of slumlords who charge above value rents for homes that often don't meet code. Evictions tend to multiply like the dust bunnies under the bed: once you have one, it's hard to avoid more in the future.Author Matthew Desmond follows the plight of eight renting families and two landlords as they try to navigate through the Milwaukee housing jungle. His writing is as compelling as the best work of fiction, and once you pick up Evicted, it's hard to put it back down. It would have been easy for Desmond to take sides, to portray the renters as saints and the landlords as sinners, but he never loses his objectivity. The example of a broken sink sums up the struggle between perspectives: the tenants says the sink is broken; the landlord says the tenant broke the sink.As a reader, I tried to remain objective as well, and failed quite a bit. It was hard to read about the fire that tore through landlord Sharrena's property and killed an eight month old child. The property didn't have working fire detectors, but Sherrena's concern was whether she'd have to return that month's rent money to the grieving parents. She asked a firefighter who assured her she did not. It was hard to not to judge Lorraine, who was chronically late with her rent, but purchased a lobster dinner with food stamps and bought products off infomercials.And, of course, these types of judgments and emotions are part of what has made the housing crisis among the lowest of income groups possible. This book makes its readers confront these biases.My only disappointment is that the epilogue didn't catch up with all the people Desmond wrote about and then dropped throughout the pages. Instead, Desmond leaves us with his solution to this problem, which in my opinion would actually create an identical crisis among the lower-middle class.I was able to view this title thanks to netgalley."}, {"userName": "Caren", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren", "userReview": "What an amazing book! I was riveted by sociologist Matthew Desmond's experience with poor renters in Milwaukee. Many times, while reading, I wondered how he had been able to collect such personal stories. The answer to that question comes in the last chapter in which he lays out his research methods and the fact that he lived right alongside some of the poorest renters in the city, recording , with their permission, their lives. The result is a book you won't forget. I was reminded of the book I recently read, \"$2. a Day\". As in that book, stories of actual families illustrate the realities the lack of affordable housing presents for the poorest in our country. Waiting lists for government housing or for help with rent are years long. These very poor families end up in substandard housing (often with stopped up sinks/tubs/toilets, no refrigerator or stove, and broken windows) paying as much as 80% of their monthly income in rent. When families are continually evicted (and single mothers are most likely to be evicted), the kids are forced to change schools and jobs are hard to find and keep. There is just a total lack of stability, with the evicted constantly in stress. The author is a sociologist and urban ethnographer. As an academic, he has chosen what seems to me the most effective way to present his case: he allows readers inside the living situations of the poorest of the poor in the USA and allows them to judge for themselves. He points out in his closing chapter that Milwaukee could just as easily be Indianapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis, or any other moderately-sized city in the USA. He chose Milwaukee because he was in grad school at the University of Wisconsin, so it was nearby. He really befriended the families in question and, once again in the last chapter, shared his own situation, noting that his own family had lived in tight financial circumstances with his father being a pastor and his mother taking any sort of job she could find, yet losing their house during the recession. It brought tears to my eyes when the author noted that any proceeds from the book would be shared with the families he profiled. You know, you can talk the talk, but here is a guy who really walked with these people and tries to open the eyes of his fellow citizens to just what is going on in this country. Along with the poor renters, he also profiles two landlords who are pretty ordinary people trying to make a living, but who are totally taking advantage of the situation poor people are in to make a pretty tidy income on their misfortune. As an ethnographer, I found the author to be very even-handed. He isn't playing a blame game; rather, he is showing us how it is, and asking us to care enough to seek change.My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for a digital prepublication galley.

Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, \u201cLove don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced\u00a0 into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America\u2019s vast inequality\u2014and to people\u2019s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852784-evicted", "average": 4.49, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453060710l/25852784.jpg", "reviews": 4957, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/915500.Matthew_Desmond", "name": "Matthew Desmond"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Sociology", "Politics", "History", "Economics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852784-evicted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30523746-evicted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108505-racial-domination-racial-progress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2014661.On_the_Fireline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26532378-race-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27882417-rsf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23130442-the-racial-order", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
