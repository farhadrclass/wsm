Although historians talk much about the early years of 1940's and the war efforts, few have studied the later years of that most eventful decade, whose end witnessed the start of the cold war and a new chapter in global history. \u201cParis After liberation\u201d studies these years in Paris, the city of light. It pays a much admired attention to the details of social life as well as political atmosphere. Beevor includes politicians, artists, philosophers and writers as well as ordinary people in his story. By doing this he draws an accurate picture of events, their trends and transformation that individuals and society experienced alike. One may say in doing this he sacrifices the depth and remains satisfied with the surface of the events. That is the purpose of this book to provide readers with a big picture of so many intriguing characters, history changing ideas and history making events, going deeper than that creates bias and unbalances the book\u2019s narrative. One who seeks to study further about any individual or any particular part of French contemporary history finds this book a good starting point. For anyone who wants to learn about France, this wonderful country that still continues to intrigue us and sometimes to annoy us, \u201cParis After Liberation\u201d is a must."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "It's definitely a particular kind of history with its own perspective, but it's so my thing and I loved it and I will write about it soon."}, {"userName": "Czarny Pies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies", "userReview": "\"Paris apres la liberation 1944-1949\" est un louange glorieux a la France, a son peuple et a la culture comme seulement les anglais sont capables d'ecrire. Ce livre vient de la main d'Antony Beevor le grand historien des batailles sur le Front de l'est pendant la deuxieme grande mondiale et de sa femme Artemis Cooper la petite fille de Duff Cooper qui a ete ambassadeur anglais a Paris de 1944 a 1949.Ce que l'on trouve dans\"Paris apres la liberation\" sont les souvenirs de la famille Cooper et leurs amis des evenements qui ont eu lieu dans et autour de l'ambassade anglaise. Le liste de personnages est remarquable: Jean Cocteau, Charles de Gaulle, Georges Vanier, Evelyn Waugh, Juliette Greco, Malcolm Muggeridge, Gaston Pawlewski et pas moines de trois futurs laureates du prix Nobel de la Litterature a savoir Francois Mauriac, Winston Churchill et Ernest Hemingway. Je dois mettre ce livre dans la categorie de plaisir coupable. Il ne possede aucune these. Cependant, les descriptions des grands auteurs et les incidents auxquels ils participent sont extraordinaires. Le lecteur fait vite l'illusion qu'il est assis a une table dans un cafe cabaret sur la rive gauche avec Ernest Hemingway a sa gauche et Jean Cocteau a sa droite tandis que Juliette Greco chante sur la scene.Ce livre plait enormement.

The authors give a vivid portrayal of the class divides in French politics and society. We read of the collaboration of some conservatives with Vichy, and in some cases their enthusiastic participation in Nazi atrocities. The post war world saw them lose their place to be replaced in many cases, if not all, by those who participated in resistance.The Communist Party (PCF) was the largest and most popular party in the immediate post-war period, thanks to their role in the resistance and popular support for the part played by the Red Army in defeating fascism. But Stalin had little interest in a new French Revolution. Instead he was concerned with consolidating his gains, building a buffer zone in Eastern and Central Europe to protect the Soviet Union from further invasions. So the PCF acted in the interests of Soviet foreign policy, not French socialism.On the other side was de Gaulle, hero of the Free French army in exile. Militarily he played a minor role but symbolically he was hugely important. His egotism and dictatorial tendencies are explored in this book.More fascinating still are the stories of the intellectuals and cultural figures of Paris such as Sartre, De Beauvoir, Picasso, Greco, Merleau Ponty and Camus. It would have been nice to hear more about their ideas and much of what is written about them amounts to showbiz gossip."}, {"userName": "Janos", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721719-janos", "userReview": "An utterly interesting and compelling book.

I have also read Beevor's Stalingrad and Berlin, both of which were absorbing.This book has been very much in the 'can't put down' class. It would be easy to expect that the minutiae of post-war French politics would be both boring and confusing, but the writing style saves us. And by interspersing chapters on social matters such as fashion, theatre and lifestyles, the reader is drawn through the period with regular diversionary treats within the political story. The narrative is enlivened by quotes from contemporary diaries, particularly of people who were in positions to observe the political and diplomatic manoeuvring. All in all, the book maintains a lively pace and gives, I hope, an accurate depiction of that most interesting period in French history.As a bonus, my copy of the Penguin edition was constructed so that the back didn\u2019t break, a fate that occurred with my Spanish Civil War copy!!"}, {"userName": "David Lowther", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14288663-david-lowther", "userReview": "It's ironic that a book that's partly about collaboration should itself be a terrific example of collaboration between the husband and wife team of Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper.

The book covers, in gripping fashion, the revenge on the collaborators, the political turmoil, the cultural history of the period with writers like Sartre and painters like Picasso prominent, the re-birth of Paris fashion (Dior)and France's eventually recovery, thanks to Marshall Plan money.

This was not the fault of the writing, I just have little interest in that sort of stuff.The one major complaint I have in this book is that the author would sometimes put french expressions or quotes down and not put the english translation, some off them I could figure out but the majority I could not.

This 'slogan' has a slightly romantic undertone, just as the title of this book, \"Paris after the Liberation\" evokes some romantic images (if only for the photograph on the cover, Robert Doisneau's famous \"La derni\u00e8re valse du 14 juillet\", representing a lonely dancing couple in nightly Paris). However, this book describes a rather down-to-earth reality, the reality of an impoverished Paris, where during the harsh winters of 1944-47, people didn't have any heating in their homes: \"Pipes froze, burst, poured forth, and refroze in huge icicles\". Transportation had almost come to a standstill, while there was a shortage of almost everything. The economy had stopped functioning normally, people exchanged goods and services rather than receiving payment in cash. The 'black market' flourished.The book is also about politics, even very much so.When the French envisaged during the war their national future, there were apprehensions of what might happen after a liberation. Suppose the Communists were about to get the upper hand; that might incite the Americans to impose a military regime in order to forestall a communist regime. Others feared however that if g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle were to impose himself at the head of government, this might lead very well to a kind of dictatorship. De Gaulle indeed intended to assume power; he wanted the French resistance to be united, it should be seen as a unity acting under his leadership, and this would be the foundation for his future power base after the war. But his 'slogan' would rather be \"De la R\u00e9sistance \u00e0 la Restauration\" (implying a return to the period before the Third Republic, which he loathed because of its 'parliamentarianism'). Some 'royalists' even dreamed of the Comte de Paris usurping the throne, reinstating a monarchy in France.The book tells the complicated situation that arose after the war. De Gaulle had indeed assumed power, but opposition rose quickly in the form of strikes, mostly organized by Communists. The authors are remarkably critical of de Gaulle's politics: his attitude was anti-Anglo-Saxon, which made him conclude a treaty with the USSR, but he was anti-communist at the same time. This made him look at himself as a possible bridge-builder between the two poles; France could then take up again her role as an independent great power. When he resigned in January '46, de Gaulle expected to be called back soon. Andr\u00e9 Malraux, who claimed to be close with the general, even expected him to come back shortly as a dictator. (Malraux who, by the way, had had the lucidity to refuse engaging in resistance activities as long as the Americans didn't take part in the war.) But de Gaulle wasn't called back, even though the economic problems continued. The penury in France was relieved only when the Marshall-help began in '49. According to the authors, this was the decisive factor that finally broke down the power of the french Communists.So, on the political level, the book is informative. But the reading isn't always thrilling. It abounds with anecdotes, but was it really necessary to let us know that at the day of the inauguration of Pr\u00e9sident Vincent Auriol \"the women wore formal dresses, but the men were in dinner jackets rather than tail coats\" (p.255)? Was it indispensable to detail the menu and wine list of the lunch Auriol offered to his American guests at the Elys\u00e9e (p.359)? The authors seem to delight in such details. Or else they were so proud of have having dug these up, that they couldn't refrain from telling them, - one of the authors being the granddaughter of the English ambassador at the time, which enabled them to use his unpublished diaries as one of their sources."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward", "userReview": "Seventy years after Paris was liberated and the subsequent end of World War II, it's easy to forget the bitter divisions that existed in France. France's surrender at the beginning of the war led to the Vichy government under Petain which collaborated with the German occupiers,, but there was a burgeoning resistance movement which was itself divided into factions On one side were the communists, strong in France from before the war, and on the other, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, absolutely opposed to the Communists who nearly won a plurality of the vote in l946. Within these groups were more factions.At the end of the war, there were recriminations and executions for \"traitors\". After that came attempts to set up a stable government which would try, ineffectively, to combat desperate fuel (two unusually cold winters in a row) and food shortages with resulting strikes and chaotic conditions.At the bottom of most of this turmoil could be found DeGaule who many suspected of wanting to establish a dictatorship to lead France out of its troubles. DeGaulle had little patience for the intricacies of parliamentary government, and he reflected France's divisions. During the war the Americans and British had found him very difficult to work so he was always somewhat isolated. He was furious about post-war efforts to strengthen Germany, wanting instead a permanently divided Germany with France confiscating its industrial heartland in the Ruhr. He distrusted Britain and even more distrusted the Americans. He opposed the Marshall Plan of aid to Europe as an American plot to economically subjugate France. He saw enemies on all sides, including Russia, a contradiction as a weakened Germany would not act as as a counterweight to the Soviet Union, a strategy that the Americans and British pursued as the Cold War began to develop. All of this, of course, only deals with the political sturggles of the time. The book also discusses the profound changes that would come to France in the late 40's. Contributing to thee changes were the music of the Americans, the GI's who had money to spend in impoverished Paris, the tourists who began to flood Europe, the army of bureaucrats who swept over France. And there were the intellectual disputes of the time between such men as Sartre and Camus.  All together it was a incredibly complicated period, and despite DeGaulle's opposition, what really allowed France to economically rebuild itself, including its war-damaged infrastructure was the help provided by the Marshall Plan. Without it, France would not be what it is today."}, {"userName": "Xfi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18770639-xfi", "userReview": "Escrito en la l\u00ednea de \u201cBerl\u00edn, La Ca\u00edda\u201d, en esta obra Beevor nos cuenta los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de Paris bajo el dominio nazis as\u00ed como los meses posteriores al final de la guerra.Tiene el m\u00e9rito de desmitificar los hechos, tanto la importancia de la resistencia francesa como de la euforia posterior a la liberaci\u00f3n, que pronto fue engullida por el hambre y el fr\u00edo provocado por la catastr\u00f3fica situaci\u00f3n de Francia en la inmediata post-guerra.Tambi\u00e9n los golpes bajos y el clima casi de guerra civil que se cre\u00f3 entre el influyente Partido Comunista y el nuevo poder Americano, con el egoc\u00e9ntrico General De Gaulle en medio.
