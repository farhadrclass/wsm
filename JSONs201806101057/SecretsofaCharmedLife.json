I've rarely been so swallowed up in a story since I was ten and read the Little House series. Susan did a masterful job of making me care about Emmy and Julia and then, well, stringing me along on a horrific ride through the London Blitz.And then. And then we came to the last section of the book presented as journal entries and although there was no way I was going to quit reading at that point, the story lost its momentum. I no longer had a front row seat to the action. And that action included the moment I'd scrambled through war-torn England to reach. It was a good ending, I was satisfied with how the story turned out, but I felt robbed of the chance to be present for the climatic moment.I wouldn't have minded so much if the book hadn't been so incredibly good. I still HIGHLY recommend this book, I just wish I could have been there when . . . well, you'd better read it for yourself."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "It was 4 stars until some things got on my nerves."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "Loved it!

This book certainly didn't disappoint. I was sucked in by the engaging narrative. I was left in suspense as to the ending. I was forced to think hard on the issue it tackles: blame. Notably blaming oneself for things out of one's control.And this was a good lesson for me right now.The lowdown: It's London, WWII; the actual focus is what happens during the Blitz. Though the story delves into the before and after, it's about how the Blitz completely changed the course of people's lives: two sisters, their mother, an \"aunt\", and more. Hardly a single soul went unaffected. It's about family being torn apart and while you could point the finger at so-and-so for having done this and so-and-so for not having done that, in the end, the blame lies with war itself.It's about blame, beating one self up, and there's a side story about being forced to grow up before one's time. Being forced to be a mother when one isn't. Taking on more responsibility than one is ready for. So many lessons wrapped up in these pages.And there's a mystery too, one you can never possibly figure out till the very end. Yet we can make assumptions. It's like a guessing game. In the end I was blown away by how many people were involved and didn't even realize it.Imagine living that way for real. What happened to her? Did she die? Did someone find her? Was it my fault? Imagine thinking that for twenty years, and you'll be in Emmy's shoes. I love the way this story came together; the brides dresses, the umbrellas, the names. I felt for both heroines. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. And because so much of this tale could be considered spoilers, I hesitate to write paragraphs explaining what happens. This is one you need to read for yourself. You won't regret it. In the end, I was amazed at how so many people were involved, at who made errors in judgement and didn't realize what they were doing.The writing is stellar and engrossing. Not too much of anything; not too little. The modern story is very minimal and you only need it to tie things together, but this didn't bother me at all. It worked well. There wasn't enough of it to distract me from the history and lesson and the story of mothers and daughters and sisters within the pages. And the final lesson (at least to me): the closest you get to a \"charmed\" life is allowing yourself to be happy.http://wwwbookbabe.blogspot.com/2014/..."}, {"userName": "Melisa - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42481357-melisa---traveling-sister", "userReview": "\"Fear is worse than pain, I think. Pain is centralized, identifiable, and wanes as you wait. Fear is a heaviness you can't wriggle out from under. You must simply find the will to stand with it and start walking. Fear does not start to fade until you take the step that you think you can't.\"This is a relatively simple story of ordinary people during an extraordinary time, but is complex in its development. It is the story of how one decision can change your entire life. I think I often fall into the trap of wanting to read twist after turn and suspense and action. While the book contains quite a bit of the action of WWII, it is a slow story told beautifully and I loved how it unfolded. As someone who is enamored with history, I thoroughly enjoyed the opening question that sets the stage for the entire story:\"Ah, but what is history? Is it a record of what happened or rather our interpretation of what happened?\" \"I think it's both,\" I answer. \"It has to be both.

This story reads like a modern American teenager throwing hussy fits when nothing goes her way, only in a Blitz setting. The disconnect between history and character reaction is gaping. Just think, this is similar to a blend of High School Musical and the SS marching down the street in the same plot. It's disconcerting to say the least. Not the least concession was made to the fact that this book was not set in the modern US. I might have been able to overlook this big fault if there were anything good with the book. The plot held out a promise, which is why I chose the book. But gosh, it SO did not deliver! I am giving the plot away below because I don't want you all to read it and suffer like I did. So, SPOILERS ahead!Emmy and Julia are two sisters who live in London. Emmy is a shit-faced bitch, and Julia is a lonely kid. Their mother is a single mother and is often absent, trying to provide a good life for them. But Emmy keeps slut-shaming her and thinks of her as a whore despite hogging on the food she brings. As far as I am concerned, the mother is doing her duty towards her children, whether by sleeping with someone for money or not, is none of anyone's business, least of all, the nincompoop Emmy's who is being fed and clothed with this money. Also, it turns out that the mother was not a prostitute, so Emmy made more than a fool of herself. I disliked this character so much that I kept hoping the Germans would drop a bomb directly on her head.The only idea in Emmy's otherwise empty head is to design stupid wedding gowns. Really? This is a career? In the wartime with rationing, when people were struggling to get basic food rations? According to her, this will make her rich and famous \"when the war is over\". She sets up an appointment with a big designer for a job, but before anything could proceed, she is evacuated along with many of London's children to the countryside, where she proceeded to make herself unpleasant with prospective foster parents. Finally, the two sisters move in with a woman. Emmy keeps in touch with the designer and gets a date for the interview. So she plans to sneak off with her box of sketches into the night without a thought about pretty much anyone else. Her little sister discovers the truth and naturally doesn't want to be left alone. So she makes Emmy promise that she would either not go or take her along with her. But poor Julia is trusting an unreliable idiot, because Emmy still plans to sneak off leaving a seven year old Julia behind! As luck would have it, Julia wakes up in the middle of the night, and Emmy faces a dilemma. Or at least, she should have faced. But Emmy doesn't give a shit about anyone else, so she takes Julia along with her to London, towards the war! Oh, stupid wedding dresses are so much more important than little sisters! And then she loses Julia, and her mother dies trying to find her. Emmy is now left to mourn and then she assumes the identity of a woman called Isabel, so that she could keep searching for Julia. But for some strange reason, she continues to keep that name after the war, lies to the man she marries about her real identity and then claims she is too traumatised with the war to give any kind of freedom to her daughter. Yeah, right! It's not really strange because this is what disgusting Emmy does. It's all about her. Then some American woman shows up and Emmy tells her the REAL story that she never told anyone else. Why? Because halfwit Emmy only likes Americans? Whatever.Julia's part of the story is hurried through and doesn't even make it to a decent narrative. Her entire life story is condensed into a few letters that she wrote to herself as part of her therapy. This is about the clumsiest narrative device I have ever seen in a book. At the very least, Meissner could have told the story from Julia's pov and stuffed the annoying Emmy into a few pages. Just skip this stupid book about the angst of a stupid girl who basically just brings it all on herself. I must admit I was happy with the ending. Very happy that Emmy doesn't get to design wedding dresses. Ha! Go fuck yourself, Emmy!"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17920620-holly", "userReview": "I received this book through a goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review.I loved this story! I thought it was beautiful in a simple way but still left an impact on me. I just cannot imagine going through something like the London Blitz in WWII. Such a sad and devastating time.

Julia is the younger sister who lives with different regrets and is deeply affected by what occurs in London. I had a lump in my throat for the entire last part (of 3).

We make our choices - you and I - in a world that isn't perfect. And while I wish I had made different choices, as I know you do, which one of us can say that if we had, nothing bad would have ever happened to the people we love?\" A story of mothers and daughters and sisters, uniting and colliding within the volatile realities of war - real and imagined wars. And so much more: shattered dreams, burning hope, love, loss, grief, solitude, redemption, and restoration. Susan Messiner is a beautifully gifted storyteller, weaving contemporary fiction with that of historical in a moralistically astute and emotionally satisfying way. \"[W]hen you make a choice, even if it's a bad one, you've played your hand. You cannot live your life as though you still held all your cards.\" Everyday we make choices. Some turn out quite well. Others, not so much; leaving a trail of sorrows and regrets in our wake. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, these choices can have far reaching rippling effects as evidenced in Secrets of a Charmed Life through the realistically imagined characters of Emmy and Julia Downtree.  [L]ife is lived at the moment you are living it . . . No one but God in heaven has the benefit of seeing beyond today.\" This emotive-rich story made me think, feel, and ponder - deeply at times; reaching back into my turbulent teenage years in conjunction with my often strained relationship with my own mother and finding correlating connections. In this sense, I feel Meissner is spot on when it comes to the ups and downs of mother/daughter relationships. Relationship-exploration in general is one of her strengths. And I truly appreciate her choice to write cleanly, sans vulgarity, no matter how unsettling or dark the subject matter. On a less stellar note, \"Secrets of a Charmed Life\" doesn't behold the most authentic voice in terms of narrative. It's evident an American author is attempting a British narration - without complete success. Nothing to get cockeyed over; at least not in my estimation. However, literary purists might find it irksome beyond forgiveness. Meissner also tends to be overly zealous with explanatory details. Every cause-and-effect instance need not be spelled out in minute details; readers aren't without deductive reasoning skills. Then again, maybe some readers prefer being spoon fed????? Overall, peeves aside, this a beautiful touching story. It brings to light conflicting choices Britons had to make during world war two in regards to family and survival. And it explores family bonds, promises, secrets, intents, burdens, and disappointments. \"Mum had made an exchange, just like everyone does when quaking under a load that seems far too heavy. She exchanged a transparent life of abject poverty for one of secrets and illusion that kept her and her daughters fed and clothed . . .

It is a story of misconception, too many assumptions, too many actions without enough forethought to avoid dire consequences and the grief that comes from making a mistake you feel you can never rectify.Throughout the story you want to scream at Emmy, \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d or \u201cthink about what you are doing\u201d, but she is fifteen and she acts from impulse, as fifteen year olds so often do. She misjudges her mother and in many ways distrusts her, and she sees only part of a situation but judes it as all. Her rashness costs her dearly and puts her sister\u2019s life and well-being at jeopardy as well. While it is hard to live with messing up your own life, sometimes it is even harder to live with your effect on the lives of others. The truth is uncovered in layers in the novel. Truths about self, about others, and about events. As one character says, The truth is a strange companion. It devastates one moment and enthralls the next. But it never deceives. And because of that, in the end, it comforts.I particularly liked this reflection on time and grief ...but if I know anything about time, it is that it stretches to walk with you when you grieve. The rest of the world may zoom past at breakneck speed but when you are learning to live with loss, time slows down to the pace of your breathing.And, the quote from which the title springs, that is all about responsibility and guilt: I want her to see that I understand there are no secrets to a charmed life. There is just the simple truth that you must forgive yourself for only being able to make your own choices, and no one else\u2019s.Meisser has done a good job of recreating the historical time frame, weaving believable characters and investing them with meaning beyond their own individual stories. An easy narrative with enough mystery and emotion to keep you reading to the end."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459558-jennifer", "userReview": "Warning: If you get irritated by \"prudish\" reviews, stop now.

I started to get a bit uneasy when the Lord's name was taken in vain a couple of times, but thought it surely would be a rare occurrence and I could press on. Meissner is a Christian author after all. Then I realized that the book really didn't contain any Christian elements and the perspective on life presented was rather hopeless and dreary. Then more crude language and awful use of God's name popped up again and again. When it dawned on me that this book was going to include a sex scene, that was the last straw. I ended up skimming quickly over the last few chapters and was again disappointed to see that the book offered little hope. I can't understand why the author would spend so much time writing a well-crafted story and squander the opportunity to point readers to God and His light.

I normally don't read much of this genre (nothing against it, just doesn't cross my radar very often) but the synopsis had caught my eye and (thanks to Kate Morton, I love these kinds of stories) I was eager to read it... dove into it without reading any reviews.Thanks again to my friend Shaun for gifting me this for Christmas :).It starts off slow, building up the lives of Emmy,Julia, and their mom before the war came to England. Not compelling exactly but it keeps your attention as the story moves along. We're immersed into the lives of these people and ache with Emmy as she endures the disappearance of her sister and the uncertainty if what had happened to her... and having a hard time of forgiving herself for her 'mistakes'Emmy annoyed me in the beginning when she and Julia were evacuated, her determination to be a designer of wedding dresses and scheming to get back to London matter what. I understood her better later on. Emmy starts out optimistic, believing anything is possible and excited envisioning her future.Then Emmy and Julia were evacuated to the countryside to keep them safe and many events were set in motion.----After all that had happened, I thought she was too harsh on herself and another character as well but I could sort... not understand exactly( but for lack of a better word) why they felt how they did. I truly don't know how I would have reacted if I had had to live through all they did.Charlotte was a wonderful character as well, someone I would have loved to know and Thistle House sounds so beautiful (The kind of house I would want to have).Couldn't help but love Julia, such a sweet kid:).Isabelle's husband was a good man, I admired him. Part three had me wanting to give the person whose POV it was a big hug... both this one and Emmy were brave people, pushing on despite what life has thrown at them.The relationships between everyone were extremely well done, the bonds felt natural and not forced at all. Each one has their own powerful effect on the story and in some motivations of each person.A beautiful ending that made me smile as well.The narrator is lovely, a softish way of speaking that suits the story wonderfully.

Last time I read one of her books I fell completely in love with her elegant writing and storytelling and found myself falling in love all over again. She is one of many authors that keep my interest with historical fiction alive and why I keep coming back to this genre over and over again.The story mostly follows a 15-year-old girl Emmy Downtree, her story told by Isabel McFarland when a young scholar comes to interview the elderly woman in hopes of learning some secrets about the war. Emmy has big dreams, and all she really wants is to find love and acceptance from her mother, for her to be proud of Emmy. She loves to draw wedding dresses, so when she get's a job at a wedding dress shop, it feels like a dream come true. When her boss informs her that she knows a man who is willing to look at Emmy's brides and could offer her an apprenticeship, Emmy can't believe her luck. Luck, that unfortunately soon starts to run out. When the war escalates, Emmy's mother signs both of Emmy and her half-sister Julia to evacuate London and find refuge in the country side. What happens next changes both of the girl's life forever...Such an emotional, riveting tale about love, lose, hope and perseverance. I found myself glued to page after page, immersed in the fantastic storytelling by Meissner. Emmy was just a young girl who thought she was doing the right thing, who just wanted to make her dream come true. In turn she watched her entire world crumble into pieces when the blitz hit and she found herself losing everything that has ever been important to her. I don't want to dig into the story as much as I want to talk about it more with a fear of revealing a little too much. I did find myself irritated by Emmy's reckless behavior, I found it selfish and one-sided, but I understood that she was just a young girl who was looking to make her mother proud. In hopes that Emmy would never feel like she had ruined her mother's life, she wanted to show her that she could do something good with hers.I found myself in tears by the end of the book. Everything that left me with questions midway through did get answered at the end of the book. Luckily there was closure, or else I am not sure how I would have done without it. I wanted to know what became of Emmy and how she coped with the hand that was dealt to her. How she managed to get through with losing so much in so little time. Her tenacity and ambition to make things right were inspiring, so was the fact that she had a hard time giving up. The 15-year-old girl had to grow up fast during the blitz and become a strong and independent woman.I could have just hugged this book after reading it.

We learn very little about Kendra other than the fact that she finds Isabel's story intriguing. The only mystery surrounding her is why Isabel chooses to tell her the story... spoiler alert, there is no real compelling reason why it's Kendra and not somebody else. The plot of Isabel's story actually had a lot of promise and as I was reading it I couldn't help but think that this would make a nice screenplay, though perhaps I felt this way because the author at times goes into unnecessary detail about what a person was looking at or touching or hearing. The descriptiveness got a bit leaden at times and the abundant use of proper names \"Emmy said... and then Emmy said... Emmy looked around\" made it feel more like stage directions than reading as a novel. I've not read any of Meissner's other stories, so I'm not sure if this is a stylistic trait of hers, but I did find it a bit distracting and inelegant. On the whole a pleasant distracting read. Not one I would add to my permanent collection, but not unpleasant either."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "Oh how I loved this book about a young London woman (girl) during the Blitz. The author does such a fantastic job describing the complete incongruity of the situation, set against Emmy's idealistic nature. And the theme of sisterhood- wow. I was completely enchanted from the first page. Highly, highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Zeena", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2367182-zeena", "userReview": "Once I picked this book up I couldn't put it back down. The characters were easy to love and to feel their pain. Historical fiction at its best.

Through her telling comes thee recounting of the lives of Emmy and Julia Downtree. They are sisters living with a single mother in London during the bombings from the Luftwaffe in WWII. Their mother sends them to the countryside to be sheltered by a foster family. They are fortunate to be taken in by a caring couple of sisters. But Emmy's dreams cause her to make some poor choices that change the course of their lives. The sisters are left to pay for those choices, changing their futures. A couple of wonderful quotes:\"Fear is worse than pain, I think. Pain is centralized, identifiable and wanes as you wait. Fear is a heaviness you can't wiggle out from under. You must simply find the will to stand with it and start walking. Fear does not start to fade until you take the step that you think you can't.\"\"...truth is a strange companion. It devastates one moment and enthralls the next. But it never deceives. And because of that, in the end, it comforts.\"I would highly recommend this book to fans of historical fiction.Really 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Krystal Bond", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9299051-krystal-bond", "userReview": "4.25 I loved reading yet another perspective of World War II. This story was very gripping and kept we wonder in until nearly the end if the two sisters in the story are ever reunited after so much heartache and loss from the Blitz. They both overcame so much over the years I wanted so badly for there to be a happy ending to this story. I enjoyed reading about Emmy, her story, as other historical fiction novels have, made me feel closer to history in a sense. This isn't the most heart wrenching historical fiction novel I've read, but it is definitely wonderful and worth reading."}], "description": "She stood at a crossroads, half-aware that her choice would send her down a path from which there could be no turning back. But instead of two choices, she saw only one\u2014because it was all she really wanted to see\u2026 \n Current day, Oxford, England. Young American scholar Kendra Van Zant, eager to pursue her vision of a perfect life, interviews Isabel McFarland just when the elderly woman is ready to give up secrets about the war that she has kept for decades...beginning with who she really is.

But even as fifteen-year-old Emmy Downtree and her much younger sister Julia find refuge in a charming Cotswold cottage, Emmy\u2019s burning ambition to return to the city and apprentice with a fashion designer pits her against Julia\u2019s profound need for her sister\u2019s presence.
