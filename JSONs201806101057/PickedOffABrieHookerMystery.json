Cozies often have a creatively crazy title, but here it\u2019s the Udderly Kidding Dairy and the name Brie Hooker that have me shaking my head. Really cute! There are some references to previous events in the first book, but this story stands alone.The age-old vices of jealousy, revenge, and greed play a big part in the mystery, including the lure of sports gambling. The strong secondary characters function almost like an ensemble cast, and they added so much to this story \u2013 from Brie\u2019s aunt Eva, to her friend Mollye, and the two friend/boyfriend guys, Paint and Andy. I liked both of the guys and wish Brie wasn\u2019t so indecisive. Hopefully she will choose one or find someone else in the next book.South Carolina politics also enters into the storyline, beginning with a Halloween costume party that served as a fundraiser for Eva\u2019s friend and governor candidate, Carol Strong. It was a fun evening \u2013 until an attack that left a pro football star in a coma. The mystery was well plotted, with enough twists and turns to keep me guessing.I didn\u2019t care for the mild profanity, even when food terms were used as substitutes, and the romantic, lustful element had a little too much emphasis for me. Still a good cozy mystery overall.I received a copy of this book through Great Escapes Tours.

A Halloween themed costume party has been set up on the grounds and people have come from all over. The Senator\u2019s son has even flown in from Las Vegas. Zack is the starting quarterback for the Aces. Brie who has told Paint and Andy she values their friendship too much to date them decides she may like to get to know Zack a little better. Before she has the chance he is attacked by someone with a pitchfork in the barn. He survives his injuries but has a long recovery ahead of him. Since it happened on at Udderly and Eva and Carol are best friends, Eva decides Brie needs to find the culprit that brought the party to a complete halt. Was it someone from nearby or did someone follow him from Vegas to make sure the quarterback has thrown his last pass?This is a very exciting story. Gambling, greed, fame, revenge, jealousy, all play a part in the wonderfully written tale. The first victim is just seriously hurt, then another victim is kidnapped, and then a murder is uncovered. Twists, turns, spins, this story has it all.The attack of pro quarterback Zack Stone brings not only a lot of press to the area but it also brings the owners of his team, extra security, and his back up quarterback to town. These additional characters take the story in an unexpected direction and really add dimension to the story. Brie, Eva, Mollye, Andy, and Paint have their hands full taking care of some and avoiding others as they all piece together the clues to find out who did what and why. A certain animal plays a pivotal role in one scene that had me both on the edge of my seat and laughing out loud.I will say everyone seems to be worried about Brie\u2019s love life including Brie. I was excited to see at one point it looked like she had made a huge decision only to backtrack herself a few chapters later. I know romantic triangles are a big part of cozy mysteries, but this one needs to be decided soon. I don\u2019t think the idea Andy and Paint have come up with is tenable for long in the future. I do appreciate the friendship all the core characters have. It is very believable and real.Linda Lovely\u2019s plot takes on a serious issue in a very entertaining way. As with the first book, I enjoy the author\u2019s writing style. Her descriptions create fantastic imagery of time and place. The dialogue is spot on. Brie\u2019s meat and cheese curse words always make me smile. Aunt Eva\u2019s cursing is a little stronger, but she is a strong woman. A huge heart but I wouldn\u2019t want to get on her bad side.I had a great time reading the story. Another perfect escape from this author.

I loved the first one and the second one did not disappoint. This one had a bunch of great storylines and I enjoy the wannabe love triangle between main character Brie and best friends Andy and Paint. I also love that Brie is a vegan, which is such an odd part of the plot and yet comes together beautifully. Lots of animals, dogs and mayhem at their farm. The mystery in this one I very much enjoyed, the political twist was not what I expected and read really well not a predictable run of the mill plot line. I really enjoyed it. I could not put it down and I read it in one night. This one is out June 5th and well worth the read. A fine Henery Press book! *Not sure why but Amazon has the cover below.

(Goodreads)Review:The characters are well developed and well rounded. I like the interactions between Brie, Aunt Eva and Mollye, Brie\u2019s friend. They are sometimes outrageous and always funny. I enjoy spending time with them and seeing what they are up to. I have to say that I wish Brie would make up her mind about her love interests, Paint and Andy. I started getting frustrated with her wishy washy ways. That is only my opinion and others may not feel the same way. I hope the next book settles the issue.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. The author is very talented in her descriptive writing and she created a farm setting that was teeming with some incredible animals, especially one special mule. The mystery had enough suspects and clues to consider and even though I thought I knew who had done the deed, I was wrong. But that is okay with me.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted cozy mystery.

The cause is not the scary decorations, but rather the bloody body of Carol's son, Zach, star quarterback of the Las Vegas Aces. With Zack in a coma, Brie tries to puzzle out who attacked him. Was it one of the local enemies from his past? Did it come from a disgruntled football fan or someone from his team? Or was the attack politically motivated, a way to bring down his mother and stop her running for governor? While Eva comforts Carol, Brie, along with Mollye, Andy, and Paint search for the truth.Lies, deception, and trust are at the heart of this second Brie Hooker mystery. Who is telling the truth? Who can you trust? There are lots of characters with ulterior motives and plenty of suspects and I, for one, wasn't trusting anyone! The mystery was cleverly plotted with plenty of action and lots of humor. My favorite bits included scenes with Duncan and Rita! I could picture their antics as well as their heroics perfectly! Although not a fan of love triangles in mystery series, I do like the underlying friendship and camaraderie of all three characters. Indeed family and friendship is at the heart of this series.PICKED OFF is a fun mystery that celebrates friends and family while providing plenty of action and laughs.FTC Disclosure \u2013 The publisher sent me a digital ARC provided through NetGalley, in the hopes I would review it."}, {"userName": "K.A.

From the opening scene to the final chapter, there are several attention grabbing plotlines to keep the reader turning pages. Protagonist, Brie Hooker, is a vegan yet finds herself working at her Aunt Eva\u2019s Udderly Kidding goat dairy farm, tending to 400 goats. Surrounded by meat and cheese loving family and friends, Brie still holds her own and has taken it as her mission to convert them by introducing her vegan fare a little at a time. Aunt Eva is quite the character and the repartee that she and Brie have is quite humorous. I also enjoy Brie\u2019s curses of choice, which are concoctions of meat and cheese phrases. This adds to the colorfulness of the dialog without resorting to inappropriate language. Another colorful addition is Brie\u2019s best friend, Mollye. She is a great sidekick and adds more hilarity to each scene she\u2019s in. Also, I can\u2019t overlook the two male supporting characters, Andy and Paint. These hunky best friends both want to date Brie and she in turn is enamored of them both. While I don\u2019t mind a love triangle starting out in a series, I\u2019m not a fan of it continuing past the first book. For me, in this instance, it did detract from the overall plot and mystery which is unfortunate because I do love the characters and Ms. Lovely\u2019s writing style.That said, when the story centered on the mystery at hand I was enthralled! A contender for South Carolina\u2019s governorship goes missing, her pro-football quarterback son is attacked, and his old high school friend is found murdered. Not only was I kept guessing about who the killer could be, I was kept guessing about who the intended victim(s) really were and why they were the victim. Could it be someone who opposes the political candidate or does someone from Vegas have it in for the quarterback? Haunted houses, secrets from the past, sketchy news reporters, and the theme of gambling are woven into this fun read! I was provided an advance copy via Netgalley with the hopes I would review.

I've really enjoyed getting to know these characters - Brie the vegan chef, her wacky friend Mollye, Aunt Eva, and of course the two men vying for Brie's affection - Paint and Andy. And of course the goat farm's name is very creative - Udderly Kidding.This book pulled in politics, attempted murder, kidnapping, and gambling into the why of the mystery. There is a murder but as I said earlier, it is not what causes Brie and the gang to start looking into this curious situation. I was partially surprised at how the mystery portion unveiled. While I wasn't totally shocked at who was behind it all, it did take awhile before I guessed it might be this character. I still love the way Brie uses meat and cheese to substitute for curse words. It cracks me up every time.This is a fun series and the only thing that might make it better is some vegan recipes."}, {"userName": "Laura M", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14854186-laura-m", "userReview": "This is the second book in the Brie Hooker Mystery Series by Linda Lovely (the first was Bones to Pick), however, it was the first in the series I read. I generally hate to start in the middle of a series, but I had the opportunity to review it for NetGalley and it looked like an interesting premise. Brie Hooker lives with her aunt Eva at Udderly Kidding dairy farm. Eva\u2019s best friend, Carol (who is really more like family), is running for office and Eva agreed to have a Halloween-themed fundraiser at the farm, complete with haunted house. However, the evening takes a turn when Carol\u2019s son Zack is attacked with a pitchfork in the barn and goes into a coma. Another family member is soon targeted, and everyone is on edge wondering who the culprit could be, and the reason behind it.I was a little disappointed in this book. For one thing, it references the first book a few times and while you don\u2019t have to have read it to enjoy this book, I always recommend starting in the beginning. Second, Brie is consumed with her sex life (because it has been 19 months since she has had the pleasure, as the reader is reminded often) and which of her suitors she should choose. Every single chapter discusses it. I don\u2019t mind it if it is a romance, but in a mystery I like to focus on, well, the mystery. I also got tired of hearing her exclamations: rotting ribeyes, pickled pig\u2019s feet, deviled ham! The first five or six were cute. After that, I was over it. I will admit I skimmed or skipped several pages in the book just to get to the climax. I cared enough to stick with it to find out who the culprit(s) was/were, but barely. It was nice to get to know Brie and her friends, but I think one book was enough in this series for me."}, {"userName": "JoAnne McMaster (Any Good Book)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4078451-joanne-mcmaster-any-good-book", "userReview": "When Brie and her friends Paint and Andy are getting Udderly Kidding Dairy ready for a Halloween fundraiser for her Aunt Eva's best friend Carol Strong, who is running for governor, all talk is about Carol's son Zack, who grew up with the two men and has now made it big in football. But no sooner are they talking about him when he shows up to visit with his old friends.Once the costumed affair is underway, everyone seems to be having a good time...until Zack is found unconscious in the barn, having been hit on the head and then stabbed with a pitchfork. The attack has left him in a coma, and since almost everyone wore a mask, no one can tell who the attacker might have been.But it doesn't stop there. Soon Carol disappears, and both Brie and Eva thinks she might have been kidnapped. It doesn't help that suddenly the town is filled with people from Zack's football team, including a pair of hired thugs who are more menacing than protective. And if Brie doesn't figure out what's going on pretty soon, she might be the next one in the line of fire...First off, I should get the things that bothered me out of the way: Having read the first one, I was looking forward to this book. However, this time out, Brie is really concerned with sex (as she reminds us how long she's been celibate). Also, as I've said before, if this were a man and he were making remarks about two women who were interested in him, the demographics would be a whole lot different on peoples' opinion of the book. Her friend Mollye, who is supposed to be witty and funny, comes off like a twisted teenager in this book. She's constantly making sexual innuendos which seem out of place considering there's a man in the hospital and his mother is missing. I just felt that she never took the situation seriously; it gave me the impression that this book was centered more on the romantic angle, and because of that, the mystery angle suffered. It wasn't until the second half of the book when there's a murder to be solved. (Let's face it, folks, you read a mystery because of the murder, and you expect it fairly early on). Unfortunately, since I'm not the least interested in love triangles, it made the first part of the book slow going for me.But once the mystery started to get going, so did the action. The pace picked up, and suspects began to come out of the woodwork, making the last half of the book quite interesting. There were some harrowing situations that Brie managed to get into (and out of) and I enjoyed this immensely. The words began to flow off the page, bringing us into the story and keeping us involved right up until the end. It was this half that saved the book for me, and the best part of it, in my humble opinion.Brie manages to think on her feet in tight situations, and that's always a good thing. I found the writing to be very good, the plot line engaging. I enjoyed how everything came together nicely at the end, and look forward to the next in the series.
