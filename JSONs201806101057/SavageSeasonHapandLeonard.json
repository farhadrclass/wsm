Leonard and Hap are best buddies. Why? I have no clue. They really are not much alike. Leonard is a gay, Vietnam vet who seems pretty mellow at first. Just don't mess with his vanilla cookies.Hap is a guy with a prison record because he wanted to make a statement during the sixties about the war. Hap was kind of stupid then. Now Hap's ex-wife has returned to the scene and has a scam up her very short dress. She wants Hap to find some missing robbery money for her and her new man. Hap won't do it unless Leonard is involved. Leonard is not crazy about the ex-wife or the scam.\nThe two guys are fun. I think they are those two friends that when the shit starts to hit the fan they might make it worse because neither of them can keep their mouths shut.

Then during one of our bitch sessions highly intellectual conversations, Shelby reminded me the show had premiered. It sounded like something my husband would TOTALLY dig so I cued it up for him and planned to get back to my regularly scheduled porno Pulitzer winner.

My apologies for the couple minutes of your life you just wasted and will never get back. Now let\u2019s get on with the show. Hap and Leonard are just a couple of good ol\u2019 boys \u2013 never meaning no harm. They\u2019ve been makin\u2019 their way the only way they know how, but then Leonard\u2019s ex-wife shows up with her magic poonany and reveals a scheme that\u2019s just a little bit more than the law will allow . . . \n\u201cOne hundred thousand dollars for each of us.\u201d\u201cShit.

However, if you\u2019re not easily offended by foul language or some pretty gnarly asskicking and want to read the best dialogue of your life - Lansdale will provide. I may have shown up way more than fashionably late for this party, but I\u2019m most definitely here to stay . . . . \n3.5 Stars rounded up because I need some wiggle room as I continue the series and also because the final action sequence went on just a wee bit too long for my liking.

In tow is Hap's best friend, Leonard, a gay black man who happens to be the toughest son of a bitch on the planet. Will Hap and Leonard finally make the big score that saves them from a life of backbreaking labor or is Trudy leading them to their deaths?2014 reread: Since nothing on my unread pile looks appealing at the moment and a Hap and Leonard TV series is in the works, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the Hap and Leonard books I read pre-Goodreads. One of the perks of getting older is that old books magically become new books after seven or eight years. I remembered the basic plot of this book but forgot most of the wrinkles.Savage Season introduces Hap Collins and Leonard Pine to the world. Hap is an ex-hippy who spent a year and a half in prison for dodging the Vietnam draft and Leonard is a gay black Vietnam vet who is the toughest man on Earth. Together, they coast through life on crap wages and make a lot of smart ass remarks.Since originally reading this, I've read a lot of other crime books. It seems to me that Hap and Leonard owe something to Robert Parker's Spenser and Hawk characters, transported to Lansdale's rural east Texas setting. No matter how you slice it, though, Hap and Leonard are one of the most entertaining duos in crime fiction.The plot of this one is pretty straight forward. Some money from a bank robbery was stashed on boat and sunk in the Sabine River. Trudy, Hap's ex, with some other radicals in tow, want Hap's help in retrieving it. Funny quips and bloody double-crosses ensue and Hap and Leonard wind up in the hospital for the first of many times in the series.It always surprises me how funny Joe Lansdale's books are without lessening the impact of the violence that often follows. There are some pretty brutal images in this one.While Savage Season isn't the best book of the series, it's a great beginning. Even in their first appearance, Hap and Leonard are very much the losers I've come to love over the years and I'm excited to be experiencing their adventures once again. Four out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Hap Collins and his friend Leonard Pine seem like pure east Texas rednecks in a lot of ways. They have crappy jobs working in rose fields, shoot clay pigeons with their shotguns, drive worn out piece-of-shit vehicles, raise hunting dogs and listen to country music. But Leonard is black and gay, and Hap is a former damn dirty hippie who got sent to prison for refusing his induction notice during Vietnam as a protest against the war. So they aren\u2019t exactly the Dukes of Hazard.Years after his prison stay ended his marriage, Hap\u2019s ex-wife Trudy still likes to come around regularly to break his heart all over again. Trudy is another former flower child who still thinks she can change the world while Hap\u2019s time in prison took care of all his idealistic notions. When Trudy shows up again, she\u2019s got a new proposal for Hap.Trudy and some other old damn dirty hippies have gotten a lead on a lot of cash from a bank robbery that was believed lost. They think it\u2019s in a sunken boat in an remote river area that Hap grew up in. Trudy wants Hap\u2019s help, and Hap insists on cutting Leonard in, too. But both have second thoughts when they meet the old radicals they\u2019ll be working with. Still convinced that they can revive the spirit of the \u201860s, they want the money for their pet causes while Hap and Leonard just want to be able to stop working in the rose fields. Joe Lansdale is one of the funniest guys I\u2019ve ever read, and he really knows about rural living and the redneck lifestyle. Every time I read one of his books, I feel like I\u2019m sitting on a front porch in my old hometown while listening to some entertaining story teller spin a yarn about the trouble that some idiot good old boys got themselves into. The series is profane, politically incorrect, violent, and hilarious. Lansdale created a couple of my all-time favorite characters in Hap and Leonard."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "A recipe for Delicious Fiction: Take a pair of VERY UNCONVENTIONAL good old buddies + one BITCHOSAURUS of an ex-wife.Add in half a million in lost, stolen money, a group of wannabe radicals and an awesomely PSYCHOlarious duo of drug dealers.Spice all the above with sharp writng, brilliantly witty dialogue, heaping helpings of southern humor and stir in several pounds of violence, bloodshed and betrayals..... and VOILA.... Criminally YUMMY Buddy NOIR Cake.Definitely one I am going to recommend as this book has made me an instant fan of the Hap and Leonard series. Joe Lansdale has an slick, breezy writing style that comes across with a very authentic, rural Texas feel to it. I haven\u2019t read much of Lansdale\u2019s work, but what I have read has been very engaging. That is certainly the case here. Good writing aside, the true charm of this story begins and ends with the two main characters, Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Hap and Leonard are a terrific \u201codd buddy\u201d tandem that mesh perfectly together, despite their rather different backgrounds. Hap Collins is a straight, white 40 year old, former 60\u2018s idealist, who went to prison for 18 months for refusing to go to Vietnam. He has since become rather cynical of his former radical-ness. Leonard Pine is a gay, black vietnam vet who is distinctly \u201cnon political,\u201d reads Walden and loves country music (especially Patsy Cline and Hank Williams). Leonard has few friends (besides Hap) and loves his 6 bird dogs like they were family. Both Leonard and Hap work together in east Texas, like to shoot skeet and are martial arts buffs. The bond of friendship they share is something that comes across immediately and I have to give Lansdale full marks for that because it is central to the feel of the story. Plot-wise, there is really nothing ground-breaking here, but it is still very effective. Hap\u2019s \u201ctrouble on two legs\u201d ex-wife, Trudy, shows up out of the blue with a scheme to retrieve hundreds of thousands of dollars of stolen money lost years ago. Trudy\u2019s return sends Hap\u2019s angst meter into the red as Trudy\u2019s pattern has been to blow into his life every couple of years and make it go KABOOM!! Despite that, Hap still has strong feelings for her though he has learned to be much more guarded. For Leonard it\u2019s pretty straight-forward: he can\u2019t stand the bitch for everything she has put Hap through and has nothing but contempt for her and her \u201ccauses.\u201d Well, turns out that Trudy is part of \u201cyet another\u201d radical group that wants to use the stolen money to help fund their activities. She offers to cut Hap and Leonard in if they can help locate the money which is buried in an area Hap knows well. From there, the violence, bloodshed, vulgarity and betrayals quickly commence. Despite a fairly conventional plot, this story is still pure gold. The magic is in Lansdale\u2019s writing and the terrific banter/dialogue between Hap and Leonard which is constantly witty and loaded with \u201cdown home\u201d irony and sarcasm. I laughed out loud on more than one occasion listening to these two go back and forth and was chuckling for much of the rest. Great writing, a fast-paced plot and two of the best buddy characters I have ever come across add up to an enthusiastic thumbs up for this one. I was left wanting more and I can\u2019t wait to see what they get into next. 4.0 stars.

Lansdale's most popular characters, Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Brothers under the skin, Hap is a good-old-boy white guy from East Texas while Leonard is a black, gay Vietnam War vet. The two practice martial arts together and when we first meet them, they're living close to poverty and eking out a living working in a rose field.Still, life is fairly copacetic until, out of nowhere, Hap's very sexy ex-wife, Trudy, suddenly shows up. There's no love lost between Leonard and Trudy, but Hap is a guy who more often than not is happy to let his little head do the thinkin', especially when it comes to Trudy. After a blissful and energetic reunion, Trudy confesses that she hasn't returned just for a quick romp. She and her current beau, Howard, have a line on what may be upwards of a million dollars that was stolen from a bank years earlier and apparently lies sealed in containers under the deep, frigid waters of a tributary of the Sabine River. Trudy, an unreconstructed hippie, would like Hap to help them recover the money so that she and Howard can donate it to Save the Whales and other worthy causes. Trudy is willing to give Hap two hundred thousand dollars of the loot for his trouble since she, Howard and their two other confederates have only a vague idea of where the money might actually be while Hap, who was born and raised in the area has a very good idea. Sexually exhausted, Hap isn't thinking all that clearly, but he agrees to at least consider the scheme. Much to Trudy's consternation, Hap immediately brings Leonard into the action, promising to share his end of the money 50-50.Much against his better judgment, Leonard agrees and what follows is an action-filled and often hilarious romp. Inevitably a scheme like this is going to go sideways almost immediately, putting everyone involved in the harebrained scheme in grave danger. It's a lot of fun watching all of this play out, and this book provides the basis for the first season of \"Hap and Leonard\" which is now playing on the Sundance Channel. I'm a huge fan of Michael K. Williams (\"The Wire\" and \"Empire Boardwalk\") who's signed on to play Leonard. For that reason alone, I'm really anxious to give the series a try."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "3.5 stars!For my Year of Lansdale project I had this audio book all lined up and then the TV show came out.

The old and reliable 'heist' story. One would think it's been done enough times already to get a bit stale and predictable. Fear not! Joe Lansdale has some surprises in store for you. And even if sometimes you feel you've heard it all before, a good storyteller will still get you hooked with a couple a sympathetic scoundrels and their sharp, hilarious banter, he would still keep you intrigued about motives and possible outcomes and he would still knock you down flat with intense, heartstopping terror before the end. I believe Joe Lansdale deserves all the accolade and literary prize nominations he gets, and \"Savage Season\" is a prime example of his style. This is only my second novel by him, but I know I will eventually try to read them all - he's that good!If I were to break the novel into easier to chew components I would settle for these archetypical building blocks: the location, the team, the sell, the heist, the split, the endgame. Location East Texas, the same sort of small, impoverished town that was covered in   The Bottoms  . Texas is commonly associated with sweltering heat, sweeping vistas of dry brush and oil rigs. Lansdale though has a soft spot for the humid lowlands and in the present novel he also throws in an atypical snow and ice winter spell. Not the best season to be outdoors looking for buried treasure. Probably one reason to call it 'savage'.  They were nothing like the Everglades of Florida or the greater swamps of Louisiana. Not nearly as many miles as either of those, but they were made up of plenty of great forest and deep water, and they were beautiful, dark and mysterious - a wonder in one eye, a terror in the other.  The Team For their first misadventure, we should probably start by getting to know the titular characters in the series.  Hap Collins  : approaching forty, college reject, former hippie peace activist who went to jail to protest the Vietnam War. Now doing oddjobs and farm work, when he can get it. He likes karate and skeet shooting, but despises guns and killing on principle. He's big, has alcohol issues and women issues, mostly courtesy of his ex-wife Trudy who can still wrap him around her little finger. Leonard Pine  : Hap's best friend and guardian angel, a Vietnam vet and a man immune to Trudy's charms (he's gay and proud of it!). Also likes karate, loves his dogs, Hank Williams, vanilla cookies and an untroubled existence. Leonard tries to act as the brakes and the voice of reason for the more impulsive Hap.Despite coming from opposing sides of the war in Vietnam, Hap and Leonard respect each other and share in a wicked sense of humour that manifests mostly in rapid fire repartees and sarcastic comebacks in high octane situations. The Sell winter is not the best of times for penniless, itinerant workers. Hap and Leonbard are just killing time, shooting at ceramic flying saucers when temptation walks in. She's tall, blonde, curvaceous with impossibly long legs and a smile that promises illicit delights. Leonard is out in a huff and Trudy is back (in Hap's bed). Soon enough though it becomes evident that a second honeymoon is not on the menu. Trudy has a business proposition, and she believes men are more open to persuasion after sex. What she wants is for Hap to help her retrieve the loot hidden somewhere in the East Texas marshes, money from a decade old bank robbery. It appears her new husband, Howard, has found out about the sunken treasure during his own stint in prison. History tends to repeat itself, and Trudy, Howard and a couple of others are still in the eco-warrior business even though the sixties are long gone. The Heist Some of Hap's neurons are still functioning, and he convinces Leonard to come along, help retrieve the money and watch over Hap's back. The two buddies get to meet Trudy's team: a sorry and amateurish lot composed of Howard, a big boned sap not much different from Hap; Chub, a chubby loser who thinks he is a psychanalist and Paco, a former homegrown terrorist, now heavily disfigured by a bomb mishap. The criminal club plans to use their share of the money for some unspecified 'good cause', probably saving the whales or stopping nuclear proliferation.To make a long story short, the team members dislike each other intensely, but somehow manage to recover part of the loot. The Split  Of course, where there's money, there's trouble and I don't think there ever was a heist movie or book where things didn't go pear-shaped after a succesful hit. Hap and Leonard are in deep s__t! The Endgame This is the part where all hell breaks loose, all bets are off and readers are reminded that Lansdale is a writer with a penchant for horror. The less I say now about the way the game is played, the better. Read it and weep! Or if you are of a more tender disposition and/or soft heart, turn around now and go watch a Disney movie. This stuff is bad for you!>><<>><<>><<>><<I wouldn't sing so loud in praise of Lansdale if he was a one trick pony. Yes, he's good at mixing humour with horror and he writes excellent action scenes, but his range is much broader. Lansdale truly shines in the confessional mode, in the unguarded moments when his actors let their guard down and reveal their core values, their most cherished dreams. Idealism was a little like Venus in the daytime. There'd been a time when I could see it. But as time went on and I needed it less and I wanted to pass on the responsibility, I had lost my ability to see it, to believe it. But now I thought I might see it again if I made an effort and looked hard enough. >><<>><<>><<>><<I am planning to continue with the Hap and Leonard series, provided they get back on their feet after the drastic pounding they got for dreaming of easy money."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677640-richard", "userReview": "I really loved The Thicket last year when I chose it to quench my thirst for a good Western read. I was impressed by how engaging the writing was. I decided this year to jump into more books by author Joe Lansdale, and I thought a good start would be his popular Texas crime series featuring his characters Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. This first novel in the series lived up to my lofty expectations!Hap & Leonard are best buddies, are minding their own business and shooting some skeet in Hap's backyard, when a cute blond heartbreaker walks back into Hap's life, offering more of that sweet love that he remembers fondly. But like any experienced femme fatale knows, most human men would agree to any post-coital request no matter how stupid. So in bed, he agrees to help her and her new man find a treasure trove of cash lost after a bank heist years ago. \n\n\"I didn't want to be anywhere near Trudy right then. I had a hunch she would have harsh words to say about me and Leonard, and I wasn't up to it. I didn't want her to get me near a bed either. She could really talk in bed, and if she talked long enough and moved certain parts of her body just right, I might agree to have Leonard shot at sunset.\"\n\n Lansdale is one of those writers that makes it seem so easy. He manages to find that balance between economic storytelling and lyrical, expressive prose; a balance that my favorite writers possess. It makes for a captivating read that's entertaining and still leaves an impression. In just this one book, Hap and Leonard become two of the most enjoyable protagonists I've come across in a crime series. They seem like two guys I'd like to be friends with and so I would be willing to go on any adventure with them in the future. In this way, they're right up there with Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins and Dennis Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro as some of my favorite crime heroes. Likeable, everyday people caught up in dark, extraordinary situations, where they have to step up and be heroes. Hap and Leonard are so different on the surface but are perfect compliments for each other, making for hilarious banter between them that makes the proceedings that much more enjoyable. Can't wait to see what craziness they get into next.\n\n\"Yea, that money could make up for a lot of missed ambitions, but without it we were nothing more than a batch of losers, standing cold and silly, empty-handed on the muddy bank of an unnamed creek.\""}, {"userName": "\u1d25 Irena \u1d25", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252054-irena", "userReview": "3.5I've heard so much about this duo and finally started this series.

Hap's ex-wife Trudy asks him for help to find some money that's been hidden for the last twenty years, he lets his best friend in on the scheme and that's the basic plot.

Una stagione selvaggia fa parte di quei libri che si leggono da soli, che non richiedono applicazione, basta seguirli in punta di dito, son pieni d\u2019azione fino a traboccare. La prima parte mi ha divertito, Hap il narratore e soprattutto Leonard, l\u2019amico suo, si prendevano gustosamente per il culo in qualit\u00e0 di reduci beatinik. Il divertimento ha preso scemare quando lo spirito degli anni '60 riesumato come pretesto, li ha infilati in un\u2018avventura prima strampalata, poi strampalatamente tragica che \u00e8 costata la vita ad un numero di personaggi da film di Tarantino. Non avendo riferimenti per giudicare questo tipo di narrativa, \u00e8 proprio al pulp di Tarantino che mi vien da paragonarla.

Not sure I agree, then it's always like that when much loved books make the transfer to the screen- see Game of Thrones, LOTR, and many more ( hence my mixed feelings about the rumoured adaptation of Dorothy Dunnett' s Lymond series, my all-time favorites). Having seen the show I had the back story filled in that's missing from the first novel but I doubt that would've mattered had I read the book first. The story is roughly similar to what plays out over six episodes of TV, with some changes. Again, that doesn't bother me. These are books I will read with pleasure simply for the wonderful relationship between Hap & Leonard. I can't get enough male friendship and will happily absorb both versions, double the fun. The East Texas setting adds colour for sure. The writing goes down easy, with dry humour and some memorable characters, e.g. Teacher, Angel and Paco. I had never heard of Hap & Leonard before finding them on Amazon Prime video, so book purists ought to be grateful their literary hero has gained wider recognition through the show. Personally, I think James Purefoy makes a fine Hap and Michael Kenneth Williams is a perfect Leonard. I was sold from the get-go with Hap & Leonard, one a cynical middle-aged former hippy who served time rather than be drafted, the other a gay black Vietnam vet. An unlikely friendship but an enduring one based on trust, dependency and mutual support, It's a kind of love though Hap is strictly hetero and Leonard only goes for men. Hap, of course, is attracted to the wrong kind of women, who inevitably let him down, though like a rejected puppy he keeps coming back for more. Leonard is only attracted to straight-looking men, though he says Hap is not his type. I was reminded of Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove, McCrae & Call, two very different men who make a perfect team, somehow incomplete without the other; though outside relationships sometimes get in the way they always come back together, each having the other's back and best interests at heart."}, {"userName": "Danger", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5184971-danger", "userReview": "This dude is such a good writer that I sat down immediately after finishing this book and began writing myself and my output was 25% better than it normally is.

Lansdale's novels and short stories are very visceral reads. When Lansdale writes action, you can smell the sweat and taste the dirt. He knows how to keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Add onto that, a very sharp wit and you rarely come away from one of the author's stales disappointed.Savage Season is the first of a series of suspense novels featuring Happ Collins and Leonard Pine; the first one I have read, but I am eager to devour the rest of the series. Happ and Leonard seems like an odd couple, a white straight man and a black gay biker, but their rapport and politically incorrect slings at each other sound as natural as it comes in real life. Stir in the rural surroundings of East Texas, Happ's unlucky love life, burn-out sixties radicals, and a fortune hunt for illegal loot. It has been a long time since I read a mystery novel that kept me so involved. Funny like Hiaasen, gritty like Spillane and uniquely Lansdale, you will wonder why the author is not a household name."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "SAVAGE SEASON is a fast-paced, hard-boiled suspense novel about two hardworking friends, Hap and Leonard, who can't resist the opportunity to make a quick $200,000 a piece. All they have to do is find the money that is supposedly buried somewhere in an icy river where Hap grew up. But nothing comes easy for these two and it isn't long before they're not only dealing with vicious weather but also greedy and psychotic humans.This is a short little book that packs a punch. It is unflinchingly and sometimes painfully graphic but the characters of Hap and Leonard, who both have a really nasty sense of humor, provide much needed comic relief. I don't want to give too much away here but this book isn't going to become one of my favorites, even though I enjoyed most of it, because of a certain horrendous plot twist towards the end of the story that tore out my heart."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "A pretty decent crime caper noir, my first Lansdale, feeling like a cross between the wise cracking Elmore Leonard and the more brutal Don Winslow with a pair of \"heroes\" in Hap and Leonard that are a joy to read.It was Hap and Leonard that saved this one for me, the two of them together are funny, conflicted and real, a great channel for Lansdale's obvious talent with dialogue; providing the kind of banter and realism that Leonard would be proud of.That aside, for a slim novel it felt like it was dragging for the middle 60 or so pages which dragged the overall enjoyment down and caused me to distance myself from the brutal ending through a kind of boredom brought on by the behaviour of the ridiculous 60's throwback renegades."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "Talk about instantly falling in love with a writer\u2019s work...by the time the first exchange of genuinely funny and completely natural-feeling banter between Hap Collins and his good buddy Leonard Pine was over I knew I was into some really, really good shit. Lansdale manages to pack lethal doses of dark humor, brutal violence, social commentary, and the intoxicating East Texas setting into this relatively short book. The story itself kept me glued to the book long enough to finish it in a single sitting, which is really saying something considering I have a horrid attention span, but the real gold here is in Hap and Leonard\u2019s friendship and chemistry. I straight up CHALLENGE anyone to not like these guys.Aforementioned plot consists of Hap\u2019s ex Trudy showing up at his place with a strange story about a heist gone wrong, after which a boat carrying the loot is scuttled and left at the bottom of one of the many rivers/inlets/whatever there are in East Texas. I\u2019ve never been to Texas at all, but I gotta say it feels like I visited it after this one. Without slowing the pace an iota with overlong descriptions of the setting, Lansdale makes you feel like you were there, dealing with the brutal heat and icy cold, the humidity and the maze-like swamps along with Hap and Leonard. Anyways, Trudy brings Hap in on the plan she has with her current dude to find the boat and dredge up the sunken cash. Sounds easy, but you hope and know it\u2019s not gonna be.I really can\u2019t overstate how funny these books are. With most humor in books, I\u2019ll just internally say \u201cthat was clever\u201d or maybe grin, but I\u2019ve definitely found myself laughing out loud at some of the dialogue and slapstick ridiculousness. Lansdale\u2019s comedic timing is pitch-perfect. Even his metaphors go beyond the usual necessary wittiness for the genre and are just too over-the-top to not laugh at. I\u2019d post some here but that\u2019d be spoiling the fun for anyone that wants to read this stuff. Let me just say that in a lot of cases he matches and even bests the dead king of crime novels, Raymond Chandler when it comes to hilarious observations. That said, even with all the humor and funny situations in this book when shit turns serious it feels it. The violence and peril are just as gripping and morbid as any other writer\u2019s.I was gonna give this one five stars, but I already read Mucho Mojo and it\u2019s even better, so I know that Lansdale can do better than this one. Still, as far as first novels in a series go you can\u2019t really do much better than this. Everything feels gelled and natural, and absolutely never ham-handed or contrived. It just reeks of creativity and originality. I\u2019m ultra-stoked there are so many more books in the series, as it would have been an absolute crime against humanity to stop writing these books after just one. These characters just cry out to be written and read about. I happily recommend this to all my Goodreads friends, except for the ones who don\u2019t enjoy large doses of obscenities, sex, and violence in their fiction.

Hap is a white heterosexual former idealist who went to prison for making a point out of dodging the draft, and Leonard is a black gay Vietnam veteran. When Hap's ex-wife, Trudy, comes to them with a sketchy proposition for making a lot of money fast, Hap's desire for Trudy combines with his and Leonard's need for living expenses, making the opportunity too good to pass up and drawing them into a dangerous scheme that proves to have too many variables.This is probably best described as a backwoods-noir-caper-thriller. It had a lot to like, including two likable yet grumpy anti-heroes that crack wise non-stop, a flawed and dangerous supporting cast, a plot that was simple yet suspenseful and difficult to predict, an interesting backstory involving American idealism and how it changed people in different ways, and a satisfying dose of sudden violence. Lansdale's prose is quite good and has a little of that classic \"private eye\" feel as we see the world through Hap's cynical point of view. This is one more series I'm sold on.I caught the news that the television adaptation is coming (of course it is) and after reading the casting, I got stuck on picturing Hap and Leonard as James Purefoy and Michael Kenneth Williams in the roles.

Lansdale bedient seine Fans seit 1990 mit der Reihe um die beiden Kumpels Hap und Leonard, einen wei\u00dfen Kriegsdienstverweigerer und einen schwarzen Vietnamveteranen, die beide in einem staubigen Kaff in Ost-Texas leben. Angelehnt an die Hardboiled-Stories eines Jim Thompson oder James M. Cain, entwirft er das meist zutiefst ironische Szenario einer texanischen Welt, in der seine Protagonisten zwar gerne leben, das aber von Gewalt, Rassismus und immer dunklen Geheimnissen gepr\u00e4gt ist. Anders als in seinen Horror-, Science-Fiction- und den apokalyptischen Romanen, deren Ideen und Handlungen gelegentlich vollkommen irre daher kommen, h\u00e4lt er sich in seinen Kriminalromanen, denen die Hap & Leonard-Reihe zuzuordnen ist, inhaltlich selten mit originellen Ideen auf. Stil und Atmosph\u00e4re sind alles, Inhalt nichts \u2013 oder fast nichts, ganz im Sinne des gro\u00dfen Raymond Chandler.Eine sch\u00f6ne, aber gef\u00e4hrliche Frau, ein undurchsichtiger Haufen halbseidener Gestalten, die Beute eines Bankraubs, die irgendwo auf dem Grund der Bottoms von Texas \u2013 einem \u00c4quivalent der Everglades Floridas und der Bayous von Louisiana \u2013 liegen soll und schon hat er alle Zutaten, um seine Helden auf einen ultragef\u00e4hrlichen und schlie\u00dflich ultrabrutalen Trip zu schicken, den nur wenige der Beteiligten \u00fcberleben werden. Nichts davon ist neu, nichts davon war schon 1990 neu, aber Lansdale versteht es \u2013 und das macht einen guten Neo-Noir-Autoren eben aus \u2013 eine altbekannte Mischung mit durchaus originellen Details anzureichern und das alles so zu erz\u00e4hlen, da\u00df der Leser sehr gut unterhalten wird. Vor allem stattet er seine Figuren mit interessanten Lebensl\u00e4ufen aus. Hap, der nicht, wie so viele, einfach vor der Einberufung nach Kanada oder auf ein College geflohen ist, sondern sich hat ins Gef\u00e4ngnis werfen lassen, um seine Haltung zum Krieg zu demonstrieren, ist ein Sp\u00e4thippie, den der Lauf der Dinge statt in eine akademischen Karriere in Handlangerjobs auf den Feldern seiner Heimat verschlagen hat; Leonard, der den 60ern, die Hap zwar nicht verherrlicht, deren Ideale aber hochzuhalten er sich bem\u00fcht, kaum etwas Positives abgewinnen kann, ist ein nahkampferprobter Ex-Soldat, schwul und ein Freund der Country-Musik, womit er John Connollys eiskaltem Killer Louis aus dessen \u201aBird\u2018 Parker-Reihe Modell gestanden haben d\u00fcrfte. Das ungleiche Paar frotzelt sich unabl\u00e4ssig an, nimmt sich auf den Arm und h\u00e4lt doch zusammen.Im vorliegenden ersten Band der Serie, WILDER WINTER (Original: SAVAGE SEASON; 1990), werden die beiden mit Trudy konfrontiert, Haps Ex-Frau und Gelegenheitsfreundin, die ihn mit ihren Eskapaden immer wieder in ausgiebige Saufgelage treibt. Sie ist diejenige, die ihren Ex-Mann um Hilfe bei der Bergung der Beute eines Bank\u00fcberfalls bittet. Nat\u00fcrlich kann sie Leonard nicht leiden, was durchaus auf Gegenseitigkeit beruht, wei\u00df der doch um die Verfasstheit seines Freundes immer dann, wenn Trudy wieder in dessen Leben auftaucht. Und es kommt wie es kommen mu\u00df: Nat\u00fcrlich spielt keiner der Beteiligten \u2013 u.a. eine Truppe ehemaliger Links-Terroristen, angelehnt an die Weathermen und ein ebenso bedrohliches wie l\u00e4cherliches Gangsterp\u00e4rchen \u2013 fair, jeder kocht sein eigenes S\u00fcppchen und schlie\u00dflich m\u00fcssen sich die beiden Freunde nur noch ihrer Haut erwehren. Lansdale l\u00e4sst seine Figuren in endlosen Dialogen einander aufziehen und beleidigen, wobei letzteres oft allzu klischeehaft daherkommt, zumindest in der deutschen \u00dcbersetzung. \u00dcberhaupt sind die Entwicklungen, die die Handlung nimmt, allzu erwartbar und also auch die Explosion der Gewalt, auf die das Finale fast zwangsl\u00e4ufig zusteuert. Dieses Finale hat es dann allerdings in sich.Doch sollte man sich nicht t\u00e4uschen lassen. Lansdale versteht es, seinem Text subkutan, jenseits der Klischees, jenseits des Sarkasmus, durchaus bedenkenswerte Reflexionen einzuflechten. Da sind einerseits die spezifischen Themen dieses Bandes \u2013 die Sixties, der Terror, die Frage, ob man Diebe beklauen \u201edarf\u201c \u2013 andererseits die generellen Themen wie der allgegenw\u00e4rtige, oft beil\u00e4ufige Rassismus und die Gewalt, die den amerikanischen Alltag pr\u00e4gen. Lansdale verhandelt diese Dinge oft wie nebenbei, aber dennoch mit dem entsprechenden Ernst. Er versteht es, an den richtigen Stellen die Ironie zur Seite zu schieben und das aufscheinen zu lassen, was sie bedeuten. Was es bedeutet, ein schwuler Schwarzer zu sein in einer strukturell immer feindlich gesinnten Umgebung, wie es die S\u00fcdstaaten der USA f\u00fcr einen wie ihn nun einmal sind, was es bedeutet, in einer Kultur zu leben, die Nehmen um jeden Preis zu einem Wert an sich erhebt und die Mittel, mit denen man nimmt, als zweitrangig betrachtet; mehr noch \u2013 die den, der sich mit allen Mitteln durchsetzt, auch noch belohnt. Wie jeder gute Thrillerautor gelingt es ihm dabei, diese Anliegen eben nicht didaktisch wertvoll als Metakonzept zu pr\u00e4sentieren, sondern eingebettet in Handlung, Dialog und dargeboten mit der n\u00f6tigen Schnoddrigkeit, dem Leser seine Sicht der Dinge also eher unterzuschieben, als sie ihm aufzudr\u00e4ngen.Zu guter Letzt darf man auch nicht \u00fcbersehen, da\u00df Lansdale da, wo es n\u00f6tig ist, schlicht \u00fcbertreibt. Wenn Hap und Leonard sich schlie\u00dflich mit wirklich aller Gewalt zur Wehr setzen, dabei weder Scheu noch Skrupel zeigen und somit selber zu durchaus ambivalenten Figuren mutieren, pr\u00e4sentiert der Autor das derart \u00fcberzogen, da\u00df es einerseits comichaft wirkt, andererseits aber schon eine dringliche Wirkung entfaltet. Man kann anhand von Lansdales Romanen gut die Entwicklungen des modernen zum postmodernen, reflektiven Noirthriller verfolgen, kann ablesen, wie die Klassiker auf ihn wirken und wie er wiederum auf jene gewirkt hat, die das Genre weiter vorangetrieben haben in den vergangenen Dekaden.Doch genug der Analyse, denn im Kern hat man es hier mit einem guten, eben nicht sonderlich originellen aber sehr unterhaltsamen Thriller zu tun, den man schnell weg lesen und dann auch schnell wieder vergessen kann. Und so soll sie ja auch sein, die Hardboiled-Schule amerikanischer Pr\u00e4gung."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "Fun with a capital F, now I'm a Fan with a capital F, both of Joe Lansdale, and the Hap and Leonard series, of which this is the first.

It helps if the ex is a sex bomb and Our Hero hasn't quite gotten over her. So it goes in Savage Season, the debut of East Texas good-ol'-boys Hap Collins and Leonard Pine.The troublesome ex in this story is Trudy, Hap's ex-flower-child ex-wife, who, despite having broken Hap's heart years ago, needs only to twitch her well-arranged rump to get him back into bed and wrapped around her ______ [insert body part]. She's now tangled up with some other '60s flotsam who are fishing for a million dollars in money stolen from a crooked bank; could Hap come out to play and maybe help them find the dough? Of course he can. He drags Leonard into the scheme, which of course goes completely off the rails and leads to murder and mayhem.Hap (the narrator) is good, easy-going company. His written voice goes perfectly with a drawl, but he's not your typical redneck. He was a liberal college boy in the late 1960s until he let himself get sent to prison for draft evasion, a protest against The Man also pitched to warm Trudy's heart. Now he's a near-burnout scratching by working in the rose fields. This background lets his observations get a tad highfalutin' at times without breaking character.Some reviewers wonder how Hap ended up best friends with Leonard, a black gay Republican (back when those could still exist) who went to Vietnam. I can see it, though -- Leonard's the flintier, harder-headed of the two, the realist to Hap's dreamer, the cynic who can try to keep Hap's good nature from getting the best of him. The two of them are well-matched, though Leonard usually gets the best lines.Trudy and Howard, her most recent former lover, are the most completely drawn secondary characters; each has a distinct voice and manner. Trudy, while not quite Jessica Rabbit, does have some leporine qualities, and beyond her lush sensuality it's often hard to see why Hap's such a sucker for her. The rest of the would-be revolutionaries, while distinct, never quite rise beyond being types. Soldier and Angel, who appear late in the story and cause much of that mayhem mentioned earlier, rarely rise above being standard-issue sociopaths, though they remain true to their particular personality quirks.The settings are well-described, atmospheric, and show the author's familiarity with the area along Texas' swampy eastern fringe. This extends to his portrayal of the downmarket side of local society, which he describes with sympathy but no romanticism.My main beef with the story is that it starts as something of a caper, then in Act 3 becomes a hard-boiled thriller with considerable violence (including torture) and a not-insignificant body count, much of it tallied up by Our Heroes. I was able to stay in the saddle when this horse began to buck, but others might suffer some whiplash from the fairly sudden change in tone.How does the Sundance series Hap and Leonard stack up to Savage Season? I came to the latter after watching the former. The two track closely through the first half of the book, then steadily diverge as they approach their respective climaxes. The TV series gives a lot more play to Soldier and Angel, which both fleshes out their characters and brings a more thrillerish vibe to the entire story. If you read the book, you can watch the show without being disappointed by the changes.Savage Season is a solid introduction to a personable pair of common-Joe protagonists who can navigate the gray area between straight and crooked. The series now includes nine novels and several short stories and novellas, as well as that TV show (Season 2 now in production), which shows that plenty of people have taken a shine to these ol' boys and their hangdog world. If any of this sounds good to you, pop open a Pearl and peruse this shortish (178 pages) novel -- you might find something you'll like."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7291253-mike", "userReview": "First time with Hap and Leonard, and what a trip.
