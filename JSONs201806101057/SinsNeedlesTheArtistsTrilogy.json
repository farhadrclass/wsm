I'm saying this now because I know I'm about to be the black sheep when it comes to Sins & Needles. So before everyone in my Goodreads friends list comes out with their torches and pitch forks, guys, I can totally see why you all love this book.Alright, now that we've got the basics out of the way, strap in because I'm about to light it up. BTW, yeah, spoilers 'cause that's how I roll.Sins & Needles started off very strong for me. The main character, Ellie Watt, has a great presence and voice. She's someone I'd even consider badass... at first. Obviously, her profession demands nothing less with her being a con artist and all. But for once in her life, Ellie feels like she's had enough and goes home to Palm Valley. It's there where Ellie must now face the ultimate human challenge: Getting a job. But just as her first and only attempt fails, in comes Camden McQueen. Ellie is instantly attracted to this tattooed stud-muffin, but doesn't recognize him as the bullied goth from high school (and former best friend). Anyway, they hit it off and somehow end up on this wild Bonnie and Clyde type adventure.Up until around 50%, I was feelin' this book somethin' serious. Like I said, Ellie has a great voice and the writing wasn't bad either (even though I do think it was stronger in the first half). But somehow along the way I found myself caring less and less about finishing the book. Here are three reasons why my happy cat died along the way complete with pop culture references FTW (because obviously I was bored enough to soundtrack my review):1. \"Gypsy Woman, stay the hell away from me.\"Ellie is one special character. She makes a living from conning men out of money left and right. She meets them on internet dating sites (She fed me lies while she cast her spells...), pretends to be their girlfriend for months (Save me, she's a liar...\u00a0)\u00a0and then makes off with their cash (Gypsy woman robbed me of my best...).\u00a0Your ability to love this novel is really going to be dependent on if you can relate to her situation and past. Or at the very least, sympathize with her.\u00a0I thought I could. I mean, I tried really, really hard to. I liked the idea of a con artist trying to go legit and finding love along the way. It's just the way Ellie went about it that bothered me.So check it, Ellie goes back home and tries to get a job at ONE LOCATION, fails, sees Camden McMoneyPants walk in, and says, \"Fuck it. I'll just rob him.\" (Trifling friend, indeed.)\u00a0\u00a0Actually, I kinda am...I know, I know. It's all she knows and she's used to just taking from everyone else, but that is no excuse to me. And honestly, I think Ellie was just being lazy and I can't stand lazy people. I wanted to shake her and make her get off her ass and get a job. But no, instead she tries to rob Camden because obviously that's way easier and more logical.But wait! Ellie is JUSTIFIED because the world has wronged her. I get that Ellie was a flawed character with a lot of issues, but hasn't anyone ever told her life isn't fair? *this is me playing the world's smallest violin* I understand that Halle was trying to show the other side of the coin where a person doesn't make the right decisions. My issue is that I couldn't understand WHY she was making them.2. \"I always put myself in destructive situations.\"POP QUIZ!If you had a tragic accident due to a career choice made by your parents, what would you do?A. Choose a different career when you grew up.B. Choose the same career path of your parents because of... reasons.Guess what Ellie chooses? That's right, B! Makes complete sense, right? (I\u2019ve got that lefty curse...\u00a0Where everything I do is flipped...\u00a0And awkwardly reversed) But it gets better because this is Ellie-fucking-Watt we're talking about.So Ellie's parents tried to con a drug lord and she ends up paying the price by getting acid poured all over her leg. I'm not sure I would go back to the same drug lord with the intention of conning him alone, because, ahem, he's a DRUG LORD. But she finds love in one of the drug lord's right hand men, Javier. Surprise: it doesn't work out and she steals his money and car. Look at your life, Ellie. Look at your choices! The girl is addicted to Making Bad Decisions. Intervention, I say!I see...You would think after that huge fail she would quit while she was ahead, but nooooo. She goes on to con more and more men, leaving a trail of bread crumbs until eventually her past catches up to her.Now, there are two really big bones I gotta pick with Ellie here. First, why does she never throw away her cell phone? What kind of con artist keeps the same phone from con to con? A shitty one. (Somebody get my phone...\u00a0So I can throw it in a public pool and watch it float...) Second, how did Javier continue finding her? Her cell phone is my obvious guess, but it was clear the cell phone was not even thought of in this case and Javier seemed to locate her a little too well. All the reader is given is some one liner from Mr. Creep, saying he'd always find her. Sheesh, I can't believe she thought that was romantic at some point. And yet, she never fully takes responsibility for her actions. (I don\u2019t look innocent with this big, big mess on...)3. \"I want your love and I want your revenge...\"I really don't think novels with dysfunctional relationships are for me. I'm a firm believer in the idea that if you don't have your own shit together, perhaps you should not get involved with someone else's. This might have something to do with how well I understand them, which is virtually nil. My only exposure to them is Fifty Shades of Grey and\u00a0a page of Beautiful Disaster.\u00a0I'm sure we all can agree that those characters need to sit down with someone and get some well-needed advice.No, not you, Tay-Tay.\u00a0*skip track*Ellie's uncle warns her about getting involved with Camden and urges her to focus on getting on her feet. That makes sense considering it was her entire point of returning home and begging for a place to stay. But right after Camden discovers Ellie's plan and double crosses her, they go on the run together. Ellie's off in her corner of the hotel hating Camden and Camden is off is his corner hating Ellie and secretly thinking of raping her so that he can humiliate her just as she humiliated him in high school. (I want your drama...\u00a0The touch of your hand...) Wait, what? I'm raging right about now. Are you telling me this Grown Ass Man is still angry about something that happened YEARS AGO in high school? But wait, he also loves her. Does your head hurt? Great. Here's an ice pack.But that's not even the half of it. Ellie in turn resents Camden because she got caught trying to rob him. She keeps saying things like, \"How could he do that to me?\" And I'm like, WTF, dude. You broke and entered his house and tried to steal his money. Also, she loves him and he's howt and she can't stop staring at his abs because, yeah, there goes his shirt... again. (I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand...)So somewhere along the lines they stop hating each other so much because, due to Ellie's stupidity, a character dies. Then she's all, \"loosen up my buttons, baby,\" sexy time on a car and declarations of love.\u00a0(Love-love-love I want your love)\"I hate you, Ellie Watt,\" he whispered, lips coming closer to mine, \"because I still love you after all these years.\u201dSo all the while I'm having this internal \"discussion\", if you will, with Ellie. I'm grilling her about this \"love\" that she has with Camden.\"What is your deal?!\" I scream at her, grabbing her shoulders.(It\u2019s the way I\u2019m feeling I just can\u2019t deny...)\"Oh, really? You love him, huh? And where did you find this love? I bet it was\u00a0In A Hopeless Place.\"(But I\u2019ve gotta let it go...)That's a yes, isn't it?I might not be an expert on love and relationships, but their... whatever-you-wanna-call-it... doesn't make sense to me. But I get it. Sometimes you can't decide who you love or whatnot. However, seeking revenge on someone you claim you've been in love with for years? Does not compute.\u00a0This is probably an indication of where my personal beliefs just got in the way of sympathizing with the two characters. I couldn't suspend logic long enough to simply go with it.So, yeah. Not my kind of book. I couldn't relate to the story, the characters and their subsequent decisions despite the strong start.\u00a0Clearly, I am in the minority with not loving Sins & Needles, so feel free to tell me to kick rocks, blow bubbles, throw stones and STFU.More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog."}, {"userName": "Fathima", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5799807-fathima", "userReview": "OH MY FUDGEKNUCKLES !!!!WHAT DID I JUST READ ??!!! I ... I'M .... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY HERE ... I ...  I need to think and calm down before I ....\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A big thank you to Karina Halle for providing me an ARC for an honest review !!! \n\u201cI hate you Ellie Watt,\u201d he whispered, lips coming closer to mine, \u201cbecause I still love you after all these years.\u201d Shock seized me first, the butterflies shredding me to pieces. Then he grabbed my face and kissed me, hard.\nSins & Needles will be Karina Halle's first release of 2013 and all I can say right now is ......Bring out the fireworks my peeps , coz this woman is ROCKIN GOOD !!!  Woohoo , god , I don't even know where to begin this review with ! I know , it obviously has to be from the beginning and all but .... The hell man , I cant even think straight righ now ! I've been excited to read this ever since Karina announced it , and the fact that I got to read an ARC of it is just a sliver lining on the cloud that I'm floating on right now !!! Yes , I'm on a Karina-fied high right now ! Damn , this woman and her work turns me into a junkie ! And I'm already craving my next fix .....\n*sigh* okay then , lets move on with the review shall we ...\n\n This will be the last time \n ... That's exactly what Ellie Watt tells herself when she's in the middle of conning someone or paying up for her conning abilities . Ofcourse , we all know that wont be the case anytime soon . Escaping from one of her such Oh-shit-I-fucked-up-with-the-wrong-man situation Ellie finds herself driving back to her hometown . The place that was her refuge and her hell at the same time . Uncle Jim being Ellie's only saving grace every time she or her family needs saving . But Uncle Jim's kinda reluctant to help her but gives her time to settle down for some days and find herself some sort of an employment which does not involve her getting into anymore trouble . Ellie decides to get a job at a Coffee shop , somethings better than nothing right , something a little too inconspicuous . And that's where trouble walks in the form of Camden McQueen ! \n Well , that's one trouble I'd handle any day . Ellie and Camden ... they have a history . A history that did not quite end on a good note . But hey , that was the past and this is now . Right ? Hmm , lets just say somethings are not forgotten that easily . Some wounds definitely know how to resurface when you least expect them . I'm gonna have to stop talking here , because If I continue , I'll probably develop a verbal diarrhea or something . That blurb up there , yeah , that doesn't even begin to cover what you're in for once the book crosses that stage !\nHell , It was one even before we could reach that stage ! But still ....\n My thoughts : \nSins & Needles is an absolute   Karina Halle is an expert when it comes to creating characters who are fucked up and story lines which are messed up ! To put it correctly I'll say she creates the best characters ever ! They cant get any more 'human' than this . \nWe are pretty unpredictable and our decisions about life and the choices we make are always based upon the situations we are made to exist with . Ellie and Camden are such two characters who are living their life with the choices they've made . They may not seem right to us , hell , they might even end up looking down right suicidal but that's just how these two roll .  Ellie  is contradiction on legs ! She has scars that have probably governed her life so far , reminders of where she's been . But the choices that she makes here , has turned me into a contradictory mess ! I started off unsure of whether I would like her or not . But holy hell , she is FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC !!!!\nAnd then there is Camden ... Camden fucking McQueen ! He ... He may not be your knight in a shining armor but he sure as hell isn't a douchebag in a tin foil ! Broken on the inside , add to that a sinfully sexy epitome of art .... he can instantly turn into a creep who can scare the bejeebus out of you !  OMG that's such a turn on !!!! \n \nHe is just delicious ! \n My Playlist : \nI absolutely lurve music ! And they always keep me company whilst I'm reading . And this book was no exception . Karina Halle has quite an exquisite 'Desert Playlist' that bodes well with the feel of this book . Presenting to you my 'Its-sexy-and-you-know-it' playlist , because this book is all kinds of sexy !!!1) Fizgig - Chevelle 2) Paradise Circus - Massive Attack 3) Inertia Creeps - Massive Attack 4) The Lonely boy - Black Keys 5) On Demon Wings - Bohren & der club of gore 6) Endless - Dave Gahan 7) Straight out of Line - Godsmack8) Oddfellows - The Tomahawk  9) White Angel - The lion 10) Here With Me - Dido 11) On Every Streets - Dire Straits 12) The last Goodbye - The Kills  13) One and the same - Rob Dougan 14) Roadhouse Blues - The Doors 15) Wish - Nine Inch Nails 16) Even Deeper - Nine Inch Nails 17) Me, I'm not - Nine Inch Nails Enjoy ! ;)What I really enjoy about Karina Halle's writing and story telling technique is that not only does she create some pretty real and genuine characters , she also knows how to keep a reader engrossed in the world she creates for these characters . Sins and Needles is her first Dark Contemporary romance and the woman sure knows how to spin one hell of a tale . It is dark , edgy , uberly sexy that tends to seep into your bones and stick to you like second skin ! Relatable and Real , Sins and Needles is a 110% movie material . Oozing action , adventure , humor , drama , romance and steamy sex the book is a definite page-turner that's bound to keep you glued to the edge of your seats till the very last page . So guys and gals , grab those popcorns , soda cans and candy floss sit back and enjoy your ride !"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "[All the late night bargains have been struckBetween the satin beaus and their bellesPrehistoric garbage trucks Have the city to themselvesEchoes, roars, dinosaursThey're all doing the monster mashAnd most of the taxis, most of the whoresAre only taking calls for cash\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Baba  ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669232-baba", "userReview": "[kidnapped Camden's ex and son and Ellie refused to call the cops.

I swear, it was like watching one of my favorite Tarantino movies, except it wasn't a movie, it was a book and it's the very first time a book has ever made me feel that way. The story kept me enthralled the entire time, and I loved every minute of it. From shady drug lords to sexy tattoo artists to the maffia and visits to a casino, this book had everything in it to earn itself a place on my \"favorites of 2013\"-list (although the year has only just started...). There was action, suspense, humor and romance (but not at all in a clich\u00e9-way) and to top it all, the story was accompanied by an awesome soundtrack!!!Sins & Needles is the story of a girl named Ellie Watt --\n\"I'm not a bad. The world is bad, and I'm just trying to survive in it.\"\nEllie Watt is not just any other girl, she's a con artist and an excellent one at that. She's spent her entire life being on the run from the people she's framed and she's spent her entire life being someone else...\n\n\"I don't think I'd ever gone on a vacation my whole life. I was always working, always on. It was a full-time job pretending to be someone else.\"\n\nNow, Ellie has decided it is time for her to go back to her roots, spent some time with her uncle, commit one final scam and maybe start a new life away from the troubles that come along with being on the run the entire time. \n\n\"This will be the last time. I've said that before. I've said it a lot. I've said it while talking to myself in the mirror like some Tarantino clich\u00e9.\"\n\nWhat she didn't expect was for her former high school friend, Camden McQueen to still be in the same town they grew up in...Camden McQueen --Once upon a time, Camden used to be a freak, he used to be the most tormented kid in high school and he used to dress himself as a goth (long hair, black painted nails and long leather coat included) but now... Now, Camden has become a very attractive, successful tattoo artist (he even had an appearance on Kat Von D's LA Ink) and in no way, this Camden resembles the young, weird-looking boy he once used to be.\n\n\"He was like a living, breathing painting on an all-male canvas.\"\n\nIn high school, Camden used to have a crush on Ellie, but she never really returned his feelings... Now, with Camden being so successful, Ellie has found herself the perfect target of her new and hopefully final scam. She hopes to use the feelings he had for her to make the scam an easy job. But what seems like a done deal, turns out to be a whole lot more difficult than anyone could have ever expected... What follows next is a roller coaster ride of events--\nThe story is fast-paced and constantly keeps you on edge. Whenever you think you've figured it out, something unexpected happens, that will make you re-evaluate your opinion about everything you've just read and all the people involved in it.And that ending...I mean, I completely get that authors make use of cliffhangers to keep the audience on the edge of their seat and it's probably a good thing because it makes us crave the next part of the story even more...But that ending....\nIt left me speechless and wishing that the next part in the series would come out like RIGHT NOW!!!!But, either way, I still LOVED this book and I would recommend reading it to EVERYONE because it really has a bit of everything in it and it's the kind of story, I think, all kinds of readers will be able to relate to. Sins & Needles was my very first book by Karina Halle and I already know it won't be my last!!!!5 UNIQUE and ACTION-FILLED STARS!!!!****"}, {"userName": "Ana ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13346584-ana", "userReview": "I decided to torture myself this weekend.

Sins & Needles is a story about drug lords, con artists, the Mafia, and a sexy tattoo artist. It's a story about redemption...justification. It's a story that perhaps seems a little unbelievable. But isn't that what makes fiction so amazing? There's no rules, anything can happen, anything goes. It's like Quentin Tarantino & Martin Scorsese wrote a book and had Kristen Ashley and M. Leighton edit. A hot, sexy, romantic, action packed book. I won't give a lot away about the plot because experiencing it raw is half the fun, but I will say that the characters are nothing short of perfect. Ellie is a kick ass, tell it like it is, con artist. When she's not being kick ass, she's saying things that are...\nGet your head out of your vagina, I told myself and sat up in the chair a little straighter.\nI mean who hasn't thought that!? Then there's...\nI pried my hands off of it and reached out. Seregei, my future fake husband, wasn't short, but I had long arms and as I pushed aside his gut, I found his balls\nAnd of course the banter....\nI glared at him. \"Is the gun really necessary?\"\"No,\" he admitted. \"It's just fun to have one.\"\"Like an extra penis,\" I mused.He smiled unkindly. \"Something like that.\"\nCamden's transformation from sweet goth friend to tattooed, take me in the grass, alpha-male was toe curling. The sexual tension was palpable and the pace was gripping. It swept me away, entertained me, and left me...left me...OH MY GOD, I can't believe how it left me. The ending killed me and the sequel better be released...yesterday!! Not just because of how I was left hanging, but everything between Ellie and Camden was perfect. The perfect blend of push and pull. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. The perfect blend of making love and f**king. Sometimes you just need to get lost in the unbelievable. Get lost in the crazy. Get lost in fiction.

Because then you start thinking of all the other 5-stars you've given, and it just doesn't compare. You don't want it to be compared. This was one of them. Having read a copy the minute it was made available, there were no reviews or feedback yet, giving me absolutely zero expectations, and I. Was. Blown. Away! (!!) I have both been dying to, and dreading, reviewing this book, because I want to just pour my heart out, but at the same time I'm afraid nothing I say can do it justice. So... it may not completely make sense, you have been warned.First and foremost, this is not a young adult (or New Adult) book. It's a fully adult contemporary novel. We get introduced to two of the most phenomenal (and broken) characters I have ever come upon. The character development in this book is unsurpassable. Our protagonist, Ellie, carved her way into the deepest crevices of my heart. I became in tuned to her thoughts and emotions as if they were my own. Her scars, both physical and emotional, become a palpable part of this novel. To layer her even more, we regularly get taken into her past where we see what she has been through; how she was damaged and emotionally beaten into the person she is today. These chapters are written in the third person, showing us exactly what Ellie thinks of her younger self--with a detachment. This gives her character incredible depth; a driving force to her current situation, her current state of mind. Before I start on Camden, let me give you Karina's inspired by visualization:If you are even able to get your eyes off of that picture to read the rest of this review, I can tell you that you heart will be in shreds when this book is over. I don't think I've ever been infatuated with a character as much as I am with Camden. He can eat crackers in my bed anytime! Oh let's face it, I want to eat them off of him, and you will want to, too! *fans self* Ok. Besides being a walking sex-on-a-stick, Camden is a masterfully created tortured soul, broken by his past and so so passionate about everything he takes on. I'm telling you, bringing characters to life like this does not happen very often. These people are REAL. They are 100% completely genuine. Together, they work! They just do! Plain and simple. It's not always pretty--only imagine what you get when you put two tormented individuals together. Their relationship is rocky, and it's as frustrating as it is smoking hot sometimes, but it will tear your heart out. The ending: it broke me. I was a complete mess.

A liar. A thief. An unredeemable soul. You can't be reformed. You can't be saved. You'll die trying to make the world pay for what it did to you. And you'll die alone.\"Readers,the story of these two flawed people is something you won't be forgetting anytime soon.And you have no inkling about what is to come next.Someone's about to enter.A new story will unfold.And by the end,you'll be left reeling.Javier.So Readers,prepare yourself for the onslaught that is.....\n\nSins & Needles.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------My thoughts--I hated Ellie and her weakness for always choosing the easy path,the wrong path.I hated her for trying to justify her actions.I hated her for blaming others.I hated her for wearing her scars as a badge.Using them as an excuse while choosing the wrong things,using them to justify her actions.Camden too choose the wrong path.And there's this last individual.A beast.A monster.So what did I like?I liked Ellie and Cam's journey towards redemption.Both of them still have a long way to go.And I have no idea,whether the last one can be redeemed or not.Along with the twists and turns,suspense and drama,Karina Halle has done a wonderful job in portraying this dark side of human nature.The side which lives on spite.Which is capable of hating with a passion.Which lives for revenge.Capable of ruining others for gain,and never looking back.And now I'm breathlessly waiting for.....\nPerhaps love can be their redemption after all.\n----------------------------------------------------------That's all for now,Readers.Ta-Ta!!"}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "She is a con artist...That\u2019s what Ellie Watt,with the thousands of other names,is..After a fake bride scam goes wrong she goes back to her childhood town to rebuild her life legitimately....

The world is bad and I\u2019m just trying to survive in it.\u201d\nThis was SUCH a good book \u2013 absolutely compelling from the first page right through to the end with an ending to leave you positively salivating for the next part.This is the story of Ellie, Eden, whatever she is calling herself the day you meet her. She is a liar, a con artist, a fake virgin bride, a cheater, a thief \u2013 her parents would be so proud. She is the subject of an upbringing by two grifters, badly scarred on her leg by one of her parents\u2019 cons gone wrong and we join her returning to the only place she ever came close to calling home, Palm Valley to visit her uncle Jim, the only person in the world who appear to care for her. She is not a classic heroine by any stretch of the imagination but I learned to love her despite screaming with frustration at some of her decisions. I\u2019d like to say \u2013 She ain\u2019t bad, she\u2019s just drawn that way but she is totally badass but she just doesn\u2019t know any other way to be. She\u2019s guarded, hostile, isolated \u2013 she cuts a bit of a lonely figure but I couldn\u2019t help but warm to her. There\u2019s immense sadness and the horrific scars on her leg are more than just physical as they affect nearly every aspect of her life. She decides to look for legitimate work and bumps into Camden McQueen, tattooed Adonis with a septum ring, ex High School Goth and former friend until she humiliated him one fateful day. He runs the local tattoo parlour, Sins & Needles and he and Ellie rekindle their friendship. Camden may have grown into his looks but he\u2019s definitely not wearing a halo either and he\u2019s holding grudges and is a firm believer that revenge is a dish best served cold. He doesn\u2019t easily forgive and forget and when Ellie walks into town, he puts an idea into action that will have far reaching consequences for both of them and those closest to them.To go any further into the plot would be to spoil it and I really don\u2019t want to do that as I had absolutely no idea what direction the story was headed in when I read it and it constantly surprised and shocked me, something not a lot of books do anymore. It\u2019s a twisting, twisted, compelling story that completely consumed me as I read it and I just couldn\u2019t put it down.Ellie & Camden are both incredibly flawed central characters, both of them deeply scarred by their childhoods in more ways than one and yet they found something in each other that was really quite beautiful even though their reckless and selfish behaviour threatened to destroy any fledgling relationship building between them. Ellie made some decisions that had me cringing and screaming \u2018Noooooooo, don\u2019t do it\u2019 as I read. But, she\u2019s on a self-destructive path on cruise control and just can\u2019t seem to stop herself. Camden didn\u2019t do much better at first either with a devious plan in mind but both of them, guided by the growing feelings between them, made some fairly noble decisions by the end of the book.There were a few real gasp out loud shocking moments as the unpredictable plot wound its way towards its devastating conclusion with an ending that will leave you in despair and desperate for more. The whole thing is taut, compelling, fascinating, tense, edgy \u2013 a real refreshing change from most contemporary romances. It offers something significantly different. It\u2019s an incredibly accomplished first part of the trilogy and I just cannot wait for more.4.5 badass starsFor more reviews, please visit Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews or visit us on Facebook."}, {"userName": "Rosalinda *KRASNORADA*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12788865-rosalinda-krasnorada", "userReview": "[ There\u2019s no way she\u2019s ending up with Javier, ladies.

I\u2019m really on a huge thriller kick.... however I still love the love! And this book definitely had a dark edge to it, so I got my thriller needs met....Ellie returns to the only home she has ever really known..... determined to live an honest law abiding life.... Ellie was raised by grifters and that is really the only way she really knows..... Ellie is carrying around a lot of scars both inside and outside from this life.... and really wants to go legit..... after returning home Ellie runs into Camden, the boy who had a mad crush on her in high school, the boy she would not give the time of day..... of course he is now super hot and super successful.... I\u2019m sure you see where this is going? Or maybe not.... because things go sideways real quick!This book definitely kept me entertained throughout.... I listened late into the night and never wanted to press the pause button..... don\u2019t really want to say too much... but these characters took me on a crazy ride....I felt as though this book was the perfect blend of romance and thrills.... however if you are not a romance fan I\u2019d stay away.... on a steam scale of 1-10 I\u2019d give it a Six!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25My only problem with this book was Ellie herself.... the girl came home to get on the straight and narrow and within a day she was off that road... I just really couldn\u2019t get a handle on her... I didn\u2019t understand a lot of her past actions either, like why did she hunt down Javier? I never understood how that was going to hurt anybody.... she unquestionably has a lot of room for some character growth.... fortunately she did redeem herself a bit in the end....I would recommend this book for people who enjoy romance with a Darkside and some thrills mixed in\ud83d\udc97PS: this book ends on a huge cliffhanger, apparently there are two more books in this series that I will need to get to sooner than later, so many books so little time!  \ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7 you can find my review on the audio narration as well as all the other reviews from my partner in crime and me on our new blog... https://audiokilledthebookmark.com/"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "Revenge never felt so good.\n\nIn this game of deception and lies will anyone come out a winner?4.5 stars. This is the brand of drama I can subscribe to. By now, you all know that I loathe drama for the sole purpose of shock value. But when you add drama into a story which has some teeth to it, I'll be up front and center waiting to see what happens next. There's something about the vibe of this book which reminds me of how I felt when I read Tiffanie DeBartolo's - How to Kill a Rock Star for the first time. I was highlighting everything like crazy in HTKARS, but when it came time to review, I could not think of what to write. It wasn't until my second read through before I could finally come up with something halfway legible other than \"buh.\" I think I'm sort of having the same problem with Sins & Needles. There is something about the flow of this book which took me back to how I felt when reading HTKARS. When you put music and art and feelings into a jar and shake them up with the unfortunate trials of being human, you get an experience which pulls you into its grip.\n\nNever commit a crime when you're the only one to blame.\n\nOur players in this story are flawed. Both are scarred - inside and out. Ellie is trying to run from her past, only to find that it's catching up with her. These two worlds couldn't have collided at a better - or worse time. \n\n\"But then I wouldn't be who I am. I don't want to hide myself. I'm not ashamed of being Camden McQueen. Are you ashamed of being Ellie Watt?\"\"Yes,\" she said softly.\n\nI thought the past and present swaps were executed well enough. The switching of scenes from first person over to singular third person took some getting used to, but once you make it past a couple of chapters, it becomes an easier transition. At least there were handy little past and present headers so you weren't completely out of the loop (believe me, I've seen books which haven't done this and it's not fun to have to flip back pages in order to figure out what just happened).What have you already found out about this story from other reviews? I'm sure you've already been told that Camden is smoking hot. I'm also pretty sure that you've seen at least one person mention the great sexual energy. You've also probably been told that the shit hits the fan more than once. Because, after all, there are bad people out there looking to make trouble for Ellie and Camden. So I won't rehash any of that. Where Sins & Needles won me over was with the emotional connection. From the past to the present, you FELT the pain and the loss which had rocked Ellie and Camden to the core. These two broken people had reasons to want to destroy one another, yet neither one of them could seem to completely let the other go. Throughout the entire book, I was never really sure which direction we were headed in. In one moment, I would wonder if every word was tied back to a scam, while in the next I was rooting for them to end up together. I absolutely love when scenarios keep me guessing. It wouldn't be surprising to me if I was still guessing as more of the story unfolds in future installments of the series.Which brings us to the cliffhanger question...Yes. Sort of. Maybe? I guess there was a 'technical' cliffhanger. But it wasn't in the way where I found myself pissy and wanting to know if I would end up hating a person in the next book. I say read this anyway. Just do it. Random extra : I want to make out with authors who give me great one-liners.He was pale, as if he was in witness protection from the sun.Get your head out of your vagina.Definitely not a Morgan Freeman fan.Someone can look like a tattooed, muscular god and still be terribly insecure about his Dumbo ears.\"Cash?\" \"Might as well be douchebag.\"I will now wrap up my vague-ish review (I really didn't want to summarize much because it would spoil the element of surprise) with a little disclaimer :Karina sent me a copy of Sins & Needles for review. She gave me free reign to slam the hell out of her book if I wanted to, knowing full well that I'm not going to mince words if I don't like what I'm reading, even if the book was gifted to me. So my stamp of approval is only going on the book because I honestly loved this.I mean, how could I not? Once you meet Camden, you'll get what I mean.\n\n\"Can it be so bad?\" he whispered. \"How can someone as pretty as you have anything that would make her less?\""}, {"userName": "Taryn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2724584-taryn", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Karina Halle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5416618-karina-halle", "userReview": "THIS...this book.

When Ellie\u2019s latest scam falls apart, she packs up her latest identity and heads back home to her Uncle Jim in Palm Springs CA. Ellie Watt wears different names and looks since her departure from Palm Springs and is hoping that her uncle will give her a much needed place to stay and possibly a way to start over. While job hunting Ellie runs into her old high school friend Camden McQueen who has transformed into a gorgeous tattoo artist and guitarist from the gothic \u201cfreak\u201d he was in adolescence. The story takes the reader from a \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d scenario to see what happened to their friendship as well as things that happened in Ellie\u2019s early childhood.As much as Ellie is taken by the new Camden, she is what she is, a con artist.

Ellie has another problem, a handsome Latino named Javier. Javier is Ellie\u2019s former boyfriend, he is hell bent on getting her back to the point that she has a bounty on her head.

Sins & Needles is a departure from her PNR; this story is all contemporary romantic suspense but still all things brilliant, Karina Halle style!Ellie is a con artist, her parents taught her the life, she is good at it and she is damaged by it, mentally and physically. Now, at age 26 she wants to give up the life and just be Ellie Watt once again. Yeah\u2026 this is not going to be so easy as she is on the run from more than one person. When she gets back home to Palm Valley she runs into Camden McQueen, her (former) best friend from High School. Camden is the son of the Police Chief, outcast goth loner everyone called \u201cThe Dark Queen.\u201d Now, Camden is a hot tatted musician and successful tattoo artist, owner of the Sins & Needles tattoo parlor. He is also deeply damaged and has a few secrets of his own.Ellie and Camden\u2019s story unfolds in a series of \u2018Now and Then\u2019 segments through out the book and it really gives the reader an incredible understanding of how and why Ellie and Camden ended up in the place they are \u2018Now.\u2019Ms. Halle uses her genius of weaving a tale full of twists and turns into an exhilarating ride.

It was just such a \u201cdifferent\u201d read! It was quite refreshing to read something that you really can\u2019t compare to anything else.  It was edgy and gritty, at times heart breaking and others steamy, along with a touch of snark. I\u2019m finding this book hard to review despite really liking it because for most of the book you really don\u2019t know which end is up. Usually when I write my reviews, there are some constants to base it off of but with this one the ground was constantly shifting beneath me and so I was just never quite sure where I was standing. But, then again, that\u2019s part of the whole charm of the book.Scarred both inside and out, and having been raised by grifter parents, the only life Ellie has ever known has been one of cons, deceit and constant relocation. Tired of always being on the run and changing identities, she is determined to make a fresh start for herself and returns to her home town where she runs into Camden McQueen. Once the weird goth high school reject, he is now a  hot-as-shit guitar-playing tattoo artist with dimples.  Dimples, ladies!! Be still my freaking heart!!!!Counting on his affection for her and reverting back to what she knows best, she plans to con him and leave town but there were many things she wasn\u2019t counting on. His life isn\u2019t as simple as it seems and there are dangerous men from her past that are catching up to her. Together, they are thrown in on a  wild, fast-paced ride filled with twist and turns, heart-break, steam, and sacrifice. The story is told from Ellie\u2019s POV in a mixture of flashbacks and present day story lines which really helped answer questions and to understand the mood behind their current relationship.At 25% I was enjoying the story but honestly not quite sure where it was going. Several twists later I still wasn\u2019t sure. 85% and I was still wondering \u2026There were just so many unknowns that you really couldn\u2019t help but start to form theories. There were so many possibilities and ulterior motives behind everything and everyone. It really just keep you guessing.The story was deep and twisty\u2026 much like Camden and Ellie\u2019s relationship. Their entire relationship was based on tangled emotions and a mind game of manipulation. Talk about a love/hate relationship. They really took the cake with this one!  \u201cBeautiful, sad, wounded, and lost\u2026 A freak, a work of art, a liar, and a lover.\u201dHis gaze was starting to eat away at my insides. Razor-blade butterflies whirled in my heart.\u201cI hate you, Ellie Watt,\u201d he whispered, lips coming closer to mine, \u201cBecause I still love you after all these years.\u201d  I loved Camden \u2013 he had a few kinda crazier moments but for the most part was just plain awesome. My heart really broke for him \u2013 especially hearing about his teenage years \u2013 and the anger that he still held was truly more than understandable.  \u201cDo you think because you can\u2019t see my scars that they don\u2019t exist? That\u2019s the trouble with pain, Ellie. If you\u2019re lucky, you can wear it for all the world to see. Most people have their pain deep inside them, in places no one ever goes. Not until its too late.\u201d  But the more I learned about him, the more understandable his more extreme actions became so all in all he was definitely the highlight of the book for me. He\u2019d go from swoony to fuckhot to scary to sympathizing\u2026 and did I mention hot?? \u201cWe ended up in the bedroom for our final course. Nothing fancy here, just the good ol\u2019 missionary position. Women may scoff at it, but I\u2019m telling you, when you have an all-male machine of strength and hard muscle primed above you, pounding you to the bed while spearing you with his eyes, there\u2019s no better feeling in the world.\u201d I had a weird time connecting with Ellie. You know how much we love bad boys? Well\u2026 Ellie\u2019s a bad girl. She\u2019s self-sufficient, always toying with danger, and I don\u2019t know if its odd to say this but I both liked and didn\u2019t like her at times. I could understood where she was coming from but at the same time I had a few issues with her actions in the past and her decisions towards the end of the book. But, that being said, I look forward to seeing her journey over the course of the trilogy.  \u201cI have to live with my mistakes, but I dont have to regret them. I regret my actions but I can\u2019t regret the consequences. We all make our own paths in life. Everyone we meet, everything we do, it changes us. It makes us who we are. And, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019re given the chance to make things right again.\u201d  At 40% there was a BRILLIANT twist that I had suspected and hoped for, but wasn\u2019t sure if I was right so when it happened I just SQUEE\u2019ed. Out loud! I loved the direction it swung the story in.And after that, we\u2019re taken on a roller coaster of drug lords, psycho ex-boyfriends, high speed chases, casinos\u2026 everywhere from small towns to Sin City, mansions to motel rooms\u2026 it really is a wild ride.I loved the writing style \u2013 I have definitely become a new fan of Karina Halle.The sex was HOTTTT but I wish there had been a bit stronger romance. That being said, I have to remember that this is only the first of a trilogy and so I have hopes for it developing further in the later books.My only real complaint is that I found the ending entirely too predictable. I wasn\u2019t surprised by the turn of events and so I was hoping for a little \u2018more\u2019 there. It was like \u201cNOooo!! Don\u2019t fall for that trick! Its ALWAYS a trap!\u201d . But yeah \u2013 DEFINITELY a cliffhanger. No Kindle throwing, or anything, but you are kind of left hanging at big crossroads.That being said, I\u2019m totally invested in the story now so I will absolutely be continuing on with the series!CASTING (apparently this is who the author saw as Camden)and honestly, I like the cover girl as Ellie For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "MELISSA *Mel Reader*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10312276-melissa-mel-reader", "userReview": "Wow, that was one hell of a ride!

Going back to her hometown might just be the answer.Camden McQueen, tattooed and guitar playing ink artist and ex best friend of Ellie is the first person who recognizes Ellie when she\u2019s back to her old home.

A definite must read!!!Ellie Watt is a con artist. She is 26, and ever since she was 19, she has moved from city to city, different name, different scam. After doing this for over 7 years, she decides to move back to California where her uncle is and leave this life behind. ELLIE\nOnce she is home, she realizes leaving that life behind is not as simple as it seems... Ellie assumes everyone she knew from her hometown has either moved on, or wouldn\u2019t recognize her. What she didn\u2019t count on was running into him. CAMDEN MCQUEEN\n\nThe Camden McQueen I pulled up from my memory banks did not look like the tattooed and pierced sex on a stick I had standing before me.Camden and Ellie have history. When she first met Camden her freshman year of high school, they were both outcasts. Ellie was the new girl with a \u2018limp\u2019 and Camden was a freak. Black lipstick and nails, long hair, gothic clothing etc. Things have changed. Camden is now a sexy and successful tattoo artist who owns his own parlor in town. We got to read the back in forth of \u2018then\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019 between Camden and Ellie. In the past, Camden always accepted and cared for Ellie, but she didn\u2019t treat him right. Don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but our girl Ellie decides to run one final scam, and finds out the hard way....\nThis book was different from anything I\u2019ve read, and I loved that! Not sure how I felt about Ellie, I felt for her, at times she infuriated me, but overall- by the end of the book I really liked her.Now, Camden on the other hand....\nThis guy- holy hell. He was hot. The chemistry between Camden and Ellie was on fire. There were some twists and turns with Camden I did not see coming. But I loved him! When he says things like this, how can you not???\n\u201cYou\u2019re different, Ellie. Your scars, your injury, they make you who you are. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\u201cYou know how I feel about your scars. They only make you more beautiful.\u201d\u201cDo you think because you can\u2019t see my scars that they don\u2019t exist? That\u2019s the trouble with pain, Ellie. If your lucky, you can wear it for all the world to see. Most people have their pain deep inside, in places where no one goes. Not until its too late.\u201d\u201cThat Ellie Watt. I know the real Ellie Watt and she\u2019s not that much of a people person.\u201d\u2028\u201cWhich Ellie do you prefer?\u201d I asked teasingly. He stopped walking and pulled me closer to him, starting down into my eyes. \u201cWhichever one I\u2019ve got.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not bad, Ellie. The world is bad and you\u2019re just trying to survive it.\u201d\u201cThat is what I though of you, Ellie. Heartless, reckless, selfish and cruel. Beautiful, sad, wounded and lost. A freak, a work of art, a liar, a lover.\u201d\u2028\u201cI hate you Ellie Watt,\u201d he whispered, lips coming closer to mine, \u201cbecause I still love you after all these years.\u201d\nNow that we\u2019ve established how much I loved this book, I will give a warning about the ending... it had me looking like this:\nI cannot wait until spring to find out what happens!

Get yourself ready, this is a MUST READ!Ellie Watt is 26 years old con artist with very hectic life. Always different names, different places and different enemies. Now after 7 years she is coming back to town where she spent her teenage years determined to leave her grifting lifestyle behind. With unusual and difficult childhood, we can say that Ellie is not your typical heroine. She lives dangerous life, not entirely moral and legal. She has her own skeletons which may be hidden in the closet, but they are definitely not forgotten...\n\"I was used to running and always kept a spare life in the trunk. Spare clothes, spare driver's licenses, spare social security numbers, and a spare tire.\"\nThan there was Camden, Ellie's old friend from high school. Back than the victim of emotional abuse, now sexy tattoo artist. I have to admit I really liked Camden. He was very interesting character. Temperamental, charming, hot-tempered but still emotional, sexy and loving. But Camden has demons of his own...\n\"Spite was the fuel to right all your wrongs. And like any fuel, it could consume you.\"\nEvents in this book were dangerous, exciting and unexpected. Story was full of twists, surprises, action, emotional and steamy parts. At the begining I was not entirely sure what to think about main characters, but the more I got to know them the more I fell in love with them. They were realistic, with their own flaws but always compassionate. This book was spectacular, unique and made me feel all sorts of raw and deep emotions. I just loved this book so much!Normally, I hate when sex is a main focus of the story and in such a case I become easily bored with book. One of the many reasons why I love Karina Halle's writing is the fact that she always focuses on storyline and characters development, twists and emotions. Sex scenes are always just hot and sensual addition to her novels. In Sins & Needles writing is exceptional. It draws you right into the middle of story and you feel like you are there with heroine, experinecing everything with her. Karina Halle is extremely talented author and if you haven't read any of her books, you are definitely missing out. Sins & Needles may be different from her previous works but once again she created excellent and very addictive story.This was not just plain romance, neither it was just thriller. It was so much more and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone! Perfect start to new contemporary adult series! *I received ARC as exchange for honest review*MORE REVIEWS ON MY BLOG \nReading Is My Breathing"}, {"userName": "Lisa Jayne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11963959-lisa-jayne", "userReview": "4 CAMDEN STARS\n\u201cYou know how I feel about your scars. They only make you more beautiful.\u201d\nWow what a Refreshingly different story; moving, heart breaking and totally Unpredictable. The story of Ellie and Camden had me sold from chapter one, however this is not your typical sunshine and lollipops love story, it is dark, sometimes painful and moving. karina Halle has produced an outright gorgeously written book with interesting characters.What's it all about?Where do I even start to describe this book, I'm not sure I can wrap it up. My best advise go and experience this book for yourself, go check out the official blurb had prepare to be wowed.What did I love?I applaud the author for making such complex and honestly at times unlikeable characters, loveable. Ellie is a completely different heroine from my normal reading experience, tough, flawed and broken her life is marked with a painful past and equally dubious lifestyle choice as a grifter. I was completely compelled by this authors storytelling her imagination knows no bounds. Camden had me falling in love, this misunderstood, talented tattoo artist and guitarist is guaranteed to make any readers heart fall hard, but don't be mistaken this hero has a past full of mistakes and a dark side. The chemistry and relationship between this duo is addictive, the author created that many twists and turns I was completely distracted from the fact that this is not my usual reading comfort instead I was thrown into a world that I loved reading about. I was looking for a different reading experience and yes I found it here, this was an addictive and compelling story. A ride you won't want to get off. The book speaks for itself I can't recommend enough.Final thoughts ...Do not delay go and grab this series and dive straight in, Caution expect a HUGE all consuming mother of all cliff hangers ... Roll on summer!

I mean, knowing that her inspiration for Camden McQueen was  this guy, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this! My expectations were high because Halle's \"Experiment in Terror\" series is my favorite adult series, hands down. With Sins & Needles, Halle did not disappoint. I was floored and blown away with how fantastically addictive it was. I absolutely loved it. I'm officially obsessed with The Artists Trilogy.This isn't your typical run-of-the mill romance novel. As always, she sprinkled her magical Halle dust into this novel, making it a one-of-a-kind. Like her other novels, the characters are messed up and flawed. But despite their jackedupness, I fell in love with them. I couldn't stop thinking about them...I'm hooked!Ellie Watt is a con artist and master manipulator. She was raised by gypsy parents, moving from one con to the next. Her crappy parents used her to con people, and when one trick went wrong, it changed her life forever. The scars she bears are a constant reminder of that night.As an adult, Ellie goes into the family business. She decides to go back to her hometown for a fresh start. Lucky for her (and me), she bumps into her former best friend from high school, Camden McQueen. Their friendship doesn't quite pick up where they left it, but it is steamy among other things. Camden is a successful tattoo artist in town, and when she finds out just how successful he is, she decides to con him, too (UGH!). Their relationship is a bit complicated to the say the least. Prepare yourselves for a dark, twisty, and wild ride with these two.Someone who was asking me out on a date, to see his show. And I was thinking two things: 1) I can\u2019t afford to befriend anyone, let alone someone I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing naked and 2) how much cash could I take from him before I hated myself.He looked up to the ceiling. \u201cAnd I needed to start over. Isn\u2019t that why you came back?\u201dI looked at him quizzically. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m trying to start over?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why people return to their past?\u201dOur eyes were locked together, each of us trying to suss the other one out, poke around for the hidden meanings.The story alternates between the past and present. Interestingly, the past is told in third person. In those sections, the reader gets an honest and raw look into Ellie's physical and emotional pain . So many times, my heart broke for her, but I found myself shouting and screaming at her more often than not. From the beginning, I was on Team Ellie, and I was probably in the minority. Ellie had her reasons for doing what she did, and I understood that. She wanted so badly to be a better person and to redeem herself, but does she? I'm not telling.Okay, lets talk about Camden some more. Oh Camden, you are so wonderful, but you're a horrible cook. Trust me, what he lacks in culinary skills, he makes up for in all other areas. Seriously, he is the quinfecta of goodness--glasses, tattoos, unbelievably hot, sweet, and edgy. People, those scenes between Ellie and Camden are so freaking hot. One of my favorite scenes is what I call \"The Sexiest Get-Dressed Scene Ever.\" Oh. My. Lawd.Though his gaze, his pose, his very being, reminded me of a wolf about to pounce, he didn\u2019t move. I felt his eyes roam up and down my body like silk, sending shivers down my back. He was turning me on without laying a hand on me.If you've read any of Karina's other novels, then you know the characters' actions, motives, and emotions are deliberate and well thought out. The character development in this book is fantastically flawless. I couldn't get the characters out of my head. After reading the book, I keep thinking about them and theorizing about what will happen next (Karina and Meg, thank you for putting up with my gazillion messages). This book gave me the worst book hangover. I need book two now!Be sure to add the novella, book 2 & book 3 to your TBR list!*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Quotes are taken from a pre-published copy and are subject to change.*************************Out January 29, 2013!A tortured tattoo artist with glasses!!! WANT THIS NOW!!!!!!!Karina's inspiration:Teaser #1This will be the last time.I\u2019ve said that before. I\u2019ve said it a lot. I\u2019ve said it while talking to myself in a mirror, like some Tarantino clich\u00e9. But I\u2019ve never said it while having a pool cue pressed against my throat by a crazed Ukrainian man who was hell bent on making me his wife.It\u2019s nice to know there\u2019s still a first time for everything.  Teaser #2I folded the application haphazardly and was trying to stick it in the back pocket of my jeans when I felt it fall out and flutter to the floor behind me. I turned around to see a man bent over, picking it up.I saw the top of his head first, saw shaggy dark brown hair that curled down the nape of the man\u2019s neck. Then, as he rose with my application in hand, I saw arched brows over crystal clear blue eyes. A septum ring that acted like an exclamation point at the end of his slim nose. A striking pair of lips; thin and curved on top, full and wide on the bottom. A few day\u2019s worth of stubble all over his chin and jaw. He looked like a male model and I found my breath hitching as I took him in, from his nice height and all-too firm build, to the way he wore his cargo shorts and aged Iggy Pop tee like a second skin. His arms were covered in tattoos, an intensely colorful mixture of skulls, animals and campiness.I finally breathed out when he tucked a strand of hair behind his ears. His ears kind of stuck out, like Dumbo. This was good. This stranger had flaws. I couldn\u2019t stand perfect people.Then he was handing me the application and smiling at me. And in that smile, the way it took a few seconds to reach his eyes, eyes that darkened momentarily before brightening, I felt a rush of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that nearly knocked me over.I knew him. How did I know him? And how long had I been standing there, staring at him like an idiot? I was usually a lot smoother than that._________________________Find more of my reviews and other bookish things here:\u2725 My blog Reading Books Like a Boss \u2725 Like on Facebook \u2725 Follow on Twitter"}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "The girl needs a \u2026.The girls needs a The girl cannot understand theThe girl remembers the date (this should be 2013 and not 2010) That was the date that The girl started anotherThe girl loved the other book and all the other books in the SERIESThe girl feels she will neverRECOVERThe girl wanted to thisThe girl is saying ato herThe girl hopes this affliction ends in the near"}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "[These two better get their happy ending, but (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Lucinda - I JUST LOVE TO READ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7072280-lucinda---i-just-love-to-read", "userReview": "[ 1.
