King writes his novels like a seduction, the story unfolding delicately and deliberately. As any Stephen King fan knows, his coy expository chapters often take up the first hundred pages or more. In Cell, however, the reader is brutally dragged into the main action--unspeakable, senseless violence--within the first seven pages. Cell is by far King's most brutal, transgressive work to date.Many have compared Cell to his earlier epic, The Stand. On the surface, the novels are quite similar: an apocolyptic event threatens the very existence of the human race as a band of survivors struggle to come to terms with the carnage and avert further catastrophe. Cell, however, is the far more mature novel of the pair. The Stand was, in many ways, a novel by an idealistic youth, whereas Cell is filled with the trenchant and world-weary observations of an adult. The subtext is laden with so much chillingly apt futurist rhetoric that it is as though the author had Marshall McLuhan whispering plot devices and metaphors into his ear as he labored over his typewriter. King manages to explore several of the major sociocultural conflicts of our time, most persuasively the end of the era of individualism and the rise of collectivism, here symptomatic of heavy reliance on technology. Whereas many dystopian novels are almost comically blunt when expounding upon the dangers of collectivism, King's horrific plot and action give his metaphors a sort of subtlety that renders his subtext much more graceful and easier to stomach than the work of Ayn Rand.As the epigraphs indicate, it is also a meditation on the intrinsic violence of the human race. King clearly feels as though the world is out of control and wants to find out why. His preferred genre, horror, is an excellent one with which to consider the depravaties of modern life. The Stand was a novel that, if not upbeat, was at least optimistic--a reflection of the times in which it was written. There was also violence, but it had its own biblical logic, if violence can ever be called logical. In Cell, the violence is senseless, oppressive, and omnipresent. There seems to be little promise for a better world... at least not one inhabited by human beings.Many reviewers took issue with the unresolved ending. Considering the subtext of the novel, however, the reader will find that the ending's abruptness actually informs the sense that Cell, besides being an excellent horror yarn, is a meticulously painted portrait of the horrors of global culture. The many crises of our time are still developing and mutating. The end is not yet, it seems, in sight."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "[(hope we get to find out what happened to Tom's cat and the rest of the gang!)And remember: \"Assume makes an ass out of you and me\" (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733629-chris", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know where to start. I don\u2019t know what to say. I own about 30 Stephen King books, I believe I have read them all. Strange enough, it seems like just as I started getting into the King of Horror, his talent began to dwindle. I think it was when I was in sixth grade that I started digging him and becoming a fan, and at about that same time he began to put out books that pretty much anyone with a brain will concede are not nearly the clean-up hitters that his first works were. Carrie, Pet Cemetery, Christine, Cujo, The Stand, The Shining\u2026..esteemed and awesome for the most part, only to be replaced with the likes of Gerald\u2019s Game, The Woman Who Loved Tom Gordon, Insomnia, and the Green F@cking Mile. There\u2019s something wrong in that, I was always under the belief that the more experience you have in your craft the better you will eventually get, unless you\u2019re an absolute nimrod. Well, Mr. King proves me dead-fricking wrong, especially with the release of Cell, a novel I can\u2019t quite find a word for. Disappointing? No, I was expecting about as much. Poor? Too rich for this trash. Feeble? Getting warmer. I want to put this to bed rather quickly, after all, Stephen King has written more than a few badass books and I\u2019d rather not dwell on the poor bastard's dwindling talents as he progresses in age and rocks out in his crappy band, \u201cBookwyrm\u201d. Ok, so his band isn\u2019t called Bookwyrm, but it ought to be; it shows that in one second I came up with a more powerful and awesome name than he ever could. His band doesn\u2019t matter here, what matters is that King had the great idea of making a back-to-the-basics horror novel, and what better subject matter than zombies! Flucking zombies man! Maybe Steve is the only one who hasn\u2019t realized it, but zombies have been beat to death (no pun intended) in recent media via horror films and video games. Not to mention that the Zombie King, the venerable George Romero, has produced some rather slick zombie films in his \u201cDead\u201d series recently, one example is Land of The Dead, which King liberally rips off with the idea of zombies evolving in this novel, although Romero isn\u2019t gay enough to consider having them evolve super powers including levitation, thought-control, and telepathy. Thank god.  King, however, is down with this wishy-washy, flimsy shit, and it\u2019s not surprising that the novel starts to nosedive about the time the undead begin using their newfound powers. Like all King novels that center around droves of mindless minions of evil, there is one badass leader zombie that seems to be running the show, and he\u2019s the only character that I can really even recall from the book, how f@cking pitiful is that, especially since the only reason I can imagine the dude is because he\u2019s such a archetypical figure that this is his only real intent.The story plods along after all cell phones receive some sort of \u2018pulse\u2019 which leads to the poor f@cker on the phone becoming a zombie. If I recall correctly, that\u2019s the only thing which turns people into zombies, the Pulse. Now, I understand King is trying to make a point on society through the sheer number of zombies, but let\u2019s face it, the number of people this would effect is not that fucking catastrophic. In Cell, it is, almost 75% of the world seems to either have been zombified, or is in immediate danger due to someone else\u2019s transformation into a zombie. This sheer mathematical impossibility annoyed me throughout the course of the story. Adding to my troubles, the main character, Clayton (of all fuggin names), is hell-bent on finding his family, he\u2019ll do anything just to see if they are alive or dead, blah blah blah. I think another character was a homo and of course there was the ever-present Crafty Child. All dicking around while the zombies grew more powerful through their unnatural cerebral enhancements.

Not one to usually dislike a King novel, I did go into this one without the highest of expectations and ended up being very pleasantly surprised.The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was. I am of the opinion that not everything that Stephen King writes is destined to be a classic, but the majority of his work is well above average and I feel that one day he will be given his long overdue kudos and be placed in the literary canon with the other greats of modern literature."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "I suddenly realised half way through this book that it is really a zombie novel. After a shower I felt better and rationalised that this was occupying my \"wouldn't normally read this\" slot in my book consumption; sigh of relief. I must admit that I did enjoy some of King's early novels, but this was so far fetched and ridiculous (Am I really saying \"It\" wasn't?). The plot is simple. Somehow, someone sends a pulse through the mobile phone system which wipes clean a person's mind and sends them back to basics and they become unreasoning killers. Those that survive the bloodbath begin to flock together and develop a sort of telepathy. Meanwhile those that didn't hear the pulse and survived the bloodbath also group together and a struggle for survival begins. Sometimes books like this are good mindless fun and I do enjoy well written thrillers. King does write well and is a natural storyteller; but there is something insidious at the heart of this. Basically (and this is actually said in the book), when everything is stripped away from men and women; what is left - MURDER. This, quite simply, is the Doctrine of The Fall (not Mark E Smith's rather good Manchester band), as found in the Old Testament. We are born in sin and are wicked at heart; our first instincts being to kill rather than care for each other. That is the problem with this book; that premise. Nature and nurture matter not; we are hard-wired to Murder. In my more depressive moments I realise we have created an economic system which destroys the weak and poor rather well and we regularly elect governments that play and build on xenophobia and the evils of those who are different. However, in my heart I believe we all have that spark that would rather care for others than destroy them. That's the problem with this book."}, {"userName": "seak", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak", "userReview": "Stephen King does zombies! Well...kind of. We'll get to that in a bit.But first, here's how I think this book came about:Way back in aught-6 (2006), or just before because Cell was published in '06, but who knows with King, am I right? But anyway, we've come a long way since that time. Everyone was getting cell phones and they were just about getting to every last person around. I imagine him having this conversation with, let's say, his son, Joe Hill.Stephen: \"Wow, cell phones have really gotten popular lately. Everyone seems to have one.\"Joe: \"Yeah Dad, come on, get with the times already, man.\" Stephen: \"Well, at least we'll never get rid of these landlines right? Both are VERY necessary. [useless joke probably not in King's character, just wanted to make fun of how we used to still had landlines when everyone was switching to cell phones]\"But seriously, I am SO sick of people being on their cell phones all the time. You can't even have an honest-to-goodness conversation with a person without someone bombarding you with a call.\"Can't we just have real conversations with human beings anymore? Instead, we talk to electronics and let them control everything we do, sacrificing our humanity.\"If only there was a way to put an end to this nonsense...I've got it!\"Cell starts out as your basic zombie book. People are going about their normal business when suddenly lots of people start going crazy and attacking other people while a few people escape unscathed for a while until they get attacked.Well, Stephen King made a couple of changes to the normal zombie mythos (I think we can call it mythos now). Here, the zombies are created by a pulse that occurs through cell phones. All the people using their cell phones at the time of the \"pulse\" (as its known throughout the book) are immediately changed into what is essentially a zombie. Those without cell phones or not on them at the time are saved.It's not exactly clear whether they are (or have to be) dead or not, some are, but not all, but they all have the same traits, which are pretty zombie-like. They go crazy, they attack people including their own kind, and make survival the number one priority for those who weren't turned.They are known throughout the book not at zombies, but as \"phone crazies.\" Boy did I hate that term after a while. It's just so dumb. It's also descriptively appropriate, but meh. Call them walkers, call them phoners even, but \"phone crazies\" just bugged me to no end.In addition, the zombies only come out during the day and therefore leave the night to the survivors.Cell follows Clayton Riddell, a survivor of the pulse who happened to be in Boston at the time of the \"pulse.\" He lives in (you guessed it) Maine (but he's not a writer, he's a comic artist, completely different), which is where his family is located at the time of the pulse and provides the impetus for Clay and his group of survivors to head north.I did enjoy this book, but to talk about why I didn't enjoy it enough to even reach the 4 star threshold, I'm gonna have to get into some spoilers. These aren't huge, ruin-the-book spoilers, just possibly ruin a part of the first 200 pages/quarter of the book. You've been warned./Begin mild spoilersI could go more into Clay's group because they do play a large role in the novel, but I just don't have the time nor the energy at the moment. Know they're there and they are some great characters.The reason I wasn't a huge fan of this particular zombie book is that King almost immediately kills the whole reason I read zombie books. I read them for the constant suspense and scare that the people we've grown close to are going to get eaten, turned, die, whatever.King introduces telepathy into the zombie mythos. While it's an interesting and unique take, I realized toward the end that it pretty much killed this particular zombie novel for me.Because the zombie apocalypse occurred through the pulse, the phone crazies (bleh) are connected somehow, they can even communicate in a way telepathically. It begins through large gatherings where they sleep during the night while getting essentially reprogrammed telepathically.While they are communicating telepathically, they begin to flock just like some types of animals (birds in a \"v\" for instance). While they flock, they don't attack humans. It just stops.There's more that happens and they do begin to do some much more devious things, but the survivors, and especially our little crew we follow, are essentially immune from the day-to-day zombie attack.Bigger Spoiler, for the novel I Am Legend as well: While I'm still within the spoiler section of my review, I also wanted to add that I totally thought he was going to go I Am Legend with the zombies, making the zombies the new society and the survivors the outcasts. It seemed to be going there, but didn't in the end./end spoilersI enjoyed this book, it had great characters (as expected) and a good enough story to keep me enjoying it. It also had an interesting take on zombies that, while I applaud King for his creativity and boldness, kind of killed the zombie part of this zombie novel.3 out of 5 Stars (Recommended with reservations)"}, {"userName": "Johann (jobis89)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89", "userReview": "\"What Darwin was too polite to say, my friends, is that we came to rule the earth not because we were the smartest, or even the meanest, but because we have always been the craziest, most murderous motherfuckers in the jungle.\"Cell is an apocalyptic tale about mobile phones that wipe the user's brain, getting rid of any humanity and leaving behind only aggressive and destructive impulses. The story focuses on the main character, Clay, who is on a mission to find his estranged wife and son. Now living in a post-apocalyptic world and unable to use mobile phones for fear of becoming crazed maniacs, Clay and his group must navigate their way in an attempt to find out what has happened to his family.Okay, so, I actually really enjoyed this book. I loved the premise of it, and found it terrifying to even consider what it would be like if such an event occurred in real life. I loved how it was the use of mobile phones that created these crazed \"zombies\", especially because if something like this did happen, your first thought would be to call your loved ones to check they're okay. So I kinda loved that detail, added an extra layer to the story I thought.The characters were so-so. Clay was fine, but I think I actually preferred Tom. I also really liked Alice, so I wasn't overly happy with her storyline. The \"zombies\" or \"phonies\" as they were called in the book were downright horrifying! I really liked their behaviours and how they were used within the story. The fact that they were only active during the day and then \"rebooted\" at night. It felt like a unique portrayal of zombies.I thought the story moved at a great pace, especially at the beginning. It was non-stop terrifying. The pace did slow down a bit, particularly towards the end, but I was still very much interested and eager to see how it all panned out. But then that ending. THAT GODDAMN ENDING. Left me feeling so infuriated and angry. I absolutely hate endings like that...I was so annoyed by it that I felt like deducting a star, but then maybe in hindsight I will look back and like the ending (similar to how I feel about The Sopranos), so it can keep the star... for now. I thought it was a great read (apart from the ending) and very much underrated in the Stephen King universe.

Any person on their phone at the time of the Pulse goes completely insane.They kill themselves or others in violent and vicious ways. One guy even bites the ear off a dog. Another girl smashes her own face repeatedly off of a pole until she dies. It\u2019s fucking awesome. I know people say this is King\u2019s version of zombies but I disagree. I think the Pulse strips you down to your most primal self. You become a beast; an animal.  At bottom, you see, we are not Homo sapiens as all. Our core is madness. The prime directive is murder. What Darwin was too polite to say, my friends, is that we came to rule the earth not because we were the smartest, or even the meanest, but because we have always been the craziest, most murderous motherfuckers in the jungle. And that is what the Pulse exposed five days ago.The pace of the book does slow down but the story does not. It develops into a one-of-a-kind mindfuck of a tale. While I love the opening sequence for its relentless violence, I think the ending is my favorite part. King nailed it. His endings are sooooooooooo hit and miss among his fans-at least in my experience- it is nice to see an ending I can really appreciate. I think it was the perfect ending for this book. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to read it yet- I strongly recommend it. If you have- make sure you check out the trailer for the movie! It looks amazing! You can check that out right herePs. The docked star is mostly due to the inconsistent narration of the audio book. It was patchy and you could clearly hear the edits.

Meh... but in a good way. I'm a huge Stephen King fan, but I think I'm going to start defining my adoration for him by a certain era. I find I love his earlier stuff, but don't particularly love (or sometimes even like) his later stuff. 'Cell' is a good example of how a former master of horror has now become a much more average author. Now, this is not a bad novel. It varies from alright to good, rarely achieving greatness, but scoring points for story, some pace, and King's usual habit of giving us the creeps. But the story was part of the problem too. Although there was a slight twist on the 'Zombie tale' (people become zombie-ish creatures after receiving a signal through their cell phones), this novel quickly turns into a story we've all heard before: The majority of people become zombies, small groups of living people escape/fight to stay alive in the ensuing zombie apocalypse. Been there. Done that. Many times. And it's played out. But there was a little bit of new life breathed into an old trope, and it was as decent as the next good book about the undead. Still, I expected a lot more from our crowned ruler of creepy books. It's a bit annoying and disheartening when someone like Stephen King starts becoming an imitator instead of an originator, or when it feels like big-time authors are getting lazy in light of their success (I have the same feeling about authors Peter Straub and Dean Koontz).I read a book like 'Cell' and I can't help wonder if maybe it is time we had a new 'King' of horror fiction."}, {"userName": "\u2660 Eze \u2660", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36162557-eze", "userReview": "De los mejores libros de King.

I went through a kick where some of my favorite old-ish movies, I was going back and reading the books they had been made from - Jaws, The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs. So of course, I wound up hunting down quite a few Stephen King books.I kept seeing this book on the shelf at the library, and the blurb intrigued me, so finally I checked it out and read it.I really, really liked it! I am a fan of apocalypse/zombie themes, movies, whatevs, and this book is strong with both of those. Of course, there aren't zombies in this book - they are living, breathing human beings. Just ..., changed. Evolved. Different.This book was haunting. There is no denying that very few authors can give you the heebie jeebies as well as Stephen King, and this book is no exception. When the shiz starts hitting the fan, the pandemonium that's described is scary as all get out. The second time I read it, it was late at night and I was in bed downstairs alone. Unbeknownst to me, the teenage neighbors at the end of the street had decided to throw a kegger that turned into a Fight Club. Needless to say, I nearly peed myself as the noise outside seemed to mirror the noise in the book.Like many Stephen King books, this follows a man going through an unusual, terrifying situation, trying to get back to his family and life, and forming friends and allies and foes along the way. A phone call causes everyone who answered their phone to go insane. Our hero didn't have a phone, thankfully. At first, it's a murderous rampage free for all. Then the phone-zombies calm down a little and start to mass together.Never a good sign.Throw in some psychic abilities and a strong telepath, a frightening red sweater, and lots of guns that never really do anything but hurt the ones trying to use them, and you've got an interesting story.I was very excited when I saw that this was being made into a movie - visions of Thomas Jane as the lead dancing through my head. Instead, last I heard John Cusack was cast to play the hero, and I just can't see that. Boo.If you like Stephen King, read this book. If you don't like Stephen King but like scary novels, read this book. If you don't like Stephen King AND you don't like scary novels, then I'm not sure why you're looking at this page.

This one was short compared to his average novels and because of his entertaining, free-flowing script, this was another one of those books that was a breeze to read.

If we were to rank him, he'd probably fall somewhere towards the middle. Kind of forgettable. I actually thought Tom would be a better main character; he had better lines.The first part of this book kicks ass! I love the opening scene in the streets when the Pulse hits and Clay is first hand witness to all this crazy shit going down.

Not that I'm complaining, mind you - this was a fun read. I just figure we should never trust a writer when they say they're done. This is like crack to them, I suppose.With this book, King is back to my favorite story type of his - world-spanning apocalypse. Ain't nothing better than the end of the world, in my judgment, and The Stand is still one of my favorite King books.In this one, though, he takes a slightly different approach. In The Stand, the full scale of the disaster is revealed in pieces, with tantalizing peeks at how bad Captain Trips is every now and then until we finally see just what it means to lose 99.6% of the population in ten days. Hint: stinky.For Cell, King tells us right up front, before the first page of the story, that the world as we know it would be gone in two weeks. Then he gives us a happy, almost exuberant main character, whose life has just taken a massive turn for the better and who believes he can see a bright and shining future ahead of him.A few pages later, of course, The Pulse hits. And the world, for all intents and purposes, ends. At 3:03 PM EST, October 1st, everyone who uses a cell phone goes instantly and ferally insane. The people who see the first waves of chaos do the natural thing - pick up their cell phones to find out what's happening. And in an instant, they are part of the madness.It's a terrible new world, to say the least. And Clayton Riddell has to make his way to his wife and son, hoping that they survived the pulse and the murderous madness that followed.The story is not, technically, original. King borrows a great deal from other writers and artists - he thanks Richard Matheson and George Romero up front, as well he should. And he has one of the main characters refer to Neal Stephenson as \"a God,\" perhaps to balance against criticism of apparent similarities with Snow Crash. And, of course, because Stephenson is a god, if a terribly difficult one to understand all the time....Of course, he can't escape comparisons to his original apocalypse book, The Stand, but he didn't reference it directly. The characters seem to have a more difficult time getting their way in this book, it seems, and they certainly cover less ground. And they're not, to my mind, as memorable as the wonderful cast of characters who wandered through The Stand. No Randall Flagg, either.However, for you Dark Tower fans, there's one oblique reference in this book: It's in the \"Kashwak\" section, just at the end of part 15, pretty close to the end of the book. You should know it when you see it.Speaking of which.... I haven't read everything King's written since he finished out Dark Tower, but it looks like he's decided that closure is overrated. That's all I'm gonna say about that. It's not a bad ending by any stretch, it's just.... *sigh*Anyway, pick it up.

Yes!The story starts minutes before The Pulse occurred and takes us through the entire scenario in perfect detail. You\u2019ll get a feeling that you are right next to the lead, Clayton Riddell and are experiencing each and everything. The craziers or the phone-crazies are easy to picture and seem scary. Clay\u2019s allies, Tom and Alice are perfect and the way they survive is really intriguing. The major part of the book is about Clay\u2019s journey to save his son and that he does! Or not! Well, the best part (as far as I\u2019m concerned) is the open-ending, which is a treat for reader\u2019s imagination.One of the other things I liked about Cell is that The Pulse, that is the virus, which is also referred to as a programme, is shown to be corrupted and wormed.

And there are some good reasons, End-of-the-World setting, the survivors polarized into two camps, one camp, arguably no longer even human, a big bang ending in an arena like setting, etc. But there are differences as well. When King wrote The Stand, it seemed to mark a moment in that writer's life where he was becoming overt in things religious. The Stand is a battle between good and evil, darkness and light, King's Book of Revelation if you will. Cell is more ambiguous. The zombie like creatures that inhabit the novel are, through no fault of their own, zapped by the \"surge,\" which pretty much wipes out anyone's human hard drive if they happened to own and use a cell phone. No choice there. To some extent, as animal like as they can be, the zombies of Cell are pitiable. Meanwhile, King's little band of survivors are just trying to get somewhere, find some human traction in a world that has been blasted. In particular, there is Clay Riddell, who in his previous pre-Surge life was a graphic artist, and probably something of dreamer. His marriage is probably on the rocks, but he loves his son dearly, and when the deal goes down, he can only think of one thing: to get to him. In King's universe, we now see the Manichean Good and Evil from the Stand being replaced by Cell's Love and Duty. To some extent Cell is similar to Cormac McCarthy's The Road. Both are Father and Son stories; both look beyond the End, to what must remain if we are to survive as a species: Hope. The ending of Cell has bothered some, but I think this is unwarranted. In many ways, it's one of King's most powerful endings, and shows the mature writer that he has become. There is no need for a sequel, and I would be surprised if King wrote one. Cell is a fine effort by King, and one that will be viewed, as time goes by, as one of his best efforts. It has as an effective leanness and nastiness to it that will remind some of Thinner, but also a suggestive depth to it that carries it beyond merely Pulp Fiction. * Note: I think King totally ripped off Simon Clark's Blood Crazy. I still like what King did with it, but I'm dropping a star (from 4 to 3) as a result.

I neither cared for any character but Alice and Rafe (the cat), nor wanted to know why the Pulse had happened. It was simply odd. Even the \"phonies\" (as they're called) weren't creepy. Just stupid, violent beings (probably this is the definition of zombies, now that I'm thinking...)However, things warmed up (got the pun?), and I started caring for the other initial characters - Tom and Clay -, such as the ones that were added to the plot through the rest of the book.The phonies were more explored in the second half of the book, and they evolved to more complex, interesting and creepy beings. I loved that. The Raggedy Man and those dreams were also quite intriguing, and gave a soul to the book.Many people have problems with this kind of ending, but I actually liked it.

That's the basic premise of King's spin on the otherwise beaten to death and left to die idea of zombie infestation. The story was fun (although I think it had a much bigger potential)but for what it was, it was good. The characters were good, but I was not buying the fact that Jordon for the most part, almost had everything figured out. I get the fact that he guessed for most of the time and it turned out to be one hell of an intelligent guess, but still. He was very young and a much brighter for his age. I was hoping to read about some take on the \"zombies\" as horrible, disfiguring mutants, maybe some that go on rampage, maybe others that increased in size due to their exposure or something. Alas, it was none of that. Instead, it was average survival tale where characters look after each other while at the same time trying not to think too much about what happened to their loved ones. One think I did not like (I might be picking on small things here), but most of the people who turned were hard working folks. Therefore, I hated when the main characters said stuff like, \"They can all burn in hell\" when referring to them. It was not their fault they turned into zombies. I understand the main characters lost family members, but don't push it by insulting these mindless people while they go on about not being aware of what they did or what they are doing. ALSO, I am very excited that the movie adaptation of Cell is coming to the big screen in 2015, starring Samuel L. Jackson, John Cusack, and the girl from the Orphan (2009) movie.

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED, CONSTANT READER!!It was one of those \"you figure it out by yourself\" types of endings. I guess it was typical for King, but I wish there was a bit more closure on what happened at the end. What happened to the rest of the people who turned and who didn't turn? Did Jordon's crazy theory turn out to be right? Was there a nuclear strike on big cities since the military and bog government officials thought that there was no hope for most people so they decided to start fresh and build a new habitat for the future? What happened to the main characters? Were they ever reunited? Did they see their loved ones ever again? And did they learn their lesson and decide to never use cellphones again?
