Somewhere in Baghdad is the mysterious \"Jericho,\" the traitor who is willing--for a price--to reveal what is going on in the high councils of the Iraqi dictator. But Saddam's ultimate weapon has been kept secret even from his most trusted advisers, and the nightmare scenario that haunts General Schwarzkopf and his colleagues is suddenly imminent, unless somehow, the spy can locate that weapon--The Fist of God--in time.

I'm not one who likes the blending of fact and fiction in these types of novels, and I was constantly googling to see what characters were invented, whether Iraq actually did have a nuclear weapon in 1990, and how Scuds compared to the al-Husayn missiles. There are some brutal torture scenes. Not everyone lives to see the end of the book. With the exception of Margaret Thatcher, its female characters don't come off well. Its twisty turns, particularly at the end, make it a slightly above average thriller."}, {"userName": "Madhura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11120650-madhura", "userReview": "One of my favourite books on earth!

The work is in the form of a Singspiel, a popular form that included both singing and spoken dialogue. Takes place in Egypt.The Magic Flute is noted for its prominent Masonic elements; Schikaneder and Mozart were Masons and lodge brothers Time: Egypt, about the reign of Rameses I.Place: Near and at the Temple of Isis, Memphis.Schikaneder had persuaded Mozart to compose the music to a puppet show for him. At that time, however, freemasonry was a much discussed subject. It had been interdicted by Maria Theresa and armed forces were employed to break up the lodges. As a practical man Schikaneder saw his chance to exploit the interdicted rites on the stage. Out of the wicked sorcerer he made Sarastro, the sage priest of Isis. The ordeals of Tamino and Pamina became copies of the ceremonials of freemasonry. He also laid the scene of the opera in Egypt, where freemansory believes its rites to have originated. In addition to all this Mozart\u2019s beautiful music ennobled the libretto even in its dull and unpoetical passages, and lent to the whole a touch of the mysterious and sacred.Because of its supposed relation to freemasonry, commentators have identified the vengeful Queen of the Night with Maria Theresa, and Tamino with the Emperor.

E' indubbiamente uno dei miei scrittori preferiti in questo genere e lo metterei con Ludlum, Le Carr\u00e8, Cruz Smith, direttamente sul podio.Questa storia \u00e8 meravigliosa, uno dei migliori dell'autore, se non il migliore, documentato tramite una fittissima ricerca dove si riesce a mischiare molto bene realt\u00e0 e fantasia, prendendo le mosse dalla storia reale del super cannone; l'inizio \u00e8 molto analitico entrando nel dettaglio di tutte le problematiche relative alle forniture di armi e tecnologia da parte di USA ed Europa all'Iraq di Saddam nel periodo in cui si cercava di usare l'Iraq per mettere i bastoni tra le ruote all'Iran.La storia: poco prima dello scoppio della Guerra del Golfo, l'agente segreto inglese Mike Martin scopre che le truppe di Saddam dispongono di una misteriosa e potentissima arma denominata \"Il pugno di Dio\", un ordigno in grado di rovesciare completamente le sorti del conflitto. Nonostante l'incredulit\u00e0 dello Stato Maggiore, Martin riesce a infiltrarsi a Baghdad e a preparare un audace piano di sabotaggio.Spionaggio, azioni dietro le linee, tanta tecnologia e spiegazioni da manuale nel pi\u00f9 puro stile Forsyth. Ho letto tutti i suoi libri e questo \u00e8 diventato subito il mio preferito perch\u00e8 \u00e8 avvincente, interessante e verosimile.Consiglio vivamente la lettura di questo libro, sia per la parte puramente romanzata, ma anche per quella storica di ricerca, da ottimi spunti di riflessione su quello che era, ormai parliamo di una decina d'anni fa, lo scacchiere mediorientale.Forsyth \u00e8 un maestro indiscusso di questo genere."}, {"userName": "Neil Wright", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4518082-neil-wright", "userReview": "The second Frederick novel I\u2019ve read after \u2018The Day Of The Jackal\u2019 and packed with the same precise detail as the first. Focusing on the first Gulf war, it tells the story of an S.A.S veteran who goes behind enemy lines to prevent Saddam detonating WMD. Now, to call Mr Forsyth thorough is to say that Saddam has a bit of a bad temper, and whilst this can be a little frustrating in the beginning it does prove worthwhile in the end. Through the allies of the main character Forsyth skillfully portrays the methods of the british S.I.S and the Israeli Mossad in extracting the secrets from within their relevant enemies. These make for some of the most interesting threads of the story, the unassuming, normal and innocent people they use to gain the information they require from each others governments.The inner workings of the Iraqi regime and how Saddam must have controlled his minister\u2019s is another of the sub plots of the story, along with the A.M.A.M, the Iraqi secret police, and how an organisation like that can control a population.Overall, 7-10, you can imagine everything in this novel actually happening and the concise annotation of events and the clandestine operations and conversations of the characters put Fred as one of the best for military/spy/espionage thrillers."}, {"userName": "Pequete", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-pequete", "userReview": "I had loved Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal, the first book I read from this author, and also the first one I read through Bookcrossing.

Even though the theme is very different (The Day of the Jackal is about an attempted murder of General de Gaulle and this one is about the first Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait), they both share an attention to detail, accuracy of information, suspense and a great ability to mix historical facts with a fiction plot.

Where Dan Brown is famous for his books crafted on history art which is mired with known & unknown facts that boggled the reader's brain, Jeffery Archer mingles the real life scenarios with fiction & presents it lively and finally I'm introduced to FF which I believe writes on the Military related issues that deal with some international crisis. THE FIST OF GOD, written in 1994, is still rattling as I believe it was, when written more than two decades ago.Author had sewn a major thriller witht the yarn of Iraq's invasion on Kuwait. So, the Iraqi forces under the command of Saddam Hussien invaded Kuwait when put the west in rock-and-roll position to safeguard the Saudi Arabia from Saddam's encroachment. With Kuwait under Iraq's control was burning, Brits managed to pass on a SAS commando, Mike Martin, deep inside the Kuwait to gather the intel & resist the Iraqi forces as he could. And on the same time as the situation exasperated, Diplomats of several countries were called back which called off the intel that Israel is gathering from an asset through a third country diplomat. Iraq was garrisoned & west didn't have evenn a scintial of intel about the Iraqis & as the west can't sit lip tight , So after litany, Israel shared the snippet of their spy in baghdad with West & then Martin was again made to intrude in the town where he was raised & completed his basic schooling, before his parents, brits, left for Britain. This picks the fable's pace & kept the reader gripped till very end.In the plot, author precisely enunciate the conditions on the ground zero either in Iraq or in kuwait or in the Riyadh, base of Coalition forces. Author also succeding in giving the message of how a tyrant was made, surrounded by no. of sycophants, he wrought Atrocities on iraqil civilians just for the sake of his ego.Then there's this head of AMMAM, Secret police of Iraq, who's having a dysphemism, The Tormentor, & have the Iraqi's feared him more than anyone else on land. Author had even bolted a bank whih plays a crucial role in the plot but what's special about the bank is its working protocol. This bank don't operate online & every account is solely handled by one of the 4 vice-presidents of the bank. Records were lodged into books instead of punching it into computers.

One of Forsyth's recurrent tricks is that of creating lead characters who possess an exceptional combination of boldness, physical prowess, chutzpah and the capability of deadly violence when necessary; the one he introduces here one of his most intriguing characters, Mike Martin, who appears again in a later book \"The Afghan\". As in many previous books, Forsyth manages to construct fictional stories populated by real people whom we immediately recognize -- in this case Saddam Hussein. He does it so seamlessly that it's easy to lose sight of where real events end and fiction takes over.One criticism: Forsyth is overly fond of including minute detail about his subject matter -- things such as weaponry, the inner workings of intelligence and military organizations etc. This speaks well of his diligence in research and adds realism, but it makes some of his books unnecessarily lengthy and this is one of them."}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5986207-sheila", "userReview": "Fredrick Forsyth has done it again another wonderful book mixed with fact and fiction.
