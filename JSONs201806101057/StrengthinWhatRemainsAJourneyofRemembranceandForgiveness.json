I normally love Tracy Kidder books. And this book had an incredibly compelling story to tell, about a man who escapes genocide in Burundi and amazingly goes on to complete his education and even return to Africa to help rebuild his country. Yet somehow the author keeps getting in the way of the story. At first, describing the main character's journey to America, he is a little condescending, making Deo seem a little simple when in reality he is a bi-lingual former medical-school student. Later, Kidder switches to a first-person narrative when he follows Deo on a trip back to Burundi. This last third of the book is much more about Tracy Kidder than it needs to be. Also, throughout the book, the narrative keeps jumping through time in a way that isn't exactly confusing, but is annoying and unnecessary. Still, the book is gripping simply because the story being told is so remarkable and inspirational. I recommend it and will continue to do so until Deogratias writes his own book about the experience."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "Kidder is considered the master of non-fictional narrative. He lets his subjects tell their own story, in effect crafting their autobiography. In this case, his subject is Deo, a medical student who survived the bloodbaths of the Burundi and Rwanda and makes it to America only to face a prolonged period of challenges in surviving in Harlem. Yet, with timely help from key people along his way, he gains an education and ends up doing public health work with Paul Farmer's Partners in Health organization. His heart is big enough to forgive the perpetrators, and those who helped Deo come to feel more benefits from him than they render. These include an ex-nun working among the homeless and a Soho couple, a sociology professor and his artist wife. The task of understanding the origins of the mass killings in these small countries is confounded by the Tsutsi and Hutu sharing the same language, religion, and, for the most part, culture. Kidder infers that the German and Belgian colonists helped establish the myth of differences between the groups that fueled a history of antagonism. Kidder doesn't dump Deo's personal witnessing of the genocide in a painful lump on the reader, but slowly intersperses the experiences from Deo's memories with his progress of recovery in America. This is a powerful and uplifting story told well."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/353546-anna", "userReview": "Fabulous, moving and complex-- it takes you between NYC and Burundi and Rwanda through the life of Deo, who was medical student when the massacres of Tutsis began in Burundi (Oct 1993- about 6 months before the genocide in Rwanda). It is not easy to describe this book, but Tracy Kidder with his usual understated gift manages to allow us to begin to enter the unimaginable world of Deo, in ways that don't ever reduce anything to simple. It is a must read if you care about being human, and maintaining the humanity of others, and even attempting to create a world where genocide doesn't happen. It is also a powerful story of one person's effort to find a way to stay human and continue to build a meaningful life, even after surviving the unimaginable. Deo never becomes cynical, continues to work against all odds and to succeed beyond all imagining. There is an epilogue which details how Burundi & Rwanda differed, and offers a concise recent history of the conflicts, massacres and genocides in each country. He cites Pete Ulwyn (sp?) and this man's concept of structural poverty as a root cause of some of these problems-- it is really worth reading and thinking through."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Where are we today at the beginning of the 21st Century? Where are we headed? I have been reading books that focus on ethnic cleansing and genocide. It seems to me there is more and more of this with each year that passes. What does this say about the way the world is run today? How do different books tackle these questions? When The Stars Fall To Earth was very good, albeit simple, but with an important message. It was fiction. It dealt with the problems that continue today in Darfur. I kept thinking, why did I like it so much even if it is simple and fictional, but I did! I liked it because it spoke of today's world and it spoke with clarity.Strength in What Remains: A Journey of Remembrance and Forgiveness by Tracy Kidder is equally good. This one is biographical. The author lets Deo, a survivor of the Rwandan/Burundi genocide, speak of his experiences. This is non-fiction, but it too speaks with clarity and leaves an important message about the world we live in today. Is there hope? Yes, but the main message from both is that people of the 21st Century must keep themselves informed and must get involved.Kidder\u2019s book clearly explains both the Rwandan and Burundi genocides. Although they are interrelated and do share some similarities, there are differences too. In both countries poverty, malnutrition and lack of educational opportunities have led to the underlying problems. In both countries Hutus comprise the overwhelming majority of the population, but in Burundi the military and political power was transferred to the Tutsis by first the German and then the Belgian colonial authorities. In Rwanda Hutus were in power. Both countries became independent from Belgium in 1962, and in both countries Belgium failed to prepare the governments for a successful takeover of power. The ethnic differences have been reinforced by the colonial parties. In Rwanda there was a government of the majority fighting against a powerless minority. The Burundi genocide was a prolonged ethnic civil war by a minority government fighting against rebels of the majority. The chapters flip between those focused on Deo\u2019s personal experiences and the historical details of the war. In addition, Deo\u2019s experiences do not follow a chronological order. I would have preferred that they had. Chronologically you start in the middle, when Deo has just gotten to the US in 1994. He had been in his third year of medical studies in Burundi when he fled from rampage of killings in Burundi to Rwanda, back to Burundi and then to NYC, an immigrant with neither English, money nor even a green card. He went from an inferno to another situation scarcely better, but he survived. Later in the book the author accompanies Deo back to Burundi and Rwanda. He also accompanies Deo to those places he lived in Harlem, the exact sites in Central Park, to Soho and to those who gave him a helping hand. The reader looks at how Deo dealt emotionally and intellectually with his experiences. It all would have been simpler had the events been presented chronologically. That is my one complaint with the book.The audiobook is narrated by the author clearly, but without any special flair. I have no complaints about the narration.I liked this book because it clearly explains the details of both the Rwandan and Burundi genocides. Deo comes to work with Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of Partners in Health, about which the author has written another book: Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World. Here the focus of the book is set on what path we must follow into the future. This I liked too. That is why I picked up the book. Where will the future take us?"}, {"userName": "Meri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368201-meri", "userReview": "It's not easy to write an effective genocide memoir. At first, it shocks and moves the reader to see people turn on each other, bodies burned, and children slaughtered. As the bodies start piling up, we start feeling numb and removed from the violence, which seems cartoonish at a certain point. Tracy Kidder takes a different approach by starting the story in the middle, as Deo is leaving Burundi. We suffer with Deo as he struggles to find his feet as a penniless illegal immigrant in New York with no friends or family to speak of, but we have no idea what kind of emotional blows he has been dealt before he got on the plane. I read a review that said that Deo's troubles in New York were worse than those in Burundi, which is ridiculous, but it's certainly no picnic. It's like Kidder is easing us into Deo's rough life. The center of the book is dedicated to Deo's nightmarish experiences in Burundi and Rwanda in the 90's. The end follows Deo as he takes Kidder through the spots of his memory. We watch him suffering from PTSD through Kidder's eyes, another aspect that many genocide memoirs lack. People who experience genocide and write about it can't step outside of themselves and talk about the effects. Kidder shows us Deo's continued struggle with what he has seen, giving us a clearer message about the human ability to get through tragedy--messily, and never completely."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041716-michael", "userReview": "Despite the awkward title (a quote from Wordsworth) this is a great book about good and evil, even better than \"Mountains beyond Mountains,\" although it is in way a sequel to Kidder's essay on Dr. Paul Farmer, the man who single-handedly took on tuberculosis and the World Health Organization. The tale of Deo, a survivor of tbe Burundi holocaust (a lesser-known adjunct to the Rwanda slaughter), is more accessible as Deo, a medical student refugee, is (at first) less heroic than Dr. Farmer, Deo is a man with fears and weaknesses manifested in chronic stomach problems and nightmares. Narrative is not always Kidder's strength but he's come up with a novel structure here. First he tells the story of Deo's remarkable survival. Then he retells the story examining the motives of all those who threatened and those who saved him--the angry Hutu rebels, the kindly New York intellectual couple who takes him in, prevents him from being deported, and puts him on the road to medical school. Finally he describes the aftermath of the Rwanda/Burundi holocaust and the potential for healing. In doing so Kidder actually describes the roots of good and evil in rational terms rather than leaving us scratching our heads about man's innately savage or noble nature. And he does so without excusing the atrocity. Great stuff."}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "This is a readable but mediocre book that gets a lot of praise because it\u2019s about an impressive person and a tragic topic. Deogratias grew up in rural Burundi with few advantages, but made it to medical school, until he got caught up in the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi in 1993. A friend helped him flee to New York City, where despite a job delivering groceries he found himself homeless at first, until making friends who helped him get back on his feet. He then went to college and medical school in the U.S., and returned to Burundi to set up clinics for people with no access to health care.This book reminds me of Ashley's War, in that both are about people and subjects that absolutely deserve a book, but their authors sell them short. Kidder\u2019s writing feels superficial throughout. From early on I had the impression that he was drawn to Deo but never really understood him (or perhaps Deo wasn\u2019t willing or able to open up to the extent an author would need to write a biography that appears to be based mostly on his own disclosures), and so was able to relate the facts but only on the surface level. This becomes even more apparent in the second half of the book, when Kidder accompanies Deo on one of his trips back to Burundi. They visit numerous memorials and sites from Deo\u2019s past, and Kidder describes how Deo reacts, but in the end we get more of Kidder\u2019s feelings about the trip than Deo\u2019s.Though this is primarily a biography, we do get some information about the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi as well, along with a brief overview of the countries\u2019 history. Though, again, this feels superficial, it\u2019s an adequate starting point and is interesting for a reader with relatively little knowledge of the area. Especially interesting is Deo\u2019s theory that the genocide was made possible in large part by structural violence \u2013 that when everyday life is full of fatal illness and injury, hunger, violence at home and at school, and little opportunity to improve one\u2019s lot in life, people perceive the value of their own lives as low and therefore value others\u2019 even less. Also interesting is the fact that, although westerners reading about the genocide assume Hutu and Tutsi are clearly definable ethnic groups, the reality seems to be anything but; these are apparently social groups more than anything else, and it appears Deo isn\u2019t alone in being unable to tell the difference.At any rate, this is a very readable book, not a bad choice for those who are interested in the topic. (It\u2019s also worth pointing out, for those unsure about whether they can handle a book about genocide, that only one 35-page chapter is all about that; most of the book is about Deo\u2019s life before and after, and about Kidder spending time with Deo and the people who helped him in New York.) But I\u2019m underwhelmed by Kidder\u2019s writing and likely won\u2019t recommend this to others."}, {"userName": "Clif Brittain", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2801751-clif-brittain", "userReview": "I have read most of what Kidder has written, and this is my least favorite of his books. The others I could have read purely for the subject matter or because I love the way he writes. My favorites include House, Among Schoolchildren, and The Soul of a New Machine because they satisfy both cravings. I liked Mountains Beyond Mountains because it gave me so much new information far outside my normal interests.This book did not hold as much fascination for me. It is really two books, one about the Burundi/Rwandan civil wars and genocide. The other is about Deogratias, a Burundian refugee who ended up in the US. The genocide I cannot get my mind around. Eleven thousand dead in a day by machete and clubs is typical. The carnage is similar to Civil War battles in which more sophisticated weapons were used and there were political ideals involved. The motives of fear and revenge are beyond comprehension.Deo is the most naive character I have read about in non-fiction. I have trouble understanding how he can have seen and experienced so much and still be surprised that people treat each other badly.I would recommend this book only to people who want to know more about genocide or how recent refugees have made a living in the United States. Do not expect this book to satisfy your yen for Tracy Kidder's writing."}, {"userName": "Walter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143854-walter", "userReview": "Tracy Kidder's Strength in What Remains is a compelling and compellingly-told story, certainly worthy of any reader's effort, but, in the end, somewhat incomplete or vaguely disappointing. Simply put, the story ends too soon and we never quite find out what his protagonist accomplishes relative to his new life vision. (We leave him as he's just begun to attempt it, which feels premature after the significant and moving ground that we have covered with him to that point.)The subject/hero of this book is Deogratias and his story is truly one of the amazing, only-in-America variety. A native of Burundi, he grows up in a rural area but is given the opportunity to go to a good school, gets into college and then medical school (the first in his family to do these things, of course) and then his world falls apart as the country comes apart in the civil war that was the Hutu-Tutsi genocidal conflagration (that has been much more well-documented in neighboring Rwanda). He manages to escape the genocide, makes it to America and in the United States another incredible tale unfolds, transforming him from a homeless grocery deliveryman into a medical student in a little more than five years. The final third of the book is what he does after he has established himself in America to address the situation back in his native land.Sadly, for me, it was this final third of the story - unfinished in my assessment - that was less compelling. In addition to the author's injecting himself and his thoughts into the storyline more (especially his tendency to share his projections of his protagonist's feelings rather than confirming them), he also ends the story just as Deo begins to realize his vision of doing good works back in Burundi. It almost felt like Kidder had a deadline and couldn't hang around for the end of the story.Other than this, though, this is an incredible life story grippingly told. In the sections of the book describing Deo's experiences amidst the genocidal insanity, the story is so well told that you can picture what is happening ... and it becomes a disturbing reality that forces you to imagine what an absolute horror it must have been for this incredible young man to experience first-hand.So, overall, I recommend this book for three reasons: its compelling and compellingly told story; its chronicling of an unfortunately underappreciated period in modern history; and its significance - Deo's story is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit that contrasts hopefully against the darkness of which we as a species are also capable (and that he experienced and through this book we experience with him)."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana", "userReview": "I'm about 4/5 of the way through this book, and I wanted to record my impressions. I love this book. It's heartbreakingly sad but also enheartening and healing, in some inexplicable way. I love Deo, the person whose story this is. I've felt since the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi that my understanding of and response to this episode was pathetically inadequate. I know that that particular time and place was not special or odd. Things like that can happen anywhere, anytime. A few of the factors that supported such a sequence of events are ignorance, fear, and the severe poverty and desperation of the populations of those two countries. Poor governance, and scare-mongering by unscrupulous elites so that they could remain in power also played a part. But here's the thing: none of us is completely immune from this scenario. Only a small portion of the populations of the two countries were involved in the militias, in the slaughter of their neighbors. Perhaps 2% or 3%, that is all it takes, apparently.So my deep puzzlement remains. What is it that causes people to give up the rule of law for anomie? And what happens to reestablish the rule of law and normalcy afterward? It's something we as a species really need to understand well, so that we can protect ourselves and each other, and quickly do whatever is needed to put a stop to conditions like this, to rebuild nomie out of anomie. So I've been pondering and worrying the question in the back of my mind ever since, during these last 16 or 17 years.Riots sometimes have broken out in the US in various places in my lifetime. There was the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s, which happened when I was a young child and unaware of what was going on, yet it could have led to a state of armed violence. It might have been another Northern Ireland, an endless series of attacks and counter-attacks with no political solution for decades. I'm so grateful that it didn't come to that, so grateful that we found reason, found something approaching justice. Not complete justice, not a perfect solution, not by a long way, but something far better than we had before.This book, though, stretches my heart and extends my sympathies to all the people in the world who live in conditions of intolerable poverty. There's no reason at all that everyone born on our planet shouldn't have access to clean water, to adequate nutrition and medical care, means for prevention and treatment of treatable diseases, decent housing, clothing, adequate parental care, and education. Those are the non-negotiable elements that must be put in place very soon, in the next few decades, to avert human extinction. It's the only thing for a caring and decent civilization to do, and it's also wise and in everyone's self-interest. We simply can't afford to throw away all our human capital anymore. So as heartbreaking as episodes like this are, as painful to examine carefully, it is necessary that we do open our hearts and minds to these situations and the people who become victims of them. It's possible for us to do that. Our hearts can be stretched wide. There's no limit to the compass of the human heart. We can ask ourselves and expect ourselves to care about all 7 billion humans alive today. It's not beyond our capacities in the least, we just have to accept and open our minds and hearts to receive it.The book is very well-written and allows the reader to become immersed in the story and forget all about her local time and place, even one that contains seven devastatingly cute 5-week-old kittens. The story is a true one. The implications of it are broad. It gives me a whole lot to think about, how the human mind and spirit overcome impossible trauma, how it's possible to bring to pass great good out of horrible evil, how to transform things that are grievous beyond understanding into building blocks for good things in our future. For, make no mistake, that is the task at hand for the human species today. There have been many genocides throughout our history, but sooner or later, one way or the other, there will be a last genocide. Let's make it come true today."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45247598-donna", "userReview": "A true story of a young Burundian (a country I now know exists) who fled his country to escape ethnic genocide in the early 1990s.

After reading Mountains Upon Mountains about one of my heroes, Paul Farmer, I couldn't wait to read Strength in What Remains. I was not disappointed! Deo is a Burundian refugee, arriving in the United States. Through flashbacks, the reader begins to understand the horror that Deo underwent as a Tutsi in his country. As hatred once again grew to a high pitch among the Hutus and Tutsis in Deo's country, Deo started making meaning out of these slogans: \"At the level of the ear,\" meaning \"a machete's proper target,\" and \"Warm them up,\" meaning \"Pour gasoline on Tutsis and light a match.\" As a third year medical student intern, Deo hid under his dorm bed, holding himself flat against the springs of his mattress, while patients and non-patients were facing genocide. The only reason that Deo ran away safely was that he forgot to lock his dorm door, leaving it open. He knew he was free when he heard the words, \"The cockroach is gone. He ran away.\" Everyone else had locked his door.Deo escapes to the United States in hopes of freedom. As he slept on the floor in an apartment in Harlem, he was mugged and one week's meagre salary of delivering groceries was stolen. Deo begins sleeping in Central Park, a safer place, out in the open air. Tracy Kidder sums up Deo's frustrations so well:\"He stood on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Ninety-sixth Street and looked at the traffic. What was going to be his future? His life and the future he had imagined had been, not interrupted, but wiped out. There was no future now that he cared to occupy. When would his life be over? Would God please hurry up and end it? It was getting dark. Rush hour was past, and cabs and cars were racing by. Maybe it would be a good idea to close his eyes and run out into the middle of the street.\"When Deo befriended kindness by an ex-nun who connected him with the Wolf family who would house him, give him an allowance, and pay for his education, he was still riddled by nightmares and sleeplessness.\"Again and again, on the perimeter of sleep, Deo was visited by sudden vivid images, of machete and flesh, and by those dreams, in which, sooner or later, he had to run but couldn't move. He would get out of bed and tiptoe to the bathroom and take a cold shower, as cold as he could stand, then try to stay awake.\"Deo's hopes become a reality through the generosity of good people, sheer will and brilliance, Deo achieves his dream of attending Columbia University, medical school, and devotes his life to healing others.

I say \"nearly indescribable\" because Tracy Kidder accomplishes what must have seemed impossible at the outset; he constructed a word picture of hell. Kidder begins the story in 1994 where Deo had just arrived in New York after fleeing Burundi and then slowly reveals Deo's history of growing up in the 1970's in his Burundi village and of his education in the 1980's which led him to an interest in building a clinic. Kidder's description of Deo's flight from the genocide is horrific. And, the description of his plight in New York City in 1994 when he arrived with $200, no contacts, and no English skills was - well, I lack a suitable adjective for that experience.Kidder paints an interesting picture of Deo. Deo is approachable and unapproachable at the same time. You feel like if he were in front of you, you would want to reach out to him and at the same time would want to avoid him because you could never truly understand him.I am glad Kidder spent time analyzing the people in NYC that showed compassion to Deo. It makes the reader look inside his soul and ask, what makes a person able to open their home to a scarred stranger? My favorite chapter was the one where Deo took Kidder on a tour of his college campus. Kidder points to the juxtaposition of a student, who has seen the depths of hell, studying philosophy and human nature. A student trying to make sense of something that has no sense.This book left me with a sense of the evil that sprouts from perfectly avoidable poverty. Deo says that kind of poverty makes you somebody who you are not.My son has just read \"The Grapes of Wrath\" for school and we talked about the scene where Steinbeck writes how there is a turning point where when \"poverty and injustice to ME\" becomes \"poverty and injustice to WE then the seed of revolution starts."}, {"userName": "Mikey B.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b", "userReview": "A very strong rendition of the genocide in Berundi and Rwanda based on the personal experience of a victim (Deo).The book is divided into two sections.

But perhaps I am being too cynical; credit must be given to the spirit of generosity of people who dedicate themselves to aid those in need. Even if one person is helped it can radiate outwardly.His African experience always forms the background of the New York story. The portrait of Deo is intimate and enthralling. Even though he has endured the worst that humanity has to offer, he never loses site that goodness can be found in the least likely of places.

He managed to survive the initial violence and then fled the country to New York, where he lived in an abandoned tenement, occasionally slept in Central Park, and delivered groceries for $15 per 12-hour shift (plus tips, when he could bring himself to accept them). He was eventually befriended by an ex-nun, and artist and a professor, which gave him the means to pursue citizenship, improve his living situation, and take up his studies again, all in the hopes of improving the desperate situations of the poor around the world.Deo's story is both horrifying and inspiring. (Who knew there were still people in the world who would put themselves so entirely on the line for an African refugee, a practical stranger?) It's wonderful to know that someone can survive genocidal violence and yet keep a basic sympathy toward humanity. Nevertheless, the book never hit the right note for me. My suspicion is that Tracy Kidder (and through him, the reader) was never able to truly understand Deo as a person. He never comes through as a wholly three-dimensional character, and that makes him hard to relate to. Perhaps this is because no one who has not witnessed such soul-shattering violence can ever understand it. That seems likely. But in the end, I found Daoud Hari's memoir of genocide in Darfur, The Translator, to be more immediate, authentic, and reachable than this work from the better-known and widely acclaimed Kidder.

He found himself in New York with $200 in his pocket, no language apart from fluent French and no contacts. After going through immigration, and arousing sympathy from a baggage handler from Senegal, he lived with him in squatters\u2019 apartment in Harlem, and later after the Senegalese had gone back to his country, together with the homeless in Central Park. He worked for 15 dollars a day (in 1994!) delivering groceries, and was sick and traumatized. He was afraid to tell anybody his story for fear of reprisals to himself and to his family back home. Plagued by intense stress and malnutrition, he was ready to die when he befriended a church worker who finally helped him. It wasn\u2019t easy to help him though, as he was still too afraid to reveal the truth to anybody \u2013 about his past and his present alike. His past was horrific, and he wasn\u2019t ready to let anybody in on the story just yet, but then gradually he did.Against all odds, and after many twists and turns, he studied at Columbia and then started medicine, met Paul Farmer (Mountains Beyond Mountains), with whom he shared a passion for medicine, and got deeply engaged in spreading health care in Burundi. In many ways in fact, Doe resembles Farmer in his single-mindedness and perseverance.A fascinating read. Well written too."}, {"userName": "Kathrina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569242-kathrina", "userReview": "This is a riveting account of one young man\u2019s flight from the violent chaos of genocide in his home country of Burundi, his abrupt introduction to the unjust social system of New York City, and the resilience of his character that allowed him to rise above his circumstance, finally returning to Burundi to found the country\u2019s first non-profit medical clinic. The first 2/3 of the book is seen through Deo\u2019s eyes -- the horror of sudden and incomprehensible violence, the blind flight for safety, the kindness of a few strangers providing that narrow lifeline towards survival, and the arrival to a strange new world that doesn\u2019t bring the promise he had hoped and strived for. Yet between the nightmares of his past and the darkness of his present, Deo dreams of returning to Burundi as a doctor, and caring for the people and the country he was forced to leave behind. Through a series of contacts and long patience, Deo finds the people that help him to fulfill his dream. One of those people is the author, Tracy Kidder, who finishes the last third of the book with his observations of the journey he and Deo take together, returning to Burundi and the emotional sites of terror in Deo\u2019s past, to make peace, to remember and forgive, and to build the clinic that will symbolize a new era of progress and peace for his home community. \tThis book was lent to me as part of a book group kit from the ICPL. This title is currently the One Community, One Book title for Iowa City, and the ICPL encourages group discussion and participation in local programming. I have never participated in a One Book event before, excluding a discussion I hosted in my bookstore for the One Book discussion ofA Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah. This was the true account of a child soldier in Sierra Leone, who was able to escape that violence to spur activism here in the United States. That title is similar to Kidder\u2019s in both content and tone, beginning with unspeakable evil and ending with inspiration and hope for a better future. \tI must comment on the observation that One Book titles seem frequently to deal with contemporary social crises that plague various corners of our world. From civil unrest in Africa to natural (followed by civil) disasters like Katrina (Zeitoun), One Book seems both dedicated to enlightening its communities to world affairs of import, and at the same time guilting its readers to read of issues they should feel \u201cashamed\u201d not to have pursued on their own. Does One Book intend to raise activism at home, or just create some healthy discussion? I cannot yet discern its true aim. I am familiar with at least two local book groups that have given up including One Book titles on their reading lists, because they were \u201cjust too depressing.\u201d \tDepressing perhaps, but the social activism/memoir has become something of its own genre in recent years. I am reminded of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, The Price of Stones, and Born in the Big Rains, all memoirs that not only describe lives disrupted by civil unrest, famine and plague, but also boast a narrator who escapes these trials, obtains formal education and organizes activism in the United States, and returns to successfully bring change to their home communities. One of these titles goes so far as to publish a website on its last page that inspired readers can visit to contribute funds for school-building and clean water installations. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this kind of solicitation, but it certainly changes the nature of the reading experience, leaving the reader to worry that \u201creading\u201d the book was not enough; that more is still expected of them. As for Kidder\u2019s book, the least a reader will do is be reminded to acknowledge the humanity of the delivery boy, the cab driver, the homeless man sleeping on the park bench, and consider what the circumstances of our class-divided society have smothered in him. At best, a reader might be inspired to take action, either directly in Burundi\u2019s needs for social and civil structure, or in the needs of the reader\u2019s own community. And maybe that\u2019s the purpose of One Community, One Book -- to begin a local conversation that invites the \u201cother\u201d and creates \u201cus\u201d. Whatever the results, this read is stimulating."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2081136-joel", "userReview": "Strength in What Remains tells the true story of a young man named Deo, who flees from his home country and tries to re-establish his life as a refugee in New York City. Burundi, a tiny African nation bordering Rwanda, was engulfed in violence in the 1990s when a Hutu politician was murdered by members of the Tutsi-controlled military, setting off a chain reaction of mob violence and brutal military crackdowns that eventually spilled over into Rwanda.Deo was a medical student in Burundi's only medical school when the violence broke out. He traveled for weeks on foot with nothing to eat, while militias armed with machetes and hand-grenades massacred entire villages. When he finally escaped the country - with the help of a well-connected friend of Belgian descent - he found himself struggling to start a new life in which he was no longer a promising medical student, but instead, a homeless refugee who spoke no English and couldn't sleep for fear of the terrible dreams about what he had seen in Burundi and Rwanda.Long story short: things turn out all right for Deo. He ends up getting an education and returning to Burundi to try to make the war-torn nation a better place. Hurray!I thought that the portions of the book that took place in New York City were substantially better than the portions that took place in Burundi. I can't put my finger on exactly why this is the case, but the portions that occur in Burundi - the portions that are supposed to be the most riveting and the most disturbing, don't really come across that way. While the causes of the genocide are interesting, the question that most interested me was: how can a person continue to live a normal life after witnessing such atrocities? Whether it's the tribal massacres in Burundi and Rwanda, the mass executions in Cambodia or in the Soviet Union, ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, or the gas chambers of Bergen-Belsen - how can a person witness these things and feel anything but bitterness and rage? How could anyone live through these things and still believe that human beings are good and worth trusting? These are the questions that arise after Deo has escaped the genocide, as he tries to adjust to a new culture, a new language, and a new life in which he must accommodate the memory of the things he has seen.Deo's story turns out far better than those of most of his compatriots. Nevertheless, it isn't exactly a happy ending; the fact that he managed to salvage a life from the wreckage of the genocide is tempered by the fact that the genocide occurred at all. Strength in What Remains is equally the inspirational story of man who overcomes tremendous odds and the tragic story of what could have been - for Deo and for Burundi - if the violence had never occurred."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7788548-joan", "userReview": "I could not put this book down. Kidder takes the title of this inspiring tale from the words of William Wordsworth. It is an amazing, true story of a young man, Deogratias (or Deo), who is displaced by the genocide and civil war in his country, Barundi. He was a medical student in 1994 when the fighting forced him to flee. He was lucky to have the help of a fellow medical student, who provided him with a plane ticket to NY. He arrived knowing no English (his medical education had been conducted in French) with $200 in his pocket and no connections. At first, he lived in abandoned tenement buildings in Harlem or slept in Central Park, eking out a meager living as a grocery delivery boy.\tThe conflict in Barundi, which is a tiny country just south of Rwanda, was intertwined with the genocide there. Deo is a Tutsi, and Tutsis were being murdered by the thousands by Hutu militiamen. While on the run, before he was able to escape to the United States, Deo witnessed unspeakable suffering and horrible atrocities.\tThis remarkable book shows Deo\u2019s courage and determination to do something good, to help the impoverished people of his country and his refusal to buy into the ethnic hatreds that had caused so much death and destruction. But without the generous help of some very good people he met in NY, he never would have achieved his dream. He went to Columbia University and eventually founded a public health clinic in his home town in Borundi. He finished medical school in the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen.\tKidder does a good job of telling the story and staying out of the way. He provides enough historical background so that the reader gets a sense of the context of the violence, including the role of the colonial powers in sowing the seeds of the terrible crisis. As horrible as it is to contemplate the mass slaughter that occurred in Rwanda and Borundi, it is also uplifting to read Kidder\u2019s compassionate account of this incredible, bright young man and the good-hearted people who helped him to succeed."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/280049-mary", "userReview": "Once again, Tracy Kidder has done what he does so well - provided a world of information and a host of questions that need to be thought about, by telling the compelling story of one amazing individual. Deogratias is a survivor of an impoverished childhood in rural Burundi, ethnic massacres in both Burundi and Rwanda, and homeless poverty in New York. He was a third year medical student in Burundi when he was forced to hide and flee for months. Although fluent in French he knew no English when he eventually made his way to NY, where he was helped by a series of lucky encounters - from Muhammed the Senegalese baggage handler who took him to his rent-free tenement in Harlem and taught him to ride the subways, to Sharon, the former Benedictine nun, who was determined to find him a place to live, to Nancy and Charlie Wolf, who all but adopted him. He made his way from a $15 a day grocery delivery boy to a student at Columbia University, to medical school at Dartmouth. While a medical student, Deo met Paul Farmer (the subject of Kidder's previous book, Mountains Beyond Mountains), went to work for Partners in Health, and was given a renewed sense of purpose. One of the many interesting thoughts this book left with me is that it takes far more than a translating dictionary and a simple conversation to understand a person from another culture, because some ideas and values are so different that there are no equivalent words. Somehow, Tracy Kidder manages to convey these ideas very clearly."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom", "userReview": "Another remarkable book from Tracy Kidder in his distinct genre; part biography, part anthropology. This is an amazing story of a young Burundian (Deo) who arrives in New York city in 1994 with no money and no English and not only makes his way, with the help of a number of people, but finishes university and then begins medical school, before returning to the scene of the massacres in Burundi and Rwanda to build a medical clinic.  One of the most memorable occurrences described in the book took place as Deo is desperately trying to escape the genocide that took over both Burundi and Rwanda. Starving and exhausted, he lays down in the grass and decides not to move...to lay there awaiting his death. From a stream of refugees passing by a woman who was Hutu (he is Tutsi) sees him and tells him to get up and come with her as the border and a refugee camp is not far away. He declines and, fearing her, pleads, go ahead and kill me, but please to don't torture me. She replies that she isn't going to harm him, but he must get up and come with her. He wonders why she, a Hutu is willing to help him a Tutsi. She replies that her ethnic group is motherhood, now get up and come along. She protects him from Hutu militia seeking out Tutsi men and then covers for him as he escapes. He never sees her again. This stories and others are all the more compelling because they are not fiction.. This book was a Christmas gift from Kate.

He literally needs to run out of the hospital where he is treating patients to escape machete-wielding madmen. His months on the run are harrowing, but eventually a wealthy friend with ties to America gets him a fake work visa, and he is able to come to America. He speaks not a word of English, as he was always told and thus believed that French was the universal language. His assimilation into New York City intellectual and political life is awe-inspiring. He goes from being homeless in Central Park, to becoming a student at an Ivy league college within a span of two years. But his homeland and the family he left behind are never far from his mind, and he is compelled beyond common understanding to keep returning to Burundi and helping his people as he can. The author (who wrote Mountains beyond Mountains, about Dr. Paul Farmer, who also becomes a friend and colleague of Deo) got to know Deo well over a span of many years, and his is not a story hastily learned or told. The author accompanies Deo on one of his trips home, and his fear and discomfort are palpable.

The genocide in Burindi had many of the same factors as the Rwandan genocide -- Hutus vs. Tutsis. It was definitely an interesting read -- the protagonist Deo was a resident at a rural hospital when the fighting broke out, and barely managed to escape before making it to New York. The book focuses on his arrival in New York, and how he made it to college and then American medical school after being homeless in Central Park. The remainder of the book deals with his return to Burundi in later years to see the aftermath. The author accompanys him, and provides a lot of factual detail to go with the emotional reactions Deo is experiencing.It's a great book, but I think I've been reading too many escape from African genocide/I was a child soldier type of books, because some of the details did begin to bleed together for me.

Although the last third of the story, when Deo returns to Burundi, doesn't have the same page-turning intensity of Deo's flight from Burundi to Rwanda back to Burundi or the same pathos as the New York story, I was heartbroken by the description of the hospital where he first encountered the genocidal slaughter and to which he returned several years later.In addition, I thought the author's musings about the idea of remembrance, which run through the book, were interesting and thought-provoking. Why do we remember? What is its value? What should we remember, and how?
