The strength of the novel lies in the detail and historical period of when the Dutch East Indian Company was at it's peak.This is more a novel of suspense and mystery than of romance, although there is a romantic element to the story. It is an engrossing well written novel and kept my interest throughout but I would have liked a more detailed ending for some of the characters."}, {"userName": "Claude", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490527-claude", "userReview": "A very enjoyable historical novel that takes the reader from Ireland to Indonesia via Amsterdam, at the time of Cromwell. The first novel by Norah Lofts I have read, but certainly not the last one. Interesting characters, good story-telling that gets you involved right away. I found the end a bit weak, which is why I didn't give it five stars."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "First half was a 5, but the ending was a bit contrived. And yet the story of Maire's escape and saving of the protagonist as a babe was Cromwell century perfect. Also the Dutch sections and the entire voyage and adult life on that island had some of the best period descriptions and timely sensibilities that I've read for that part of the world or a tropical island environment as it was experienced 3 centuries ago. Few revisionists dithers at all here, Norah Lofts could have been writing a hundred years or more before she actually did write this one. It's not as good as some of her others in plotting, but one of the best in natural world and dialect nuance."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6811689-shannon", "userReview": "Norah Lofts is my favorite author and she proves it over and over as I re-read her books and continue to admire her masterful insights into the human heart and its complex motivations. She is considered a writer of historical fiction, and she is, but her books go way, way beyond pleasant little stories in historical settings. She uses historical detail to be sure, and I feel her backgrounds are accurate as well as interesting, entertaining and enlightening. However, it is her expositions behind the plots that I find so intriguing for their incisiveness and clarity into the souls of her characters, to whom, no matter in what time period, I can so relate!THE SCENT OF CLOVES is no exception. It tells the story of a young girl rescued first by an Irish servant fleeing from the forces of Oliver Cromwell and next by a kindly Dutch sea-captain, who finally (after many adventures which just seem inevitable rather than adventurous,) ends up married to the severely mentally handicapped heir to a \"Nutmeg Prince\" in the Spice Islands of Indonesia.A breath taking plot to say the least, but it is her moral dilemmas which she faces with such courage and resolve that lift this book far above the realm of this genre."}, {"userName": "~\u2606~Autumn\u2665\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36269827-autumn", "userReview": "I tend to get this book mixed up with her other book about the spice islands.

Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10249613-c-p-lesley", "userReview": "Julia Ashley, the child of English Royalists, narrowly escapes death as an infant when Cromwell attacks, then again from starvation at the age of eight. After years in an orphanage, a \"glove\" (proxy) marriage to the son of a merchant in the Dutch East India Company seems like a godsend. But she soon discovers dark secrets beneath the beauty and spices of a small Indonesian island....A lovely, clean historical novel in which romance plays just one part in a larger story and apparent clich\u00e9s twist into something other. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Spitz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950421-spitz", "userReview": "I learned about the Dutch nutmeg trade in the Western Indies in the 17th century.
