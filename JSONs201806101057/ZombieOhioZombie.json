And not just the good-girl going straight, humanizing kind of perspective of Melanie or My Life as a White Trash Zombie. No, this is 'normal' in the intelligence sense, in a person for whom 'normal' was a semi-adhered to value. It becomes clear that the narrator has been kind of an asshole. Which means the narrator is not an altogether sympathetic one; although Kenemore (eventually) avoids some of the obvious \"I'm still a good guy\" tropes, it does make Peter a bit of an anti-hero that I'm not sure I support. When he eventually starts hunting, I became uncomfortable. When he started leading a gang of undead, I really lost any empathy, and the writing itself started to make me queasy. I rather think Peter is a bit of a low-bar kind of dude--he likes power, but prefers not having to work too hard or make any sacrifices for it.

But I named it Bob instead, and we lived happily ever after.But seriously folks. I grant that the middle section of this novel can feel, at times, like you're watching Tom Hanks talk to a volleyball for an hour and a half, but Peter Mellor is so much more FUN than Tom Hanks. I loved the pacing and progression of this story; at first, maybe good ol' Pete is gonna be a Dexter-zombie and only eat the brains of \"bad guys,\" but brains are like top shelf drugs for this dude and IT DON'T MATTER. I absolutely LOVE that he embraces his Zombie nature and goes full-tilt for the glory, especially when he waxes philosophical about being an Uber-Zombie instead of wallowing in angst or worrying how quickly he's going to decay away. Who cares about all that existential bullshit when there are brains to be eaten, AMIRIGHT!?The mystery subplot is negligible, and there is no real \"noir\" feel to this story (as the back cover text suggests), but even so, the narrative voice of Peter Mellor is superbly entertaining and I had a lot of fun with this one (and even got all tense at the final show-down). One of the best zombie novels I have ever read, period."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "I don't read zombie genres. In fact, I can only remember two books related to zombies that I had read. This one came to me by accident, when I saw the advertisement and the reviews were quite positive. So I decided to give it a go.And BOY, was I mesmerized!!I enjoy reading this story, a tale coming from the zombie rather than the humans. Of course, the zombie, Professor of Philosophy Peter Mellor, isn't like any other zombies. He can still talk and think, although yes, he eats brains. I find his story to be funny but also thoughtful. This is a story how Peter finds redemption as a zombie, because when he was a human, apparently, he was a jerk and a coward. His voice is funny and fresh (from the moment he said \"Braaaains\", I was hooked). There are moments that baits big smile from me, like this ...\"I hadn't thought that I - or the original Peter Mellor - had been a good man, exactly, but neither did I think I'd been some sort of Hitler. was an oversexed disappointment who'd started drinking too much, true. But I had called only for the annexation of liquor bottles and vaginas, not Poland.\"In his new \"life\" as the undead, Peter tries to become some sort of moral Zombie, he doesn't eat good people, he draws line in killing children. Although there are second part of the book, where Peter goes in killing rampage with his band of Zombies (whom he gives names to, like Hunter, Rock Star, Mario, and Mr. Turk), when he develops hatred to human and thinks that he is better than people. But then there is redemption ... and we also find out the reason why Peter died.This book has everything ... humor, action and gore (yes, there ARE scenes of Zombies eating brain), friendship, mystic (that includes a turkey, yes, a real turkey, you just have to read it for yourself), thoughtful moments, and even romance (in-a-way).

First the pros: I really liked the story being told from the POV of the zombie, it was a fresh take. The setting in an Ohio college town was also unique, as so many of these stories take place in or near a major city. The car wreck and amnesia all worked. I enjoyed the first 50 pages and then it all went down hill. This really would have been great as a short story.The cons are too many to list: You never felt for anybody in the story- I was not on Peters side, or the humans side. This ia a major flaw. In a good zombie story, you are rooting for one of the sides. There never was a moment where I was scared- another huge flaw in this genre. We never got to know Peter or his girlfriend so I could care less what happened to them and I didn't care if they ever reunited. Peter was a very unlikeable character and not in an antihero way.Too much wondering, not enough action. Peter got bored as a zombie, and I was bored as the reader. We never knew what side he was on- one minute he is with the zombies, the next with the humans.Last, when this first took place, the zombie outbreak had only been going on for 3 weeks. Peter said people were already jaded at that point- in 3 weeks?! Nobody would be jaded by zombies in 3 weeks!If you want to read a really fun, scary zombie book- read \"Married with Zombies\" or \"Flip this Zombie\""}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe", "userReview": "Our protagonist and narator, Peter Mellor, lifts this book above the average level of zombie gore-fest. Our story begins with him awakening by the side of a highway after an accident, unlcear as to how it happened due to partial amnesia. This sets us up for a voyage of discovery as Peter recovers his identity, realizes that his accient occurred at the height of a zombie apocalypse, and that he did not survive the crash. It's a few pages more before he discovers the tastiness of brains.What follows is the story of a zombie apocalypse from the unlikely perspective of a zombie. It's a story chock full of dark humor as Peter empbraces his new \"life\", having been reborn with all the emotions and instincts that go with it. Peter's a happy corpse (a grateful dead?), though at times he's confounded be the unexpected complexities of zombie life. Skulls are not actually as easy to open as they are in the movies.This novel is not entirely free of faults. Peter's character is morally inconsistent, varying back and forth between being a friend to humans to being a self-superior predator and back again to suit the needs of the narative. And the background setting has not evolved much beyond usual rural landscape of survivors, outlaw gangs, and semi-conspiratorial military we've known since the early days of the genre. However, these faults are too minor to deaden the fun of sharing a zombie's eye view of an apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Shells Walter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2396385-shells-walter", "userReview": "Peter Mellor wakes up disorientated with a car crashed nearby. He is unsure what has happened to that car. Was he in a car accident? He also doesn't remember who he is. Getting up slowly, he grabs his hat and places it on his head, which is now half-gone.He runs across some people who recognize him and give Peter some semblance of his memory back. When he comes in contact with an old friend named Sam, he starts to realize something is not right. Zombies are all over the place and maybe he assumes he had the car crash because he was running from them. After looking at himself in the mirror with his head half-off, he started wondering if perhaps he is a zombie.Later, he watches a zombie move and eat. Something feels right about that. As it turns out he can still walk and move okay, but Peter learns in fact he is a zombie.Kenemore takes readers on a different take of an undead story, from the perspective of a zombie. However, not just any zombie, but one that talks and acts like a regular human, he just has a preference for a little different type of food, brains.This story shows that even a zombie has to deal with moral issues and try to discover who they really are.

Danny Campbell is the narrator, and he was splendid at being a zombie. The novel itself is an easy, light read, from the zombie's point of view.

Peter is a zombie. He wakes up not knowing who he is or where he is. It seems that he has been in a fatal car accident, hence the zombification. His memory of anything before the wreck is spotty at best. Title of the rock song on the radio? No idea. The year? Clueless. The Simpsons? Yes, and he specifically remembers Chief Wiggum. This is what makes Peter special. He is a zombie, but he can remember some events, feelings, and memories. He can even remember what sarcasm is and on more than one occasion uses it.Peter sets out to find people (not to eat them, though). He learns he has a girlfriend who he really cares about, and decidesf to find her. At this point Peter is still passing as a human, albeit a sick-looking one. He has not had any of the delicious zombie staple, brains. Gradually, the human that Peter was before and the zombie that he is now, meld. Peter is able to justify the eating of human brains because zombies are higher on the food chain. He gathers his own gang of zombies and they travel throughout the countryside, feasting on any humans that cross their path. This makes him happy for a while, or at least as happy as a zombie can get. In the end, though, Peter\u2019s residual humanness rears its head and he finally has to decide who or what he is. This book is in turns funny and profound. It definitely left me with unexpected thoughts and feelings. It left me with ideas and concepts that I mulled over days after I finished the book. I would highly recommend it for library collections.

I really did enjoy this book and will read the rest of this series. yet I can not give more than 3 stars here's why...-1 star for lack of noir that I was promised on the book jacket. I am a huge fan of noir and very picky on my zombie books. Being promised noir in a zombie book was one of the biggest reasons I picked up this series to read. Sadly a search from cover to cover and between the lines failed to produce one inkling of noir. :(-1 star for the ending. For me any movie, book, story, etc. is made by the beginning and the end. If the beginning is intriguing or action packed it will suck me in and make me stay even if the story slows in the middle. The end though is just as important it has to wrap everything up for me in a nice red bow. I don't mind cliffhangers as long as I know there's more in the series. I ABSOLUTELY hate ambiguous endings where you can draw your own conclusions or surmise what happens next. UM no! This is your story to tell as the author not mine. Don't imply what happens. I feel like I know what happens but again its not my story. I didn't buy the book so that I could fill in the blanks. Grrr. Big pet peeve of mine.Sorry for ranting, but I usually don't rate books low when I do I feel I need to explain myself. Those that know me know I'm pretty easy going on books.

The main character, Peter Mellor, wakes up as a zombie minutes after crashing his car into a tree. He doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s a zombie at first and thinks that he\u2019s only suffering from memory loss since he can\u2019t even recall his own name. He finds his wallet and learns his mane is Peter then grabs a knit hat out of his car for the cold even though, surprisingly, he can\u2019t feel anything. He finally discovers he is a zombie when he goes to the bathroom to wash his face, removes his hat, and realizes that the tip of his head is gone. From then on he keeps a hat on at all times and fools people into thinking he\u2019s human.

Peter discovers that his car was tampered with so now he\u2019s wondering why he\u2019s different and who tried to murder him.I think people who enjoy science fiction or fantasy type books would enjoy this story since it\u2019s based on the zombie apocalypse.

Thankfully, this book wasn't scary. The plot line was interesting and I was curious to see a zombie apocalypse from the perspective of a zombie. But, I was sadly disappointed in this book. Despite the plot, the clunky and awkward dialogue made this a long, boring book to read. Kenemore used traditional zombie lore to create his world; this would have been fine if he didn't insist on reiterating all the \"rules\" about zombies: Your have to destroy the brain, zombies walk slowly, zombies are stupid, etc. Peter's inner monologue was suppose to explain why Peter made the decision to work with his kind instead of the living, but it didn't really explain anything. It just made him unlikable and irritating. None of the characters were likable and you really don't care whether they live or die.I did listen to the audiobook version of this and found it interesting that the reader sounds like Casey Kasem.

Like every other review, the idea of a first person zombie narrative (that is, from the zombie) is so great, but I think part of my problem was that this particular voice annoyed me? It seemed overly try-hard to be edgy and funny and just sort of came off as a weirdly misdirected attempt at YA lit. The narrator, Peter, didn't seem to be to be at all reliable as a middle aged professor. Like, I get the amnesia thing, but I don't know that I'm sold on the thought that your casual vernacular drops 20 years when you lose some memories.Other than that, the story had enough pull to make me finish reading it, and there were a few points (closer to the middle or just fresh of the other side of it that) that had me grinning like the cheshire cat. After the good faith instilled via that meaty section in the middle, I wound up feeling a bit betrayed by a lackluster ending. Basically not terrible, but not great.

The premise is fantastic - I love the idea of a zombie book told in first-person POV by a zombie. I didn't really connect with any of the characters, including Peter, but I think that might have been the author's intention, given that a zombie wouldn't have the emotional connections that a live human would. There were humorous sections within the book and there were sections that dragged on. Even though it was a fairly short book, it took me several days to finish it. Part of that was because it was so dry and part was because the pages were \"filled to the brim\" - the margins were insanely small. I will say that I loved the ending.

With society crumbling around him and violence escalating into daily life, Peter quickly learns that being a zombie isn\u2019t all fun and brains. Humans\u2014unsympathetic, generally, to his new proclivities\u2014try to kill him at nearly every opportunity. His old friends are loath to associate with him. And he finds himself inconveniently addicted to the gooey stuff inside of people\u2019s heads.  As if all this weren\u2019t bad enough, Peter soon learns that his automobile accident was no accident at all.
