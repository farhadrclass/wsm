Familiarity with Rimbaud and a better memory of Faulkner's Sound and the Fury should have bumped this up another star. As it is, no one writes like Acker. She has a pen that goes all the way through to the awful, traumatic core of being human."}, {"userName": "Griffin Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25982974-griffin-alexander", "userReview": "It's impossible to know a person who's always fantasizing about you and about whom you're obsessing.Which is really to say: good luck knowing anyone, let alone yourself, except in some kind of unsatisfying dialectical self/other relationship\u2014especially because the most rampant fantasy is that of the self, or the obsession of knowing another. So, the question here is an old one: What/who is the self? Who are we actually? What is love's purpose? Yeah, it sounds trite, but I guarantee there is no precedent for how this book is trying to talk about these questions.A BRIEF LINEAR SYNOPSIS OF PLOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARITY...This question is dramatized through the repurposed biography/poetry of Rimbaud (or R) and his attempt to define himself through his love and boredom with (i.e., opposition to) society. If you didn't already know, he failed\u2014abandoned poetry at 18, abandoned his oft-spurning lover, and abandoned himself to being a gun-runner and slavetrader in then-Abyssinia where years later he died, having never returned to poetry.We then take up with Airplane, a girl bored by the Connecticut suburbs, her judgmental judicial father (mostly referred to as The Judge), who gets caught up with the first person that makes unwanted moves on her (who is also a reincarnated Rimbaud), ends up working a live sexshow, breaks up with R, and eventually lands in NYC as a writer of some kind involved with a German journalist Dom.Alternated throughout the Airplane narrative is the repurposed narrative from Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury concerning the oft-mentioned and never heard-from Caddy, in this book almost exclusively referred to as Capitol. Important to note, this entire section is from her perspective, which lacks from Faulkner's. The narrative for her is much the same, just her side of it (oh and R is again reincarnated, here as Jason Compson), and when she runs away she too ends up in New York, trying to construct a self through making art out of disemboweled dolls, having failed (like R and Airplane) to make any kind of meaningful identity out of the people who she continually fucks. This artform finally gives her to herself: \"because working... was her and her had never before been.\"AND BUT SOWhat we have is a reconstructed text on the always reconstructing concept of the self and identity. The last sentence of the book (spoiler [not like that ever matters with anything Acker writes]):\"Note: all the preceding has been taken from the poems of Arthur Rimbaud, the novels of William Faulkner, and biographical texts on Arthur Rimbaud and William Faulkner.\" This, of course, should be read in the same way as Deleuze and Guattari's \"everywhere it is machines\u2014real ones, not figurative ones\"\u2014which is to say, it is really both figurative and literal at the same time. Perhaps this would have been more helpful in the beginning, but that's the point, isn't it? It is a very disorienting beginning, and the first section on Rimbaud that lasts about 100 pages will make you lose interest\u2014power through. It reads better the second time after having finished the other two sections once the sparse discursive drops of insight have made you understand just what it is Acker is trying to get at. The Rimbaud section lays the basis for the failed attempts at establishing a self through relationship with another that will be seen again and again elsewhere.Somewhere in the Capitol section, we are given: \"We're not nothing. We're our stories.\" followed some forty pages later with the aside:\"(Perhaps there are only stories and perhaps there aren't.)\" There is quite a good deal of having it both ways here\u2014quite a resistance to the stability of the text to even be comprehended. Everything is always broken apart to be reassembled whether it be the texts of R/Faulkner, or the characters' conceptions of their own selves\u2014are they merely their memories? the people they fuck? merely the stinking meat of the physical which is the constant though alienated medium of access to the outside world from which they continually flee? simply ideological constructions in a novel used to make a point? It's really whatever you want as the reader given your own level of cynicism and/or patience for these kinds of textual and self-conscious post-modern efforts on the part of Acker. If it sounds like a drag from this review, turn back\u2014this is not the book for you.Surprisingly, the intertwined sections on Airplane and Capitol make for (dare I say) compelling character development, moreso than I have seen elsewhere in Acker, which is not to say they are \"round characters,\" but neither are they flat. They inhabit the contradictory space of the self in their timeline in the novel (adolescence thru adulthood) that feels real, even tender. They do what they do because they do, and along the way they try to understand why. In some ways, even though they are cut-up stand-ins for the exploration of the theme of the self, they feel less deterministically bound than many more \"round\" characters from less self-conscious literature (ahem, Stephen Daedalus). Perhaps it is their instability that makes them relate, or their desire to know through the chaos of not. Capitol, toward the end, changes her artistic methods. Instead of merely making the dolls cut open with guts hanging out, displaying fake interiority to what is obviously hollow, she now \"smashed up dolls and remade the pieces, as one must remake oneself, into the most hideous abstract nonunderstandable conglomerations possible and certain people saw as beautiful.\" And here we have it\u2014Acker's aesthetic in a nutshell. The move from the modern to the post-, and the conception of identity as elusive and everpresent\u2014always somewhere hovering between memories and the stinking flesh."}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "Not sure why exactly but I found the first section of this 4-part novel weaker than most of Acker's work. Maybe I've heard it all before--so many punks and poets and punk poets are obsessed with Rimbaud and his crazy affair with Verlaine. Geeze, I hate to say it here in public and all but, well, the old gun-runner never did all that much for me--and I'm hard-pressed to care as much about writer's so-called lives as I am about their works. So, Acker's take, in her inimitable pornographic, terse-sentenced, and mixed POV style struck me as so much second hand news. (My favorite adaptation of this material is Richard Hell's utterly fabulous short novel Godlike, which transposes the story from 19th century France to 1970's New York City and makes the Verlaine figure the narrator. A fabulous piece of work--highly recommended.)However, I found the second, third, and fourth sections of In Memoriam to Identity engrossing as hell. It feels like Acker's most self-reveletory novel--not sure if that's ironic given the title or if the title signals the end of the gesture. She often mixes snatches of her diaries into her literary appropriations but this one seemed heavier on the diaries and personal experience than on the appropriated voices of the Faulkner heroines and women in the author's life that she was appropriating. Two women, Airplane and Capital (the latter is also sometimes Caddy from The Sound and the Fury), plumb the depths of female sexuality, from incest to S & M through self destruction, desperate for love, sex, and survival. Classic Acker. Important ground for a female writer to cover and, I think, an amazing stylistic achievement in terms of freedom, readability, and sheer ballsyness.Looking back from the end I can see how the Rimbaud material thematically links to Airplane and Capital's search for fulfillment through incest and S & M (as R. and V. searched for it through homosexuality, cruelty, and momentary rejection of bourgeois family life) but the first part wasn't half so personal, raw, or interesting to me as the rest. (This may also be because I just read Chris Kraus's biography of Acker so I was hyper-aware of the relationships the author was churning through in her journals that inform this particular novel.)"}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc", "userReview": "This one never entirely clicked with me. Had that Acker penchant for rawly presenting desire as a kind of brutal slave-master, but the literary references were lost on me. Started off making me think a lot and then slowly went downhill. Amidst all the rebellion, power trips, and libido, it still seems like a cry to be loved. To be vulnerable, open, and embraced by another with no fear of being hurt. I believe it was based on Rimbaud and also had something to do with Faulkner--I know the former because he was a character (or what masquerades as \"character\" in an Acker book), and the latter because it was mentioned on the back cover or something. My least favorite Acker book so far."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245892-melanie", "userReview": "It almost sounds like the setup for an elaborate joke told in a depressing bar: what do Rimbaud and Verlaine, Faulkner's Compsons, and a stripper named Airplane have in common? (Punchline: ...)Obsessive love is all over the place in literature and in literary lives, and Acker weaves a few of these stories together in her wise, chaotic way. There's something here about how we create ourselves, how we assemble identity, that \"house into which you can enter, lock the door, shut the windows forever against all storms.\" (The experience of love--even or especially if it's a bad idea--can act as a catalyst for this, but suffering is not the only thing that can change a person.)"}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17035511-fred", "userReview": "I have dabbled in Kathy Acker before, having read Empire, Blood and Guts and Hannibal previously. This novel may be better than those, but for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much. One probable reason is the source material Acker is so famous for appropriating to her own ends; in this novel Rimbaud and Faulkner provide the base inspiration and I am really not familiar with either so most of its referential value was lost on me. And much like a tree falling in the forest, if the only value is in the references does the work have any intrinsic value at all? The first section is the tedious whining, probably true to life, of Rimbaud as he tries to find his place in society while chasing after the guy he winds up stabbing in some French affair. Don't Care. Never cared about Rimbaud, don't care about Europeans and their American wannabees wearing leather jackets and smoking, discussing the philosophy of existentialism. I guess I prefer Dada to Kerouac, actual artistic production to preening for an audience, and while Rimbaud's poetry, the little familiarity I have, is fine and wonderful, his biography is uninteresting to me, and I feel that's what Acker is exploring here. Maybe gay identity tales were way more exciting before our enlightened age of 2015, where they seem to be just another part of the \"coveted victim status\" diversity pigpile.  The latter sections involve a New York artist moving from the worlds of art to prostitution to sex shows and back again, with apparently a backdrop of Faulknerian reference. So, read a bunch of Faulkner first if you want the full value. I basically just feel like I read a pretty close version of Acker's own biography and was not extremely interested in it. The older I get, the more I like writers who are able to project outside of their own lives, not endlessly rehash their own personal identity minutia, which seems to be what the worst of postmodernism devolved into. Which brings us to the title, In Memoriam to Identity.

She has influenced many writers, and is among the most important postmodernist authors. Her writing is a mix of obscenity, violence, and literariness. \"In Memoriam to Identity\" (1990) is inspired by the writings and lives of Rimbaud and Faulkner; in one passage, she rewrites Faulkner's \"The Story of Temple Drake;\" in another, she retells the relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine. Her writing is challenging. She ignores rules of story, grammar, punctuation, and good manners. It is immediate, as if she wrote in an automatic way, spewing out thoughts, obscenities, ideas, scenes, memories, knowledge, nonsense.

It is subversive, transformative, reckless, irresponsible, and ingenious in every way that a book can be. IN MEMORIAM TO IDENTITY is as beautiful in its rapid-fire distortion and presentation as it is fatalistic in its understanding of what pain is. No writer understands these things like Acker does. Its flaws only solidify it even more as a piece written by someone who is very human. Piece by piece, Acker hits the mark in her self-fulfillment and aggrandizing failures to match what, in her mind, is reality when, to us, these images feel like successive fantasies of sexual awakening and disillusionment. The transformative power of human suffering. The rape, turned relationship, ideology of rationalization. The fury of the human body and how many lives are wasted in trying to achieve what is, in actuality, nothing but a passing notion of collective servitude disguised as companionship. Her aggressive nods at subjectivity become almost overwhelming in their pessimistic power. Our fellow man's preoccupation with unattainable flesh and how weak it makes us all. How we are transformed into powerhouse fuck machines with little to no resemblance of who we actually are. All of these things add up to a powerful triptych of a book, full of sickeningly frank pervasive pervertedness. No matter who you are, you will find this writing to be remorseless.
