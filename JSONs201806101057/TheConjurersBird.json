I've heard it many times. I am sure many of you heard it as well and I am absolutely positive Martin Davies heard it more than once.He is a talented guy. He managed to create a mystery story that revolves around a stuffed bird. And not even a colourful, exotic one, just a plain grey bird. To be fair, the bird is now extinct and the stuffed specimen is the only specimen in the world. And it is missing. In fact, it has been missing for 200 years or so. Using primary sources Davies creates two stories, one is a 19th century romance and the other is a contemporary mystery. I am not a big fan of two intervening narratives because I have OCD that stops me from reading more than one book at a time. I am always tempted to read one story, and then go back and read the other story. Alas, my OCD doesn't allow me to read pages in any other than numerological order either. Sigh.On the top of that Davies added a story of the narrator's grandfather search for African peacocks. Therefore we have three stories and 305 pages. You do the math.\"That Thursday evening I was working late, removing the skull of a dead owl.\"This is the first line and it shows a lot of promise but after that there just rah, rah, rah, bam, bam, bam and off we go. Davies just didn't take his time. The man can write, and he had a good story but everything was barely touched. He did a real disservice to his characters, the poor things looked all like cardboard cut-outs of themselves. The 19th century England was not brought to life either. I had to rely on the vision of the period I had in my head thanks to more hard-working authors. All in all, a decent beach read for times when you feel lazy and can only associate with like-minded authors."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill", "userReview": "So I've been on an \"academic mystery!!\" kick of late, and friends: it comes to an end today.Here's the thing about calling something 'formulaic' -- you can't really do it until you know the formula. Now, I can suspect a formula, but I don't actually read that many mysteries (or genre fiction, period), so like...it's more me saying \"this is kinda predictable\" or \"this is dumb\" than \"this is formulaic.\"But FRIENDS, I have read enough. I know the tropes. The quirky, down-on-his-luck male academic with a mildly sad past. The completely random, mildly harsh female academic who begrudgingly but inevitably helps him. Their completely unrealistic romantic relationship. Other weird academics searching for the same thing. No one needing to take time off while they chase random leads around the English countryside. And the ultimate prize, the ultimate treasure, being something that no one in the real world gives literally a single fuck about.So friends, I can now say: \"THIS SHIT BE FORMULAIC.\" Some fun terrible moments from The Conjurer's Bird, specifically:- The main descriptor of women being 'slim.' Like, he saw her slim form or her slim figure stirred him or whatever. To the point where on page 301 I barked out a laugh in public:\"He barely had time to note the slimness of her figure before she turned and the light fell golden on her face.\"hahaahah I justBARELY had timebut this guy is a winner don't worry he's got thisnoted!!!!!!!phew!!!hahahaha- Hi my name is Fitz, I have a mildly sad past. I will keep referring to \"the photo by my bed.\" You'll think it's of this ex of mine BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE. Also I will end every chapter by referencing my grandfather whose quest exactly parallels mine, just in case you didn't notice the parallel. Also I'm profoundly unlikeable so you won't root for me and if I succeed you might even be like \"aw shit I wanted the other way more interesting mildly antagonistic character to get it.\" Oh well.- Okay spoilers ahead but no one reading this review should read this book so I don't care: KATYA. Listen. Listen. Fitz has an upstairs he lets to students. Fine. Katya, his tenant, is a Master's history student whose dad is a famous historian. Fine. They exchange zero words until ~the game is afoot!~ Fine. But SUDDENLY, Katya is MASSIVELY interested in literally EVERYTHING to do with this dumb fucking bird, and Fitz, and keeps referring to her father and what a sellout he is.I mean 2+2=Katya's gonna get the bird for her dad, right? Predictable.BUT NO, WRONG, because LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS WITH HER. She displays zero qualities, and just falls in love with this weird older guy who taxidermies animals in her basement and they drive around looking for drawings of plants and hold hands. I just like ----- what the fuck?! It's so clearly wish fulfillment on Davies' part that I....I don't know. The women in these books are so one-dimensional it's ridiculous, and I'd be pissed, except everyone is one-dimensional so enh.- Who cares about birds. Why did I ever buy this book.- The historical narrative was also really dumb. Honestly, I think Martin Davies read Possession and was like \"K IMA DO IT BUT WITH BIRDS????\" and y'all know how I feel about Possession so I should really give this one star, but I tend to reserve my one-star ratings for like Really Infuriating books, and this was more laughable than irritating, so...y'know. Plus I didn't HATE reading it. Most of it. But god --- this is the last one for awhile."}, {"userName": "Lowed", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3100453-lowed", "userReview": "In 1774, an unusual bird was spotted on Captain Cook's second expedition to the South Seas. This single specimen was captured, preserved, and brought back to Englandand no other bird of its kind was ever seen again. The bird was given to naturalist Joseph Banks, who displayed it proudly in his collection until it too disappeared. Were it not for a colored drawing created by the ship's artist, it would seem that the Mysterious Bird of Ulieta had never existed.Two hundred years later, naturalist John Fitzgerald gets a call from an old friend asking him to join the search for the bird's remains. He traces the bird's history, uncovering surprising details about the role of a woman known only as Miss B in Joseph Banks's life and career.Seamlessly leaping between time periods,The Conjurer's Bird is at once the story of Joseph Banks's secret life, Fitz's thrilling and near-impossible race to find the elusive bird, and of John's grandfathers' search for an unknown peacock from Africa.There is something about this book that triggers the interest of the readers. As one reviewer has already noted, Martin Davies has a way with words and could really keep you over the edge. I'm not into birds per se, but if it has something to do with finding a lost item that could involve an unexpected adventure and an untimely love affair, then enlist me on the next expidition! \u00dcThis is a four!"}, {"userName": "Adrien", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1235580-adrien", "userReview": "This is my absolute favorite kind of book -- historical research! Like The Historian and Possession (though not *quite* as good as either), most of the novel is spent in archives and libraries tracking down obscure bits of paper. I personally love this kind of thing, and could read about looking for lost material all day long. The pacing of this novel was excellent -- it kept me turning pages quickly. With that said, that's partly why it is not quite as good as the above mentioned novels -- it was competently written with great characters and story, but a lot of me was reading just to find out what happened next. It was like Possessionbut without so much work. It all depends on what you're in the mood for. I also had a few quips with the plot, but overall it was so enjoyable that it still gets the coveted four stars. I think the highest praise I can give it is that it sparked my interest in Joseph Banks -- I love it when pleasure reading encourages non fiction reading. I will certainly be hunting down other works by this author."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500984-karen", "userReview": "I really liked this book and the switching bewteeen the two different timelines each chapter. I loved both era's but probably enjoyed the historical pieces the best - the way of life, the stigma associated with a young woman not being a virgin and its implications for the rest of her life. The adventures overseas to draw wildlife (no cameras), and the inability to communicate quickly with people on the other side of the world (no phones or even telegrams) made me focus on how very much has changed in the world and how we are both richer and poorer for it."}, {"userName": "Rory", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1816840-rory", "userReview": "This was a complete chore to read.

Then again, if the writing and story were really engaging, then I wouldn't have time to think of criticisms while reading. So: writers of historical fiction, please give me more detail. While this book had a really interesting (and mostly based on true primary source stuff) premise, it ended up feeling a little thin because the author hadn't taken the time to flesh out the time period, or create convincing dialogue that wasn't just an interlude between rushed expository paragraphs. And unfortunately I got the idea that he was a bit of a drunk (the author). And then I got the idea that the main character was based on him, and I pasted his author's photo onto the idea I had of the main character, and his unsubtle crush on the graduate student character became sort of creepy... you see, it sounds like I didn't enjoy reading this.

It took me just over 24 hours to read its 307 pages, not bad going, and not rushed, just pleasurable. There is romance, but in the background. There is mystery, deception and detection, corruption and greed, consideration of social status and mores, natural history and art, history and the seeking of information from public records, the necessity of knowing what you are looking for, be it fact or inspiration. Indeed, there is travel, through time and internationally, withh beautiful descriptions. There is sensuality, betrayal and honesty. If I begin to describe or to precis the story, it will spoil the pleasure of the reading for others, and this book deserves to be read. I really enjoyed my day between its pages, and it is a book I might well want to re-read in the future."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/478613-elizabeth", "userReview": "A short review, I'm constrained by time.I loved The Conjuror's Bird. It's a mystery with two stories running parrallel, one set in the 18th century and the other in modern day. It's based on a true story and the modern part hands on the hunt for a valuable and important stuffed extinct bird. The earlier part of the tale is about how the bird came to be in a particular family, and it explores a delicate and rare love story for which the bird is in part a metaphor.

Se h\u00e1 cerca de dois anos bastava encantar-me com a capa de um livro para iniciar a sua leitura, hoje sou bem mais cr\u00edtica em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s obras que escolho. A minha presente necessidade de conhecer in\u00fameros pormenores acerca de um livro antes de decidir se devo l\u00ea-lo, ajuda-me a escolher obras com as quais me identifico diminuindo assim, os sentimentos de frustra\u00e7\u00e3o e desilus\u00e3o que experiencio ao ler algo que se revela n\u00e3o ser do meu agrado. Por\u00e9m a minha falta de espontaneidade pode levar-me e, acredito que tal j\u00e1 tenha acontecido v\u00e1rias vezes, a perder a oportunidade de ter o prazer de deleitar-me com uma bel\u00edssima obra.Na altura em que confiava muito mais nos meus instintos no momento da escolha de um livro, descobri este mesmo romance \u2013 \u201cA Pintora de Plantas\u201d de Martin Davies. No meio de tantas outras obras empilhadas nas prateleiras das estantes da Biblioteca Escolar, poderia ter passado despercebido mas as palavras que formavam o seu t\u00edtulo e as cores quentes da capa, captaram imediatamente a minha aten\u00e7\u00e3o.A leitura foi iniciada perto das f\u00e9rias do Ver\u00e3o e por esta raz\u00e3o pude ler apenas os primeiros cap\u00edtulos da obra pois, durante o per\u00edodo de pausa lectiva todos os livros que pertencem \u00e0 Biblioteca Escolar devem ser devolvidos. O livro ficou por ler uma vez que, terminei o meu percurso ao n\u00edvel do Ensino Secund\u00e1rio e, assim sendo, n\u00e3o voltei a dirigir-me a esta recheada biblioteca. Dois anos mais tarde, reconheci-o assim que o vi numa papelaria e o mesmo tornou-se imediatamente parte da minha estante.A hist\u00f3ria desenrola-se em dois per\u00edodos \u2013 atualmente e no s\u00e9culo XVIII \u2013 acompanhando simultaneamente o professor John Fitzgerald na procura pela Misteriosa Ave de Ulieta e a vida pessoal de Joseph Banks, bot\u00e2nico e naturalista ingl\u00eas que, exibiu durante anos na sua cole\u00e7\u00e3o o \u00fanico exemplar existente da mesma. Fitz, recebe uma chamada de Gabriella, uma antiga paix\u00e3o, e logo descobre que a mesma e o companheiro atual contam ter o seu aux\u00edlio numa busca que est\u00e3o prestes a come\u00e7ar, uma busca pelo exemplar da Misteriosa Ave de Ulieta que desapareceu da cole\u00e7\u00e3o de Banks h\u00e1 duzentos anos atr\u00e1s e nunca mais foi visto. Porque \u00e9 que o casal quer encontrar a ave embalsamada? Fitz n\u00e3o sabe mas tem a certeza de que os motivos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o os mais nobres e por esta raz\u00e3o recusa-se a prestar ajuda. Ao regressar a casa ap\u00f3s o estranho encontro com o casal, o professor percebe que foi assaltado. E o que levaram? Os documentos que continham toda a informa\u00e7\u00e3o que pesquisou durante anos acerca da Misteriosa Ave de Ulieta! Deste modo, Fitz sente-se compelido a iniciar a sua pr\u00f3pria investiga\u00e7\u00e3o acerca do poss\u00edvel paradeiro da extinta ave tentando evitar que esta chegue \u00e0s m\u00e3os erradas. A busca leva o protagonista a descobrir cada vez mais pormenores acerca da vida de Banks e de Miss B., uma misteriosa mulher que se revela crucial para o desenrolar de toda a trama.Este \u00e9 sem d\u00favida um dos melhores livros que j\u00e1 li pois envolve o leitor na procura pela ave enquanto nos possibilita desfrutar de uma linda mas, realista hist\u00f3ria de amor."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034453-marianne", "userReview": "This book is actually one big meh. I've been looking forward to reading it for months but always put it off, and maybe it was the anticipation or the blurb, or my own shortcomings as a reader but it was just an epic disappointment.The concept of the book is decent but the execution was poor. I never felt invested enough in the relationships to care about the present story (which is a shame as I felt the Fitz/Gabby backstory was fascinating and heartbreaking and I wanted to read more about it) and the back story was okay, but not enough to really make you give a damn about the quest to find this extinct stuffed bird and a load of paintings.I think the book could have benefited from another 100 pages to flesh out the characters. I mean when we didn't even get to see the goodbye between Gabby and Fitz despite the history between them (in their 20 pages of interaction in the book we learn they were lovers, were married, lost a child, he left her and she continued to write to him for the 15 years they were apart but never divorced and the ending just felt so anti-climatic. Fitz and his student, Katya (who I think we were supposed to be rooting for?? I don't know - random insertion of someone to move the story along I guess but she made no indent into the story beyond solving all the clues and being the romantic foil to contrast Fitz past relationship and his new one, I think.Maybe I missed something epic that made it standout as something memorable, or maybe my love of past/futures colliding just wasn't enough to overlook a book that fundamentally is about taxidermy and is 100 pages of characterisation short of being worthwhile as a character driven book. It definitely improved in terms of readability as it progressed, but to be honest - I was expecting so much more from it when I picked it up. It's definitely not one that will be getting picked up again anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1730247-stephen", "userReview": "The Bay Thrush. If you know about birds, even a lot about birds, you probably never heard of this one. But it's real. \"The Conjurer\u2019s Bird,\" a historic novel/mystery is about a little-known, long-extinct bird. The novel toggles together two story lines: one centered on the famous eighteenth-century English naturalist Joseph Banks, while the second follows a fictitious modern-day lecturer, taxidermist and extinct bird expert named Fitzgerald. The mystery at the crux of the story is the disappearance of a specimen of the Bay Thrush, a.k.a. \"Mysterious Bird of Ulieta,\" once in Banks\u2019 possession. The specimen was real, having been obtained on the island of Ulieta (200 miles from Tahiti) on Captain Cook\u2019s second expedition to the South Seas in 1774. Yet sadly, it was the only specimen ever collected and the species was never seen again despite repeated efforts to find it. After being in Banks\u2019 collection for only a few years, the specimen itself disappeared without a trace, written record or explanation. (This is all true.) At the time, one illustration was also done of the \"dusky brown bird.\" That drawing, housed in a British museum, is the only record of the species that survives today. What happened to the specimen? Author Martin Davies uses all that is known about Banks, Cook and the fabled \"rarest bird in the world\" to create an imaginative whodunit filled with personal intrigue and betrayal. Unfortunately, the book is disappointingly short of the natural history minutiae I expected considering that two of its central characters are naturalists: one true-to-life, the other make-believe. Still, The Conjurer\u2019s Bird is a well-constructed mystery that will keep you up late at night as the story of the Bay Thrush unfolds."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5217028-pat", "userReview": "Closer to 2.5..a decent historical novel which dives back and forth from present time to the 1700s to tell the tale of the non-fictional naturalist Joseph Banks and his expedition with Cook to the Pacific islands and his love affair with an unsuitable woman who shared his passion for nature.The modern thread of the story is an attempt by a naturalist,still healing from familial sorrow,who is intrigued by the legend of a rare bird found by Banks on the voyage which may still exist somewhere in England.There's not much plot tension or in depth characterization of the players, but it's a decent read(fairly intelligent writing,some good atmospheric renditions of life in the 1700s,a not-too sappy romance,a strong female character who reminds us of the few options for women in earlier times), tho ultimately I suspect you are not likely to remember this story for long after you've closed the book."}, {"userName": "Kaethe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe", "userReview": "I know I'm not the only one who'll compare it to Possession.
