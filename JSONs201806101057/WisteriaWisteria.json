It was full of action and suspense, and an even greater mystery that was barely answered when the story reached its end. I am left wondering what the big secret is, and how it will be resolved. I must learn more about this world.I love the cover, I even made it my Facebook profile photo. It's pretty creepy and I'm inexplicably drawn to it. I'm not a big fan of scary/creepy stuff but the cover of this book was one of the reasons I signed up to read it.There's a glossary of terms in the beginning of the book, the author has created a world quite different from ours and it helped that she provided the glossary aside from describing some of the words used in the story. I liked that the main character, Wisteria, is unlike other female characters. She's average, more realistic, or I'd like to think she is based on the descriptions. I also liked that she acknowledged the fact that there are far more important things to worry about than having an intimate relationship with a guy. That was a big plus for me. I love reading intimate and romantic scenes but sometimes in dystopian settings, it's like the characters forget that they are fighting for their lives, that was not the case in this book.I liked the idea of the Family - or at least, I enjoyed reading about Bach. There's still much I do not understand about them, maybe we will know more in the next books, but they do seem like obnoxious beings - so full of themselves. It's a world I am very much interested in learning more about. Here's to hoping Bisi Leyton would write a spinoff or something.The twist near the end caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting it to be that way...but it explained some things that I didn't notice when I was reading. I should have known! Guess I was fooled too. But it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the end though so I do not know what happened to that.All in all, it had a great ending but presented more problems and questions than resolutions and answers. I will definitely wait on the second book and be on the lookout for more works by Bisi Leyton."}, {"userName": "Anatea Oroz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183325-anatea-oroz", "userReview": "This review is also posted on my blog, Anatea's Bookshelf.\nWow! Let's talk about surprises! I thought this would be a great book, but it was even better. It has aliens, it has zombies and it has romance. What else could we possibly wish for?Most of the humans are infected by Nero disease which turns them into biters. Wisteria is living on the Isle of Smythe with her mother and her brother and she is a tracker. Her job is to kill all the biters that threaten the Isle of Smythe, one of the last known places on Earth biters-free. But one day, something goes wrong and Wisteria is left alone with bunch of biters. She almost gets bitten but Bach, who is from another race called Family, saves her. I won't tell much about the plot as it would be too spoilery, but let me tell you this. This book is made of 99% action awesomeness. There's always something happening, something that makes you wanting to know what happens next. There is so much surprises and twists in this book that I lost count of them. It seems to me that every character has some secret of their own and will surprise you sooner or later. I loved Wisteria. She's just a normal girl caught up in this dystopian world and she's a true kick-ass when in danger. I feel like I could really relate to her. Bach, on the other hand, was full of mysteries. It was hard to understand him sometimes as we don't know much about Family until much later in the book. I really enjoyed this book, even though there were some minor things I had a problem with, I really did enjoy it. I can't wait to get my hands on Myopia which is the second book in Wisteria series. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes zombies, aliens or something different. You won't regret giving the chance to this book.

She had some character development going with Wisteria who comes off as being a nice mixture of strength under pressure and vulnerability when it comes to the heart. I also really liked the idea of the alien race looking down on us as our planet is being destroyed by zombies due to the Nero virus. The end of the book hints at all sorts of possibilities as to the origin of the virus and the possible implications of it for Wisteria's family. So lots of good ideas here....But....This book needed a good edit. There were lots of beginning writer mistakes which needed to be corrected. At times, the writing felt rushed, and at other times, very slow. The dialogue, in particular, was often frustrating for me because it was stilted and mechanical. I also think pieces of the story should have been introduced earlier and that the world of The Family/Bach should have been clearer. I think there is a great storyline with that particular group, too, but as it was written, I had trouble understanding who they were and why they were important. Bach comes off as a robot with PMS: one minute he's all worked up over Wisteria and two lines later, he's cold as ice. When that happens once or twice, a reader chalks it up as an odd character trait, but when it happens in every scene....well, then it's overused and makes the reader not like the character, which is too bad since he's supposed to be the hero and love interest of the story.Sound a bit harsh? It is, I admit. But this writer has so much potential! All it would take to be truly great with this story and its sequels, is to make a few tweaks in the editing department. I would still recommend checking this book out and seeing what you think for yourself!"}, {"userName": "Corina ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2919367-corina", "userReview": "WisteriaLike most books, I was drawn to Wisteria, because of the cover. There was something hauntingly beautiful about it that drew me in and created this picture in my head of a world at war type atmosphere. The color of her bright red dress against the background also caught my eye. Combine that with the summary and the mention of zombies, despite my irrational fear of them, and I\u2019m hooked. Sixteen year old Wisteria lives on the Isle of Smythe with her Mother and brother and it seems from the very beginning that she\u2019s sort of an outcast from the rest of the teenagers on the Isle. She works with her Mother as a tracker, a group of Isle citizens who track and store data about the biters in Norton and other places on the mainland. The kids on the Isle are terrible to her and the way they treated her made me angry for her. The whole Isle were run by these army guys who rationed food and kept the biters off the Isle, or so we thought. Bisi Leyton, author of Wisteria, did a great job of creating a post apocalyptic world and I have to say I liked Leyton\u2019s zombies a lot better than the ones from Ashes. Wisteria\u2019s story was compelling and when she got left out on the mainland and almost killed by biters I was on the edge of my seat. This book is full of action and there is new information being thrown at you at every turn. Oh, and Bach! I loved Bach. I\u2019m still a little confused about what Bach is and what The Family is, that part of the story wasn\u2019t as detailed as I would have liked, but I\u2019m hoping that since it\u2019s a series we\u2019ll learn more about Bach and his people in the next book. I did not like Wisteria\u2019s Mom. That woman drove me crazy. I think she and Steven were my least favorite characters, but it takes a good writer to make me dislike a character so that\u2019s something. The great thing about Wisteria is it has a little bit of everything. There\u2019s a lot of action and a bit of gore. There are some moments that just make you want to hug Wisteria and other moments that make you want to poke her and be like \u2018what the hell was that?\u2019 I think at the heart of this story though, it shows us the connection between people and how far some connections go despite how much people try to ruin or stop them. There was a huge twist towards the end of this book that I totally should have seen coming, but I didn\u2019t and when I finally realized what was going on I was stunned. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who likes Dystopia, paranormal romance type novels."}, {"userName": "Rute Canhoto", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706229-rute-canhoto", "userReview": "OPINI\u00c3OConclu\u00ed a leitura deste livro a 17 de setembro de 2012 e dou-lhe quarto estrelas, muitoooo perto de cinco.A autora criou um cen\u00e1rio apocal\u00edptico muito bem conseguido, em que os zombies s\u00e3o o maior pesadelo dos poucos sobreviventes.Gostei de Wisteria: \u00e9 humana, tem os seus medos, mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 uma personagem forte que n\u00e3o se deixa ir abaixo e est\u00e1 sempre pronta a lutar se essa for a \u00fanica sa\u00edda.

Bach is also interesting and I liked to see him fighting for Wisteria after overcoming his prejudices. I admit I'd like to see them succeed as a couple, although I figure they should still find many obstacles on their way.As for The Family, I\u2019d like to know more about them and their functioning as a society; perhaps the author will talk more about that in the second volume. I also suspect that Felip should return on that book, but I better not try to anticipate. With all this, of course I want to read the second volume.

At A GlanceWisteria was a zombie, alien, post-apocalyptic mind explosion. However, the writing wasn't great. The GoodThe concept of Wisteria is what drew me to this book. Aliens and zombies? I am so there. But I never expected the lengths this book went. I was sickened, excited, and terrified with every word, every page. I never knew what to expect next. I love a book that can keep me guessing. The world Wisteria lives in is horrifying. The world is overrun with zombies, an infection that has only missed a few small communities that the remaining survivors have put together. And though zombies should be the number one fear, Wisteria has other problems. The community she lives in is run by the strongest and smartest, and they get to do whatever they want to the rest of the community without repercussions. Wisteria is close to the bottom rung of the social order, even though she is a tracker, someone who observes the zombies and patrols the surrounding areas. I found it so hard to watch Wisteria be repeatedly belittled and abused by her community. I was actually happy when she was left to fend for herself on the outside. I respected Wisteria for her strength and endurance. This girl never gets a break but she lives her life the best she can. The trials she goes through on the outside were gruesome, but through it all she kept her friends safe and did what was right, not what was easy. Then Bach came into her life. Stupid aliens. Bach thinks himself superior to the dirt people, humans. He has to spend time on earth, watching humanity slowly die out, as a trial to become a man on his world. But when Wisteria comes into the picture, his narrow-mindedness stars to unravel. For the first time, he can see a human for something more. As something beautiful and interesting. And he can't shake the feeling that he and Wisteria have met before, but when...where? Bach was hard to care about since he did act pretty emotionless and superior most of the book, but I also caught the few times his walls cracked and the caring, sympathetic Bach came out. I would like to learn more about his people because this book only skims the surface when it comes to the aliens. Leyton was amazing at painting each scene with great detail. I could picture every place, every action without effort. And the overall theme and story has huge potential as a series. Just in this book alone we go through more than one person can handle in a sitting. So much happened it still makes my mind whirl. The tension and suspense were well done. My stomach was in cramps with the places Leyton took her characters. The world-building was complex but I did want a little more explanation on a few things. Though this book had zombies, it wasn't really a zombie book to me. The zombies were a factor but not a main focus in the story. Leyton focuses more on the relationships between people: between the aliens and the humans, between the meek and strong, and between Wisteria and Bach. Wisteria also raises a lot of questions that you are dying to be answered the whole book. Why do these aliens hate humans so much? Who was responsible for the infection? Who can these characters trust in a world falling apart? There were so many secrets revealed, and by the most unlikely people too. Nothing is as it seems. And when the Red Phoenix, alien hunters, came into the picture, all hell breaks loose. Are they bad or good? They added another element that kept the reader guessing. I am very interested to see where this story goes. Only a few things are resolved in this book, but so much is left to fix, to deal with. I want to know what's next for Wisteria and Bach because after what they went through together, I can only hope a happy ending is on the horizon. The BadI think the biggest thing that bothered me was that Wisteria was treated like crap from a lot of people and no one stopped the abuse, not even she did much to stop the verbal and physical abuse from her schoolmates. People claim to care for her but just stand by while she is abused. I didn't like it, it made my stomach hurt. But it's the writing that made me take away the one and a half stars. This book has a first-time writer feel to it. The dialogue was often mechanical and it felt off. Some scenes felt rushed while others dragged out. Bach's background or story should have been introduced sooner. I was confused for a lot of the book, especially in the beginning, on what Bach's whole deal was. And really, Bach is not a likable character. I finished the book and still didn't like him. He mostly has no emotions, but when a few shine through, it's contempt and hate for others not like him. Really, Bach, you're not that great yourself. The SnugglyNot much snuggly in this book. Bach is too mean throughout most of it for us to enjoy the few times he and Wisteria kissed and touched. Final ThoughtsI enjoyed this book overall. I wasn't wowed by the writing, but the concept kept me reading. I like books that keep me wound tight with tension and have me guessing until the end. Wisteria does that for sure. Recommended for those looking for a different kind of zombie book. Quotes\"I know you had nothing to do with the Red Phoenix attack,\" Bach finally spoke. \"I should not have let Enric do what he did.\"\"No, you shouldn't have, Bach.\" She marched up to him and poked her finger to his chest. \"I did everything I could to protect you on the street and in the dungeon. I gave you all my food. That crazy woman, Mackenzie, almost killed me because of you.\"\"I did not know.\" Bach responded quietly. \"No, you didn't. You were only thinking about yourself, your cohort, or that damn cult--whoever those people are. You see the whole world from your point of view. I get it, Bach. You've have a hard life. Well, big surprise! Everyone has had a hard life since the outbreak.\" She closed her eyes and backed away from him while seeming to hold back her tears."}, {"userName": "Loves To Dive", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5194898-loves-to-dive", "userReview": "In a world taken over by a deadly virus known as Nero Disease which turns people into flesh eaters, there are pockets of uninfected people living in isolated areas. One such group lives on the Isle of Smythe in England. Smythe is not a democracy; there is a council to make the laws and the military to enforce them. Everyone is expected to pull their own weight, man, woman or child; it makes no difference. Sixteen year old Wisteria Kuti is a tracker, along with her mother Lara and her partner, Lt. Andrew McDowell, her job is to go outside the walls of Smythe and into the deserted town of Norton to track, count and \u201ccure\u201d biters (as the infected are called) if necessary. On one such mission, Wisteria ends up getting separated from her mother and Andrew and cornered by biters. Thinking she is going to die, she tries to fight but she\u2019s lost her gun and only has her sword. All seems hopeless and Wisteria is sure she is going to die. Out of nowhere, a teenage boy comes to her rescue. She passes out and wakes up surrounded by luxury in a beautiful penthouse in London. Her rescuer, Bach, lives here with his steward, Felip, and his best friend, Enric. Soon Wisteria will find that Bach and company are not normal teenage boys. Circumstances soon change for the worse, and Wisteria and Bach find themselves on the run. Without the help of Bach\u2019s friends or Wisteria\u2019s family, Bach and Wisteria will learn to rely on each other as they face biters, cannibals, and a mysterious paramilitary unit known as Red Phoenix. Wisteria learns that no one can be trusted. Things are not as they seem on the Isle of Smythe, and even though she knows she has never met him before there seems to be some strange connection to Bach. Ms. Leyton drops the reader into a world gone mad where people live in fear of becoming infected, everything is rationed, and there seems to be no hope for mankind. This is a gritty, dark world, where there is very little beauty and children grow up much too soon. We see it through both Wisteria and Bach\u2019s eyes, each with a different view, yet both strangely connected to each other. In some ways Wisteria is your typical teenager. She goes to school every day, she has a crush on the popular boy, and is picked on by the popular girls. She also is one of the few who have been off the Isle of Smythe. She carries a sword and she knows how to use it. Poor child was obviously having hormone issues since one minute she was thinking Bach was all that, and the next she was mad as a wet hen at him. And speaking of Bach, slight spoiler alert here, he is not of this plane, which might excuse his less than pleasant personality. He redeemed himself every once in a while, but he certainly put Wisteria through the wringer more than once. There are a number of secondary characters who round out the cast. From Bach\u2019s life there is Enric and his Thayn, Piper, who is a sort of human servant that has basically had her brain reprogrammed to live to serve her master. Bach\u2019s manservant is Felip, who is part human and takes care of Bach and Enric. Neither Enric nor Felip come across as likeable, but of the two, Felip was the more likeable. Bach and Wisteria meet up with a young teenage boy named Garfield who ends up helping them out of a tight spot and who from time to time provides us with some comic relief. Back home on the Isle of Smythe, we see a good bit of Wistera\u2019s mother, Lara and occasionally get glimpses of her brother along with the kids from school and the head of the military, Major Coles pops in and out. Now the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly \u2013 There are some scenes that are a little disturbing and quite a bit of violence, normally I would say this is no problem given the story line but some are pretty graphic for a YA book. There were times when they were with Garfield\u2019s people that I had to \u201clook away\u201d. The bad \u2013 the world that Ms. Leyton built for Bach and company is a little complicated; I never did truly get a handle on it. The good \u2013 at its core this book has a good story and for the most part, kept me interested. I think the book could have used another pass with a good editor but for a first book, Ms. Leyton has done well.

Her home on the Isle of Smythe is zombie free though, and she lives there with a couple of hundred other people.Wisteria wants to be a tracker, and spends her work time off of the Isle, watching out for the zombies (or fleshers), and \u2018curing\u2019 them \u2013 killing them with poisoned arrows or a bullet to the head.With only 2 sightings in the last 6 months, the people of the island decide to have a fun run, which Wisteria thinks is crazy. She\u2019s proved totally right two when two girls leave the approved race route and go shopping for makeup in an abandoned store instead.Wisteria tracks and confronts the two girls, but ends up chased by fleshers, and has to leave the building from a second story window.Luckily for Wisteria she is spotted by a boy called Bach and rescued. What Wisteria doesn\u2019t know though is that Bach is not human \u2013 he is from an alien planet, and these aliens are able to brainwash humans into becoming their servants.What does the future hold in store for Wisteria? Why does Bach feel like he\u2019s met her before? And which is worst \u2013 being killed by zombies, or being brainwashed by aliens?This was an interesting mix of post-apocalyptic, paranormal, fantasy, sci-fi, and romance genres, but I did get a bit confused, especially towards the end.Wisteria was an okay character, although I was surprised at how much she allowed other people to walk all over her. Whilst tracking Zombies she came across as a very strong personality, but faced with school bullies she just collapsed.Bach was the sort of person who held everything back, and didn\u2019t let his true feelings show. It was a little difficult to read him at times, but I liked the way he followed his instincts and didn\u2019t try to enthral Wisteria.The storyline was okay, but it was here that I started to get a little confused. There was mention of this special coral that Bach\u2019s people used to travel to earth, and they were horrified to find that there was some on the Isle of Smythe, and went to great lengths to go there and get it. I found it quite difficult at first to work out why this was so important, especially considering that the humans didn\u2019t even seem to know what or where it was.I also got confused over the term \u2018Red Phoenix\u2019, which wasn\u2019t in the glossary at the front of the book. I\u2019m not sure whether I just missed the part where this was explained or if it wasn\u2019t explained, but even having finished the book I still don\u2019t understand what it means, or why it is important which is really frustrating, as it turned out to be really key to the storyline.There was some romance in this book although it was pretty minimal. Wisteria and Bach did seem to slowly develop feelings for each other, although in the beginning Bach was sure that they had met previously. There were special terms thrown around concerning Wisteria and Bach\u2019s relationship, but I wasn\u2019t overly sure what these meant either, which again made it very difficult to understand what was going on, and by the end I really didn\u2019t care either.Overall; this was an okay story which covered a mix of genres, but I just found too much of it confusing to be able to really enjoy it.6 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Books Mom", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7199227-books-mom", "userReview": "I wasn't entirely certain what to expect with this book.

The author's skill is certainly with description and she's able to clearly paint pictures of all the people and places Wisteria and Bach encounter. However, this is also the one drawback of the story. There are places it drags and I'd end up skimming pages waiting for the action to start again. It always did, and it was frequently heart-stopping. Wisteria and Bach are in nearly impossible-to-survive situations more than once and I had to find out how they'd make it through.So, regardless of the slow spots, there were so many questions posed that I needed to know that I couldn't stop reading.

Wisteria was a great read, it had some of the things that I love about zombie books and movies, but also had some good twists.

The Nero premise was very cool and creepy, the community if afraid of being attacked and torn apart by flesh eaters, but it also had a very Resident Evil feel, always someone fighting their way through. There were some wonderfully written creepy survivor parts. Then there was the main story- line of Wisteria and Bach (one of the strange boys), this was by far the most interesting part, Bach and his companions are nor from Terra (Earth) they are just here to watch it die, and Wisteria and he have met before but neither of them can figure out when or where. This is what kept me reading,I needed to find out.Some dislikes- very typical zombie, dystopia-- ahh there are zombies, we have to survive! I get it, there are flesh eaters and you are striving to live...sadly this has been done...a lot. So if it had not been for the weird alien boys I would not have read to the end. So if you have a thing for zombie books, you should obviously go get this one same if you like green-eyed boys that aren't from Earth."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Ward", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4831794-stephanie-ward", "userReview": "4.5 Stars'Wisteria' is the first book in a new YA paranormal/horror series. It follows the main character, Wisteria Kuti as she struggles to adjust to her new life after Nero disease changed the world as she new it. Wisteria must either fight the ones infected around the safe haven of the Isle of Smythe or risk her life by going outside it's borders and into a land full of flesh eating biters. Enter Bach, a mysterious stranger from a race known as The Family - one of the few who can live among the infected without contracting the disease. Normally Bach wouldn't think twice about a human girl, but something about Wisteria has him intrigued. Now they both must fight their way back to the safety of the Isle of Smythe - all while fighting the flesh eaters, cannibals, and a dangerous and mysterious group known as Red Pheonix. This novel was an action packed thrill ride with tons of suspense and romance along with lots of twists and turns. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and eagerly turning the pages. The writing is very well done and the story flows naturally and at a really great pace. The main character, Wisteria, is realistic and easy to like. I found myself identifying with her right from the beginning and rooting for her throughout the book. There's a definite mix of genres in the book - horror, action, mystery, adventure, thriller, romance - it definitely shouldn't just be limited to being labelled as horror. The descriptions and details of the setting, plot, characters, history, and happenings in the book are incredibly well done - which I think adds a new layer of depth to the novel that the typical novel doesn't usually have. This is definitely something fresh and exciting for fans of multiple genres - I highly recommend it to readers who want to try something unique and different from most books out there right now.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! Bisi Leyton has written a fabulous novel, showing us what life would be like if a plague hit the earth and if you were bitten you turned into a flesh eating biter. There are Supernatural people who can cross into our world and the disease has no effect on them. Those of the unaffected people who remain are all in colonies so that the \u2018biters\u2019 can\u2019t get in. If you have seen the movie \u2018I Am Legend,\u2019 this could be the sequel to that, but with a few Supernatural\u2019s thrown in!!Wisteria is a 16 year old girl who lives in one of the colonies and works as a tracker. She doesn\u2019t have any real friends on the island so she spends most of her time by herself if she isn\u2019t working. She is a quiet girl, but if she is confronted by any of the other teenagers she doesn\u2019t hold back and stands up for herself.Two of the unaffected girls go missing when she is out patrolling with her Mother and Andrew. They locate the two girls and Wisteria goes in to get them alone. Soon they are surrounded by the biters and are on the run. In swoops Bach to save Wisteria, but instead of just returning her to the colony, he takes her back to his home. Bach is a self-assured person. He sees himself as a higher being than the Terrans/Humans- they are more like pests for him. But for some reason he rescues Wisteria. There is something about her that he is drawn to and it is confusing for him. He wants to keep her close until he finds out more about her. He is very attractive, has the perfect body and supernatural powers, now who doesn\u2019t want a guy like that??I love the buildup of this story, getting to know the characters and watching their connection grow. I had no idea which way the story was headed and I was kept in suspense right up to the very end! It has plenty of action and a fascinating plot and I can\u2019t wait to see what Bisi Leyton has for us next!!"}, {"userName": "Maghon Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3382002-maghon-thomas", "userReview": "I\u2019m enamored! I love this book. It was something that was so different so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why!! First it\u2019s like aliens meets zombies meets slayers, except it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but how cool is that concept!! Lets just say it\u2019s a thrill ride!!Wisteria is a girl who lives on an island that is trying to survive from a zombie out break. She wants to be a tracker, to help keep the \u201cbiters\u201d away and their town safe. Except things go a little amiss when she gets separated and almost killed by zombies. I like her. She seems so real because she worries just like normal people do. She\u2019s worried about surviving. She\u2019s worried about her mom and brother. She worries about strangers because she doesn\u2019t want to lose anyone else. I really like.An then there\u2019s Bach. He\u2019s a boy, but a special boy from a special place. He is in a position of power and it\u2019s extremely forbidden to have human consorts. So when he saves Wisteria, even he is flustered as to why he did that. He is so mysterious and intriguing and I can\u2019t help but love him, plus he\u2019s hot! Lol and when he promises to bring Wisteria home, he keeps his promise but with a few secrets.There are some extremely interesting side characters. And the writing is excellent. I started reading this book and the next thing I knew it was HOURS later!! That\u2019s always a good book when you lose time! I will say that some of the book has a darker feel, but it\u2019s as it should as a zombie apocalypse isn\u2019t really a happy subject. And every once in a while you get to see a semblance of something normal and then BAM there\u2019s a \u201cbiter\u201d!

The opening scene, which happens to be the prologue, caught my attention right away. From then I just had to find out who Wisteria was and what her purpose entailed.One of the things I loved the most about the story was the fact that Wisteria is a strong female character that can hold her own and kick some serious zombie butt. Her life is a little chaotic though, with her line of working and having to stand up to bullies, she\u2019s pretty tied up. So meeting someone as mysterious as Bach is something new and maybe even a little exciting for her.Another great addition to this plot is of course, the strange relationship between Back and Wisteria, which only adds to the story and makes it twice as interesting. With nonstop action, which begins within the first two pages of the book and continues till the end, a sci-fi element that you won\u2019t see coming, and a female lead that is stronger both physically and mentally I guarantee you\u2019ll love this book as much as I did.Though the zombie element has been done many times before and by itself doesn\u2019t make this an interesting read, the twists and turns throughout the story make kicks it up several notches."}, {"userName": "Monique Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7490600-monique-morgan", "userReview": "The first thing that struck me as I read this book was that the main character was unlike the majority of female characters, she was not the prettiest, the skinniest, the deadliest, etc. She is what I would like to call an average, all around girl. This was refreshing to read about a character like this.I enjoyed the dystopian setting of the book, as well as the communities that Wisteria comes in contact with along the way. I wont go into too much details, as I hate spoilers, but the synopsis will give you somewhat of an idea of this. There was a twist to the normal zombie story, in that the love interest is not Terran... I mean human:) This was a nice sci-fi element to the story that I enjoyed.

But the racism, bullying, and sexism were over the top and seemed gratuitous in this already packed book. While I don't believe in the whole \"humanity comes together against a common enemy\" trope, you would think in a world where 80% of the human population was gone, these kinds of issues would be, maybe, idk, slightly less prevalent? But instead it all got heaped onto this book, particularly this one poor girl. Even the aliens found the MC an \"ugly human\", geesh. And why the entire town thought it was smart to bully the daughter of the crazy soldier/fighter woman who was also in with the Major? Well I guess they needn't worry anyway since there were literally 0 repercussions for their grotesque treatment of the MC. Also the MC never defended herself, and I kept waiting for her to beat some ass or at least hoped the love interest would save her or an adult would step in but none of that ever happened. All of this just seemed really unlikely and far-fetched. Also, I read to ESCAPE so the theme of Let's Bully the (Fat?) Black Girl was, as a black woman, very off-putting. If I wanted to see that, I could just go outside. Also also, the cover was offensively misleading.

This book had me on the edge of my seat with NON-STOP action, adventure, and drama, that I Craved for! Their was SO MANY twist and turns that I NEVER seen coming and was SO MANY parts that absolutely BLOW MY MIND! I was turning the pages faster then I could read them because I wanted, NO I NEED MORE and I had to know what happened next! I haven't found too many books that made me feel like Wisteria made me feel! When I was finished reading the first book and I went to bed, I could NOT get this book off my mind! I kept replaying everything over and over, and I wanted to get up at 2am and start reading the second book! That's how much I craved for MORE!When I first read the description I thought it sounded good, but like every other Zombie Apocalypse book. But since I LOVE Zombie Apocalypse books, I decided to read it, and I am SO glad I did because this book is SO MUCH different then another Zombie Apocalypse book out there! Bisi Leyton the author of this book has brought something new and original the the Zombie Apocalypse books, that will have readers craving more!The Plot:A Plague has swept across the world and has taken out about 80% of the human population, and turned them into mindless blood thirsty, flesh craving animals, that want to eat you from the inside out! With only small numbers of uninfected humans left, SOME humans have bound together to create settlements that are semi safe for humans to live without the infected trying tear them apart every chance they get! With pretty much nothing left and very limited food source, some humans have gone crazy and turned into cannibals that will befriend you, only to eat you when you least suspect it! But not ALL humans, and human settlements are like that.On the Isle of Smythe survivors come together to create a walled safe haven for the uninfected. Everyone is expected to pull their weight and if not they are tossed out of their community and into the infected! They need to have rules and order so their settlement can thrive. Otherwise their would be no order and everyone would be out for themselves. And we all know it won't end well that way! So everyone must pull their own weight and work together if they are going to survive! Wisteria, a 16 year old girl is trying to get by by following the rules, doing as she told, and staying off the major and the soldiers radar! She goes to school by day, being picked on and shunned by her fellow classmates, and by night she works with her mother and the other trackers, tracking the movements of the infected, getting samples from the biters (The Zombies) so the scientist can try and find a cure. Also by going outside of the walls to get what is needed and to lower the numbers of the biters by Curing them (Killing them) as they call it! Wisteria is okay with her job by night, she wants to learn how to take care of herself, and what a better way then going out and facing the worst possible thing out there, the zombies! Or So She Thought....Bach is on his Great Walk, a thousand day experience away from home. He decided to leave his realm and complete his Great Walk in the human/Terran world. Bach is not human, he is a famila from a different realm. They feel that they are Superior to humans, and that ALL humans are dirt people and worse then the biters! Bach has decide to do his Great Walk here in human/Terran world because he wants to watch the human/Terran world (Terran is what Bach and his people call humans) suffer and die from the Nero Disease (The Zombie Infection)! As a young child Bach and his mother were tortured, beaten, and experimented on, and finally his mother was killed by humans/Terrans, and he HATES ALL humans and everything they represent for what they did to him and his mother! He wants to see this world die and suffer they way that he and his deceased mother did! The famila are much stronger and faster then humans/Terrans and they can turn humans/Terrans into Thayns. Thayns or Sleepwalkers as the humans call it, is when a famila shows them a card and asks that person what their greatest desire is. And when they answer with their greatest desire, the card shows them what they want, and then they are turned into Thayns. They only live to serve and please their Liege and other famila! Only a handful of humans know of the famila's existence, and they are the ones called The Red Phoenix. The Red Phoenix are a group of assassins hell bent on destroying the famila and have inquired plants and other poisonous things that are dangerous and lethal to the famila to use as weapons against them. They are searching for famila on earth and a way to get into their realm!So when Wisteria and Bach's lives collide, they NEVER thought that they would feel drawn to each other, like they know each other, a connection that they can't explain and refuses to tell the other about! Especially Bach, with his hatefulness towards the humans/terrans. It makes him sick that he feels this way toward Wisteria, and doesn't know why! Together they experience many painful events and separation, and when the truth is revealed it will BLOW YOUR MIND!This is A MUST READ for anyone that loves zombies, other supernaturals, adventure, action, and AMAZING TWIST!

I haven\u2019t read many zombie stories and just as few sci-fi books and so I was curious as to whether this book would be of my liking. I did enjoy the concept of this book and found the story to be entertaining, but for me it simply didn\u2019t quite hit the spark as many other books have. But, it is still a book I would highly recommend and one that I am glad to have given a chance to read. Bisi Leyton is an author who has a lot of potential and I am interested in keeping an eye out for more of her work. Wisteria is a novel that is easy to devour while drinking a cup of tea and simply tuning out the world.are taking overThere are a great many things about this book that I enjoyed, one of which was Bisi\u2019s take on zombie\u2019s. I thought the way they looked was interesting, and how they moved in packs made the story interesting. But it was the way these zombie\u2019s were created that really intrigued me. This is not something that is explained until near the end of the book, so I won\u2019t spoil it but just know that it is definitely an interesting concept that I liked reading and finding out about. I felt that the world was really interesting with it\u2019s dystopian-like qualities and I think that the way she captured human interaction during this time was really clever and interesting, and just simply well done. It helped to make the visualisation of this novel easy and realistic.The plot of the book was definitely an entertaining one! You\u2019re never sure what was going to happen next, it is fast-paced, and full of plots and twists at every turn. I was often on alert, certain that something dreadful was around the corner and there were a fair few twists that I definitely didn\u2019t expect to happen! The romance in this story was also quite intriguing. It wasn\u2019t an easy-ride but it was quite intense and exciting. And the revelation at the end of why was definitely worth reading. There is enough in this novel to make it a good read, keeping the reader interested and making it difficult for them to stop turning the pages!someone must stopAt first, I struggled to find myself sympathising with the main protagonist, Wisteria. She seemed unstable to begin with and I just found it difficult to connect with her. As the story progressed, I understood her better and while there were times that her actions still grated on me, I realised that it was just who she was and how she had been brought up to be. Wisteria was stubborn, protective, caring, and loyal, but she was also angry, defensive, and hard to crack. She had a hard life and was just doing her best to survive. She made a good character for the story, and I\u2019m definitely interested to know what will happen in the next few books of the series.On the other hand, Bach, our second protagonist, was one that I easily understood. He was stuck in a difficult predicament and while it irked me how he thought about humans, it was also easy to understand from his background. He was conflicted throughout the book, not sure of his own emotions. He was anti-social but trying to be social, didn\u2019t get Wisteria\u2019s \u201cmood swings\u201d, tried to push people away because he could do it on his own but then needed people. He was a brilliant character who was on a quest to find himself, something that he was clearly having trouble with! I\u2019m curious as to how he will manage as the series continues.them before itUnfortunately, while the story was interesting and exciting, there were a few issues that I had with the story as well. Some of the place names were lost on me, and I found myself getting confused over them a few times. I also wasn\u2019t entirely sure about the dual narrative of this story at first. It seemed a little forced. I understand it was necessary but it just didn\u2019t flow well to begin with. Towards the end it did get better \u2013 or I just got used to it a bit more, but it took a while. Of course, these things are also likely to be the same reason why others will pick up this book and devour it but I\u2019m always a little iffy with dual narrations at first!is too lateOverall this was an interesting story that I enjoyed and felt was a very unique concept with a fast-paced plot. It kept the reader interested and intrigued, leaving them wanting to know what was going to happen next. It had just the right amount of suspense and mystery and left the story at the right moment. It is a book that I would recommend to zombie-lovers and to sci-fi geeks, but also one I would recommend to anyone who wants to read a book which holds a forbidden romance that has the possibility to pull at your heart-strings. If that sounds like the type of book you\u2019d be interested in, then why not pick up a copy today!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1676827-lori", "userReview": "I need to start by saying that this was one of the craziest books I've read in a long time. There is lots of action, plenty of gore, secrets, aliens, zombies, people out for revenge, and groups just in search of violence. I didn't love everything about the book but it was certainly an entertaining ride! At under 300 pages, the story never slows down and packs as much action into those pages as it can. I was able to read the book in a day because it moves so quickly and just begs you to keep reading. And while I didn't always seem to be on the same page as the book and got lost a little bit with everything that was going on, it was still highly entertaining.And I just have to say that I really love the cover of this book.We meet Wisteria right off the bat in the middle of a swarm of biters (zombies). She's living in a self-sustaining society on the Isle of Smythe and works as a tracker to try to learn the patterns and numbers of the zombies around their community. We learn that her mother is one of the best trackers but isn't too happy that Wisteria also desires to be one and sneaks out on a surveying mission. It doesn't go well. But Wisteria is young. A couple of years later, she's worked back up and is being trained as a tracker again. While out on a simple protection job, everything goes wrong and she becomes separated from her group. The rest of the book follows Wisteria as she survives on the outside with help from Bach, a boy quite different from her who is on a quest of his own to prove his worth to his own race and who Wisteria seems to be inexplicably connected to, and what happens when they finally reach Smythe again.The biters in this story are only part of what's threatening Wisteria. She must also escape from cannibals, figure out who the Red Phoenix are and why they attacked her, and decide who she can trust within her own society. I won't give away any of the secrets or twists that this books has hidden within its pages but I will say that almost all of the characters will surprise you at some point. And most definitely not in the way you will be expecting. It was one of the more enjoyable parts of the book, just trying to figure out who should be trusted and who to stay away from and finding out whether I was right or not. Leyton certainly kept me on my toes!One of my favorite parts of this book was Wisteria. She was a completely normal teenage girl who lived in abnormal circumstances. She was not the prettiest, strongest, thinnest, bravest, or most talented girl but she knew how to survive and was willing to put her life on the line for those around her. She made mistakes and got angry, she was made fun of and even had an embarrassing crush on a classmate. She was completely relatable and that helps make a great MC. She did, unfortunately, have a sort-of insta-love moment which I wasn't too fond of, but I'm forgiving her because of her circumstances and things that I won't spoil for you. It was just nice to see a female main character that didn't automatically have all the answers because she was the best at everything.There were a few frustrating parts for me. In the beginning, I had a hard time with the quick turnarounds. I often felt thrown from one story line to the next without much, if any, transition. When Bach first appeared, I was so confused I had to go back and read the whole section a second time. But once I got into the rhythm of the book, the transitions became easier. Another aspect I wasn't too fond of was Bach's story line. There was so much that frustrated me about him but mostly it was just that I didn't fully understand him. I wanted more description of him, his abilities, where he was from, and an explanation of renewal earlier in the book. When we do learn about his past, so much becomes clear. His history and how it relates to the entire story is really interesting, I wish it had been discovered earlier or hinted at sooner.Final Thoughts: This book was a crazy ride full of paranormal creatures and societies that are full of secrets. Wisteria was a fast read that fans of zombie and alien books will probably enjoy. There are some confusing moments but also some very interesting characters and some action packed scenes. While this book combines both science-fiction and paranormal elements, it doesn't really add much to either genre. There's nothing too deep hidden within these pages, but someone looking for a fun, fast, action-packed story with some intrigue should find it enjoyable. I gave Wisteria 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100497-abigail", "userReview": "Wisteria is a story about the world ending, at least how the remaining survivors of a virus which has people rising from the dead and needing to feed on the flesh of live humans. Yes, sounds like another zombie book, but it is not, it is a story from the perspective of two young people from different worlds, literally, who are not only on their own journey to finding themselves, but also trying to live in a world where the rules just do not seem to fit them, no matter how hard they try.The opening of this book is wonderfully balanced with the realities of a coming to age story in this mad mad world full of \u201cbiters\u201d and desolation. Where the only safe haven is behind walls and being protected by a crazy ass militia leader who is not all he seems to be, in fact no one is. But all Wisteria is concerned with is showing she can be as strong and perfect as her mother when it comes to patrolling the surrounding town for biters and curing those they found. Yep, they have found a cure, but it isn\u2019t bringing anyone back from the dead, just giving everyone some peace of mind.It was a great introduction to this teenage girl. She is smart, resourceful and has a bitch for a mom. Who can blame the mom, she made it across the big isle of UK with her family intact and into a safe haven. This small isle where the struggle is not so much the biters, but keeping the culture and society from collapsing in on itself. Curious though, they are able to maintain many health and medical related issues at bay, seems a lot of pharmaceutical researchers and other forms of doctors found their way to this little safe haven too, how convenient huh?The best thing about Wisteria though? The author is following the new trend of constructing a heroine who is not the perfect curb-stomping zombie killer with brains, perfect marksmanship a great rack and a nice tight ass. Wisteria apparently is short, over weight or at least stocky and is teased about her huge crush on the most popular boy in the safe zone. She is a scapegoat and her day to day existence is just being herself and making it through so she can be something other than a rat catcher. Oh don\u2019t get me wrong, she is very smart, and much more mature than most of her fellow teens, in fact she stands out from the crowd. I love her to pieces! And she rocks the red dress!Bach is another teenager, but his issues seem to be getting back home and being bored with the world around him. Trying not to be so disgusted and angry. Apparently the Terran\u2019s errrr human\u2019s are responsible for the loss of his mother. He has such a disdain for humans he chose earth at this time in it\u2019s history so he can watch it die from the infection. This is his own coming of age journey. oh wait, apparently Bach is from another planet or dimensional plane of existence So technically he is an alien, but not a little green one, more like the shmexy cute alien boys from Rosewell. He has his own little entourage of family to go along with him. He has all sorts of tricks up his sleeves and upon spying Wisteria almost get taken out by a horde of unexpected biters while trying to keep the mean girls from being ate (at least one did get ate) he ends up whisking her of to his own personal Tower of London, but not to take off her head\u2026 well not literally (spoilers, Sweetie).Do I have you sufficiently confused? Perhaps intrigued I hope so. There are a lot of great things in this book, so much more than zombies and a struggle for survival. At it\u2019s base core it is about star-crossed lovers, literally and the supporting characters roles. It is about secrets of B.I. (before infection) carrying over and still have a great and important impact on the emerging and struggling A.B.I.society. Many of the questions of what and how we adapt in such a world are addressed, but not in a traditional manner. Ms. Leyton brings to Wisteria a mixture of science fiction, fantasy, dystopic world with a twist to the paranormal romance angle! It is a YA book but as I mentioned yesterday, it is for a mature YA reader. In her interview the author addresses her stand on violence in YA novels.

I never read anything in the horror genre, but this one sounded like it was more. And it is, its like a mix of action, mystery, adventure, thriller, romance - it definitely shouldn't just be limited to being labeled as horror, and it has a dystopian feel to it as well.

It had its twist and turns that kept it interesting. I really didn\u2019t know it was considered horror until after I started reading, and seen someone say that somewhere. I did have to be careful when I read it, not a night before bed like I usually do. I would have bad dreams. So basically Wisteria's life changes when a routine assignment goes wrong and she is left stranded in zombie infested territory. Saved by a mysterious young boy who she has an odd connection with. Bach is an awkward but utterly handsome hero and Wisteria struggles to understand who he is, why he so easily survives in the middle of the infected . Wisteria starts to wonder if there is anyone she can trust in her life.Bach is a mystery; he had taken Wisteria to his apartment where he lives with 2 friends. He isn\u2019t human, and is not even from Earth. He actually thinks humans or Terrans (as his people call them) are animals. Things get strange to me with this part, about Bach being there to see the end of Earth, and that he feels Wisteria is someone from his past, but she doesn\u2019t remember. So we have that mystery. Wisteria is actually from Ilse of Smythe, a small city that had survived the Nero disease outbreak. Since the island has so much protection, there are not many cases of biters there.We get a little romance started, with Wisteria and Bach, but they can\u2019t be together as its forbidden by his people. I guess so, if they see humans as animals.Overall it is an exciting read, and think people who like zombie type, in dystopian type world, with the mysteries too, will love this. I liked it better than I thought I would.Give it a try. 4 out of 5 stars for me. I highly recommend it to readers who want to try something unique and different from most books out there right nowI got this book free at Amazon, but could have gotten it with the tour too, for my honest review. I just already had it."}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "Wisteria's life has been anything but normal. For several years, she and her family have had to scavenge for whatever they need in hopes of surviving amongst the undead. Nero, a medicine that was meant to help people all over the world, has inadvertently turned everyone into flesh-eaters. Everywhere she looks, biters lie ready to pounce and feed on the unsuspecting.Determined to not become one of them, Wisteria has decided to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a tracker. Their job is to note and catalogue the undead's movements in hopes of gleaning as much information as possible in order to find a suitable cure for the disease. Every now and then, they'll need to 'cure' the biters if they get too close. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. The biters aren't your normal every day zombies. They're relentless and hungry and are quite agile.When an ordinary mission goes awry and she finds herself miles away from her beloved safe haven, the Isle of Smythe, Wisteria soon realizes she'll need to use her wits and skills to survive the onslaught of biters intent on making her their meal. Help arrives unexpectedly in the form of a dark-haired, green eyed boy by the name of Bach. Part of her acknowledges that she finds him to be quite familiar. Unfortunately, the holes in her memory prevent her from remembering that which she needs to know.As the situation becomes dire, Wisteria and Bach do everything possible to survive the nightmare they now find themselves in. In addition to the biters, they now have to fend off the Red Phoenix, a group intent on doing away with Bach and their friends, once and for all. Bach, on the other hand, refuses to fall prey to their machinations and tries to stay one step ahead of them.When secrets of their past begin to surface, they soon realize there's more at stake than they knew. Those they love and care for are intent on keeping them from ever knowing who they really are. Fighting their growing attraction, Bach and Wisteria do everything they can to make the most of the situations they find themselves. Despite the secrets they've discovered, neither can deny that they're made for one another. Love is just around the corner, a certainty both are aware of. But first, they must deal with the obstacles that have cropped up a long the way in hopes of finding that light at the end of the darkened tunnel.I found this book to be highly delightful and entertaining. Bisi has some great ideas going on. She really does. This isn't your ordinary zombie story, that's for sure. The alien theory adds a certain amount of intrigue to the mix and I find Wisteria's vulnerability in the face of such adversities a little endearing.The book does have quite a bit of editing issues that need to be fixed. If you don't mind that and can allow yourself to read past them, this is definitely a story worth reading. I do wish that the history of the Family was expanded upon a little more. At times, it felt as if not much was explained about them or about how Bach and Wisteria truly came to meet one another. I felt that portion of the story would have benefited from a little more information. All in all, it's still a good read."}, {"userName": "Nancy (The Avid Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149266-nancy-the-avid-reader", "userReview": "The following review is my opinion and not a paid review. I received a copy of Wisteria from the author via Innovative Online Book Tours.Wisteria is a sixteen year old girl whose life has all but been taken away from her. Almost everyone she knows has succumbed to the \"Nero\" disease. The Nero disease is where humans are turned into \"flesh eaters\" also know as zombies. Wisteria, her mother Lara and brother David have made it the Isle of Smythe a safe place where every man, woman and child has to do their part in helping to make things run smoothly on the Isle. All children have to go to school and when they reach the age of sixteen then they are given a job to do.When Wisteria turned sixteen and it was time for her to start helping out in the community she was given the opportunity of becoming a tracker or a rat catcher. She chose to be a tracker like her mother. A tracker goes outside the walls of the Isle to scout and study the zombies to help find a cure for the disease. Wisteria was very good tracker she knew exactly how to use her sword when the need arose for her to have to \"cure\" a zombie. She would swing her sword right at the zombies neck and chop it off.Wisteria was not a very popular girl on the Isle of Smythe. She was always having problems with the girls at the school. You see Wisteria was the kind of person that thought surviving and learning how to protect yourself was more important than dating or going steady with a guy. But the other girls thought guys, makeup and pretty clothes was more important. So on the day that Wisteria caught in the middle of a large group of zombies and almost died was not her fault. The girls that were always bullying her were in a store \"shopping\" for new clothes and makeup. She was trying to save these girls lives and would have gotten eaten by the zombies. But Bach saw her jump off the top of the fire escape and when she hit the ground she passed out. Bach took her back to where he was staying with his friends.Bach and his friends are not who or what you would think they are. Bach can't stand Terran girls which means earth girls or human. Bach and \"The Family\" think that humans are dirt people. Bach and his friends came to earth to watch the earth people kill their world. Bach hates Terrans because they killed his mother. He doesn't want them nowhere near him but when he meets Wisteria he feels as if he knows her. But he is not sure why or how he knows her.Wisteria finally makes it back home to the Isle of Smythe with Bach's help. After their arrival on the Isle of Smythe, Wisteria finds out that there are a lot of secrets being kept.I love reading books about zombies and Wisteria was no different I loved it too. Although it did differ from a lot of the zombie books that I have read. But it being different is what makes it such a great read. If you like reading about zombies then I don't think you would be disappointed with reading Wisteria."}, {"userName": "Ali ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847230-ali", "userReview": "First, let me say that it was the cover that initially attracted me to this book. It is haunting in its simplicity and the stark, frayed red dress is a dark touch of femininity in a battered world. I really love it.When I read the blurb, I was caught by the mention of infested and flesh eaters. I, like so many others, am strangely attracted to all things zombie. I can't seem to get enough of them, whether it be books, movies or television. Needless to say, I was eager to read Wisteria.Wisteria is somewhat of an outsider on the island she lives on. She made her way there some years back with her mother and brother. She lied about her age to the head of security, enabling her to venture out and hunt the infected. She is not like the other teens in her small, military protected town. She yearns for more than the average day of mindless schooling and menial work. She's had a puppy-love crush on the cutest boy in town for years; causing only heartbreak and ridicule from other kids and leaving her feeling more of an outsider.Wisteria's life changes when a routine assignment goes wrong and she is left stranded in zombie infested territory. Saved by a mysterious young boy who she has an odd connection with. Bach is an awkward but utterly handsome hero and Wisteria struggles to understand who he is, why he so easily survives in the midst of the infected and more urgently, why he is hunted by a group known as Red Phoenix. As she fights to survive along side Bach, facts about her own life, her past and the origin of the Nero disease begin to unravel and she is left wondering if anyone in her life can be trusted.I was thoroughly enthralled with this book up until Bach entered the story. I loved the world Wisteria was living in but became utterly confused by Bach's world. I feel like it needed more ground work. The reader is kind of tossed into it and has to wade through the confusion, hoping for explanation to show itself.I do really like Bach as a character. He is stiff and formal but there are a few occasions where he becomes almost human. I liked the soft moments of vulnerability. Wisteria herself has those moments. She is mostly a strong character but with this little vein of loneliness and need that runs through her, it is hard not to like her.The story itself has a foundation for a great tale, if you can wade through the sketchy details of Bach and The Family. There is mystery, intrigue, betrayal, love and a healthy dose of zombie fueled action. I just wish that there had been more time spent building up the world that Bach is from and the connection between it and Wisteria's world and the infestation caused by Nero."}, {"userName": "Michelle Cornwell-Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6818653-michelle-cornwell-jordan", "userReview": "MY REVIEWWisteria is the tale of a sixteen year old girl called Wisteria, who lived in a dystopian society. The Governments failed after the Nero disease came amongst humans and infected 80 percent of the population. The infected was basically the walking dead, who eats the flesh of healthy, uninfected humans. These \u201cbiters\u201d have overrun society, causing many pods of communities such as the Isle Of Smythe, where those not affected, gathered together behind fence, with armed guards to live.Wisteria lived in one of these communities with her mother, and brother. Wisteria is trained as a tracker, which means her job was to go out with other trackers, and to \u201ccure\u201d the infected which the only cure was to terminate them.Wisteria, is out one day, and when attempting to save members of her community who had went into the town which was overrun with infected without permission. Wisteria is separated from her group and saved by a mysterious boy who is part of the Family. The Family is a race of being who lived in a somewhat alternate universe, who are immune to the biters, and who basically keeps humans or who they call terrans, \u201cdirt people\u201d as Thayns, mindless servants.The Family basically detests humans, and the mysterious boy and his companions were here on earth to watch the humans destroy themselves, but really not realizing why, Bach, one of the Family and the who also was one of the leaders sons, saves Wisteria. He brings her back to his \u201cden\u201d and allows her to remain until it is safe to return to her guarded community. During this time together, the two begin to share a bond, that reflects a stronger union, that supersedes bother their cultures. Many twists and turns happen and secrets are revealed involving the past and present which will affect the future for both Wisteria and Bach.Wisteria was such a refreshing, unique read! I enjoyed this story so much, I am somewhat wistful, that I cannot experience the reading \u201cfor the first time\u201d again. Ms. Leyton\u2019s account has excelled at combining paranormal and science fiction, coming forth with a wonderful elixir of entertainment, seasoned with a dash of enlightenment into a different society and custom. Wisteria\u2019s home before the downfall of society was Lagos, Nigeria which adds a unique and interesting texture to the story.This was a well written action packed adventure, that kept me glued to my seat, and having me anxious to turn the page to see what happens next! I loved this book so much I read it in one sitting!Oh my goodness Wisteria was a fantastic read, and I suggest you do yourself a favor and pick up the Next Big Thing!"}, {"userName": "Ariella", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6630274-ariella", "userReview": "More of my reviews at Secrets of Lost WordsYou can also read this review here*A review copy was provided by the author for reviewing purposes*Thank you, Bisi Leyton and YANR Blog Tours!Wisteria takes place in a world taken over by the Nero disease. The Nero disease creates biters, which seem like zombies to me. They bite and infect more people. The world is almost completely infected by it and there are a few small pockets of the world left that are save havens. But no place is ever completely safe. Not even the Isle of Smythe where Wisteria lives.Wisteria is a pretty average girl who goes to school. Has the crush on the most popular boy. Gets bullied by the most popular girls. Wisteria is a tracker. Trackers are basically people who patrol the surrounding area and makes observation about the biters. They also kill the biters if any get too close.Bach is the featured hottie of this book. He is eighteen and comes from a race known as The Family. He despises humans and is the Sen Son (the leader's son). The Family thinks humans are dirt and thinks of them as slaves. But Bach gradually falls in love with Wisteria.I'm very neutral about this novel. There's nothing that really wowed me as far as this goes. I think I've seen biters in another book before.. I think it's called Darkness Falls by Jessica Sorensen if I recall correctly. As the book progresses, we see more of Wisteria and Bach's love for each other. In the end, we actually find out why Bach thinks Wisteria is familiar.I think this novel dragged on too long. There were some places where I think it could've ended. And there were also some scenes where I feel like the book just babbled to me. Like, just extra info and it didn't really keep the suspense going.There was only one character I didn't like. That is Enric. He is such a bastard. I mean, he treats Piper so badly I don't even know what to say. Seriously, it's like Piper is lower than a slave to him. Like, she is replaceable (she is, but she's still a human being!). I think some of The Family treat their Thayn (human/Terran slaves) too harshly. I get that they're supposed to be lowlives to them, but Enric is too harsh. He might as well have spat in Piper's eyes. And Piper does nothing about it because she is enchanted to her master, Enric. Ugh.. talk about inhumane treatment.Overall, I think this book is quite interesting with a few issues. Like the one above. If you still feel like you want to read this, go ahead. I'm not stopping you."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7112494-april", "userReview": "My Review as posted at http://www.myparanormalbookreview.blo...Leyton creates a world destroyed by Nero Disease, which turns individuals into flesh eaters (more commonly known in the world of fiction as a zombie). The world she creates shows most humans as only caring about their own safety and survival. Of course, Wisteria is different than most individuals. She is a caring teenager who risks her life multiple times throughout the story to save others from flesh eaters. Wisteria, her mother and brother live on the Smythe Island, a small community of survivors. The leader of the community is Major Coles. He has created an orderly community in which all residents must pull their weight or be exiled beyond the walls of the island. Throughout the book, Wisteria, is exposed to cannibalism, human trafficking, and bullying. Yes\u2026teenagers will be teenagers no matter the circumstances surrounding them. In times of survival, humans will do unspeakable things to ensure their own safety. I must say, Wisteria is a very resilient young woman. Wisteria is herself saved by a mysterious teenager, Bach. He takes her back to his apartment where he and two friends live. He is not human and not from this realm. He and his people view Terrans (humans) as animals. Bach is only here to witness the death of Terra (earth). Soon, Bach realizes Wisteria is a girl from his past. However, she doesn\u2019t remember him. This is where the book starts to really become interesting. How does he know Wisteria? Why doesn\u2019t she remember him? Why are they drawn to each other? Then, they are attacked by a group known as Red Phoenix. Who is Red Phoenix? After the attack, Wisteria returns to Smythe Island with Bach. Finally, both of them realize they love each other. However, Bach knows they cannot be together as it is forbidden for his people to be with a Terran. If they continue their relationship, he is placing Wisteria in grave harm. The ending climax reveals so much. Bach learns of a heartbreaking betrayal and Wisteria begins to learn a lot about her parent\u2019s involvement with Red Phoenix. Is Red Phoenix responsible for the Nero outbreak? How is Bach\u2019s people involved with the outbreak? I\u2019ve a ton of questions I\u2019m sure will be answered in the next book or books. I must say this is a great start to a new series. My only constructive criticism of the book is the need for more editing.
