On the one hand, I really like it, but on the other, I am quite annoyed with it. Let me break it down into what worked and what didn't. Warning, here there be spoilers!What worked:The attention to detail. This book is slow, building on the minutiae of daily life. As each day goes by, you learn more of the aspects of Victorian Canadian daily interactions. I liked this. There wasn't any sudden hook to force the characters into impossible reactive scenarios, and there was no real feel of urgency. A girl is found dead. Well now what? Let's go through the motions, step by step. I liked seeing that process. What kinda worked:-The jumping around of narrative. On the one hand, it can be seen as distracted ploy to make the reader think that it could be any of the characters. Since it never reveals who these character are doing these nefarious deeds, you just have to assume and piece it together, but often the assumption is wrong. I liked how it let you see more insight into some of the characters, but on the other, it felt like it weakened the overall book. Murdoch is not aware of these happenings, so if feels like the reader shouldn't be either. Also, at times it felt very much like a purposeful distraction to keep the reader guessing. -Murdoch's character. I guess I'm bias because I fell in love with Yannick Bisson's portrayal of the perfect stoic, gentlemanly scholar. This Murdoch seems to lack a defining character. He's methodical and clever enough, I suppose, but it definitely doesn't seem as though he keeps up with the forefront of scientific discovery and knowledge that so emboldens the Bisson character. This Murdoch is rougher and more life-hardened. He swears a bit more, loses his cool a bit faster, drinks a bit more, and all in all, seems like the everyday kind of man, just doing his bit, toiling away, keeping his mouth shut to his superiors, and just trying to get by. -How the case was solved. Murdoch solves this case, not through scientific experimentation or any notes of brilliance, but through copious interviews and following up on alibis. In fact, I was a bit disappointing that this case was solved by basically getting all the main suspects together in the same room and watching as they ratted each other out. What didn't work:-The motive. I don't know if I read this book too fast or what, but I couldn't find a motive. It seemed as though several events were going on, but not one addressed the question of why Therese died. We found out why she left, but not really what happened to her after. Was it coincidence that she was picked up? Was the death intentional? Was it a drugged orgy gone wrong? Just what kind of sordid stuff was the alderman involved in, and why was his servant so intent on killing everyone to \"tie up loose end\" that didn't seem to even be relevant? For a book that spent so much time on crafting the scene of Victorian Toronto, it seems a let down that the same attention to detail was left out of the character motive and psychology. I finished the booking thinking nothing made sense. I was more confused, and annoyed that there was no sense of closure. Will I read more Murdoch Mysteries? Yes. Just because I loved how detailed and well written the historical scenes were. I just hope that the storylines get more flushed out."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I love the Toronto-set Murdoch Mysteries television show, and this first book in the series that inspired it is even more interesting. Strange, funny and grounded in the history of Canada, this book is like a Northern Sherlock Holmes."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13825230-becky", "userReview": "Join Murdoch as he begins a case, attempting to find the cold blooded murderer of an innocent teenage girl... Twist in and out through the turns and flips as the story unfolds and mirror Murdoch as he figures out just who had done the heinous crime. This is of course, the predecessor to the television series (which I happen to be a massive fan of!), but if you are a fan of the TV series I can safely say that you will most likely enjoy this too - but you must be aware that book Murdoch is slightly less gentlemanly and more callous, less courteous and less bashful - which are some charms that I was looking forward to reading in book form but are sadly missing. That being said, I truly do love the book version of Murdoch, too, and I enjoy them both very much the same! They have formed as two separate characters to me, but I love them both dearly (and I cannot help but see book Murdoch as Yannick, too, even though he's described as having a moustache!) and have formed quite a liking towards the book version. The appearance of Crabtree was brilliant; though I hope to see more of him in later novels so to get a feel for this version of his wonderful character! The very same goes for Brackenreid; I can't wait to see his and Murdoch's day to day conflicts! The characters are all well rounded and they leave you yearning to see more of them; they don't seem square and boring and each character has a distinguishing feature about them so you don't feel that it's the same sort of character duplicated; even the generic constables at the station house have quite telling differences about them to help you differentiate between them. It's utterly charming how each character also possesses different views and varying dialogues; which adds diversity and further depth to the story. The back stories are also really good for the characters too and it's so nice to learn about them as we go along! The mystery in this is strong, it keeps you guessing and completely pulls you in from the first page right until the very end - which, by the end, my heart was hammering and my eyes were wide; which is a sign of a brilliantly formed mystery novel. Jennings writes in such a way that you simply can't guess from the off \"who dunnit\", but begins to pepper clues here and there so that you can piece them together as Murdoch does - which helps the reader feel truly connected with the story and as if they are working alongside the detective. I felt like another Constable opposed to someone reading some documents about a case; it was written so well that I felt part of it rather than like an onlooker. The whole story was really tense and interesting all the way throughout and there definitely weren't any dull moments throughout - it kept me on my toes and well and truly kept me thinking; there was never a turn of the page whereby a thought hadn't crossed my mind. It was extremely well thought out and there was no plot holes - everything had been covered and sealed with an extremely brilliant turn of events.I can safely say that the \"climax\" of the story was incredibly intense and I felt goosebumps, my heart was hammering and I was feeling so pulled into the story that I forgot there was a world surrounding me outside of the book. It was absolutely phenomenal how Jennings made the climax so easy to read, so thrilling without any slight dose of monotony or predictability. Ahhh, it was wonderful! For me, the mystery was tense, the story was well written, the plot was well thought out and interesting and the writing was superb and kept up with the time era that it was written in; I loved how it was obvious that research had taken place in order to make even minor details like how a gas lamp was lit back then had been looked into in order to get it right! Everything was accurate to the time it was based within - even down to the entirety of the vocabulary - and it was thoroughly exciting to read. I was honestly stricken by how brilliant this book is and how wonderfully intense the storyline was; I'm definitely excited to continue with the series and would 100% recommend you check this series out for yourself! This is honestly an all round, great mystery novel - and I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone (Murdoch fan or not), who is just starting out with the mystery genre or someone who has read plenty!"}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248980-ruth", "userReview": "This is the first book in a series of seven, which are collectively known as the Murdoch Mysteries, all of which feature a Canadian Police Detective named William Murdoch, who solves crimes in the late 1800s, in Toronto. Three of the novels were adapted into television movies, starring Peter Outerbridge as the title character, and a five season (so far) television show, with Yannick Bisson in the title role, featuring the characters from the books, but with all new storylines, has proved very successful. The tv series is one of my favourite shows, so I was looking forward to reading the novels, and seeing where the character of William Murdoch began. I certainly was not disappointed. This fascinating novel which combines crime drama and historical fiction, is quite different from the tv show \u2013 Doctor Julia Ogden does not appear in this book at all, and Inspector Brackenridge only plays a minor role, whereas both of these characters are major characters in the show.The ending was not predictable; a few times I thought I had worked out who was responsible, but I was pleasantly surprised. The character of Murdoch is well drawn, as is that of Constable Crabtree. Also, the family with whom the dead girl resided were also well fleshed out. There were no real gimmicks or twists in the story \u2013 just a very well told detective story, which showed Murdoch\u2019s quick intelligence and dogged determination. I also thought that life in Toronto in the late 1800s was well depicted,with the atmosophere leaping off the page.It\u2019s a cliche to say it, but this book really was a page turner. I would highly recommend it to any fans of historical fiction or crime novels, and I look forward to reading the subsequent books in the series."}, {"userName": "Evamaria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677518-evamaria", "userReview": "The Murdoch Mysteries remain one of my favorite feel-good shows - the characters are awesome, the murders always interesting, and the science is fun. I've read critiques that some people object to Murdoch (and even more so, Julia) being so progressive, but wasn't this the age of suffragettes (New Zealand granted women the vote in 1893) and other social upheavals in the wake of the rapid changes in society and technology? In my season 1-3 DVD box there were also the 3 original tv movies with Peter Outerbridge as Murdoch - those are very different (much darker and therefore probably more historically accurate, but with much less humour), and I was interested to see if they were closer to the original books. Having read the first Murdoch mystery now, I can say that they are - although they are much more graphic. However, while unsurprisingly Yannick Bisson's Murdoch remains my favorite, I was somewhat disappointed that book!Murdoch is actually the one I like least. Not that I actively dislike him. He just remains... bland, as are most of the other characters. Actually, my favorite character was probably Joe, the stable boy, and we only got one scene from his POV. And there is almost no hint of the scientific curiosity and open-mindedness I love about Murdoch (despite him taking his Catholicism much less seriously than either one of the screen!Murdochs).So this is a lot of words about a book that had a solid mystery at its center but somehow remained colorless, despite the historical detail. I guess I'm ranting a bit because it simply surprised me that I was so disappointed - normally, books are better (or at least different but equal) to their screen adaptations, because they allow for more insights into the characters and give more background and character/relationship development.I think I'll listen to the second Murdoch novel, maybe he'll grow on me, but so far, for probably the first time ever I'm really glad the adaptations diverge so much from the original."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15637876-holly", "userReview": "As a fan of the TV show for the past few years I was thrilled to learn that the show was based on a book series and had to see how the two stacked up against each other.Allowing the book to stand on its own it was a well done mystery. Going through it I thought I had figured out who had committed the murder and was constantly changing this answer up until the end. The story itself had me genuinely interested and it took no time at all to have this story read.Having the show in my head made reading it far more enjoyable - except when they described Crabtree as a strong and athletic man ... that was hard to picture. Also, Dr Julia Ogden is missing from this story completely and she is a main character on the show. Other then that though it made it easier to become invested with the characters having that immense relatability (in other words the TV adaptation stayed true to the characters at least).If you're a fan of the TV (as any good Canadian should be) you will definitely enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Carissa", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9102458-carissa", "userReview": "It's a bit of a shock going into this book thinking it'll be all charming and quaint like Canada's television series starring Yannick Bisson. In reality, there is nothing charming or quaint about this book series. It's gritty, it's hard, it possesses a great deal of language and sexual innuendo, and there is not a single character who is wholly likeable or lovable, not even Detective William Murdoch although he's probably more realistic as a flawed human being. Still, I love the Murdoch of the tv series who is so socially awkward and endearing while still being a brilliant detective. Much to love there. And don't get me started on his senior officer, Inspector Thomas Brackenreid. The man is boorishly entertaining in the tv series and an absolute bloody terror and bigot in the book series. Thank goodness they gave him that overhaul in the television program. And where, I'd like to know, is Dr. Ogden, the female pathologist that Murdoch has a crush on?! I did like the elderly couple who Murdoch lives with as their boarder. They're gentle and compassionate . . . except towards Methodists. Apparently there's some bad blood between Methodists and Catholics, of which Murdoch happens to be one.And speaking of religion, because I'm going to do so, it was fascinating to read a book where the lead character is Catholic. It grows tiresome after awhile to read protestant fiction with a severely negative bent against Catholics. So I enjoyed Murdoch being Catholic (just like he is in the tv series). I know very little about Catholicism on the whole, but don't have a negative view of Catholics so the harsh bigotry against Murdoch and other Catholics within the book surprised me. I don't know why it did, though, since I know protestants and Catholics have a long, unhealthy hatred of one another.So, obviously, this is not a Christian novel. There is unpleasant talk of murder, of sex, of an aroused dog, of prostitutes, and there are plenty of nasty slang terms flying around for various parts of the anatomy. There's even mention of *gasp* homosexuality. I don't usually like that much \"stuff\" in the books that I read and I do think Ms. Jennings went overboard quite a bit, which is why I'm only rating the book 3 stars. Negative content should not be added to a novel simply for the sake of shock value, whether it's secular fiction or not.That said, I still enjoyed Except the Dying . . . immensely. I finished it in only a few days because I couldn't put it down. In some ways it reminded me of the originality of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael books that I love so dearly. I've already begun reading book 2 in the series. And I've done a fair job separating the books from the tv series, which took a bit of doing. But I'm growing to like Ms. Jennings' Murdoch even though I'll never love him as much as I do the Murdoch in the tv series.Ah well, life isn't always perfect."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already the first of February and I haven\u2019t posted one review.

I finally gave it a look when I was up at strange hours because of my cough and there were reruns on at crazy morning times.

Of course when I found out that the series was based on books \u2013 WELL! \u2013 You know I had to pick up the books. So on to my first review of 2017 \u2026EXCEPT THE DYINGIn the winter of 1895 Toronto acting Detective William Murdock is called out to a murder scene. A young woman is found naked in an alleyway. She is clearly not a lady of the evening and winter in Toronto is not a time anyone would be outside without clothing so obviously, this young woman met with foul play.William Murdock knows no boundaries when it comes to looking for a killer. He visits the lowest and highest echelons of society to look for his answers. And answers he finds through meticulous police work without the availability of all toys and whistles a reader might be used to in more modern police procedurals.This was Ms. Jennings debut book and it was an interesting read. It showed some good research into that era of Toronto\u2019s history and the dialogue was excellent. There were a few slow spots, but I could forgive those. Having the hindsight of reading a few more in the series before writing this review I can honestly say the books improve with each addition to the series.The cover of the book is a bit deceptive as it pictures the characters from the television series. For fans of the series \u2013 be forewarned \u2013 the book is similar but definitely not the same. While the show is often humorous and tongue-in-cheek the book is deadly serious (pun intended). I did particularly enjoy the more in-depth look into Murdock\u2019s life away from the police station.\u201cExcept the Dying\u201d is well worth the read and I\u2019m giving it 3.5 stars because I know the series improves in subsequent books."}, {"userName": "Katherine Becvar", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13520002-katherine-becvar", "userReview": "A nice gentle mystery, reminiscent of Poirot.

Murdoch has much more of a bite and is more like a real person than the archetype of a perfect detective. He gets crabby, he (lightly) swears, he dislikes people--characteristics you don't really see on the show. The mystery didn't make a whole lot of sense, and I still have questions about just how Murdoch solved the case, but I enjoyed the gritty descriptions of 19th century Toronto--not always the Toronto I have in my mind. I think Jennings tries a little bit too hard to pepper the writing with period details, but overall, I like the writing style. My one regret: no Julia! I desperately would love to see her character in print, but as far as I can tell from reading the synopses of the rest of the book series, she's not a part of this.It also appears that the series gets markedly better as it goes along, at least according to other reviewers. Considering that this book wasn't at all bad, this bodes well for me reading the rest of the books.

It was all hints and guesses and supposition rather than an ACTUAL explanation of EXACTLY what happened and most importantly WHY?? (Especially when he has an interested landlord/lady to return to at the end where a FULL explanation was begging to come out).The writer gave some good descriptions of Victorian Toronto, which as a Canadaophile I appreciated, but there was none of the humor or wit of the TV show and not very much characterization. Murdoch is nothing like his TV persona, neither is Crabtree (almost non-existent) and neither is Brackenreid. In novels you expect a lot more backstory, but this delivers little. All in all (and with what I've seen of the beginning of book #2) if you like the TV show, you probably won't like the books. Far too pedestrian and lacking in excitement.

I originally read this book because I've become a devoted fan of the Canadian television series based upon Maureen Jennings' work. So many times when I sample a book (or series of books) that has been turned into a television series, my reading pleasure is greatly diminished. That definitely was not the case with Except the Dying. Jennings' historical accuracy and her main character transform what could well have been a conventional murder mystery. While William Murdoch shows himself to be a compassionate man of principles who's still mourning the death of his fianc\u00e9e, I was also taken with Jennings' turn of phrase-- one woman is described as being \"as neat as a nuthatch\" and someone else was so hungry he \"could eat moss off a rock.\" The book also opens with a scene that immediately put me in mind of Dickens' A Christmas Carol.

There are several differences, sadly most of the differences caused me to like it less than I could have. I'd probably say that Crabtree wasn't nearly as vibrant and hilarious as he is in the show, and that was huge letdown. (Although, thank God for the lack of Dr. Ogden.)As a book on its own, it wasn't too bad. The beginning was a trifle slow, with a large cast of minor characters that was just a touch confusing to keep track of. However, about midway through the plot it seemed to get a bit more focused and the flow was better. I think I probably liked the ending best, even if it was not very original, it had a good degree of tension and properly dark atmosphere. Maybe a reason I could give it three stars rather than two, was that the book didn't go on too long, with just about the right number of pages to get across the mystery. I have a feeling that I will probably like the next book more, so I'll be giving that a chance in about five minutes.

One is found with no clothing, and it takes a while to identify that she is the maid of a well-to-do family. The other is a prostitute. While others don't see how the murders could be related, Murdoch is convinced that they're connected.The book is rife with historical detail about women's roles, the practice of medicine, and even police work in the mid-19th Century. We also see a bit about Toronto's politics during the time period.This book was a \"ripping good yarn,\" filled with lots of believable characters and plot twists. If you're a fan of the Murdoch series (as I am), I highly recommend that you check out the books."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7287767-jenny", "userReview": "SO disappointed. I was really excited to read this book- what a giant letdown, not to mention a waste of my time. The book was actually well-written, with a good variety of descriptive words. That being said, I would give 1.5 stars. This is one instance where the TV show is actually better than the book- WAY\tbetter. As far as the show goes, I really like the characters, the historical tie-ins (episodes involving Edison, Tesla, Teddy Roosevelt, etc. as well as many inventions), Murdoch's ingenuity, & scientific advances and explanations. In addition to finding NONE of this in the book, it was laced with filth and I was generally disgusted. I feel that the only resemblance the show has to the books it claims to be based on is the names & profession of the main characters. Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Thebruce1314", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4355114-thebruce1314", "userReview": "I've finally given in to the electronic revolution and read my first ebook on the iPad! After watching all four seasons of the Murdoch Mysteries this summer, I was curious about the books. The characters are a little different and Murdoch's love interest was missing from this first installment, but overall it was quite an enjoyable book and a very quick read. I love the setting of turn of the century Toronto; the author has clearly done her research and it was easy to imagine myself wandering the lamplit streets of Hogtown. My only complaint was that the ending wasn't very satisfying - there were so many possibilities and the culprit seemed like a bit of a letdown, but overall a good story."}, {"userName": "Jaret", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9849985-jaret", "userReview": "This was a pretty good first novel in a historical fiction series. Unfortunately, my opinion was probably colored by the fact that I watched the TV series first. My perceptions of Murdoch were colored by what I had seen in the series, which didn't add up. However, once I got over that, I was able to enjoy the story more. The storyline itself was interesting, a sort of upstairs/downstairs story where everyone has secrets to keep. I was fine with the ending. It wrapped up in a way that made sense to me. I'll definitely continue the series."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862206-cindy", "userReview": "I really wanted to read this first book about Detective William Murdoch since I really enjoy the Canadian television series. The book is well-written, with lots of twists and turns as to who the murderer turned out to be. Murdoch is a little different from the tv character, but that is to be expected. I plan to read the second book by Ms. Jennings. I hope Constable Crabtree and Inspector Brackenreid is more prominent in the books to come."}, {"userName": "Sven Vahar", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2148766-sven-vahar", "userReview": "Have to agree with other reviewers who've seen the series first and then read the book: book is definitely weaker. Murdoch is drawn somewhat shallow and other characters lack unique personalities save some of them. I'd probably rate the book higher if hadn't followed the series for a while.There are two things that left me unsatisfied in addition to character development: what was the motive for the murder and why bring in Mr. X to carry the crucial part of the solution?"}, {"userName": "Scott Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15209423-scott-williams", "userReview": "I've been a fan of the Murdoch Mysteries television series for a few years but am only now getting around to reading the original novels. This is a fairly simple story but Jennings' writing makes it a wonderful read. It's obvious that she's done a great deal of research and her attention to detail is wonderful. In a way, this book is a valentine to Toronto. Jennings' descriptions really bring 19th century Toronto to life. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572977-kate", "userReview": "Decent police procedural but I'm obviously spoiled by the attractive character played by Yannick Bisson in the TV series, because the personalities are not nearly as strong in the book, the solution seems rather motiveless, and watching before reading made it clear how very loosely the books are related to the series. Obviously I'm not the only one because it was tough to get ahold of this through my public library and it's the first in the series."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1982521-carol", "userReview": "I enjoyed the book.
