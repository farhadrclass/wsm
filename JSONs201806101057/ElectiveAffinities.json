Se si mette un pezzo di una simile pietra in acido solforico diluito, questi si lega alla calce e insieme a essa diviene gesso, mentre quel leggero acido aereo evapora\u00bb. Quindi un nuovo elemento, C, \u00e8 intervenuto nel legame tra A e B provocando una separazione, autorizzandoci a \u00abusare addirittura il legame affinit\u00e0 perch\u00e9 pare proprio che un legame venga preferito all'altro\u00bb.A volte pu\u00f2 succedere che B, anzich\u00e9 evaporare come succede all'acido, una volta separato da B, possa essere attratto, poniamo il caso, da D, ma che continui comunque a cercare il legame con B, che invece \u00e8 talmente preso da C da considerare ormai il vecchio legame inesistente, diciamo pure inutile, a negare persino che esso sia mai esistito, addirittura.Ecco, tra elementi chimici, la scoperta e la moda degli anni in cui Goethe scrisse \u00abLe affinit\u00e0 elettive\u00bb, tanti problemi non ce ne sono, tutto va secondo natura, ma tra Charlotte e Eduard, il Capitano, e Ottilie, \u00e8 tutta un'altra storia. Una storia in cui ci si interroga tra convenzione, legittimit\u00e0, illegittimit\u00e0, matrimonio, divorzio, mutevolezza, libert\u00e0, passione, dove forse le parti pi\u00f9 intense, ancor pi\u00f9 della storia in s\u00e9 e dello sviluppo della stessa, sono proprio i ragionamenti sulle istituzioni e sui sentimenti.Ma io, dico la verit\u00e0, in questa storia, di passione ne ho trovata veramente pochina, molto romanticismo \u00e8 chiaro, perch\u00e9 al contrario mi \u00e8 parso di incrociare il rimbambimento maschile di mezza et\u00e0 della B, la bellezza dell'asino della C, la saggezza dell'uomo D e l'incredibile equilibrio di una A che, dopo aver tentato di salvare in ogni modo il proprio legame, si ricorda di non essere \u00abterra calcarea\u00bb e decide di comportarsi da vera donna e di uscire elegantemente di scena.Io, invece, quindi, resto qui, perplessa, a interrogarmi sul fatto che non sono affatto le affinit\u00e0 elettive che credevo io, una volta superata la fase dell'attrazione lo slancio e la passione iniziali, e cio\u00e8 gli interessi, l'identit\u00e0 o lo scambio di vedute la crescita e l'intesa cerebrale, a rendere saldo un legame, un'intesa intellettuale prima ancora che fisica, quanto piuttosto quell'improvviso guizzo che attira un elemento verso un altro, la chimica insomma.Ed io che pensavo che l'amore fosse alchimia!Chimica, invece, tutto qua?\u00abNel mondo le cose vanno diversamente: dietro il sipario si continua a recitare e quando si rialza non si ha pi\u00f9 nessuna voglia di vedere o udire il seguito.\u00bb"}, {"userName": "Vasha7", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3850379-vasha7", "userReview": "I read this beautiful novel in German. Though I might have objected to how structured it is, so full of symbols and echoes, in the hands of a master like Goethe it only contributes to the subtle atmosphere. What's more, the characters are individual and detailed, as comes out through their interactions and words. I found myself pitying Ottilie rather than being annoyed by her submissiveness (in any case, there's more to her than submissiveness); and Charlotte struck me as one of the most likable, admirable characters I've encountered in pre-20th-century fiction. She's not an anachronistic feminist, but rather a self-possessed person whose experience of life has contributed to her good sense; at one point she gently but firmly rebuts a man who's made some generality about women. A shocking event was increased in impact in that it was the first thing that ever shook Charlotte into saying something irrational.If Goethe has any opinion about the real significance and proper solution of the painful tangle of emotions in this story, he expresses it only indirectly; like most of the best novelists, he raises more questions than he answers. He describes the social forces that are trying to plan and control everything, yet can only do so in part. In the end, this book seems less of a tribute to romantic love (such a destructive force) than to friendship, which survived everything and was not destroyed by bitter feelings as it could so easily have been."}, {"userName": "Ana Carvalheira", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13764703-ana-carvalheira", "userReview": "Ap\u00f3s a leitura de \u201cAs Afinidades Eletivas\u201d, escrita em 1809, ocorreu-me debru\u00e7ar sobre a an\u00e1lise deste extraordin\u00e1rio romance de uma forma diferente, respondendo apenas a uma pergunta: porque Johann Wolfgang Goethe \u00e9 t\u00e3o atual conseguindo, no s\u00e9culo 21, reunir tantos admiradores \u00e0 volta da sua obra?

This book, as well as das Leiden des Jungen Werters, have clearly shown to me the beauty of die Deutsche Sprache. Because of this reason I would recommend everybody with only the slightest knowledge of German, to read this in the original language. A translation could never grasp the majestic feeling in which Goethe seems to soak all his words. Die Wahlverwandschaften is in the first place a book about interpersonal relationships. The titles refers to the chemistry that occurs when certain people are placed together. In this book, a wealthy couple, Eduard and Charlotte, invites two friends: one, a frail, polite girl, the other a solemn guy, who temporarily is out of work. It does not take long until things start to change in this once stable family: in no time Eduard falls in love with Otillie, the girlfriend of Charlotte. And Charlotte starts having feelings for Hauptmann, the friend of Eduard.The passion, the forbidden love, is a theme that Goethe handles well. The desperate feelings that the protagonists experience are translated into descriptions of intense craving for something that cannot be. Especially interesting is how each person deals differently with the emotions he or she experiences and this supports the main point of the work: people are slaves to their personalities.One should not live his life without having read at least one work by Goethe. It makes you think about the way we experience emotions, and how we are all part of a mysterious game, driven by even more mysterious forces.

I am no such reader. To me, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s Elective Affinities felt like a soap opera from a parallel universe (i.e. Europe\u2019s romantic period). While containing some terrific turns of phrase and a few ruminations about human nature that still ring true, Elective Affinities is first and foremost a paragon of anachronism. The motivations and actions of the characters are inexplicable in modern terms, and the narrative arc follows a queerly Shakespearan route, mirroring the Bard\u2019s romantic comedies in the first part and his tragedies in the second.This book is about four aristocratic lovers: Eduard and Charlotte, a married couple, and Ottilie and the Captain, the unfortunate objects of their extramarital affections. Eduard and Charlotte\u2019s pampered life is upset when Ottilie and the Captain both undertake extended stays at their estate. As Eduard falls for the demure and naive Ottilie, Charlotte\u2019s respect for the Captain\u2019s emotional maturity (a quality she also possesses) draws her away from her husband. In Goethe\u2019s words, these characters have \u201cnatures which, when they meet, quickly lay hold on and mutually affect one another\u201d (52). The four companions debate whether human relationships result from some predetermined sequence of events (i.e. chemistry), or because affinities can be \u201celective\u201d: \u201cOne relationship was preferred to another and chosen instead of it\u201d (54).This is an interesting and persistent philosophical question, but one that fails to imbue this particular narrative with much lasting value. This is because Goethe\u2019s characters are either boring or profoundly unlikable. They spend all their time bickering about 19th-century first world problems, such as Eduard\u2019s discomfort when someone reads over his shoulder, outdated theories of gender essentialism, and strategies for the optimal placing of a new path in the already-opulent grounds surrounding the mansion. Eduard is the worst by a long shot, proving himself an insufferable pissant whose only \u201cvirtue\u201d is the luck of his wealthy parentage.Elective Affinities captures European consciousness prior to the advent of Marxist thought. Goethe\u2019s protagonists blithely ignore the struggles and inner lives of the servants and peasants who surround them, treating them like meatbags whose only decent purpose is to facilitate dinner parties and dig garden beds. From two centuries\u2019 distance, it is almost comic to observe Goethe\u2019s utter lack of perspective regarding the bourgeoisie\u2019s inability to extend humanist principles to members of the proletariat. At one point, a lovesick Eduard encounters a beggar and proclaims, \u201cYou are to be envied\u2026You still enjoy your alms of yesterday, but my happiness of yesterday is gone!\u201d (134).In trying to untangle this knot of misplaced affections, Goethe goes for the kill in the novel\u2019s final act. He does his best to wring some genuine tragedy out of this overblown and haughty story, but fails in almost every regard\u2013except one. This book is a success insofar as it shows how the people in Goethe\u2019s world were utterly constrained by the ridiculous social expectations of aristocratic life. Lives are ruined and lost because of natural developments that, while causing appropriate emotional stress, should never result in the maudlin outcomes depicted here. Elective Affinities helps us realize that, despite its many sins, the modern world is better than what came before.This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."}, {"userName": "Georgia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38401-georgia", "userReview": "It was interesting.

Specifically he was interested in chemistry and the law of attraction. \"The tendency of those elements which, when they come into contact, at once take hold of, and act on one another, we call 'affinity', states one of the characters in the book. So Goethe applies these laws that are being discovered in chemistry to human relationships, and so creates a sort of 'formula romance'. It was interesting to see how he wove these different scientific ideas and also the current aesthetic philosophy into the story through the conversations of the characters and the structure of the plot.

For the modern reader, the term of Elective Affinities could be understood as a condition, which is open to emotions and romances. At Goethe's time, however, it had a technical meaning, used only in chemistry. The fact that Goethe made use of this term, and its subsequent modern interpretation, is due to the author's genius and explained in the way the novel is elegantly constructed. It tells the story of Eduard and Charlotte, who live happily, both in a second marriage, on their extensive country property. To help his dear friend in need, Eduard invites Otto, the Captain, to live with them, until his difficulties could be overcome. Charlotte on her part misses some female company and therefore invites her young niece Ottilie. Who, as she is not successful in her studies, is wasting her young life away in a boarding school. The four characters now present, affinities make their choice, and nothing is left as it was before. The secret courtship between Charlotte and the Captain and the raving desire of Eduard for young Ottilie throws chaos into the marriage. The consequences are many, and in different directions, corresponding to each character involved. The outcome is, not unexpectedly, a drama that slowly and painfully destroys all involved.If Goethe\u2019s novel is a deep, yet measured, smooth and neutral exploration of love and passion, it is also a reflection on the complications arising out of close human relations, and human experience with love and desire.

It might have provided scandal and titillation during the start of the 19th century when this was first published, but might bore 21st century readers, like what it did to me.It must be mentioned, however, that this must have been Goethe's own personal favorite as it was loosely based on his own experience. He had lived in with a woman for more than 18 years (they had 5 children) before marrying her in 1806 when he was 57 and she, 41. Thereafter, however, he fell in love with an 18-year-old girl, a foster-daughter of a printer/publisher. This, and his other subsequent affairs with young women, gave him so much inner conflict and made him write beautiful sonnets. Which proved, once again, that exciting things like infidelity, extra-marital affairs and wars are good for literature. In Chapter 11 of this novel Goethe wrote the following after a character had told a story which was eerily similar to what had supposedly really happened to another character:\"The event described had actually happened and had involved the Captain and a woman neighbour of his; it is true it had not happened exactly as the Englishman had told it, but its main features were intact and only individual details had been developed and embellished, as tends to happen with tales of this sort when they have passed firstly through mouths of the crowd and subsequently through the fantasy of an imaginative and stylish narrator. For the most part everything and nothing remains in the end as it was.\"From the depths of your despair you wrote and bequeathed us this love story, Goethe. So from the depths of my own despair after slogging through it, I salute you, imaginative and stylish narrator!"}, {"userName": "Chiara F.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50926066-chiara-f", "userReview": "Si deve avere la costanza di leggere fino a 50 pagine dalla fine per poter trovare azione e risoluzione a questo romanzo, che si conclude tragicamente come le pi\u00f9 classiche opere romantiche, di cui peraltro Goethe \u00e8 emblematico padre.Del resto, se si esclude il finale, tutta l'opera sembra essere un escamotage narrativo per poter esporre attraverso i diversi personaggi gli argomenti cari allo scrittore, temi tipici del Romanticismo, che vanno dall'ammirazione per l'arte e la classicit\u00e0 all'elegia, dall'amore eroico alla passione per i viaggi ed il soprannaturale. Persino gli estratti del diario di una delle protagoniste, Ottilia, sono succedanei ad aforismi legati alla societ\u00e0 e ai comportamenti umani, rappresentando cosi uno spaccato dei manierismi ottocenteschi, nonch\u00e9 una personale visione di Goethe del mondo del suo tempo.Beandoci delle visioni naturali e degli scenari paesaggistici che sembrano a loro volta incarnarsi e divenire per lo pi\u00f9 espressioni dei sentimenti dei personaggi dell'opera medesima, seguiamo il dipanarsi di una storia d'amore che inizialmente si manifesta come un intreccio di coppie le cui affinit\u00e0 si dispiegano naturalmente, si evolve con una nascita inaspettata e grottesca (perch\u00e8 incarnato di tutti i personaggi coinvolti nel m\u00e9nage) e termina con un triplo lutto, che coinvolge tragicamente coloro che hanno pi\u00f9 lottato contro i sentimenti, in maniera vana ed effimera e solo nell'aldil\u00e0 possono trovare pace.Ho centellinato questo testo, a parte nel rush finale dove volevo sapere al pi\u00f9 presto come si sarebbe evoluta la vicenda e ho vissuto le ultime pagine con opprimente angoscia e fugaci sospiri: tipiche reazioni da lettrice romantica, sebbene io detesti le opere drammatiche fini a se stesse come questa!"}, {"userName": "Asa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1904061-asa", "userReview": "This is the first Goethe I've read since I was forced to read Werther in school, mostly because I hated Werther and thought he was melodramatic and felt sorry for poor Charlotte who didn't deserve to be dragged into his mess. Since this was how I felt about Edvard and Ottilie as well, I think I have to accept that Goethe isn't for me. There are some books I read where I feel like the author pays attention to the wrong part of the story. In the beginning, there are two pairs of lovers, but somewhere along the way it feels like Goethe drops Charlotte and the Captain for Edvard and Ottilie's star-crossed love story. As a result the book feels lopsided, and all the interesting discussions about marriage and duty and right and wrong morally and ethically disappears and instead we get pages upon pages with how perfect and helpful and good Ottilie is. For me, I think Charlotte deserves more, because she's the one who has to keep everything together when her husband disappears to war, the Captain is away and perhaps even getting married, and her daughter seems to be an incredibly spoiled and annoying young lady. The book isn't bad, however, just not to my taste. I thought there were some interesting parts that made me wish I knew more about the times when Goethe was writing. There is a lot in here about landscaping, art and the natural sciences that I'm sure gives a resonance to the writing for someone who knows more about the period than I do. I just wish that Goethe hadn't chosen to write about characters that managed to both annoy and bore me."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3475149-ian", "userReview": "Elective Affinities comprises the exploration of a simple conceit -- that human relationships are governed by forces similar to those acting in chemical reactions -- executed meticulously and gloriously. Starting from the relatively stable equilibrium of an apparently happy marriage, new characters are introduced into the experiment (set in the crucible of the grounds and house of a German estate), and things fall apart.The novel is impeccably structured and paced, and has some of the most perfect characterizations I've read. Though it begins with simple prose, delicately executed, the density of meaning increases exponentially with time as the situations become fraught -- and yet each new plot development, though surprising when it occurs, seems necessary and obvious in retrospect, falling precisely out of the existing situation.This was my second attempt (previously I only managed three-quarters of the book before being diverted). Due to its symmetry and constant subtle foreshadowing, this would definitely benefit from a rereading or two, but it's perfectly enjoyable as a Romantic novel for those who don't particularly care to admire its execution."}, {"userName": "Bene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13676925-bene", "userReview": "\u201cLa coscienza di amare e di essere amato lo sprona verso l\u2019infinito\u201d\u201cUna parola esplicita \u00e8 terribile quando manifesta improvvisamente ci\u00f2 che il cuore da lungo tempo si \u00e8 consentito\u201dNon possiamo imparare a conoscere le persone quando vengono da noi; dobbiamo noi andare da loro per vedere quello che sono.\u201cLe difficolt\u00e0 aumentano via via che s\u2019avvicina la meta.\u201dIn qualsiasi modo si immagina noi stessi sempre ci immaginiamo veggenti.

Men always were on the lookout for young women.- Analogies between chemical elements and coupling activities of humans can be drawn.- People had strange pastimes at the time. Posing on a stage in an effort to depict famous paintings?- Two out of the four comprising the love quartet die.- Military duty was in high esteem to cultivate a man's character. Even Goethe was of this opinion.- Storylines at that time were highly artificial. Unrealistic coincidences and idealized characters abound.- The upper social strata was highly detached from the rest of society and seemingly didn't have to worry about earning their living at all.It's Goethe after all.

The plot, though, isn't especially well handled either. A couple invites to separate houseguests to stay with them, the husband's friend and the wife's foster niece, and finds their marriage rocked by their attractions to the newcomers. The novella is apparently meant to be a meditation on the power of marriage versus passion, but none of the characters is persuasively depicted, so it's not an especially illuminating reflection on the issue. One thing that is intriguing about the book, however, is the way it uses tense, suddenly shifting from past to present at moments of heightened emotion. And, as with Werther (which does this more effectively), there are these wonderful moments of philosophical reflection that are very cleverly woven into the plot.

Nevertheless, this book is a very splendid realistic rendering of the country-side aristocracy.
