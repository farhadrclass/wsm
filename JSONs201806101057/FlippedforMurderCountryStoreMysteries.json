She opens her country store/restaurant with a fabulous turnout only the whole thing put into jeopardy when someone kills the witchy assistant to the mayor and sets up Robbie to take the fall. She doesn\u2019t \u201cflip\u201d out but she does her best to flatten the killer and ride her bike off into the sunset. Not quite how it happens though :)I liked Robbie at lot. She is fair and hardworking and smart. She really is determined to make her business a success. One thing she is going to have to do is hire more help especially if sleuthing is added to the menu.The other characters we meet in South Lick are very engaging as well. Next to Robbie I would say her employee, Danna would be my favorite character. I think we have just scratched the surface on all of the characters but Danna is the one I am excited to see more of. She gets her nerve up to put someone in their place in this story and I wanted to jump right into the pages to give her a \u201chigh five\u201d. The mayor is a bit over the top but I think Robbie will learn how to handle her.Day gives us a compelling mystery and an intriguing subplot too. The victim wasn\u2019t like by many so there were plenty of suspects. Robbie did find herself in some hair-raising situations that were pretty intense and made the paging fly. There was just a touch of romance that I anxious to see what develops.There are recipes in the back of the book and a sneak peak of the next book in the series Grilled For Murder out May 31, 2016.

This delicious new mystery won me on page one. The rest of the story was a full course meal that left me happily satiated.I adored lead character, Robbie Jordan right away. Her character is filled with kindness, enthusiasm, and determination. She was a joy to read and get to know. I look forward to spending more time with her in future installments. The entire supporting cast of characters were a delight. Multi-layered, real, and some of them, just plain fun!FLIPPED FOR MURDER is a first rate mystery with a wonderfully imagined plot. Author Maddie Day kept this story going at an excellent fast pace, with edge of your seat, page turning writing that held me entranced. Truly a tasty whodunit with a menu packed full of suspects. I chewed on the possible outcome, drinking it all in right up until the shocking reveal! If you\u2019re limited to the amount of new series you can start, you must add FLIPPED FOR MURDER to your list. It is by far one of the best coxy mysteries I\u2019ve read this year!

Pans 'n Pancakes is in South Lick, IN but people are soon finding out that Robbie's food is much tastier than her rival, Ed's, who has his restaurant in neighboring Nashville, IN. When the disagreeable assistant to the new mayor is found murdered and Robbie becomes a person of interest in the case, she can't help but wonder if someone could deliberately be trying to pin this on her to force her out of business. I seriously enjoyed this book from start to finish! The characters were all so amazing and I loved how Robbie's friends and employees all pitched in to help her out when needed. I thought it was a nice touch that the main officer on the case, Buck, wasn't always reprimanding Robbie or telling her to just cook and do her job and he'll do his. He genuinely appreciated her information she passed along even though he had to keep her in mind as a suspect since for awhile he had no others. It was kind of nice to only have to focus on one murder. Also Robbie was in just enough danger to keep it interesting but I didn't feel as nervous for her as I sometimes do when the sleuth is doing her investigating. I liked the little romantic hint, nothing too overbearing. I'll say right now I'm Team Jim so even as sweet as Abe is, I am still rooting for Jim to be the one for Robbie. I'm definitely going to keep reading this series!"}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199857-melodie", "userReview": "Two REALLY good firsts in series in a row!

Robbie jumps into this new life completely when she decides to open Pans 'n Pancakes, a combination breakfast/lunch spot and cookware shop in the heart of town. It's not long before her superior cooking skills draw all the locals to the newest eatery in town, and as Robbie's neighbors pass through they bring with them a compelling assortment of intrigues, complicated relationships, rivalries, and even murder. As Robbie emerges as a likely suspect in the death of the new Mayor's prickly assistant, she realizes she must take investigative matters into her own hands or risk being charged with the crime.The plot of this new mystery by Maddie Day zips along at a nice pace and is fleshed out with an assortment of quirky characters. Suspense continues to build until the very satisfying conclusion. The highlight for me, though, was the addition of a subplot - Robbie's unraveling of her personal mystery, the big question mark of who her father might be - that helps to develop Robbie more fully as a protagonist and elevates this book into a more satisfying read than most cozies. As Robbie learns some of the truths her mother never revealed before her untimely death, she develops into someone who is deeper than a stock amateur sleuth.After this first of a new series, I look forward to more of Maddie Day's work and more of the unique setting of small town Indiana.

However, the recipe could use some refining. While reiterating the information discovered is part of the formula of a cozy, Maddie Day did it frequently enough to be annoying. I also thought Robbie was trying too hard to be appealing to everyone. Not only does she cook and run a business, but she bicycles and extols the stress-reducing benefits of exercise, AND even though the adult entertainment stays off-screen her gaining the instant attentions of not one but two men strays just a bit too close to trying to create an superheroine for my taste."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5070098-linda", "userReview": "A take-charge protagonist, a fun cast of characters (with a few odd ones mixed in), and a small town Indiana setting made this one of the best cozies I\u2019ve read in a long time.

She's also an active commenter on the blog as well.The first book in the Country Store Mystery series introduces readers to Robbie Jordan, the owner of Pans 'n Pancakes, a newly opened country store in South Lick, Indiana. Combining the country store aspect with a breakfast joint as well as selling cookware.Robbie is a cook and a carpenter. She's described as nursing a broken heart but I never really got the feeling she was all that upset over the end of her relationship. Instead, I thought the mourning for her mother was more of an aspect of why she might be sad at times.She's got her Aunt Adele, her real estate lawyer friend Jim, genius dessert man name Phil and as the story starts, Danna, new employee that harbors a secret about her previous job.The grand reopening of the store sets up the story as the town's mayor drops by accompanied by her ever present aide. But when the aide later turns up dead, Robbie is the first suspect. The dead woman made it a living hell trying to get the permits to redo and open the country store and the initial thought is that Robbie got revenge.Obviously that is quickly disproved and soon Robbie can't help but get immersed in finding the killer. But the victim, Stella Rogers, made a living a backstabbing and blackmailing a number of people in town so the list of suspects is not only long, but less than grief stricken over her death. Of course, there are other concerns for Robbie as she launches her new business. Someone is trying to put her out of the restaurant game before she really gets started. There's also the matter of the creepy son of Stella, the rather sadly named Roy. Said to be \"not all there\", he is convinced that Robbie stole the property from him and makes a nuisance of himself. Robbie also ends up dealing with questions of her past when revelations about some suspects leads to her finding out about her potential birth father, someone she'd never know the identity of. In this, I thought it might be something that would've been better suited to introduce in the 2nd book but still I can see how it works as a subplot here.I was pretty happy to have picked up this book. I did it on a lark and wasn't sure what to expect. But I was very entertained and found myself happy that there were three more books in the series already so I could read more about Robbie and the country store. Truth be told, I was halfway through the book when I went out and bought books 2 and 3 in the series."}, {"userName": "Carla Johnson-Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074498-carla-johnson-hicks", "userReview": "This is the first book in the new \"Country Store Mystery\" series. I have had this one on my tablet for awhile and now that I have read it, I wish I had gotten to it sooner. I will definitely be checking out the rest in this series. A 4.5 star read for me. In Flipped for Murder, Robbie Jordan has recently moved back to her hometown of South Lick Indiana and opened a quaint restaurant and cookware shop called Pans 'n Pancakes. Her mother had recently died in California and her marriage to a cheating man had fallen apart. Being a chef, Robbie's breakfast and lunch cafe quickly began to draw customers from the other cafes. As Robbie begins to feel like her business is about to take off, there is a murder and it looks like someone is trying to frame her. She is a suspect, but certainly not the only one. As the mystery unravels, we find out that Stella, the victim, had a large number of enemies. Robbie wants to clear her name as even being a suspect, has a detrimental effect on her business.The plot of this new mystery by Maddie Day aka Edith Maxwell, moves quickly and had me reading with interest. Her characters are wonderful albeit a little quirky, it is a small mid-western town. Robbie and her employee Danna, are a great pair. They work hard, and play harder. Robbie has a love interest in Jim, but what is going to happen with Abe? There is a side mystery to the main one regarding Robbie's personal history. As she investigates the murder, she gets some information that might just lead her to her father, whom she has never met or even knew his name. This element gave Robbie a much more complex personality as we got glimpses of her childhood. The mystery and suspense continues to build until the very satisfying conclusion. I will say that I had figured out the murderer, but it was very interesting to see Robbie follow the clues to the end. A great read for any cozy mystery lover."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12608520-kim", "userReview": "This is a great book to read while sitting in the back yard under an umbrella.

Everyone in town shows up for the grand re-opening of Pans \u2018n Pancakes, but when the mayor's disagreeable assistant is found dead, Robbie realizes that not all press is good press. With all eyes on her, she'll have to summon her puzzle-solving skills to clear her name, unscramble the town's darkest secrets, and track down a cold-blooded killer--before she's the next to die\u2026 (Goodreads)Review:Flipped for Murder is the first book in the Country Store Mysteries series and it was very good. I am looking forward to reading more in the series.The characters are well developed, well rounded and three dimensional. Robbie is so excited to be opening her restaurant/store and she is willing to do whatever it takes to make her shop successful. Just reading about all the hard work that goes into running a restaurant on a daily basis wore me out. She has put in all the long hours to get the store ready and she has the right people helping her, her aunt and her friends and she thinks that she is well on her way to realizing her dream. That is until someone is murdered and she learns that one of her biscuits has been found in the deceased mouth. It appears as though someone is framing her and she knows she needs to find the killer before her store and her life take a turn for the worse.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. The author is very talented in creating characters, settings and suspense with the written word. The mystery is carried on throughout the entire book and there are enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. One of the many things I enjoyed about this book is the fact that, although Robbie\u2019s mother has passed away, she is still a big part of the book. Robbie talks about her mom a lot and remembers many things that they did together. Her mother even plays a part in solving the mystery. I think this was clever and added a lot to the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted cozy mystery. This is such a great start to the series and I am definitely a fan of Maddie Day.

Flipped For Murder is the first in a new series located in small town southern Indiana. Robbie Jordan has just opened her new country store/diner, Pans & Pancakes (why not Pots & Pancakes? hmm.) when the mayor's assistant is found murdered. There was a lot to like about the story; the characters were charming, a picturesque locale, and I enjoyed the local lingo. I live in Indiana and hear many of these phrases daily, so it made me smile. The plot was well-paced and had a lot of twists and turns to keep me guessing. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and I look forward to reading more.However, there were a few things that detracted from the story for me. I can suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but there's a limit, and for me that limit came when, right after the murder victim was found, the cop came around to question the main character and asked her if she killed the victim, then recorded it on his tablet. No. Just no. Even someone who has only watched an hour of Law & Order: SVU could tell you that you don't ask a question like \"Did you kill the victim?\" to a person who hasn't been Mirandized because nothing that is said is admissible in court, so there's no reason to note it. And don't get me started on the subject of direct evidence vs circumstantial evidence. In the acknowledgements section, the author writes, \"Officer Garnet Watson helped out with a few questions of police procedure, which I might not always have followed.\" I would rethink that.There was also a question of the back story, which is neatly summed up in the book's description but I think more details (or starting the story a little earlier than the store's opening day) might have eased the way into the story. Also, the reader doesn't really get a sense of the victim, other than what other people said about her, so there was a disconnect there. Starting the story a little earlier would definitely help set up some of the plot points a little more subtly.I also felt like there was too much rehashing of each event after the fact. It started to feel more like filler and I found myself flipping through pages of it after awhile.Overall, a charming start to a promising new series, and an enjoyable read. And I darn sure will be making those cheesy biscuits in the very near future!"}, {"userName": "Penny Marks", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33940022-penny-marks", "userReview": "This book was great.

It is a first in a new series and I can hardly wait for the next installment.You have Robbie who is the owner of Pan's N Pancakes in a little town called South Lick, Indiana. She along with a few friends are running her dream of restaurant ownership. Robbie is such a fun character. She loves to bike, drink red wine, cook, and do puzzles. She also has a handsome lawyer vying for her attention. What could go wrong? I really enjoyed how the author brought in her mother's character. She thinks of her everyday and how her mom would have been so proud of her and her restaurant. Her mom passed away about a year ago in the storyline. Robbie begins to find out some interesting stuff about her mom and the father she never knew. Who was he? Why wasn't she told about him? Who knows who he really is and why was it kept a secret? Robbie finds that there is more going on in her little town than meets the eye. On her Grand Opening she finds out that a man named Roy hates her, a man named Don knew her mom and dislikes the new mayor Corrine, and Ed resents her because she has opened a restaurant so close to his. If things couldn't get any worse she is the number one suspect in the murder of Stella, the mayor's assistant because she was found with a cheesy biscuit in her mouth..
