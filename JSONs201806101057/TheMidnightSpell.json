(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "As a book blogger, especially one who reads Giselle's reviews, it's hard to miss Rhiannon Frater. She apparently writes super awesome vampire and zombie books, but I haven't gotten around to those yet. When the tour came up for Frater's paranormal co-written with another author, I couldn't resist. Joining The Midnight Spell tour was a good choice. Frater and Boye's novel is light, humorous, and fun all the way through.Like Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Christy is approaching the age of her powers awakening. Christy desperately wants her full-blown witchy powers, and keeps trying to perform spells in hopes that they'll turn her powers on full blast. Her latest plan is a spell at midnight to bring her bestie Adam's perfect guy to town. Adam doesn't wholly believe in Christy's magical abilities, but he hopes, tired of being alone and picked on for his sexuality.Adam and Christy both really stick out in their whitebread, small town. Christy's been called a witch since she was young, her tendency to wear dark clothing not really helping matters. Red-headed Adam has been picked on for being gay for years too, even though he hasn't actually come out. They're lucky to have each other, though, and their social butterfly friend, Drifter. I would have liked to see a bit more of Christy and Adam's friendship before the midnight spell kicked the plot into motion, but I love their bond, and that the story is told from the POV of a straight girl and her gay best friend.The plot includes some paranormal mayhem, but definitely keeps more to the funny than the creepy, which is a nice change of pace from paranormal stories that take themselves super seriously. There are some paranormal creature reveals at the end that definitely made me chuckle. The focus, though, is really on the romances: Adam's with mysterious new hottie Mark and Christy's with her long-time crush Ian.The one thing that cut down on my enjoyment a little bit was my indifference towards Mark and Christy. I don't dislike either of them, but I never got a real sense of them as people. I would have assumed that Boye and Frater each took one of the perspectives to write, but Christy and Adam read too similarly to me. I had a bit of trouble keeping whose section I was reading straight.On the other hand, I loved the secondary characters. They are made of sass and awesomeness. Callie, Christy's cat familiar, and the broom really steal the show. They're also super dependable and a bit snarky. Yes, a broom can be kind of snarky. Oh, and both Adam and Christy have super caring, present parents, with the exception of Adam's dad who's gone months at a time for work but who obviously loves his family a lot. The three parents are all a hoot. Oh, also, there's Drifter, who I totally want to hook up with Christy, because he's way smarter and more interesting.The Midnight Spell is a highly fun paranormal self-pub. The ARC version I read had very few errors, so I imagine the finished copy will be pretty spotless, so, if you're interested, feel no fear! I'm definitely looking forward to reading some of Frater's darker novels."}, {"userName": "Evie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4335276-evie", "userReview": "The Midnight Spell was SO MUCH FUN! I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked it up, but let me tell you, it totally rocked my face off! I've heard some really great things about Rhiannon Frater's writing style, but even though her books sounded right up my alley, I approached The Midnight Spell with skepticism. Why, you ask? Because it's a collaboration between two authors and while it's always an intriguing and exciting concept, from my experience it rarely results in quality. Fear not, dear reader, for this is not the case here! The Midnight Spell is nothing short of awesome. It's a quick and entertaining read with a vibrant cast of loveable characters, great humor and unique plot line that is sure to keep you captivated all the way through. It's a heart-warming and inspiring story about friends, written by two amazing authors who happened to be great friends themselves. And it's not only funny (often laugh-out-loud hilarious), quirky and deliciously straightforward (a bold, no-BS kind of book), but it's also deep, thought-provoking, at times even scary! Trust me, it doesn't get better than this! The plot follows a group of teenagers from the small \"hick town\" of Trinity Springs, with two best friends, Adam and Christy, at the centre of all the events. Adam and Christy have been friends forever.Since the very first day of kindergarten and their first hilarious conversation (\"Do you have a pot of gold?\" I asked. \"No. Are you in the Addams family?\" he countered.) they've been practically inseparable. Their bond is strong, unbreakable and very, very precious. Both Christy and Adam are social outcasts, shunned and made fun of, labelled the \"witch\" and the \"fag\". Of course, both things are true, but the constant taunts and bullying still cut deep. Determined to make her best friend happy, Christy casts a spell to summon his true love. The only problem is the new hot-and-possibly-gay guy is not the only \"thing\" that arrives in Trinity Springs, and our quirky duo will soon realize that their miserable love lives are the least of their problems.  I absolutely loved this book. I breezed through it in just a couple hours and found myself re-reading my favorite passages, quotes and dialogues (and let me just tell you, there were many of them!). I love when a book gets me so hooked and captivated that the rest of the world stops existing. I laughed, I giggled like a maniac, I nodded in agreement and shook my head in amazement. I'm pretty sure I mumbled to myself, too. In other words, I had a whole lot of fun with this book!  There's not a thing about this book that I didn't like, but it's the phenomenal character development and the way the relationships were depicted that really made this book for me. This novel has an amazing cast of characters - from Adam and Christy to all the supporting ones. Adam and Christy have a lot to deal with, their lives were never easy and they really had to fight hard for their happiness, but the book is almost entirely drama-free. Sure, they both have their bad moments, they sometimes cry and feel sad, lost and depressed, but then they just pick themselves up, dust themselves off and keep pushing on. Their strength comes from their friendship. They don't whine, don't mope around feeling sorry for themselves, no, they're actually quite optimistic (well, cautiously optimistic), cheerful and persistent. The absence of typical teenage-angst was blissful and refreshing! I loved that about this book! All the relationships were really, really amazing, too. I absolutely adored all the parental units, even Adam's overprotective mother! Christy's parents are just.. I don't even know where to begin! They were both hilarious, charming, cool and just as quirky and unique as Christy was. The dialogues (especially those involving Christy's Santa-look-alike dad) were clever, laugh-out-loud funny, charged with positive energy and sprinkled with awesome. Drifter and Olivia were both similarly interesting and fun to read about as well. I can't even think of anyone I didn't like, well maybe except for Ian, Mark and the bullies.  While the overall tone of the book is rather light and snarky, the atmosphere does get heavier at times. Frater and Boye touch on some more serious themes, such as bullying, violence and homophobia (<-hate that word, by the way! You're not \"scared\" of gay people, you're just an idiot!). About halfway through, the story takes on an even darker turn, weird things are starting to happen and it gets pretty scary! Next to the fantastically depicted relationships, this was probably my second favorite thing about this book, the way it would take me on a wild roller coaster of emotions, from making me snort my coffee from laughter, tear up from the heart-breaking events, to send a cold shiver down my spine from its creepier and more atmospheric moments. Reading The Midnight Spell was just such a great, intense experience!  I highly recommend this book to everyone!"}, {"userName": "books are love", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8470722-books-are-love", "userReview": "This was wonderful. A great YA book that at times will have you laughing, awwing and rooting for Adam, Christy and the group of outcasts to succeed.Adam and Christy are besties, love each other like family but they are also the social outcasts. Adam is the only gay student in town and Christy is a witch. Well that is what everyone calls her they don't really know she is a real witch only Adam knows this. they meet in kindergarten and never leave each others side. Through all the name calling and hurt they are there for one another. As they enter their junior year, a time when Christy's magic comes to her in full force, they do a spell for Adam to meet his love. the man of his dreams. All of a sudden things happen in town. Two strangers show up one a gorgeous mysterious magnetic boy drawn to adam and the other a outgoing lollypop eating girl who beats to her own drum. Adam is shy and unsure of himself. Scared as well he has been bullied and beaten up about his orientation that now he is afraid of someone liking him. As he gets to know Mark he finds they are alike and attracted to one another. Mark though has a terrible secret. It's sad though because he was so good for Adam. Through Mark Adam began to smile and come out of his shell. He began to get confidence and feel comfortable with who he is. mark though isn't what he seems and things begin to fall apart.Christy in the meantime is dealing with a spying broom, questions about how good a witch she is, a crush on a boy who starts to notice her but she feels there is ulterior motives, self doubt about herself and confusion on what is going on around her. Ian is her crush and he likes her but didn't know how to approach her. Didn't really see her as her until she stood up for Adam. Adam and Christy take a lot of flack from people but are always there for one another. Oh and let's not forget Drifter. drifter is liked by everyone and seems to like Christy. His relaxed ways are so great to see. He makes a great secondary character. As does Olivia the new girl. Those two will have you smiling.the banter is great and funny. the plot is fun and easy to get into and the story itself is fun and light. Adam finds himself and another to love after mark. Christy comes into her own after her Witch trial so to speak and Ian gets his chance with Adam's help. the adventures this band of misfits get into are so fun to read about but you see they are family for each other.a wonderfully light, fun read that will keep you reading to the end. You will fall in love with this group and want the best for them."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4337141-lindsay", "userReview": "I\u2019m slowly making my way through every single book Rhiannon Frater has to offer, but this was my first experience with Kody Boye. The book made a great first impression, and I\u2019ll be sure to check out more of his books. Kody writes as Adam, a strong gay character as a main protagonist, instead of the standard gay sidekick. It was so great, and heartbreaking, to be offered an insider\u2019s view on homophobia and bullying. Rhiannon\u2019s character is also a refreshing change from the everyday. Christy isn\u2019t skinny and her wardrobe isn\u2019t flashy. She keeps her head down and hides behind her hoodies, and she\u2019s struggling with more than just your everyday teen angst. She would describe herself as ugly and fat, but I see her as brave and sassy.The beginning of the book was a little slow, and read more like a contemporary story of teenage life, rather than a paranormal. Other than the initial Midnight Spell, there was very little in the way of magic. Rhiannon and Kody did a great job encapsulating the frustration of high school, but I kept expecting the pace to pick up. I\u2019ll admit, it took longer than I expected. Once it did, however, I couldn\u2019t put it down! It was exciting and original! I fell in love with this rag tag group of characters. <3Rhiannon and Kody break a few of the Young Adult genre rules. In fact, they may have just taken the rule book and torn out a few pages. One of the more notable of these rules is the language. YA novels usually toe a line as far as swears go, staying on the good side of parents everywhere. I don\u2019t know how it was when you were a teenager, but I swore like a sailor\u2026 just not where my mother could hear me. The authors kept it realistic, using swears when the occasion called for it. I loved the dialogue, for the most part. If felt genuine and was often very witty. My only complaint would be the overuse of the word \u201ctotally\u201d\u2026 granted, teens use this word in every second sentence, so I guess that\u2019s pretty realistic too. ;)Rhiannon and Kody make a great team, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if there may be a sequel in the near future? I would love to hear more from this dynamic duo, to revisit Christy and Adam and see what kind of trouble they get into next.A copy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": " \u2606\u221eLove Frances\u221e\u2606", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2953794-love-frances", "userReview": "\u201cMidnight Spell\u201d is a book that will cast it\u2019s spell on you with it\u2019s uniqueness and delightful mix of characters\"\n\nI adored the opening scene of \u201cMidnight Spell\u201d. This is when I got my first glimpse into the seriously fun and snarky tone this book was going to have. The characters were fabulous. From our 2 main\u2019s characters (Christy and Adam), to all of the supporting characters: Olivia, the parents, Mark, Drifter, Ian, etc. Part of what made this book so special was how beautifully developed all of the characters and their relationships were. The co-authors took such time and care with every character, and every aspect of their personalities, and it shows. Like I mentioned previously this story was seriously fun, and quirky, with that perfect touch of supernatural tossed in for good measure. From the beginning \u201cMidnight Spell\u201d won me over. I was a bit leery of a co-written book. I had read them before and was generally not impressed. The chapters had an obvious divide. \u201cMidnight Spell\u201d did not fall victim to this co-authoring problem. It was nearly impossible to tell who wrote what. The story blended so seamlessly together. I loved how the more serious themes of the book were tackled head on. Never once did the characters wallow. They felt & dealt with feelings like normal teens do and go on with life. \u201cMidnight Spell\u201d was one of those books that you just can\u2019t help liking. The sarcastic one liners, what happened to Callie the Cat (still makes me giggle), that long forgotten teen angst, the humor, the friendship and loyalty these friends have for one another, the foolish things we do and say for \u201clove\u201d, and everything else that makes up what teenage life is all about. Not to mention the appearance of a certain supernatural being that throws a monkey wrench into their lives. Friendships are tested, feelings are revealed, emotions run high. Only talents like Frater and Boye could handle this many plot twists and character changes seamlessly. \u201cMidnight Spell\u201d is a book that will cast it\u2019s spell on you with it\u2019s uniqueness and delightful mix of characters.\nREVIEW & AWESOME GIVEAWAY FOR NEXT 10 DAYS (ends March 10th, 2013)\nThe Midnight Spell Review & Giveaway"}, {"userName": "Diayll", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133049-diayll", "userReview": "Originally Reviewed At:Mother/Gamer/WriterRating: 4.5 out of 5 ControllersReview Source: Blog TourReviewer: HeatherThe Midnight Spell isn\u2019t my usual read. I wasn\u2019t even sure how much I would relate to it. However, I decided to read it anyway. What is so different? Well I can\u2019t lie, it\u2019s right there in the blurb. It\u2019s not that I have anything against it. I\u2019m just not the audience the author is trying to reach. After all I\u2019m a *coughs* 30 something *coughs* woman reading YA, which is rare for me.I enjoyed the story. It had a unique angle, felt fresh and was well written. The characters were very believable, and I really liked seeing them grow both apart and together. In a short time they were really forced through a lot of turmoil and teenage crap.The witchy angle wasn\u2019t completely new, but the author was comfortable in the world she created. On a side note, I would have liked to know a bit more, but I get that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the story to unfold.Now this wasn\u2019t your average PNR. It has more to do with love in the sense of family and friendship, which I think teens and adults both need to pay attention to. We get so wrapped up in who is hot, who is dating who, and all that crap that sometimes we forget who really matters in life. That, guys, is a message that rings loud and clear.While it is obvious by the blurb, the second protagonist is a gay teen. I state this for anyone who would have an issue with this, and will tell you that very innocent smooches (think cheeks, yes the ones on the face.) do take place. It also talks of the emotions anyone feels when they\u2019re in love. I found it to be terribly sweet and the whole story was entertaining.This story can be enjoyed by anyone fifteen or older. Boy, girl, teen, adult, it doesn\u2019t matter. The story really has something for everyone. Personally, I\u2019d like to see a continuation of the story, friendships, and the cat and broom too."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13706669-toni", "userReview": "This book was so much fun to read!

A delightful indie YA book you need to read! Christy and Adam have been best friends since Kindergarten. Thrown together as allies, weathering the taunts of the school yard children who called them \"witch\" and \"fag\". Yet, they never let those names hurt them because they were in fact true. Christy is indeed a witch born to two powerful witches, while Adam is the only gay boy in the small town. They have been through thick and thin together, and no matter what they have each other's back. Christy decides that she wants to help Adam find a boyfriend, since she is tired of seeing him alone and miserable. She decides to cast a midnight love spell, despite the fact that she isn't a good witch, yet, as she hasn't come into her powers. Nevertheless, the spell is cast at the stroke of midnight. Christy unknowingly sets in motion a stream of events that will end up testing their friendship and threatening their lives. Along they way, they might just learn a thing or two about life and love. Will Christy and Adam survive the Midnight Spell?What I Liked:*I never cease to be amazed by Ms. Frater's powerful writing, and this time she collaborates with fellow friend and author Kody Boye. What the two of them cook up is far beyond your typical YA book. Their brilliant pairing brings us a fantastic YA book that has amazing characters, an exciting paranormal story line, friendship, love, loyalty and magic. If you are looking for a YA title that is different and fun, I would highly recommend you check out these two talented, brilliant indie writers. Seriously, they are the type of indie writers you should be reading! *How I loved the characters in this one! At the heart of the story are Adam and Christy, the outcast witch and gay boy. They have endured their torturous school years by banding together against all the mean girl princesses and the jocks. They are fiercely loyal toward each other, and I absolutely adored their friendship, it is enduring and endearing. Christy is shy and completely afraid to talk to her long time crush Ian because she feels like she is fat, ugly and awkward. How many teenagers can sympathize with Christy? Adam struggles with being gay since he has been horribly bullied in the past. He is a quiet, kind young man. He is not flamboyant nor is he into theatre or shoes. Instead he is just a typical guy. I liked finally getting a male gay character who is more normal. Let's face it, not all gay guys are singers and into fashion, but that is how they are most often portrayed. Together, Christy and Adam make an amazing pair. I enjoyed that this book is told with dual point of views, Adam is Cody's voice and Christy is Rhiannon's voice and together they make magic!*Aside from Adam and Christy, there is an excellent cast of secondary characters from Drifter, the accepting boy, who moves from crowd to crowd, and doesn't blink an eye when he is pulled into all the craziness of magic and creepy. Olivia, the bubbly, lollipop sucking new girl who immediately latches onto Christy because she knows that the outcasts are far more interesting. She is funny, smart and has a few sneaky tricks up her sleeve. Add in Christy's eccentric and fun parents, along with Adam's stiletto wearing, fiercely protective mother, and you have a cast that you won't soon forget. I especially appreciated that Adam came from a loving, supportive family who accepted him being gay and loved him all the more for it. It was honestly hard to pick a favorite because I loved them all. That speaks volumes when the secondary characters are just as lovable and wonderful as the protagonists.*The storyline is unexpected. The first half plays out a bit like your average YA read, but then once it hits the midway point, the book shifts and takes some completely unexpected turns, and I was blown away. From that point on, it becomes apparent that something evil is afoot, and it is up to Christy, Adam and their friends to stop it. I loved that there were so many supernatural elements thrown in from vampires, ghouls, witches, a familiar cat, magical broom, shapeshifter, monster hunter, zombies, and more. I loved all the paranormal in this one, and I was totally not expecting it after the first half. *This book wraps everything up nicely and I was so excited that it appears there will be future books with the gang. I cannot wait to see how this series develops! It has everything I am looking for in a solid YA book from great characters and story line to non cliffhanger endings and no love triangles! And The Not So Much:*As I mentioned earlier, the first half reads like a normal YA read. It is a lot of getting to know the characters and following them at school as they dodge the vicious mean girls and the bullies, go to parties and experience teenage crushes. I was honestly a bit bored during the first portion, but I was blown away by the second half. The action notches up and there are all kinds of crazy reveals that left me stunned. I had so much fun. So best advice, be patient this is not your typical YA book.*I loved Olivia. She is quirky and fun and she definitely has a few of her own big surprises. I just wish that I could have gotten to know her better. Her big reveal does not occur until the final pages, but I admit once I got into the second half, I had my hunches that she was something special. I was absolutely dying to know what was the deal with all the lollipops? Alas, that was never answered, but I am sure it was more than a penchant for sucking on something sugary. *I was a tad bit disappointed that there was not a bit more resolution with the whole bullying theme. I hate bullies and there were a few in this one, but for the most part nothing is resolved with this story line. I wish that somehow the bullying was better addressed because it is such an important topic. Anything that can be done to alleviate the name calling and intolerance the better. I am hopeful that this theme will be revisited and something good will come of it in the next book, as I know it is an important issue with the authors.*I was a bit confused over the whole vampire thing. Christy's powerful witch parents claimed they were extinct, but they seemed to be alive and feeding on humans according to Nathan the monster hunter. So which is it? The Midnight Spell was a delightful book that took me by surprise with all of its paranormal secrets. This book has such amazing characters as well as a creative storyline. It is one that I would wholeheartedly recommend especially if you are looking for a terrific supernatural teen read. Do yourself and grab a copy of this one. The ebooks are a great deal! I personally cannot wait for the next book in this series!Favorite Quotations:\"Little sisters. You could live without them just fine, but living with them?

I know her As The World Dies series is very popular.I thought this book got off to a very strong start. I really enjoyed both Christy and Adam\u2019s pov\u2019s. I really liked listening to Adam. He is the only gay student at Trinity Springs High School. He naturally gets bullied.Both Christy and Adam are outsiders, but still they have a great group of friends. They have been bff\u2019s since kindy. Both are turning seventeen.Christy is a witch in training and she decides to take it upon herself to find Adam a beau, via a spell.Now I think you just have to go with the fact that every other male student at the high school is not gay, even though, how would you know. For the sake of this story, they are all straight.Until...I really love Drifter. He is the guy that can be friends with everyone, no harm no foul. Olivia is the new student, who could quite easily blend with the populars, but she puts herself in with Christy and Adam. She is a very likable character. She loves her lollipops.  \u201cHi,\u201d she said in a perky voice that immediately annoyed me. \u201cHi,\u201d I mumbled, trying to dart around her. She was quicker and positioned herself right in front of me. Without a doubt she was definitely not a local. Her blond curls had pink highlights and her makeup was pinup perfect. Dressed in rockabilly-style clothing, complete with saddle shoes, she looked like a sexy, yet cute doll. I\u2019m always trying to lose the fifteen pounds that clings to my lower stomach and upper thighs, but her extra weight looked good on her. She was all curves and cuteness. I wanted to hate her. \u201cSo, you\u2019re totally the outcast chick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said, grinning as she sucked on a bright green lollipop. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d I glowered at her. She swept her hands dramatically at me as though she were unveiling a masterpiece. \u201cBehold, the surly girl in combat boots, beat-up jeans and a vintage Blondie t-shirt. Add in the hoodie, lack of makeup and the long, slightly ragged hair, and you get... \u201d \u201cThe outcast,\u201d I said. \u201cYep.\u201d \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d \u201cI like outcasts. They have flavor and this town so lacks that. Wait, I take it back. The town has flavor, but it\u2019s very vanilla. Not even Mexican vanilla. We\u2019re talking boring old vanilla vanilla.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m not vanilla.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re like... espresso.\u201d \u201cAnd you?\u201d \u201cDefinitely peppermint.\u201d Despite myself, I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Olivia, the new girl.\u201d \u201cChristy, the outcast,\u201d I said.Olivia is a fun friend. She is open and honest and knows how to put her two cents in. Olivia was sitting on my bed petting Callie. I was surprised that my usually very judgmental cat liked her already. Olivia\u2019s pink-streaked blond hair was carefully coiffed into a retro style complete with a big gardenia in her hair. She also wore a pale blue dress that looked like something an old movie star would wear. Instead of looking dorky, she looked awesome. Meanwhile, I looked totally... different. Placing my hands on my hips, I watched the girl in the red dress and bright red lipstick in the mirror mimic me. Olivia and I had left early that morning on a road trip to the nearest big town with outlet stores. We had hit Ross and Marshalls, scouring the racks for a dress that would actually make me look like a real girl. By the time we settled down for lunch at Cheddar\u2019s, we had found the red dress and black strappy heels I was now wearing. Before heading home to Trinity Springs, we had stopped by Sephora and bought a matching lipstick. \u201cDo I look slutty?\u201d I said worriedly. \u201cI would say we avoided slutty by flirting outrageously with sexy,\u201d Olivia assured me.Enter Mark Black, the handsome guy who falls for Adam.Hard.Adam and Christy\u2019s parents are both, great parents. Nice to read a book where the parents aren\u2019t abusers, have a terminal disease or are just plain shitty. And if you try anything at the school, I swear I will bring holy hell down upon you, because when you fuck with the cub, you mess with the fucking mama bear.Amen. Sister.Adam\u2019s, mum is funny and I love that she knows Adam is gay and she is one hundred percent supportive.

I know her As The World Dies series is very popular.I thought this book got off to a very strong start. I really enjoyed both Christy and Adam\u2019s pov\u2019s. I really liked listening to Adam. He is the only gay student at Trinity Springs High School. He naturally gets bullied.Both Christy and Adam are outsiders, but still they have a great group of friends. They have been bff\u2019s since kindy. Both are turning seventeen.Christy is a witch in training and she decides to take it upon herself to find Adam a beau, via a spell.Now I think you just have to go with the fact that every other male student at the high school is not gay, even though, how would you know. For the sake of this story, they are all straight.Until...I really love Drifter. He is the guy that can be friends with everyone, no harm no foul. Olivia is the new student, who could quite easily blend with the populars, but she puts herself in with Christy and Adam. She is a very likable character. She loves her lollipops.  \u201cHi,\u201d she said in a perky voice that immediately annoyed me. \u201cHi,\u201d I mumbled, trying to dart around her. She was quicker and positioned herself right in front of me. Without a doubt she was definitely not a local. Her blond curls had pink highlights and her makeup was pinup perfect. Dressed in rockabilly-style clothing, complete with saddle shoes, she looked like a sexy, yet cute doll. I\u2019m always trying to lose the fifteen pounds that clings to my lower stomach and upper thighs, but her extra weight looked good on her. She was all curves and cuteness. I wanted to hate her. \u201cSo, you\u2019re totally the outcast chick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said, grinning as she sucked on a bright green lollipop. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d I glowered at her. She swept her hands dramatically at me as though she were unveiling a masterpiece. \u201cBehold, the surly girl in combat boots, beat-up jeans and a vintage Blondie t-shirt. Add in the hoodie, lack of makeup and the long, slightly ragged hair, and you get... \u201d \u201cThe outcast,\u201d I said. \u201cYep.\u201d \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d \u201cI like outcasts. They have flavor and this town so lacks that. Wait, I take it back. The town has flavor, but it\u2019s very vanilla. Not even Mexican vanilla. We\u2019re talking boring old vanilla vanilla.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m not vanilla.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re like... espresso.\u201d \u201cAnd you?\u201d \u201cDefinitely peppermint.\u201d Despite myself, I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Olivia, the new girl.\u201d \u201cChristy, the outcast,\u201d I said.Olivia is a fun friend. She is open and honest and knows how to put her two cents in. Olivia was sitting on my bed petting Callie. I was surprised that my usually very judgmental cat liked her already. Olivia\u2019s pink-streaked blond hair was carefully coiffed into a retro style complete with a big gardenia in her hair. She also wore a pale blue dress that looked like something an old movie star would wear. Instead of looking dorky, she looked awesome. Meanwhile, I looked totally... different. Placing my hands on my hips, I watched the girl in the red dress and bright red lipstick in the mirror mimic me. Olivia and I had left early that morning on a road trip to the nearest big town with outlet stores. We had hit Ross and Marshalls, scouring the racks for a dress that would actually make me look like a real girl. By the time we settled down for lunch at Cheddar\u2019s, we had found the red dress and black strappy heels I was now wearing. Before heading home to Trinity Springs, we had stopped by Sephora and bought a matching lipstick. \u201cDo I look slutty?\u201d I said worriedly. \u201cI would say we avoided slutty by flirting outrageously with sexy,\u201d Olivia assured me.Enter Mark Black, the handsome guy who falls for Adam.Hard.Adam and Christy\u2019s parents are both, great parents. Nice to read a book where the parents aren\u2019t abusers, have a terminal disease or are just plain shitty. And if you try anything at the school, I swear I will bring holy hell down upon you, because when you fuck with the cub, you mess with the fucking mama bear.Amen. Sister.Adam\u2019s, mum is funny and I love that she knows Adam is gay and she is one hundred percent supportive.

As it happens, the bullies have been right on both counts.The book starts with Christy doing a love spell known as The Midnight Spell, to bring love for her bestfriend. Adam is about to turn 17 and has never known romance. Christy is not really experienced either, but has been attracted to Ian, one of the school jocks, almost as long as she\u2019s known Adam, so she believes she has at least tried! The family witchcraft is a pure magic, which means Christy cannot conjure for her own benefit, which is why she can do a love spell for Adam, but not for herself. She has not come fully into her powers as she goes through witch puberty, which is frustrating her almost as much as the human one, but she is hopeful the spell will work.Although Christy shared her secret with Adam at the same time he came out to her, he does not completely believe that she is really a witch, but he humors her with this spell, making a list of traits he wants. When he leaves her house, he does not really believe he will find love before he heads to college.The next day at school, there are two new students at school. Olivia approaches Christy as she arrives while Mark Black sets hearts aflutter, but seems interested in Adam. Christy and Olivia team up to encourage this relationship, and the last of their group, Drifter, also cheers Adam on in what they hope will be a good thing for him. Adam had dreamt about a young man that looked just like Mark and it does not take long for him to be smitten.However, strange things start happening when the friends are all together, and the more they discover, the more Christy is concerned her innocent spell may have set the events in motion that To really give the story perspective, it is told from the alternating point of view of Christy and Adam.This was a great story that was hard to put down once you got started!I enjoyed the two points of view, there was the typical teenage issues such as self image, bullies, high school cliques and such, but then there is the added level of paranormal, and I really liked the way it was approached.Christy is, in fact, a witch and when she goes home, there is a familiar in the house, a cat named Callie that for most people, behaves like a normal cat, but you quickly learn she sees and knows more than you think. There is a broom that Christy thinks is there to spy on her, but it turns out, both the broom and Callie are actually helpers as Christy goes through her witch puberty. Her mother is a powerful witch, and her father, who normally resembles Santa, is a powerful warrior that when necessary, does not look anything like St Nick! When odd things start to happen with Mark, she shares it with her parents, who take it quite seriously, but suggest she speak to Mark rather than Adam, to see about clearing up any misunderstandings. At the same time, they do acknowledge that there is a presence in town, a darkness that had not been there previously and her Mom plans to look into it further.Meanwhile, Adam\u2019s Dad is not around as he works on the oil rigs, so it is usually just him, his Mom, Ashley and his 10 year old sister Amelia, who is the perfect attitude little sister! Ashley is fiercely protective of her kids, perhaps somewhat moreso with Adam since he\u2019s had one bullying incident that almost sent him to hospital if Christy and Drifter had not gotten there when they did. Although that same protectiveness puts her in the line of fire when Mark\u2019s manipulations come to light.Mark, the mystery boy, has secrets, he is heard talking with the school bully the same day Adam gets attacked, then Mark comes to the rescue. Adam sees Mark come out of a broom closet with one of the female bullies looking like they\u2019d just had a make out session when he\u2019d told Adam he was going home for lunch and could not meet him.There are suspicions, and while Adam really likes Mark, he also has doubts because not everything is adding up. Then Christy is attacked and the evidence eliminates doubt who is behind it, although the reasons are still not clear.The story was incredibly well written and I would highly recommend it for fans of young adult paranormal/paranormal romance, obviously the romance is part of the story, but is not the focal point, so it is not simply a romance and as I said, very hard to put down once the characters are all established.The only warning is that there are some violent scenes because there is a battle going on between humans and something that is not. It is not overly graphic, but they are there \u2013 there are attacks and two characters are killed through the course of the story.I would love to see a sequel to this story to see the direction the characters take after the events of The Midnight Spell, and hopefully enough readers will for it so that the authors may consider a follow up story!"}, {"userName": "Smash", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1271418-smash", "userReview": "Courtesy of Smash Attack ReadsI adored this book. The minute that I met Christy and Adam, I wanted to be the third wheel. I adored their personalities, and more importantly, their mutual love and support. I think it\u2019s rare to find people who are so dedicated to another person in the way that these two friends were dedicated to each other. So epic, this friendship. The excerpt below shows a preliminary glimpse into their everlasting bond. All of the characters leapt off the pages and into my life. They were SO engaging and entertaining, that I found myself wanting to read the book at any free moment just so I could be in their presence.Firstly, we have Christy with her unwavering loyalty, disappointment in her slowly but surely emerging witch abilities, and her good-natured soul. She rocked an Evil Alice costume for Halloween, which made me SQUEE. Twinsies! Then there is her bestie, Adam, with his gentle soul, bruised self-esteem, and yearning for love. Christy\u2019s parents were damn memorable with their uncanny ability to be there when they were needed most. Chrsity\u2019s dad was a riot. I would be his daughter any day, just so he can glamour himself into wicked hilarious costumes when he comes to save my ass from evil. Adam\u2019s mother, Ashley, was so entertaining. She really reminded me of a character in Frater\u2019s As The World Dies series. This character is also similar to a certain real-life Ashley that I adore hardcore. Turns out, the character in this book was indeed modeled after The Bookish Brunette, and it was totally her. Right down to the stiletto fetish and energetic personality. So much win.Then we have the friends. Olivia, a town noob, falls in step with the outcast duo and ends up being a seriously entertaining piece of the puzzle. Panda bears FTW! Drifter, a mutual friend, was in the background for the most part, but he was someone I respected because of his ability to fit in with any crowd. He was liked by all cliques and was able to remain neutral and level-headed. I like people that can be friends with all types of people. Next up is Mark, who was dreamy and all the things you would ever want in a man, but be careful what you wish for! Nathan came about near the end of the book, but he had such a strong presence and I want MOAR. And lastly, I cannot forget the star of the book, for me: Callie the cat. Have no fear, this feline truly has a personality larger than any human I\u2019ve ever met. I adored her protectiveness, sassiness and down-right boldness. Cats = \u2665.The mystery behind a certain character was REALLY fun and had my noodle working. I loved trying to figure out just WHAT this character really was. I picked up on the subtle hints but I was still perplexed because nothing quite fit. And there was a seriously scary scene thrown in there, and I don\u2019t think I breathed until it was over. I was totally wrapped up in the moment, wishing I could turn myself invisible so that creature would not eat me! Also, there were some great pop culture references in this book that had me giggling profusely. Hocus Pocus was mentioned. Win!Ok, I\u2019m done rambling. Sorry for the incoherent run-on sentences. Did I like this book? That much is obvious. It was truly fun and entertaining, and that is exactly what I look for in a book.Favorite Quote \u201dWhatever! I still think you should\u2019ve been planning your party!\u201d\u201cWith who? Me, my two friends and a cat?\u201d\u201cCallie? Sure! Why not? She\u2019s a party animal from what you told me.\u201d\u201cI said she\u2019s was a slut, Mom.

Regardless of what life throws your way, your friends and more specifically, your best friend will not judge you, will not turn away from you, and will believe you, no matter how ridiculous the allegation.The Midnight Spell follows the story of best friends, Adam and Christy. Both have been already classified as losers and unpopular since elementary school days, this dynamic duo still carry on through their days at school with the strength of each other\u2019s company.Christy is a budding witch who will stop at nothing to help her best friend, Adam, find a boyfriend. Being in a small town, the population of potential gay prospects is nil\u2026zero\u2026nada. So Christy takes it upon herself to do a spell at midnight which will bring Adam\u2019s soon to be boyfriend into his life. Little do they know that they got more than they bargained for. Not only is there one new student that starts the next day, but there are two. Olivia, who has the looks and cools of becoming one of the popular kids, has taken to the side of Christy and Adam, and Mark\u2026deep, dark, mysterious, utterly handsome and totally gay Mark\u2026has taken an interest in Adam.Could Christy\u2019s spell have worked? Did she just give her best friend the ultimate gift? The gift of love? Everything between Adam and Mark seem to go off without a hitch\u2026until Christy bears witness to some of Mark\u2019s odd behavior. And it seems that when she confronts Adam with her findings, he is pretty reluctant to believe her. I mean, come on! New boyfriend here!The truth starts to unravel as Mark\u2019s deep, dark secret comes to light. Things will never be the same and the monsters that go bump in the night, appear to be more real than fantasy.Okay, so first off\u2026 loved this book! The writing styles of both Rhiannon Frater and Kody Boye are so addictive, and the characters found inside are full of personality. Readers everywhere will find one that they will be able to relate to, most definitely. The storyline is one that is pretty unique and was a thrill to watch unfold. As I\u2019ve stated before, I absolutely adored the whole best friend pact in The Midnight Spell. It left me with so many warm, fuzzy feelings. But those feelings weren\u2019t the only ones I was feeling\u2026oh no, dear reader.It absolutely broke my heart to witness the bully and torment that poor Adam had to go through. I can only imagine how awful it is in a small town where there is no one else around that is gay. I wanted to reach through the pages and protect this guy so badly! The minute an inkling of sort of bullying tactic came up, I had \u201cpissed off\u201d face plastered on right away.Not only did my heart break for Adam, but I also felt so badly for Christy. To know that she is different, and have a crush on the most crush-worthy guy in the school, to only find that he\u2019s starting to notice you, and you can\u2019t help but act like a dolt around him. I felt awful for Christy and the party scene, but at the same time, I thought it was so hilarious. Her thoughts and actions while she was drunk had me chuckling, as it was written perfectly.And how awesome was it that the little group was forming to become their own little Scooby Gang, a la Buffy The Vampire Slayer! I was laughing pretty hard with all the little Buffy mentions, and how the researching that was being done at the library wasn\u2019t nearly as cool as it looked on TV. (Truer words were never spoken).Fans of reads involving the loyalties of best friends, with a twist of monsters, and a dash of crazy boyfriend material, will fall head over heels for The Midnight Spell by Rhiannon Frater and Kody Boye."}, {"userName": "St\u00e9phanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1858445-st-phanie", "userReview": "At heart, this is really a YA book but with some supernatural elements added to the mix. Rhiannon Frater fans like me will probably enjoy the book, but will probably agree with me when I say this isn't Frater at her best. While I did enjoy the story, I wasn't crazy about the immaturity of some of the characters. In my opinion, just because the book is about young adults, it doesn't mean the characters have to be immature and that na\u00efve (at times). But kudos to Rhiannon for trying YA. Since this is my first book of Kody Boye, I don\u2019t really have anything to compare it too, but along with Rhiannon, Kody has gained a place on my watch list!I really appreciated the fact that each author was writing from a different point of view. While Rhiannon was writing from Christie\u2019s point of view, Kody was writing Adam\u2019s. The writing styles were slightly different, enough to help differentiate the two main characters, yet not enough to cause a rift in the story. Personally, Christie felt a little too immature for me when it came to some situations but I must admit, I really enjoyed meeting her family and learning about her magical powers. Little things like a magical broom stick living in her house adds so much to the book, and the fact that this said broomstick likes to spy on Christie is so freaking original! I have a soft spot for Adam because all the things he\u2019s going through.Despite the paranormal elements, this is a real YA book. In my opinion, it\u2019s a realistic representation of high school life which includes bullying, teen romance, boring classes and teen parties. The bullying in the book reminded me of the bullying in the movie MEAN GIRLS. While the mean girls in the movies were called The Plastics, in the book they were called The Barbies. I couldn't truly identify with the characters as they were being bullied by multiple characters but I can definitively understand their feelings. Like Adam, my brother is gay, and even if he didn't officially come out until in was in university, he was definitively bullied in high school for being gay and different.I think one of the strong messages from this book is that bullying is still out there, even when we don\u2019t realize it. There no reason why some teens are still being plagued by bullies today. Teen bullying can come from many different sources: other teens, parents, teachers, coaches, etc. Obviously this isn't news so I\u2019ll cut my rant short, but I do applaud Kody and Rhiannon for facing the issue in their book. What made the bullying in this book bearable is that both main characters had strong support systems at home. Parents that understand their child or teen\u2019s situation makes it easier for everyone to get through hard situations. Christie\u2019s parents are definitively a good presence, and Adam\u2019s mom couldn't be more understanding (or quirky, but that\u2019s another matter).For some unknown reason, I\u2019m always scared when it comes to collaborations. While it\u2019s a good way to discover new authors, it can sometimes be a failure if the book isn't up to standards about a specific author we've been following. But I worried for nothing about this book. While this is not my favorite Rhiannon Frater book of her, it has definitively introduced my to a new author!\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00b0\u00ba\u00a9\u00a9\u00ba\u00b0\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00b0\u00ba\u00a9\u00a9\u00ba\u00b0\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8Find this and other reviews on Tynga's ReviewsAn electronic advance reader's copy was provided by the author."}, {"userName": "C.T.

I like quite a few of them but they are a bit far from my horror, urban fantasy, and comic book literature wheelhouse. The Midnight Spell, however, is a work by one of my favorite authors is Rhiannon Frater and Kody Boye so I was willing to give it a shot. The premise is childhood best friends Adam and Christy are a couple of normal teenagers: Adam is gay and Christy is a witch but this doesn't impact their otherwise normal interactions. The pair cast a spell one night in order to find Adam true love in his small Texas hometown and, the next day, a surprisingly handsome new student of the appropriate sexuality arrives. Sure, Christy shouldn't be doing magic that potent at her age according to her centuries-old parents, but what's the worst that could happen? It's an intriguing enough premise and the character of Mark gradually reveals himself to be a sinister figure who brings a surprising amount of menace to an otherwise peaceful existence. The actual identity of who, what, and why to his actions is kept for the ending but the book does a great job of slowly peeling away a seemingly perfect exterior. Is Mark a sociopath? A supernatural being? An evil-magic user? All of these questions get answered but the book takes its time to let the question stew in your mind. One of the big appeals to the book is the fact the two are some of the most well-adjusted teenagers in YA fiction. With the exception of Christy pining for the local heartthrob and the slim romantic prospects for an openly gay teenager in a conservative small town, both of them are fairly happy with their lives. A lesser author would have exploited Adam's situation for what is commonly known as \"gaynst\" when he's very comfortable with who he is as are his immediate social circle. He feels like an authentic person and that's good. Christy is also quite likable, even though she's basically Ally Sheedy's character from The Breakfast Club transplanted into a being from Samantha's race in Bewitched. I was a little put off by the fact she's, essentially a fairy sorceress versus a teenager using magic but once I accepted the idea of a \"witch race\" I found it interesting that she's otherwise a normal Goth girl from Texas. I also like the \"refuge in audacity\" moment where she uses a literal flying broom to travel around town on the assumption no one would report it. The pop culture references, frequently to Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, date the book perhaps more than it should be. I don't think teenagers would be referencing that specific show unless this took place specifically during the Nineties but that is a small quibble. I also like Christy's parents clearly watch the show as much as she does. The book, perhaps, takes a little too long for things to start happening. In our era of immediate gratification, many readers will not be willing to wait until the book is half-finished for anything sinister to start happening but I think the slow pace gives us a sense of how much an invasion \"evil\" is to their peaceful world. I also am inclined to think a resurrection halfway through is unearned and should have been avoided. Still, The Midnight Spell is a fun bit of fiction. For those who like YA fiction and mysteries, this is a good book to recommend for teenage readers or adults who never grew up.9/10"}, {"userName": "Roxanne Kade", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5948499-roxanne-kade", "userReview": "Oh. My. Gosh! This was one exciting, thrill-a-second, adventurous from start to finish read, and I could not put it down!There was so much to love about this story that I'm not even sure where to begin. I immediately liked Adam and Christy. Their connection was so strong and it really came through in the fantastic writing. My heart broke a little for each of them because even thought they had each other, they both seemed to be missing a little something in their lives. While Christy pined over her crush, Adam's sexuality really left him with limited, or make that NO chance of finding love in such a small town. I loved that Christy loved Adam so much that she'd do just about anything to help him find happiness. Even casting a love spell.The thing is, love spells tend to have a way of going awry. They may eventually find their way, but they are sure to wreak havoc before that ever happens. I truly thought, though, that Christy's spell had been flawless, when Mark showed up. He seemed like the perfect guy for Adam. Maybe too perfect...There was a moment there when I wondered if perhaps he wasn't gay and it was going to cause a whole lot of turmoil between the two BFFs, but I was glad when things started to look up for Adam. That is until everything started to fall apart.I just have to take a moment to mention the great support system that both Christy and Adam had. It has been a while since I read book in which a family wasn't on the brink of, or already, falling to pieces. It was good to see healthy parent/child relationships, and parents who showed real interest in their kids. Even if the parents where a little kooky, they were cool and fun, and it such a wonderful change from the norm.Okay, back to the boy drama...I really felt for Christy, because it seemed like every time she made a little progress with Ian, it all went to hell. If she wasn't making a fool of herself, he was making an ass of himself and pissing her off. I was glad to see that she was willing to put her friendship before her love life, though.Things were getting a little weird on Adam's end. Mark seemed genuine and sweet, but something was a bit off with him. When he started acting weird about Christy I thought he had jealousy issues or that he was a little over possessive, but I never expected him to turn into a complete nightmare of a boyfriend, quite literally. When talk of the ghost came up, and with Mark acting strange, I started to wonder if there was something more paranormal to his crazy behavior, and I really was expecting him to show up on the bridge Halloween night. I certainly did not expect everything that happened after that night, and this story took a twisted, malevolent turn as old secrets were unveiled, and a terrifying past came to light. This book was wickedly cool, with a chilling back story that gave me the creeps and had me looking over my shoulder more than once. It was also a story of love, friendship and courage. There were times in this story when I thought my heart would shatter into pieces, and times when I couldn't help smiling. It was filled with some serious subject matter, things that are very relevant today, allowing the reader to connect with the story in many different ways. But, it also had a fun, lighter side to the darkness, which was thoroughly entertaining."}, {"userName": "Barb ~rede-2-read~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234093-barb-rede-2-read", "userReview": "Christy and Adam are best friends and have been since the first day of kindergarten. They are juniors in high school and they are misfits. Called witch by her peers, Christy hates the nickname since the name represents a green faced hag flying on a broom. Granted, she really is a witch, but she's not green, just a teenage witch battling 15 extra pounds, the puberty changes associated with being a witch, and the fact that she has a major unrequited crush on Ian, a gorgeous football player. Adam is also called names, mostly fag, and he's been the victim of a beating because of it. He's quite short, has flaming red hair and is socially inept, primarily because he's the only gay boy in the town. This is the story of their junior year, when Christy's power as a witch finally, albeit awkwardly, evolves; and when Adam finally meets his dream man, a new boy who's transferred to their high school. Mark appeared the night after Christy conducted a midnight love spell for Adam. Is it a coincidence? They think not. The story is a young adult paranormal adventure with both m/m and m/f romance. The characters and dialogue are witty, humorous, and believable. They feel happiness, sadness, heartbreak and love with all the ups and downs and in-betweens that causes the teen years to be so painful. The principal romance is between Adam and Mark, the new guy who's transferred to their high school. The secondary romance is between Christy and Ian, though it's more a comedy of errors than a romance. Seems every time Christy has a chance to impress him, she either throws up on him or passes out. The secondary characters include parents who are quite funny and therefore very embarrassing for the teens. Christy's magical parents, Adam's mother and sister, Christy's cat and the family broom are all quirky and unforgettable. Olivia, who also shows up as a transfer student the day that Mark arrives in town, becomes their sidekick and oh what a character she is! And Drifter, the typical cool kid who drifts from clique to clique, and is accepted everywhere, begins to hang out with them more and more often. The beginning of the story is devoted to setting up the tale, establishing the characters and their dynamics, and endearing us to the MC's. It was never boring, both authors have a quick wit and engaging writing style, with Rhiannon Frater writing Christy's POV and Kody Boye writing Adam's. During the second half of the story the action picks up and I had a hard time putting the book down. The high adventure, roller coaster ride of emotions that occurred during the final chapters was sometimes nail-biting, and sometimes heart-breaking. But at all times it was imaginative, creative and engaging. I highly recommend this book for all young adults and those who love young adult fiction, as well as for those who love a fantasy adventure with vampires, ghouls, witches and more. You won't be disappointed in this imaginative story.

Since kindergarten they have been best friends and took up for each other. Now in their Junior year of high school the taunts and being picked on continue. It's hard for Christy because everyone calls her a witch and call Adam gay. Everyone is right to call them that because they are. One night Christy decides to do a love spell for Adam for him to find a love. Even tho Adam doesn't believe it will work because he isn't to sure of her being a real witch a mysterious new boy shows up and school and soon he and Adam are a couple. Things should be great considering Christy's long time crush Ian seems to be paying attention to her now as well. Things aren't perfect and the two soon need help from their friends Olivia and Drifter because there is a darkness in the town that they must stop. I have to say I love Adam. I want him to have a wonderful guy sweep him off his feet. He is so sweet and even if he is short he won't back down from anyone. Christy is so awesome she has secrets no one knows everything about and she is just now hitting her witch puberty so to say. She is so loyal to Adam and the two have a friendship that is so amazing. They do whatever they can for each other even if they do interfere with each other sometimes. You don't mess with one of them that you don't get the other. Olivia I adored from the moment she showed up at school and the end of the book had me loving her.Drifter kind of kicks back and is part of everyones crowd.He is there to help when he can. He just seems like such a nice guy. I don't want to keep rambling about all the characters cause there is so many great ones but I will say I love Christy's parents and Adam's mom. They all are so fantastic and love to embarrass their kids but won't let anyone mess with them. I was so thrilled to get to read this book. Both authors did a fantastic job working together to make a wonderful story. I read this book in one sitting cause I could not put it down. It is written in such a way that the pages turn if by magic. I love the plot of this story. You really don't get to see a friendship like Adam and Christy share very often in books. You get to see just how close they are to each other. Christy has some funny moments as she always get flustered around her crush and her parents embarrassing her. As a force seems to be after her she has to figure out just what it is and why it seems to be after her. It also seems to be after Adam and is trying to drive them apart. I really don't want to give spoilers so I am trying not to. You have a teen witch, an evil darkness and all kinds of kids acting strange. It is up to a bunch of teens to figure it out, stop the darkness and keep Christy's parents from finding out. Throw in a spying broom and a nosy cat and you have one wonderful story. I love the different paranormal things the authors put in the book and several of them I would have never thought of but loved!! It wraps up very nicely but I really hope they write more of these books because I am in love with this one."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "Warning: I wrote the following while very sick & under the influence of cold medicine.Okay, so it\u2019s no secret that I love Rhiannon\u2019s books. So I was all over it when she announced she was co-writing a YA novel with Kody Boyd. I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be like her previous grittier books, but I was still looking forward to it. I will say that Rhiannon and Kody did an excellent job with The Midnight Spell.The story is told with alternating point of views of Christy and Adam, with Rhiannon writing as Christy and Kody writing as Adam. I love alternating POVs, and I think it worked really well for this book. I loved both of these characters. They are the outcasts in a very small Texas town, but they\u2019ve had each other since kindergarten. Christy is a witch, and Adam is gay. Being the only gay person in town can be pretty lonely, so Christy decides to do a spell that will bring someone special for Adam. Christy is convinced the spell worked when a hot new guy enrolls at school the very next day.When something evil starts invading the town and endangering Christy, Adam, and their friends, they have to discover what it is and destroy it. I enjoyed the mystery and the paranormal aspects of The Midnight Spell, especially since there was plenty of humor thrown in.Not only are Christy and Adam great characters, the secondary characters in The Midnight Spell are pretty awesome, too. I seriously love the whole group and their dynamic. The friendships in this book is one of my favorite things about it. Olivia \u2013 The new girl in town. she was probably my favorite. Her personality and style reminded me so much of my goddaughter, that it made me laugh numerous times. She\u2019s spunky, outgoing, and doesn\u2019t care what people think of her. Oh, and her gaydar is highly accurate. Ping. Mark \u2013 The hot mysterious new guy. You\u2019ll just have to get to know him for yourself. Ian \u2013 Christy has crushed on him since forever. I wasn\u2019t sure about him for the majority of the book. He\u2019s the hot super jock at school, but doesn\u2019t really pay much attention to Christy until only recently. Except when she was throwing up on him (haha). Drifter \u2013 He was a character I liked a lot, too. He got along with everyone, and hung out with various groups in school, but he was still a loyal friend to Christy and Adam. The Parents \u2013 Both Christy and Adam\u2019s parents were great. They were all active in the story, and not just background noise. I loved Christy\u2019s parents relationship with each other and with Christy. Her dad\u2019s Wii obsession made me laugh. And Ashley, Adam\u2019s mom, was a hoot. She sure did remind me of another Ashley I know. ;) Amelia \u2013 Adam\u2019s 10-year-old sister. I love this little brat! Seriously, she\u2019s the kind of daughter I would want. Callie the Cat & Broom \u2013 Yes, a broom. Who knew I\u2019d get attached to a cleaning tool and a hussy cat. But really, these two had such great personalities!Overall, I liked The Midnight Spell a lot, and have my fingers crossed for another book with these characters."}, {"userName": "Vidya-BooksAreMagic", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3906820-vidya-booksaremagic", "userReview": "There are only some books that 'feels' special, right when you close after reading them. This is one of those special book and I would readily recommend to anyone.What do you ever want from a fantasy novel? Just tell me..is it vampires, warewolves, witches, ghouls, or is it plain fun?Whatever you want, these two amazing authors are giving it. I love you, guys! I don't want to miss this book for the world.Adam and Christy are two best friends since forever. Adam is gay and Christy is a witch (literally). There is no other gay guy in town and as Adam feels lonely, Christy does a midnight spell to find his true love. The very next day, a very handsome guy named Mark joins as a new student in their school and he is pinging high side on the gaydar. And this year, they just has some new friends, Olivia (the new girl) and Drifter. Adam's friends try to bring Adam and Mark together. Christy feels something weird about Mark. And Christy's forever crush, Ian, is suddenly noticing her. And there is something more bad happening in town.This book is pure fun. I enjoyed it to the maximum. I know many books that portrays love, friendship, parent-child relationship and especially gay guys. But, this is the book that made me accept and understand like reality.Friendship: Wow. I am just jealous of these kids. Maybe the world is against them. But, these two don't need much of anything other than each other's company. I felt so happy and I remembered my happy-happy school days while reading them. The authors did 100% justice to the plot, that has the main root to be friendship. The four kids are all cute in their own way and the loyalty they show towards each other is hug-worthy.Parent-Child Relationship: This book has the most awesome relationship between a parent and a child. Two best examples! I just get enough of them. There were many laugh-out loud moments during those conversations. The BEST! And the parental characterization is just perfect. I can't imagine any better parents. As much as they embarrass the kids, the love and bonding between the family is transparent.Homosexuality: Trust me when I say I am new to this reading about homosexuals. But, this is the first book that made me realize that it need not necessarily be a topic discussed in all seriousness in books. It's just a plain normal subject. They are just normal humans and they deserve respect. Yeah, there is bullying and harrassment, just because the guy is gay, but the acceptance between friends and family is a refreshment.The suspense element of the story shows the authors' talent in story-telling. The authors have kept me busy and engaging throughout the read by giving one twist after another.I highly highly recommend this book to every single human out there.I strongly shove this book onto your faces. You SHOULD read them. What?? How else can I make you read, if you are not going to listen to me, after all those ramblings?"}, {"userName": "Amy Fournier", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5943163-amy-fournier", "userReview": "*4.5 starts rounded up to 5I love books about witches, and I love myself a good scary book. Combine them and I'm all in!! I know that Rhiannon Frater knows how to write scary well, so I had no doubt this book would totally creep me out at some point. Now not only is it about witches, but there are other paranormal elements to it too. By far my favorite part was the characters and their relationships. This book is based very strong on friendship and family and I think that there really should be more of that in YA. Also notable is the awesome humor in it. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times!The main characters are Cristy and Adam and I really loved them both. They have both been social outcasts since elementary school and have been best friends since kindergarten. They call Cristy a witch, and Adam gay. Both true, but it gets them picked on. They are always there for each other no matter what though and will do anything for the other. I loved how loyal they were and you could tell that they had been friends since they were kids. I could really feel the connection between them. They seemed to balance each other well. Adam is more quiet and reserved, while Cristy says what is on her mind. I thought they were both well developed and I loved their alternating POV'sThe other characters were equally awesome. Olivia was so fun!! She was like a ray of sunshine. She is super friendly and unique. Best is she is comfortable with who she is and will stand up for her friends in a heartbeat. Then there's Drifter who although he is friends with everyone, he tends to hang out with Adam and Cristy. Mark was charming and sweet, though a bit possessive of Adam, and Ian was so nice and I almost felt bad that Cristy kept shooting him down after crushing on him for so long. She really judges him too harshly. Mostly I loved Adam's mom, Ashley. She was so awesome!! She was funny, tough, and I just adored her. (She is based on Ashley from The Bookish Brunette and I think they did a fantastic job capturing her personality!) Cristy's parents are also really fun, and totally embarrassing. Best for me were \"broom\" and Callie. Some of my favorite scenes were with them.This story captured me right from the start. I was invested in the characters and interested in where the story was going. It was funny, scary, and had some great action. I loved the friendships and the bonds that were already there and the ones that formed. No matter what craziness was going on around them, they would do what they needed for each other with no questions asked. And I mention again, the family aspect. I could not have loved the parents involvement more. Cristy's parents and Adam's mom were such great additions to the story and it really rounded out everything well. I was very wrapped up in the story and I felt at times like I was there with them. This book was really fun to read and I can only hope for a sequel!!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer  Ricketts (Donnie Darko Girl)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6097206-jennifer-ricketts-donnie-darko-girl", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book for my stop on the blog tour at Donnie Darko Girl. Christy and Adam are the perfect pair of best friends in The Midnight Spell. Christy is wildly dramatic, fun loving, and a fiercely loyal friend. I loved her to pieces! I could see myself being friends with her and would want her in my corner any day. Adam is more mellow, contemplative, and the calm to Christy's storm. He's level headed and fiercely loyal to her. While she believes in magic with every reason to do so (she really is a witch), he doesn't, yet they're best friends anyway. They respect each other's beliefs, and their personalities complement each other. I adored Christy and Adam's parents. Christy's parents have been married for ages but are still as in love as though they're teenagers. I loved them! Adam's mom is supportive of her son being gay, so that's a non-issue in this story. I loved her! These parents listen to their kids, and the lack of family drama was a nice change of pace. I found myself jealous at times that Christy's parents seem to understand her so well. I think she takes them for granted sometimes, but no matter what, teenagers are going to feel embarrassed by their parents.What was an issue with Adam being gay was the lack of safety around his classmates. He's been beat up before back in sixth grade, and I think the anxiety that it could happen again was always on his mind. He only wants to find love, which seems impossible being the only gay guy in a small and close-minded town. The sudden appearance of the new girl, Olivia, seemed almost too good to be true. Some might say she's abrasive while others might say she just speaks her mind. She fits right into the group as if she has always been there. Mark is the new boy at school and arrives the morning after the spell Christy casts. It seems too good to be true for Adam. Mark and Olivia were both mysterious and I kept looking for clues as to who or what the evil was that came to town. I couldn't decide if it would be most obvious or least obvious, and I liked that I couldn't decide. The tone of the book, though evil comes to town, was lighter than I was expecting, and I was happy with it. I thought from the synopsis it would have be serious and dark, but there were a lot of happy moments and times I laughed out loud. I loved the writing, the characters, the dual narrative split between Christy and Adam, and their friendship. I highly recommend The Midnight Spell to anyone looking for a young adult paranormal novel - this will grab your attention from the beginning until the end.

Christy, a witch from a long line of witches and just coming into her powers, wants to do something nice for her BFF Adam, who, as the only gay kid in their small town, is seriously lacking in romantic prospects. She decides to cast a spell to bring him his one true love and the next day their school just happens to get two new students: a quirky blonde girl with pink highlights and a retro fashion sense and a devastatingly handsome and charming boy who seems to be into Adam. What follows is paranormal tale of being careful what you wish for (since you just might get it) and love gone horribly (horribly) wrong, but also a tale of the strong bonds of friendship and family.Adam and Christy share the spotlight equally as dual main characters and the story is told through their alternating first person perspectives. Outside of the fight with the evil that arises, these characters both have their own ongoing struggles that make them vulnerable and relatable. Christy\u2019s main conflict throughout the book is internal; she suffers from extremely low self-esteem (she calls herself fat and ugly on more than one occasion) and feelings of failure (when it comes to her newly budding magic powers and trying to catch the attention her life-long crush). Adam\u2019s conflict is mostly focused externally, dealing with homophobia and bullying from his classmates. It is easy to see how two such people would form a deep and lasting friendship and how they would bolster each up when needed.I loved this book. Like really, really adored it. The Buffy references sprinkled throughout only served to cement my love. The characters are fantastically relatable and likable and the dialogue is snappy and witty. I was particularly fond of Olivia, the lollipop-addicted, retro-darling, pink-haired new student who makes an instantly wonderful and sassy addition to Adam and Christy\u2019s duo. Her brash, bold confidence is just what these two needed in their lives.The paranormal aspects of the story are subtle in the first half of the book and grows more and more obvious in later chapters. The action in the later half of the book comes fast and furious and I found myself flipping pages feverishly in the grips of the climatic scenes.I highly recommend The Midnight Spell to anyone who likes YA paranormal books and stories built around the strong bonds of friendship. I am really crossing my fingers that the authors write a sequel, because I\u2019m just not ready to let these characters go yet and would love to read more stories with them in it.*I received a copy of this book to review.

But when I heard Rhiannon Frater and Kody Boye were writing a YA novel, I knew it wasn't going to be your usual YA fare. The Midnight Spell takes what I want from my favorite horror genres and puts a new spin on it. And the result is a heartwarming, creepy, funny, and overall enjoyable tale. I visually devoured every digital page I read.Without giving too much of the plot away, this is the story of lifelong friends Christy and Adam. Christy is a witch and Adam is gay, which makes them both outcasts in their small Texas town. Christy casts a love spell in an effort to match up Adam with his true love in a place that's woefully absent of compatible suitors. But there might be something else, something evil that's stirring underneath their small town.You can tell that Christy and Adam genuinely care for each other in their well-written, realistic friendship. If only we all had a friend like one of them, right? They both have their dynamics, their problems, and their strengths. And their other friends are just a hoot. Stereotypes are identified, explored, and some are completely broken down, which is a nice change. What I liked was how well Frater and Boye wrote 16 year-old thoughts and banter \u2013 I have a little sister that age, and she's said many of the things they lament. Bravo.The creepy factor ranks surprisingly high for a YA. I had a few moments where I caught myself holding my breath and reading faster to find out what happens. Some parts are genuinely chill-inducing. Only a few authors give me downright chills - Stephen King, mainly, so for me to have a reaction like that says enough.What's more, it's also incredibly funny. I find that I rarely ever laugh when I read \u2013 about every five minutes, I'd start chuckling at an especially funny line in this book. All of the characters have their shining moments where you're like, \u201cYou guys are AWESOME!\u201d Especially Christy's cat, who ended up being one of my favorite characters.Overall an enjoyably original read. I'm glad that there's now a book that speaks to the issues that many high school students are dealing with these days, particularly Adam's story. From what I've read and seen, gay relationships aren't covered too much in mainstream YA these days (which is a shame when you think about the horrible relationships some YA presents as \u201cthis is how true love is.\u201d Twilight, I'm looking at you).

Christy and Adam have been best friends since they were kids growing up in the small town. They each came out of the closet to each other revealing their own deep dark secrets one being gay the other a witch. Since Adam is the only gay boy in town it\u2019s been hard fitting in and impossible finding a potential boyfriend but with the help of a spell cast at midnight his perfect match may just make an appearance.They each secretly think the spell won\u2019t work, but the next day a handsome guy registers for school, he\u2019s everything Adam dreamed about and wants to be with Adam. Christy is thrilled that Adam is happy but there is something about Mark she just can\u2019t put her finger on it and the more she gets to know Mark the more worried she is about Adam. As if that\u2019s not enough Christy is gaining her powers, and controlling them isn\u2019t as easy as it used to be and now the one guy she has a crush on knows her deep dark secret. What will happen when Christy learns Marks secret?With The Midnight Spell we are given two points of view both Christy and Adam. I loved Christy right from the start casting a spell that would make her best friend happy. She\u2019s the kind of friend I would want as a best friend. I thought Adam was a perfect character to pair with Christy, and they are paired well together willing to stand up for each other against the Barbie\u2019s. I like the supporting characters as well Drifter & Olivia they added and enhanced the story.The Midnight Spell is a captivating story that mixes magic with romance throwing in a twist of suspense and flashes of darkness. The authors have taken the witch concept giving it a face lift with a new exciting history. I honestly really enjoyed the whole idea of Christy creating a spell for the right reason but we all know even good intentions don\u2019t always turn out right. The characters are fantastic I connected with them all, laughing, crying, and just rooting for the underdogs. As if it\u2019s not enough being an outcast in high school, dealing with teen relationships when you throw in magic, bad guys, and a cat always in heat you can\u2019t help loving the story. I really enjoyed all aspects of the story it\u2019s fast paced full of action it even has the creepy factor that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.

Neither of them really fit in, and are frequently called names, but it doesn\u2019t really bother them, because the kids are right. Adam is gay and Christy is a witch. One night Christy decides to cast a love spell for Adam. She knows it\u2019s against the rules to cast one for herself to make Ian, the hot jock at school finally notice her, but surely it would be okay to cast a spell for Adam to find love. Christy\u2019s never done a spell of this magnitude before, and she hasn\u2019t fully come into her powers yet, but she\u2019s sure it will work. Adam, on the other hand, isn\u2019t so sure.But then tall, dark and handsome Mark Black comes to town and sweeps Adam off his feet. Things seem to be looking up for them, but then strange things begin to happen and Christy and Adam realize that something evil has come to town and it\u2019s up to them to stop it before it destroys their town and those they love.I totally \u201cgot\u201d the setting of the book. Trinity Springs, TX is your run-of-the-mill small town, much like the town I grew up in. If you \u201cblend in\u201d, you\u2019re fine, but if you\u2019re even a little bit different, people will talk.As is typical in any of Rhiannon\u2019s books, the characters are very relateable and well-drawn. I loved the friendship between Adam and Christy. It seemed authentic and like several of my friendships in high school. I also really enjoyed their families. They had happy, typical home lives. Even though Christy\u2019s parent\u2019s were from a family of powerful witches, they still felt real. I also liked that even though Christy and Adam were the outcasts, they weren\u2019t total loners. They still had a small group of friends (namely Olivia and Drifter) that added a nice touch to the mix.The book flowed very well, though it did feel like it could have been tightened a bit in places. It didn\u2019t detract from the story at all, though. There are quite a few surprises along the way, and several nods to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which I loved. That is one of my all-time favorite TV shows and I think that\u2019s what pulled me into the book. I also liked that even though it was written by two authors, it never felt choppy. The voices complimented each other very well.Fresh, clever and full of unforgettable characters and a few surprises, The Midnight Spell is a must for fans of paranormal YA. It\u2019s familiar enough to please the die-hard fans, but different enough to please those who have grown weary of the clich\u00e9\u2019s."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5724579-angie", "userReview": "The Midnight Spell was really cute! It\u2019s all about friendship and magic! There\u2019s also some romance and danger! And high school horrors! I quite enjoyed it. Christy is a witch, not that her BFF Adam believes her. He humors her anyway as she casts a spell to help him meet his true love, since it\u2019s hard dating when you\u2019re the only gay male in a tiny town. The very next morning, there\u2019s a new guy at school who is super hot and possibly has his eye on Adam. But Mark isn\u2019t what he seems.The Midnight Spell is just a lot of fun! How can it not be when there\u2019s a teenage witch going through what is essentially magical puberty!? Her spells cause some hiccups, and then there\u2019s the evil creatures of the night who start showing up. Christy also has a very helpful cat named Callie, and she\u2019s constantly stalked by her mom\u2019s nosy broom! Cute stuff. There\u2019s also a lot of humor sprinkled throughout, so the story never got dark even when bad things were happening.What I also really liked about The Midnight Spell was the parents! Yes, there are present adult figures in this YA book! Christy\u2019s parents are, of course, witches so they\u2019re trying to help her with her growing powers. Her dad looks like Santa and her mom is a kind of eccentric artist type, both of which are constantly embarrassing her in front of her friends and crush. Adam\u2019s mom is a self-proclaimed shoe whore, and is like a bipolar pixie! She\u2019s very protective of her son.The Midnight Spell is not without its faults though. For starters, it\u2019s full of cliches, but I think they work for the most part given the light nature of the story. Christy and Adam are outcasts and bullied by a group of typical mean girls, who really seemed to serve no other purpose than to be mean to them. Christy\u2019s parents are from a parallel world, so of course they\u2019re kind of weird when trying to appear human. Adam\u2019s new boyfriend Mark is something more than just a human boy, which is fairly obvious from the beginning. But at least what he is, and how he got that way, wasn\u2019t predictable, so that\u2019s a plus.In the end, I really liked The Midnight Spell. The characters are all great, and I loved the magic. The plot wasn\u2019t the most original, but it was fun.Read more of my reviews at Pinkindle Reads & Reviews."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19837886-alice", "userReview": "I am very happy that I made and be part of the tour The Midnight Spell , is one of the books that undoubtedly is in my favorites for many reasons.To start , the book was written by two authors and the sound and line of the book is like a person , but also, gives us the assurance that they are two authors , why? because each of our protagonists has some feature of both authors.The story will have the way to what a YA could be defined, but breaks the scheme in many ways and it is nice to see the risk that the authors took, Christy and Adam are our protagonists, unique and different, and above all, great friends! Their friendship starts from children and to grow,still stands and each would support to the other, if that means breaking the rules.Adam is gay and Christy is a witch, are teenagers with their pros and cons of age, be different probably is not easy but they have each other, including his family, a midnight spell with good wishes from Christy to Adam, it works very well, it will change their lives, with emotions, magic crushes, risks and even new friends.As I said above, the authors broke the schemes we could be accustomed, the protagonists are not foresee falling in love, on the contrary, here reinforces what is a true friendship, regardless of race, gender, likes, or if have supernatural powers. One of the protagonists is gay! wao, Bravo! many authors do not take this risk of put them of protagonist and less in a book classified as YA, we can see them in the background, supporting the protagonist, but not as a protagonist as such. Christy is not the typical perfect girl, she is natural, even his physical description is not the usual, but his attitude makes it perfect as a protagonist. The two are definitely my favorites, and even the secondary characters win your heart.This book is a little jewel that you should not pass up, has mystery, friendship, love, fun, laughter, and how to avoid paranormal state, added with one or another scare and surprises. El work of Kody and Rhiannon is beautiful, is supernatural and is incredibly magical. I'm, one of the many people who support please write a sequel.P. S The cover is very beautiful and as good Crazy Cat Girl, I'm a fan of Callie the CatReview on: All things in the cloud Sweet"}, {"userName": "Unabridged Bookshelf", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6447425-unabridged-bookshelf", "userReview": "The Midnight Spell in unique, hilarious, while still managing to set a dark and creepy tone when needed. I absolutely loved The Midnight Spell, because while dealing with some dark issues, the writers still manage to make you laugh. The group of characters all have distinct personalities, and they form a very tight group of friends. The two main characters, Christy and Adam, have alternate viewpoints during the story, and it gives great insight into both characters.Christy is an average teen, who has become an outcast because she is different. Little does anyone but Adam know, but she is a witch waiting for her powers to come in fully. Christy is also a teenage girl, who struggles with weight and self-esteem issues and just wants her crush to like her for her. Adam is dealing with some issues of his own; he is constantly taunted, bullied, and even beaten for being gay. Reading about what Adam had to go through broke my heart at times, but he also stood up and persevered.The amount of surprises in this book that I did not see coming is just massive, but each one made me love the story even more. I love that this book is full of surprises, because I do not like it when a book is too predictable. This book also does not lack on the action, or the hilarity and sarcasm. Also, can I just say, I would really like my own magic broom, because I think it would be a bundle of fun. I also loved the unique backstory to the witchcraft in this novel, because it puts a fresh twist on the storyline.Seriously, if you are looking for an insanely good young adult book to read, The Midnight Spell is the one. The Midnight Spell is full of romance, betrayal, friendship, and magic, what more can you ask for in a book. With two authors voicing their own character, it really gives each character its own distinct voice, but still manages to flow seamlessly together. I will admit that my favorite character besides the main ones would have to be Adam\u2019s Mother, who is based of Ashley @ The Bookish Brunette. She is just a hoot, and they really captured her personality.**Unabridged Bookshelf received this book from the authors, in exchange for an honest review**"}], "description": "Adam and Christy have been best friends since kindergarten.
