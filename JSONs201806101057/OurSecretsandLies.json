But I feel like she has toned down the ott humour, and notched up the feels. And it\u2019s a winning combination for me.I loved all the colourful characters, and my heart agonised over the various obstacles that they had to crawl through.\u201cPage turner\u201d is an over used phrase, but very apt here! As I grabbed the book, and turned pages as quick as I could every chance I got."}, {"userName": "Monica Mac", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46907893-monica-mac", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a familiar enough story: a young woman finds herself pregnant and the father is nowhere in sight so she becomes a single parent. In this instance, she is pregnant with twins, which makes things tougher. She does, however, have a wonderfully supportive network of family and friends and they all rally around to help her. There are so many strong and interesting characters in this book that it really added to my enjoyment of the story. Lucy is a very strong woman and has brought up her children very well, but at what cost? She wants nothing but the best for them, always, and yet is her protectiveness and stubborn attitude that her children must strive for the top driving them away from her?This was a thoroughly modern tale of single parenthood and there are many times when I was surprised at the direction the story was going but it all made a lot of sense to me. I got completely emotionally involved with Lucy and for that reason, I think this book deserves 5 stars. Thank you to NetGalley and Bookouture. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own."}, {"userName": "Margaret Madden", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21224317-margaret-madden", "userReview": "Review to follow..."}, {"userName": "Megan Jones", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18958766-megan-jones", "userReview": "Lucy Murphy is a driven mother with the main intention of ensuring her twins have a better start than she did. Abandoned by their father early on in her pregnancy, and forced to leave behind her future career of a lawyer, she vows nothing will stand in the way of her children\u2019s dreams. When the twins are given the opportunity to move to a prestigious school all Lucy sees is the glittering future lying in wait for them. But Lucy is confusing her thwarted ambitions with what her children really want. Lucy is blind to the risks of forcing her children into a future they may not want. Until it is too late.I found this a book of multiple sections. I loved the first part where we learn about the situation Lucy found herself in when pregnant, this was very enjoyable, highly emotional and really grabbed my interest. Then we skip forward to when the twins are moving to their new school, we see them fight to fit in and grapple with the future their mother has set out for them. Here my interest waned a little, not massively but a little bit, the drama drops off to begin with which was a shame and I did struggle to maintain interest. However Moriarty does pick the plot pace back up and towards the end my interest and enjoyment picked up again.Before I say anything else, I have to say this reads a bit funny, I cannot quite put my finger on why but at times this reads like a true story article from a magazine, unfortunately for this book it does not work and it made the reading quite stunted which was a shame. Negative aside, I thoroughly enjoyed, if this is the right word, Kelly\u2019s plot thread. I will not detail it for fear of giving it away, but it is with Kelly that the majority of my interest and enthusiasm for this book went. Her plot is incredibly emotional, raw and I have to say Moriarty writes it extremely well and sensitively. The other plot threads are good as well but they do not have the power that Kelly\u2019s plot thread held for me. As well as this I thoroughly enjoyed the characters that Moriarty has created, they are incredibly likeable, realistic characters and it was a pleasure to immerse myself in their world for a short time.\u2018Our Secrets and Lies\u2019 is an enjoyable, emotional, realistic read from Moriarty but not her best for me. There are moments where not a lot is going on and my interest died down, having said I loved the characters and I finished this feeling like I had a new group of friends."}, {"userName": "Peg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14963713-peg", "userReview": "4.5 starsOur Secrets and Lies is an inspirational, heartbreaking and touching story. This novel gripped my heart, sparked my anger, moved me to tears, and made me smile. Lucy was soon to be a single parent, and her heart was broken. Tom, the father of her unborn twins, had abandoned her. He left her alone to deal with the fallout, including informing her parents of her pregnancy. Tom was crazy about Lucy. The last thing he wanted to do was to listen to his father and leave the country. But, that\u2019s exactly what his father demanded. And if Tom didn\u2019t want to be cut off from his family, he had to listen to him.Tom\u2019s father humiliated and verbally abused Lucy. She was crushed. Lucy decided to make it her life\u2019s mission to prove that Tom\u2019s father was wrong. Lucy was not the lowlife that he made her out to be. So she gave up her dream of becoming a successful lawyer and devoted her life to raising her children and caring for her parents. Although Lucy was a loving mom, she was intense and obsessed with her children, Dylan and Kelly. She didn\u2019t realize that the pent-up anger that she\u2019d carried for years, after being abandoned and humiliated, drove her to become overbearing with the twins. But, because of her micromanaging, Lucy almost lost them. Unconditional love requires sacrifice and often the willingness to let go. Lucy discovered this the hard way. Painful lessons are never fun, but, it\u2019s through them, that hearts, and lives, are changed. They are also the lessons that are rarely forgotten. Sinead Moriarty writes a compelling, gripping and an emotional story. I loved it.Thank you, Bookouture Publishing and NetGalley, for my advanced review copy."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8254902-kathy", "userReview": "Though a good student, Lucy Murphy walks away from the hope of a promising career as a lawyer when she finds herself pregnant with twins. The father of the children, pushed by his own father, deserts Lucy in this time of need. Thus, Lucy raises the twins, Dylan and Kelly, alone. What Lucy does not realize is that her pent-up anger at her lifelong situation has become a major part of her life. She loves her children but has become too intense and over bearing. Can Lucy figure out what she is doing to her children in time to not lose them?This is a good book about relationships. Lucy, though a bit too much, was obviously a solid, loving mother, who only had her children\u2019s best interests in mind, whenever and whatever she did for them. However, she became so obsessed that she almost lost them. I did not like the father of the twins, who abandoned Lucy during the time she needed him the most, or his father, who refused to accept the fate of his son and Lucy\u2019s pregnancy, banishing his son because of it. The story is not an unusual one, and I did like the fact that Lucy had a strong support system. As the story unraveled, I could feel the emotional grip it began to have on me, as I read along. This is the first book I have read by this author, but will now pursue more by her, after reading this one.

For about half of the book it the focus on Lucy and the events that led up to her deciding to have the baby and keep it and then the book fast forwards and we get to see snippets of the major past events but mostly focuses on the the present and how her kids are doing in school. Lucy changed and not for the better though from all accounts she did well with raising her kids without a father figure in their lives (grandpa apparently doesn't count). There's some bullying involved and some drama but it's not over-the-top-suspends-belief-and-wrecks-the-book type of drama. Its used to build things up for a main event in one of the character's lives and without it being there the event wouldn't have had as much impact as it did. For fan's of the author I'd recommend the book, while its not as good as some of her other books it's still a good read."}, {"userName": "Savanah Rae", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3382033-savanah-rae", "userReview": "I received this book for free from Netgalley in return for my honest opinion.I've never read anything from Sinead Moriarty but I really enjoyed this book and will look for more books from her.

I really did not like Lucy, not even at the end when she wised up. The book dragged for me. After already reading one of Moriarty's books, I was aware of her liberal side. I was taken aback by her attack on Melania Trump, and our President of the United States. It was disgusting! Why can't foreign authors leave American politics out of their books. I read Irish novels because I have some Irish roots. And after visiting the country I fell in love with it.
