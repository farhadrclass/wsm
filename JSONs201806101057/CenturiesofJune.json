The book is a dying man's look back on history - through the eyes of eight women and a male \"guide\" that morphs from his late father to Samuel Beckett, to his living brother... The man falls on his way to the bathroom in the middle of the night... as he lays on the bathroom tile, people join him in the bathroom - sitting in the tub, on the toilet, on the sink counter - and tell their stories of times past, and love lost. The women's stories have a common thread of the men who have wronged them in life - through betrayal, negligence, etc. Yet the stories are very entertaining and the true highlight of the book. They span the American landscape and history. A novel idea for a story - and unlike anything else I have read. If you can suspend reality and just go with it, I think you will be rewarded in the end, as I was."}, {"userName": "Michelle H", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7282503-michelle-h", "userReview": "From www.thebookdorks.comWEIRD. Centuries of June is just plain weird, but compellingly so. At times, it is laugh-out-loud funny and at others, it is simply surreal and hallucinatory. And I loved it.The novel begins with our narrator landing on his bathroom floor bleeding profusely from a head wound which he acknowledges will make his floor \u201cmurder to clean.\u201d Ha! As he attempts to recount how he ended up there, he is joined by a doppleganger of his father who sneezes feathers and subsists solely on whiskey. During his brief forays out of the bathroom, he stops to have conversations with his cat (who sometimes talks back) and peek in on the eight naked women tangled in his bed a la Gustav Klimt\u2019s The Virgin. The narrator, let\u2019s call him Jack, has no recollection of how he ended up brained on the bathroom tile, why he\u2019s hosting a bevy of sleeping beauties in his bed, or just why all the clocks in his house have somehow stopped.Each of those naked lovelies awakens and heads off with her weapon of choice to attack Jack in the tiny lavatory. Dad, or let\u2019s call him Samuel Beckett, prevents these murderous rampages by allowing each to tell her story of degradation at Jack\u2019s hands.Their ire dissipates as one by one, each of the girls \u2014 a former slave, a cave-dwelling native, a cross-dressing ship\u2019s mate, a proclaimed witch, a gold-seeking prospector, and the like \u2014 explains why she feels Jack is the cause of her ruin. Jack, with no recollection of being involved with any of these women, begins to feel some guilt for perhaps mistreating them in his past incarnations.Centuries of June is full of subtle and not-so-subtle allusions to Waiting for Godot, Tristram Shandy, the Marx Brothers, and the Salem Witch Trials. If my library digital loan of this weren\u2019t up tomorrow, I\u2019d definitely begin an immediate reread because I liked it so much and rushed through it to get to the end. I did find the ending a tad anticlimactic as I\u2019d already figured out some of the novel\u2019s twists, but I didn\u2019t feel that detracted from its beauty as a whole.You know, the last book I read in the magical realism genre, The Silence of Bonaventure Arrow, was the last decent book I\u2019ve read. Paired with this, I think I now have a new favorite type of literature. I was looking for something different to read and this was definitely IT."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "Ever read a book that takes almost entirely inside a bathroom? I can't say I ever had. But now I have! Inside the bathroom is a young man who wakes up naked and bleeding on the bathroom tile, an old man in a bathrobe sitting on the tub, coughing feathers, and one by one a series of women come from the bedroom to tell their stories. If that's not bizarre enough, each of the women comes from a different century. There's a victim of the Salem witch trials, a slave in New Orleans, a woman who was present for the World Series in 1903 when the Pirates actually did something cool, etc. All of their stories are similar in one way - they've been betrayed, spurned, hurt. And they want their stories heard now.Like Donohue's first and second books (The Stolen Child and Angels of Destruction), there is an element of the fantastical in this story. Donohue writes literary fiction but with a touch of fantasy that almost makes complete sense, like it could be pretty realistic. A cat named Harpo who talks some smack? Sure, why not. It works.In a sense, this book is also a mystery. Why is the main character lying naked on the floor of his bathroom at the start of the novel? Why is he bleeding? Will he ever be able to tell his story? And, really, what's with the creepy guy sitting on the bathtub? The mystery itself slowly unravels, and by slowly I mean it unravels before your eyes across many centuries. All the pieces start to fall into place, you start to get it. It's a fun story.I think it could have been even better, however. Less choppy in parts. I had a chance to go to Donohue's reading and book signing when this book came out and if I remember correctly he talked briefly about wanting to give these women voices, which he did. But he also did the same thing a lot of male writers do when writing women - he oversexualized them. I feel the book could have done with a lot less of that. Women can have voices, even angry voices, that don't just have to do with sex.But I continue to read Donohue because I like when Pittsburgh people go on to do real things. He might not be in Pittsburgh anymore, but it makes its way into his writing, so I think this is still his home. I see he has a new book coming out, or it is out, or something. I look forward to reading it just as much as I've looked forward to these first three. I just keep hoping he'll write one I love as much as I loved The Stolen Child."}, {"userName": "Audra (Unabridged Chick)", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3083001-audra-unabridged-chick", "userReview": "This unique novel mixes surreal lit fic and dreamy historical fiction to make a (mostly) compelling story about love, loss, responsibility, and moving on. The reader and the unnamed narrator are plunged immediately -- from the first paragraph -- into the same confusing mystery: what happened to him and who are all these people in his bathroom?Strangely I feel ambivalent toward this novel even though it hits so many elements I like in a book: fascinating heroines, literary references, story-within-a-story, and interesting locales (including Pittsburgh!). My coolness toward this book is due to the narrator and his guide-to-the-afterlife. Both felt very artificial and joke-y to me; and while the guide can be excused, I suppose, since he's mythic and otherworldly, the narrator was very much real and yet, he felt flat, hollow, and boring.Visited by seven women, all unlucky in love and life, the narrator is regaled with their stories, which includes a Native American who fell in love with a shapeshifting bear; a victim of the Salem witch trials; a slave saving for her freedom; a gold prospector in the mid 1800s; and a 1950s housewife eager to rid of her husband. The women and their stories were the best part of the novel, and I just loved their interludes. I had less patience for the sexualized treatment of the seven women: it felt a bit unnecessary especially since the women themselves rarely were the sexual instigators. They were the recipients of male attention -- some passive, some active -- that had an edge of violence that made me frustrated. The women were confronting the narrator but in the end, I didn't feel like they got the justice they wanted.There's a cinematic quality to the writing which is also lovely when it works and grating when it doesn't, but I will say this novel occupied my thoughts constantly, and I rushed to finish it. This is another summer read that has some oomph for those who want more than fluff but not something too heavy; I suspect this would also make a great book club or group read."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2510203-ryan", "userReview": "When Jack falls, naked, in his bathroom, he cracks his head open and starts to bleed to death. When he comes to, he isn't quite sure what's going on, other than the fact there are eight naked women lying in his bed. Confused and disoriented he goes back to the bathroom and meets an old man, who he thinks is his deceased father. Over the course of an untold amount of time, though the clock never changes from 4:52 am, Jack is visited by seven of those women while he is still in the bathroom. All seven of them try to kill him, only to fail and start narrating a story that somehow makes Jack think he is in some way involved. Only once the last story is told, does Jack start to realize what has happened.I don't even know where to begin on this one, but a few adjectives do come to mind. Quirky, strange, fantastical, beautiful, and brilliant are a few of them that rise to the surface of my brain. Thankfully, I'm not bleeding out on the bathroom floor, otherwise this review would never get done. This book, and those like it, are the reason I love to read. Having the privilege to read a story that is so well crafted and articulated is one of the great pleasures in life.Jack and the women are all intriguing characters, when they have your attention, they never let it go. The women span five hundred years of American history and through a twist of fate, they all have ties to Jack. Their stories are tragic and full of heartache and death, but they all have an unique feel to them that makes them standout from each other. The stories range from the mythical to the femme fatale, all of them are captivating and original. There is a lyrical quality to them, so much so, that at times I felt as if I was sitting by a campfire, listening to a bard tell the history of my people. I felt for all of them and the men in their lives, the men Jack used to be.This was a beautiful story that mixed reincarnation, rebirth, second chances, and the everlasting struggle between love and hate. It's the tale of the past, present, and future all colliding into one man's life and where it goes from here."}, {"userName": "Tevya", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2629035-tevya", "userReview": "Centuries of June is set in the bathroom of Jack's home. Jack finds himself dying on his bathroom floor and is visited by a trail of women who all have tales to weave for him. These tales take place over a course of time spanning from pre-Colombian times to present, including stories from the Salem witch trials, Southern Gothic, and Native American folklore and mythology. Jack begins inserting himself into the stories, and he finds that the women seem to be familiar to him. While the stories themselves seem to be unrelated, they are tied together in the end.I was intrigued by the concept of Centuries of June from reading the synopsis. I am new to Keith Donohue's work, and that also drew me to the book as I am challenging myself to branch out and read new authors this year. While his writing is definitely not my usual style, I found Centuries of June to be well written and darkly humorous. The plot felt confusing at times, and although I found the stories told by the women to be entertaining, I found myself bored and distracted while reading. Personally, I would have preferred to read the women's stories as short stand-alone novellas. However, I am impressed by the creativity it took to weave the stories together in this manner. I did enjoy elements of the book, and if I'm 100% honest with myself, I'll admit that I most probably would have enjoyed Centuries of June more had I not been staring down a stack of must-read sequels to some of my most favorite books.As a lover of books, I have to comment on how beautiful the book itself is. The cover is mysterious and alluring, the book feels good in the hand, and the pages are wonderful. They are thick, with roughened, uneven natural edges. (Yeah, I know - I'm a total geek, but I was so impressed with the look and feel of the actual book, I couldn't not comment on it! It's rare that I find a book that makes me want to open it just because of the beauty and feel of the pages.) You're laughing - I can tell. But seriously, it's a beautiful book!"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1227713-chris", "userReview": "I was so sad as I read this. I LOVE Donohue's use of language and writing style in general. He makes me angry how talented he is; however, this book is nowhere near as good as THE STOLEN CHILD--it's not even as good as ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION. Much as I love his writing, his novels are on a downward slope. I really, REALLY hope his next one is on the incline, or I'm going to have to stop telling people he's one of my favorite authors.... Sad day.This one might not have bothered me as much if it had simply been a collection of short stories. While similar to Chuck Palahniuk's HAUNTED--in terms of structure--I cared even less about the \"intertwining\" story. Some of the women's tales were quite interesting--some I quite liked on their own--but I didn't feel like it worked as a novel. Perhaps this is just me. As I hinted at above, this is a gorgeously written novel, but the lack of coherency and an enjoyable protagonist made this one hard to read."}, {"userName": "Matt Fitz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8731579-matt-fitz", "userReview": "A mixture of folklore, myth, surrealism, magical realism, and American history as a man wakes up laying on the floor with a hole in the back of his head with unknown origin.

Essentially it is a collection of short stories linked together by the main character Jack. In general I don\u2019t like short stories, but something about this collection worked well for me. It has a bit of Dicken\u2019s Christmas Carol in that the reader (or at least this reader) is unsure if Jack is dreaming or hallucinating and wondering what kind of lesson he will have learned when he wakes in the morning.Of course, unlike Scrooge, Jack does not get his second chance; he will not wake in the morning and by the time he is reborn he will have forgotten all of these previous eight lives. Although, the irony is in the wondering of whether he will become the cat in his ninth (talking Harpo is one of my favorite characters).Each of the women that we meet through the night represent one of Jack\u2019s former lives and take the reader through a series of historical incidents from early Native American tribal life to 1950s scotch drinking and gun weilding Bunny. The stories are all rather stereotypical and emblematic of their era; some are more entertaining than others, but they are all fairly well done.For some reason the bathroom scenes reminded me of the book/movie Jumanji. I kept half expecting them to roll a die to determine what kind of weapon the next girl was going to bring in. Donohue himself made two dramaturgical references that I could appreciate: Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot (which I find absolutely excrutiating and not funny in the least bit even when I saw it performed in London by Ben Kingsley) and Checkov\u2019s adage about the gun shown in Act I being shot in Act III. There were a few good quotes on human nature:\u201cWe must be shown evidence of our pain in order to feel the concomitant sorrow, but our joy comes and goes as it pleases.\u201d and\u201cWhat are we but the sum of our desires?\u201d and\u201cseemed more concerned with what he had lost than with what was still in hand, and he struck me in the moment as somewhat emblematic of the human condition, not to read too much into basic greed and regret.\u201dOverall it was a nice blend of fairy tale and myth."}, {"userName": "Wendy Hines", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4997255-wendy-hines", "userReview": "This has got to be one of the strangest books I have ever read. Nonetheless, it is very addictive. It opens with \"Jack\" watching his blood flow onto the bathroom tiles. He's hit his head with half of his naked body in the bathroom and half in the hallway. He momentarily thinks how regretful he would be if someone found him in his current situation. His pain ebbs and that is when his departed father appears sitting on the edge of the bathtub.Jack immediately feels better and is able to stand. He puts on a robe and goes to fetch his dad a shot of whiskey. But on his return to the bathroom, with the whiskey, he pauses at his bedroom and peeks in. Eight naked women are sleeping in his bed. But then one of the women appear behind him in the bathroom, and proceeds to tell him her life story. And the stories continue as each woman appears in the bathroom. Each woman is from a different point in time and some of them are mythical. But what of Jack? Will he wake up? Who hit him on the head? Why?Centuries of June is a unique tale that will keep the reader entranced. Crude language and sexual situations are intermixed sporadically, but humor outshines it. The talking cat, Harpo, lightens any situation the protagonist finds himself in. The character building is unique and I can honestly say that Keith Donohue has one powerful imagination. The worlds he builds for each woman is detailed and easily imagined.

But I couldn't turn down the opportunity to check out his latest, Centuries of June. I mean, the blurb had me at \"black comedy about a man who is attempting to tell the story of how he ended up on the floor with a hole in his head\"... How do you turn down something like that?I will admit to reading this slowly at first. Really slowly... In fact, it probably took me a good 3-4 days to get through the first two stories, which is unheard of in my reading. And here I will state that while I thought those two stories were entertaining, I didn't quite get the whole picture then. In fact, I didn't even get a glimpse of what might be the whole picture. The parts involving the guy-with-the-hole-in-the-head were hazy and confusing enough, and then all these other characters showed up.Then I picked it up again--because, hey, I had to read it and review it--and started really getting into the stories. Which is where Donohue shines, because the women and their stories were something I really enjoyed. Each character was interesting, each story had a different style about it, and it all wrapped up nicely at the end... And now that it's done, I think reading each story and savoring it slowly is the way to go here.

But just a bit! The great thing about this one, for me, was that there are so many stories included from so many different points in history. It's kind of like seven short historical novellas in one book. It begins with a man waking up on his bathroom floor, totally disoriented and with a wound on the back of his head. Upon investigation, he discovers that his bed is filled with 8 women, who proceed to visit him one by one in the bathroom, each one apparently intent upon killing him. Their histories become the short historical novellas that form most of the rest of this story, interspersed with connecting scenes taking place in the bathroom, which continues to fill up with these women from the past who provide each new arrival with encouragement and support as each one relates her own story. The stories, by the way, are all about how each woman was mistreated, disappointed, sometimes even murdered by the man in her life.

He's a smart cookie who has also got imagination and a sense of humor, and as a novelist at least he lives in a spirit filled world. He mixes absurdist whimsy with realist melancholy in a way that really appeals to me though I readily imagine not to everyone. Would it be absurd to compare his novels to the music of The Smiths here? Well, I won't yet, but an analogy is tickling the back of my mind. In this novel the central character is really just a maypole, there to stand in the center while the action and colors swirl all around. Having just received a nasty skull fracture and passed into an uncertain realm outside of normal time, he is confronted in turns by seven women from throughout several centuries of American history with whom he apparently had meaningful and fraught relationships. Nonsensically, since we are clearly not in normal physical and temporal space here, each woman begins her story with an attempt to kill him, which provides some good fun. Their stories make up the majority of the novel\u2026 the realist melancholy married to the framework of absurd whimsy, the combination I so enjoy."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1347210-kelly", "userReview": "It's been a few weeks and I still cannot fully express how much I loved this book and why.

Ein Gl\u00fcck ist der \u00e4ltere Mann da und verhindert dies, ehe er mit beruhigenden Worten auf die Frauen einspricht die dann eine nach der anderen ihre Geschichte erz\u00e4hlt..Die Gestaltung des Buches gef\u00e4llt mir unglaublich gut, zu mal es f\u00fcr mich auch irgendwie das Wesen des Buches einf\u00e4ngt, wenn ich es mal so ausdr\u00fccken darf. :)Ich war wahrlich gespannt auf dieses Buch und habe mir wirklich viel davon versprochen, auch wenn ich doch ein bisschen skeptisch war ob ein Buch mit mehreren kleineren Geschichten in einer gro\u00dfen Geschichte funktionieren wird.Tats\u00e4chlich habe ich mir da aber umsonst Gedanken drum gemacht, denn ich fand die Idee wirklich wahnsinnig originell und das ganze Buch hat so f\u00fcr mich eine Besonderheit bekommen, die mich wirklich gefangen hat. Nat\u00fcrlich gab es unter den Geschichten die ein oder andere die mein Interesse weniger f\u00fcr sich gewinnen konnte als die anderen, dennoch war auch hier f\u00fcr mich jede Besorgnis unbegr\u00fcndet, da die einzelnen Schicksale der Frauen f\u00fcr mich einfach wundervolle Abenteuer waren.Die nicht nur unterhaltsam waren sondern vor allem aufzeigten wie schwierig es als Frau in den verschiedenen Epochen der Menschheit war und mich demnach auch einfach ber\u00fchrt haben.Alle Frauen hatten sie eines gemein, ein Mann in ihren Leben das ihr Leben aus der Bann geworfen hat.Ihre Ankunft in Jacks Badezimmer stellt dann eine Art Abbrechnung da, denn sie geben ihm die Schuld an dem \u00dcbel das ihnen im Leben wiederfahren ist.Dennoch ist ihre Feindseligkeit eher am\u00fcsant und auch nicht wirklich ernst zu nehmen, auch wenn ein Mordversuch den sie ja alle versuchen doch sehr brutal klingen mag.Letztendlich sind sie aber nicht da um sich zu r\u00e4chen und das ist es was f\u00fcr Jack so aufregend ist,d enn f\u00fcr ihn ist das ein Prozess des Erkennens.Was die einzelnen Geschichten der Damen ebenfalls ausgemacht haben, war die Mystik die sie beinhalteten. Sie sind nicht durch und durch realistisch, es geschehen Dinge die sich nicht unbedingt erkl\u00e4ren lassen, die aber zu den damaligen Zeiten und deren Sagen, Mythen ect. passen.Ganz besonders hat mir die Geschichte zu Anfang begeistern k\u00f6nnen, da gehts um eine Indianerin, die sich der Einfachheits wegen Dolly nennt, ihre Geschichte war von allen so die abstrakteste und in der geht es um sie und ihren Mann der die F\u00e4higkeit besitzt sich in einen B\u00e4ren zu verwandeln und das ist f\u00fcr sein Stamm ganz \u00fcblich, denn in der Regel leben sie ihr Leben auch als B\u00e4r.Das war f\u00fcr mich eine sehr m\u00e4rchenhafte Geschichte, kein M\u00e4rchen das alles nur sch\u00f6n redet sondern durchaus irgendwie brutal, aber ohne, dass es direkt so dargestellt wurde. ;)Ebenso toll fand ich auch die Geschichte von Marie, die in Zeiten der Sklaverei lebt und nat\u00fcrlich schwarz ist. Auch wenn es hier unnat\u00fcrliche Elemente gab, war sie doch dennoch realistisch, aber einfach f\u00fcr mich sehr interessant, da ich die Zeit um die Sklaverei generell mag. Auch wenn es eine sehr heftige und unmenschliche Zeit war.Ich fand insgesamt die Vielfalt an Epochen sehr sch\u00f6n, da ist einfach f\u00fcr jeden Geschmack was bei uns die Erz\u00e4hlweise ist einfach sehr besonders.Auf das Ende vom Buch war ich letztendlich wirklich sehr gespannt, auch wenn ich mir diesbez\u00fcglich nat\u00fcrlich meine Vorstellungen gemacht hatte und wie soll ich sagen, letztendlich konnte ich das ganze dann doch ganz gut voraus sehen, was ich allerdings nicht schlimm fand, da ich das als das perfekte Ende empfunden habe. :)Ein wirklich ungew\u00f6hnliches Buch, das mich auch nachhaltig begeistern konnte und mich rundum mit seiner originellen Art befl\u00fcgelt hat. F\u00fcr mich ein ganz besonderes Buch. :)"}, {"userName": "Cornelia Franke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13582407-cornelia-franke", "userReview": "Cover & Titel: Schlichter als im englischen Original, aber dennoch passend f\u00fcr den Inhalt, der sich \u00e4hnlich wie auf dem Bild in einer Blase, fernab von Realit\u00e4t und Gegenwart abspielt. Daf\u00fcr finde ich den Titel einfach toll gew\u00e4hlt, jede der acht Frauen erz\u00e4hlt ihre Geschichte, beginnend oder enden im Sommermonat Juni.Figuren: Jacks Figur beginnt nichtssagend und vielleicht habe ich mir deshalb so schwer getan, mich an ihn zu gew\u00f6hnen. Das Buch beginnt mit seinem Sturz im Badezimmer, der Leser sieht Jack also nie in seinem wirklichen Leben agieren, sondern nur in der Traumblase, in der die acht Frauen und Beckett ihn aufsuchen. Er tritt sozusagen in den Hintergrund, l\u00e4sst sich indirekt charakterisieren, da jede Frau ein St\u00fcck seiner Seele widerspiegelt. Die Frauen jedoch sind einmalig. Sei es die junge Indianerin, das Baseballm\u00e4dchen oder stolze Goldw\u00e4scherin. Wild, leidenschaftlich, treu, ehrgeizig. Und obwohl sie nur kurz und epidosenhaft ihre Leben wiedergeben, konnte ich sie beim Lesen greifen. Jedes Schicksal empfand ich mit, Donohue schaffte es trotz der wenigen Worte, die er f\u00fcr die einzelnen Frauen \u00fcbrig hatte, ihre Geschichte lebhaft zu zeichnen. Danach glaubte ich die Frauen und die Epochen und Jahrzehnte, aus denen sie stammten, zu kennen und zu verstehen, sann einen Moment \u00fcber ihre traurigen Erlebnisse nach.Lob & Kritik: Klappe und Cover haben in mir andere Erwartungen geweckt, gerade das W\u00f6rtchen \u201cZeitreise\u201d hat mich auf eine falsche F\u00e4hrte gelockt. Deswegen hatte ich auf den ersten hundert Seiten Probleme, in den Text zu finden, eigentlich mag ich keine Episodengeschichten. Weder im Film noch als Buch. Doch Donohue entwickelt mit den Seiten einen solchen Sogeffekt, obwohl die Figuren sich gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils in einem Badezimmer aufhalten, ich konnte das Buch nicht zur Seite legen. Ich wollte wissen, was sich hinter den anderen Frauen verbirgt, was mit Jack geschehen ist. Die Sprache war so unglaublich fl\u00fcssig! Verschachtelt, wunderlich, poetisch, aber klug und stilistisch sehr gut verfasst. Auf kleinsten Raum ballen sich die Lasten vieler Leben, Leid, Traurigkeit, Freude, Hoffnung, Liebe, doch wirkt es nicht gestellt oder erzwungen. Im Gegenteil die Erz\u00e4hlungen sind von Weisheit und Intelligenz gepr\u00e4gt, sowie einer guten Prise absurden Humors. Und gerade diese Absurdit\u00e4ten, Magie, \u00fcbergro\u00dfe Eisb\u00e4lle, Gold waschen in der Badewanne, diese phantastischen Raum-Zeit-Verzerrungen machen \u201cSommernachtsfrauen\u201d aus, es ist nicht immer von Spannung gepr\u00e4gt, aber beim Lesen konnte ich mir nie sicher sein, was als n\u00e4chstes passiert. Was die Figuren neben Coktails noch aus dem Medizinschr\u00e4nkchen fischen. Dieses Buch zu lesen, ist wie einen Dali auseinander zu nehmen.Wenn man das Buch zuklappt, hat man nicht das Gef\u00fchl, es sei zu Ende. So wie Jack beginnt eine neue Runde, ein neuer Abschnitt und das fand ich erstaunlich: dieses Buch hat mich mit einer neuen Sichtweise zur\u00fcckgelassen.Besonders gefallen haben mir au\u00dferdem die Symbole, die sich quer \u00fcber die Seiten verstecken. Die Anspielungen auf Beckett und sein St\u00fcck \u201cWarten auf Godot\u201d oder die sprechende Katze Harpo.Zusammenfassend: Kuiros. Surreal. Magisch. Eines der seltsamsten B\u00fccher, das ich seit Langem gelesen habe. Wie ein Traum im Traum, eigentlich passiert nichts und gleichzeitig passiert zwischen den Zeilen unglaublich viel. Man sagt ja, im Moment des Todes zieht das Leben an einem vorbei, Donohue nimmt es w\u00f6rtlicher, Jack begegnet den Frauen aus seinen vorherigen Leben. Erz\u00e4hlt Geschichten aus dem Allt\u00e4glichen, von den Wundern und den Irrt\u00fcmern des Lebens gepr\u00e4gt. Es ist ein leises Buch, aber nichtsdetotrotz phantastisch. Daher vergebe ich f\u00fcr \u201cSommernachtsfrauen\u201d 4 von 5 m\u00f6glichen Sternen"}, {"userName": "Gladys McGuillicutty", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/605398-gladys-mcguillicutty", "userReview": "A couple of weeks ago I was contacted by Crown Publishers to review Centuries of June by Keith Donohue. Although Mr. Donohue has published two other novels, The Stolen Child and Angels of Destruction, I was not familiar with him. I am always thrilled and excited to read new authors so I readily accepted. It is difficult in this age of instant gratification and self publishing to find original and intriguing stories. You know how it is you pick up a book and start reading an instantly know you have read this story before except instead of Miami it was set in Milan and instead of the protagonist being Joe its Juan. Oh honestly I don\u2019t blame the authors, especially if they are avid readers, it\u2019s just a natural progress to begin incorporating other stories within your own. Not so with this story. He did incorporate other stories but he made them his own by entwining them into his own tale.I began reading Centuries of June by Keith Donohue and immediately the movie began playing in my mind. I love it when an author can create a story so vivid I loose all sense of space and time and this is exactly what Mr. Donohue accomplished I had instantly cast each player as they appeared and I could see in my mind\u2019s eye the whole scene play out. A young man struck in the head and the 7 women who visit him through his stupefied state. The old man who protected and helped him through the journeys of his mind and who and what was he really? Each visit opened more questions with little resolve, each ghostly and beautiful visitor adding to the mystery as well as the question as to why our main character was bludgeoned in his own bathroom. The more you read the more you try to decipher who the old man is and why is he there, why are these women all trying to kill our poor architect and who is the woman asleep in the bed facing the wall.Mr. Donohue\u2019s writing style kept me turning the page and his story kept me enthralled. His dark humor and storytelling abilities kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the punch-line. He took me into that cold tiled bathroom and then carried me from primeval forests of the pacific northwest through the gold rush and on into the early 20th century reminding me of the pain and suffering women have lived through to give me the freedoms I have today. More importantly he told the story of the man\u2019s own insecurity and strife.I thoroughly enjoyed my romp through the centuries with Mr. Donohue and his rough and primal ghosts. I highly recommend this to those with an adventurous spirit and an open mind."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5167317-sally", "userReview": "Centuries of June by Keith Donohue\tIt sorely grieved me to put this book down after turning the last page. It is as captivating and enthralling as Keith Donohue\u2019s first book, The Stolen Child. Donohue is a master storyteller, and he proves it yet again in this latest book. His talent is evident through his use of language, weaving a tale that keeps the reader spellbound.\tCenturies of June begins in the narrator\u2019s bathroom, which is the main stage for the central plot and all the subplots. His use of language, both high and low, allow the reader to understand the various points-of-view, as told through the voices of the many women the narrator encounters throughout the novel. Donohue easily transforms the small lavatory into a theatre of stars, some of whom are recognizable from history and some who are not. \tDonohue\u2019s characters vary from the earthy to the sophisticated, but are never simplistic. Their personalities are individualistic, but connected to each other. Their interactions allow them to come to life, fully formed. Each has a story to tell, and through those stories, the reader thus comes to understand the raconteur with all his idiosyncrasies. What ties the subplots together is the relationship of each to the narrator, who seems as clueless as the audience. Together, the reader and the narrator, learn the lessons and histories of a man who is searching to understand his own place in the world, a world that has lost all meaning. Only by traveling over time and space, within the confines of one room, the bath, can he hope to find out who he is, where he belongs, and why he exists. One wonders if he will find his path, or will he be too late? \tKeith Donohue has once again woven a tale of intrigue, action, and empathy into a masterful novel, which is sure to please almost any reader. There is action and mystery behind every character, which is only divulged as each one tells her account of the circumstances of her life. The reader will fall in love with the individuals and the obstacles they encounter, finding satisfaction in the conclusions the chronicler draws from them.\tIt was a pleasure to spend time with Donohue\u2019s characters, getting to know them with an intimacy that many authors struggle to find. The author seems to convey that familiarity with ease. He draws from a sense of confidence which is transmitted through the voices of his characters\u2019 personae. Bravo, Keith! This is another well-written and excellently scripted novel to captivate and capture the audience\u2019s attention. What a lovely read."}, {"userName": "J.M.

It is the middle of the night and Harry finds himself on the bathroom floor with a hole in the back of his head. When he gets up off the floor, he faces an old man who seems very familiar and yet he cannot place how he knows the old man. One good thing about the old man is that he keeps a Tlingit woman from bashing in Harry's skull. In order to explain why, Yeikoo.shk tells a story about her husband, a man who could transform into a bear. Although Harry cannot understand why his watch, why all the clocks in his house, have stopped at the same time, he has more trouble understanding why the old man and the women, each of whom tries to hit him in the head with some lethal object, are in his bathroom. Harry thought the seven bicycles on his lawn when he arrived home that day was strange, as were the eight women in his bed, but seven women intent on killing him and then telling their stories in his bathroom is the first volley of strange. There is so much more to come.It is hard to decide what to make of Keith Donohue intends with his latest novel. While it is entertaining, Centuries of June is also confusing. Is the novel a psychological thriller, a whodunit, or a story about the way men hurt and disappoint women through the ages? There is really no way to tell. To add more confusion, what is the old man\u2019s purpose and why is he so interested in Harry\u2019s tale of the seven bicycles or in keeping Harry from being smashed in the head? While the motive of the story remains hidden, one thing is obvious\u2014Donohue knows how to write an engrossing tale. In this case, he pens nine engrossing tales. Each of the women is a complete individual and engaging in her own homicidal way, not that they do not have issue with men, and obviously with Harry. I was as confused as I was enchanted and enthralled by Donohue\u2019s tales, and therein lies part of the problem. The writing is excellent, an effortless and easy read with a dark heart\u2014seven dark hearts\u2014and Harry\u2019s situation completely draws the reader in. The payoff comes at the end of the novel with one last story, another tale set in June in a woman\u2019s life, a woman who was part of the tangle of bodies on Harry\u2019s beds and she knows Harry intimately. Centuries of June is an elaborately wrapped package with a marvelous Easter egg at the center of a complex knot of emotions and motives and regret, and it is well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Debra Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3767288-debra-martin", "userReview": "Copy provided by Goldberg McDuffie Communications, NYC.CENTURIES OF JUNE is the story of one man\u2019s journey when he\u2019s confronted with haphazardness of life. The book opens with a man, we later learn his name is Jack, who somehow falls in the bathroom and hits his head. From an awkward position on the bathroom floor, he watches helplessly as \u201ca scarlet river seeped into the grout.\u201d It is a compelling opening and I was curious to see what the author would offer up next. Mr. Donahue tells an intriguing and engaging tale. Jack is no longer on the floor with a hole in his head, but healed and wearing a bathrobe. He soon discovers that there are 8 women in his bed. He returns to the scene of the fall, and along with an older man he believes to be his father, listens while the women unfold their stories. One by one, the women enter the bathroom and tell tales of love, disappointment, murder and betrayal. Somehow Jack is always at the center of each one even though the stories span centuries in American history. It is this personal connection with each story that keeps the reader reeled in. Add into the mix a dash of humor and a talking cat named Harpo and you have part dream sequence, fantasy and mythology all rolled into one.While I found each story entertaining and unique, the book meanders along. There is no careening toward a climax, but instead the author takes the reader on a wonderful ride. I found I could put the book down between stories and it took me longer than usual to read it. However, the eighth and final story is the most compelling of all and a great twist to the book. This is the story you cannot put down and must read to its unexpected conclusion.I thoroughly enjoyed CENTURIES OF JUNE and would recommend it to those who love to be entertained by a story with a good twist.

I do not think Waiting for Godot is funny.In fact Samuel Beckett can just go pound salt in general. Bleah. (But, the author of THIS book liked him, and I can almost understand why). This was done just right.It was funny and ethereal, all characters except one are perfectly cozy, happy and friendly (after the initial murder attempts, of course-all of which the affable old man who looks like the protagonist's dead father but probably isn't thwarts) stuck in their little bathroom together. Seven women enter and stay, each from a different time period of American history, each with a story to tell of how she was wronged by some man who couldn't control his desires, whether greed, sloth, or wrath. These is one more woman, but her story is not like the others. These short historical fiction stories (my fave) are all superbly fitted under the umbrella of the bigger story, why is this man wandering around a house that used to be his but is sublty changing, why can his cat talk now, and who IS that rouge-ish old man that is charmingly guiding him through the easily extinguished anger of all these women?
