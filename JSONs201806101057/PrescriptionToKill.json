Joan Murdock, a first-year Neurosurgical resident, finds herself thrown into mysterious deaths that she is trying to figure out. First one of her patients, that had no apparent life threatening symptoms, mysteriously dies. Then her best friend Ree dies during a cocktail party after confiding a disturbing story to Joan. Suspicious, Joan plays detective and enlists the help of the Medical Examiner and the police. Not long after, dead bodies start piling up and Joan fears for her own safety.I enjoyed how the author gave a brief character synopsis at the beginning of the book: each character, their familial and professional background and age. It helped me to get a feel for each character as I was reading the story. An issue that I thought could have used a bit of tweaking was the flow, especially in the beginning. One paragraph would be in the present, and the next paragraph would be a character\u2019s past story, without some type of segue. I found myself getting a big confused by this. The formatting was a bit off; page breaks where there should not have been and some punctuation errors that made the reading distracting at times. However, it could have been because of the e-format but in general, I do recommend this book for those who love a good mystery. Overall I did enjoy the book and the surprise twist at the end was something I did not see coming.

It's a medical mystery/thriller. There are 17 characters and medical terminology to combat but not as hard of a read as expected. The story takes place in Texas. Joan Murdock is a first-year Neurosurgery resident. Dr. Blaine Wilmot, Joan's uncle, is Chief of Neurosurgery. Anne-Marie Pierce (aka Ree) is Joan's good friend and also a first-year Neurosurgery resident. William (aka Bill) Marshall Beck Jr. and Joan have a rekindle of sorts and is also a first-year Neurosurgery resident. (There are many other characters. Luckily, there is a character list at the beginning of the book.)The lot get mixed up into trouble when Ree finds out about Dr. Wilmot's secret. Out of fear that Ree might tell someone, Dr. Wilmot takes drastic actions. Joan becomes a detective and finds out more than she ever bargained for. Murder, mystery and mayhem!I first thought the book would be daunting with all of the characters and medical terminology. Once I got into the story, I couldn't put the book down! There are lots of twists and turns. If you love TV shows like E.R., Grey's Anatomy, House, etc., this is the book for you.There are a dozen or so errors in my copy of the book. I notified the publisher about them. As I was told, it's up to the author to accept the editing. While I loved the story, the editing mistakes were disheartening (more so if I had paid the cover price).

The author used the character\u2019s name in one sentence and then in the very next sentence she would use the woman instead of the character\u2019s name. The story was easy to follow and there is even some medical information that is easy to follow. Blaine and Ree were having an affair and Ree (a first-year Neurosurgery resident) discovered that Blaine (Chief of Neurosurgery) had an addicted to Meperidine and was writing prescriptions so he could get the drug without getting caught. Blaine tries to kill Ree in their motel room but she recovers. A patient dies without reason! Ree keeps getting gifts from Blaine and has a dinner party for her friends and dies. Ree\u2019s best friend Joan is determined to find the killer and Joan is Blaine\u2019s niece, who believes her uncle is the killer. While reading this book I was sure I know who the killer was, but I was totally wrong! I loved the ending.

I could not put this book down because the characters are doctors and it is a mystery. I have never read a book like this before and now I am hooked on them. I loved the characters and I was sad when one of the main characters gets killed. I was also rooting for her best friend to figure out who killed her. Now I knew the main person they thought killed her didn't do it but I couldn't figure out who really did it. Every chapter when they found out something new I would change who I thought did it but I never would have figured out who really did it. After I found out who did it I just sat there in shock because I never would have guessed in 100 years that they did it. I also loved how the author wrote a little bit about most of the main characters right at the beginning so you would know a little about them and also so you can go back and look at them if you forget who someone is and how they tie into the story.I can't any enough good things about this book! Everyone needs to read this book! Go here and pick the book up you won't regret it!FTC-I received \"Prescription To Kill\" from Dorrance Publishing Co, Inc for me to review.

The first chapter opens with a man and a woman in a hotel room. The entire chapter is then dedicated to the woman reflecting on how she met the man. Another chapter with lots of action turns out to be a dream, which, as a reader, I find irritating. Sellers varies between calling her characters by name and referring to them as \"the neurosurgeon\", \"the young woman\", and \"the internist\". This kept me at a distance from the characters and their story. It was more like reading a newspaper article than getting lost in a novel. Parts of the book read like a medical text and, while I realize it is a medical mystery, I don't want to read a novel with content that requires constant dry explanation from the author. ** I received a complimentary copy of Prescription to Kill as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team.

In the beginning of the book, there is a small glimpse of the cast of characters. I found myself during the book flipping to the front to see who they were again. In some parts of the story the author refers to them by name, and other parts they are referred to as their title (i.e \"the neurosurgeon\", etc) I found that I couldn't connect with any of the characters or the story itself.
