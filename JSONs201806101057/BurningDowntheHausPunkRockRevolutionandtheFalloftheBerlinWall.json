It hit a bunch of my sweet spots: history as viewed through a specific lens, particularly events that happened in my adult lifetime, and early punk rock. In this case, as the title would indicate, the book focuses on the fall of the Berlin wall and what part was played by the early punk movement in the DDR and eastern Europe, from 1981 through 1989. Mohr has good sources in addition to opened Stasi records, which he admits are pretty dry, and his narrative is very engaging\u2014he's obviously making sure his voice matches up to the subject, without falling into total inarticulacy, so lots of short sharp sentences, sometimes repeated like song choruses, and plenty of profanity. As someone who was involved in the downtown NYC punk scene starting in roughly 1981, I was fascinated by the contrast. Note that I ID what I was part of as a scene, rather than a movement\u2014it may have stemmed from adolescent (and post-adolescent) rebellion and a dislike of conformity on my end, but it didn't carry the same kind of life-and-death charter\u2014no one I knew was going to jail for their beliefs (other than for public intoxication, maybe), or having to dodge police to make the music they wanted to make or attend concerts or marches. So even though I know my history and have read a fair amount about the end of the DDR and the Communist regime at the time, this was an interesting filter to drive home the import of what a lot of young people were dealing with there and then. It also sparked a wave of nostalgia, and I stayed up too late last night Googling photos of punks in the early 80s East Village and falling down a few where-are-they-now rabbit holes."}], "description": "\u201cIn case you weren\u2019t sure just how political music, fashion, and a certain attitude can be: read this book. Burning Down the Haus is wonderful.\u201d\u2014Norman Ohler, author of Blitzed \u201cThe true story of how teenage kicks turned into political opposition. With meticulous research and impassioned prose, Tim Mohr brings to life the saga of a bunch of East German punk rock kids who broke the state that wanted to break them.\u201d\u2014Claire Dederer, author of Love and TroubleSAY IT, SPEAK IT, SHOUT IT OUT LOUD! It began with a handful of East Berlin teens who heard the Sex Pistols on a British military radio broadcast to troops in West Berlin in 1980, and it ended with the collapse of the East German dictatorship. Punk rock was a life-changing discovery. The buzz-saw guitars, the messed-up clothing and hair, the rejection of society and the DIY approach to building a new one: In their gray surroundings, where everyone\u2019s future was preordained by some communist apparatchik, punk represented a revolutionary philosophy\u2014quite literally, as it turned out. \u00a0 But as the East German punks became more numerous, more visible, and more rebellious, security forces\u2014including the dreaded secret police, the Stasi\u2014targeted them. They were spied on by friends and even members of their own families; they were expelled from schools and jobs; they were beaten by police and imprisoned. Instead of backing down, the punks fought back, playing an indispensable role in the underground movements that helped bring down the Berlin Wall. \u00a0 The story of East German punk rock is about much more than music; it is a story of extraordinary bravery in the face of one of the most oppressive regimes in history. Rollicking, cinematic, deeply researched, highly readable, and thrillingly topical, Burning Down the Haus brings to life the young men and women who successfully fought authoritarianism three chords at a time\u2014and is a fiery testament to the irrepressible spirit of resistance.", "title": "Burning Down the Haus: Punk Rock, Revolution, and the Fall of the Berlin Wall", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746140-burning-down-the-haus", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523866965l/38746140.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2774867.Tim_Mohr", "name": "Tim Mohr"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2774867.Tim_Mohr", "name": "Tim Mohr"}], "type": ["Music", "Nonfiction", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746140-burning-down-the-haus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34877863-stirb-nicht-im-warteraum-der-zukunft", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19314372-hier-ist-berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423587-burning-down-the-haus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2914683-feuchtgebiete", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7803810-broken-glass-park", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
