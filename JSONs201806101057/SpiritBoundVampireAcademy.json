If you're feeling something for Dimitri that's confusing you, tell me. We'll work it out.\u201d This book is like magic! I loved it once again! I loved the characters and I loved the action!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's start from the beginning:1)I loved the letters Dimitri sent to Rose! I know it was threats but I loved it!\n\n\"It\u2019s a shame, because if I could dream, I know I\u2019d dream about you. I\u2019d dream about the way you smell and how your dark hair feels like silk between my fingers. I\u2019d dream about the smoothness of your skin and the fierceness of your lips when we kiss.\"\n\n2)I love Adrian but he doesn't fit with Rose. She loves Dimitri and I accept that but I don't want her to hurt Adrian! That's not fair!\n\n\u201cBut Rose? While I'm fine with you two dating and being happy, please try not to break his heart too much when the time comes.\u201d \n\nHe is so cute!\n\n\u201cI'm sorry.\"\"Be sorry you lied,\" he said, pressing a kiss to my forehead. \"Don't be sorry you loved him. That's part of you, part you have to let go, yeah, but still something that's made you who you are.\u201d\n\nHe is also a little bit crazy!\n\u201cDreams, dreams. I walk them; I live them. I delude myself with them. It's a wonder I can spot reality anymore.\u201d  3) I don't know how Eddie agrees to break Victor out of his prison. He sacrifices everything for his friends. I really admire him!4)Abe! Abe! Abe! I love that man! He is amazing!\n\n\u201cMost fathers don't threaten to disembowel their daughter's boyfriends.\"\"That's not true. And anyway, that's not what I actually said. It was much worse.\u201d\n\nPoor Adrian :(5)I hate Victor but I don't know how I feel about Robert! He seems so lost. But he gave us important information about the stake charmed with spirit! After we learnt what we wanted, they escaped!6)I loved Lissa's and Christian's teamwork to learn how to stub a Strigoi! And thank god Lissa learnt! And Lissa and Christian together forever!!!!!!7)DIMITRI IS NOT A STRIGOI ANYMORE!!!YEAHHHHH!! I felt so happy .. I cried again... and then I was angry because Dimitri felt guilty and pushed Rose away! He can't forgive himself for what he did to her..Not only that but he adores Lissa!!! Rose went through hell and back to save Dimitri and he just pushed her away!8)Rose was so hurt that Dimitri rejected her and she turn to Adrian for comfort! TERRIBLE MISTAKE!I will admit that I loved the scene that almost had sex and he end up drink from her!9)Queen Tatiana is dead and Rose is the number 1 suspect because Tatiana was found with Rose's stake!10)Tatiana's letter!\n\"Vasilisa needs her spot on the Council, and it can be done. She is not the last Dragomir. Another lives, the illegitimate child of Eric Dragomir. I know nothing else, but if you can find this son or daughter, you will give Vasilisa the power she deserves.

Yes-yes, I am in a minority here, but it won't be the first time, nor the last. Spirit Bound is a bad book and I am contemplating to remove Richelle Mead from the list of the authors whose writing I care to follow. She can join my black list next to Beth Fantaskey and Maria V. Snyder. I was willing to give VA another chance after the disappointment Blood Promise was, but no more, this series is taking its path into oblivion along with Richelle's Georgina Kincaid books. Mead just can't produce this mediocre mess, destroy her characters for the sake of cheap relationship melodrama and contrived \"love triangles\" and expect me to eat it up. No, thanks.Now, for the good. We are back to the cast of characters we came to love in the first 3 books - Eddie, Mia, Christian (As I expected reading Blood Promise, almost none of the million characters introduced in it are back, they have served their filler purpose and now dead and gone). Lissa comes into her own powers and is an admirable person now. Lissa's and Christian's relationship is back on track, which is great because I still have no idea why they broke up in the first place.Now, for the bad. Where do I start? How about, the only feelings Spirit Bound was able to elicit in me were boredom and mild annoyance? It is surprising how a book so action-packed can be so thoroughly boring. A lot of things happen in it - Rose takes her final pre-graduation trials, she steals important prison files, she breaks into a maximum security vamp prison, then there is a final altercation with Dimitri. But just like in the latest installment of Mead's Georgina Kincaid series, these events are glossed over, everything happens without much effort, there is no tension build-up before each and every one of them, the characters don't experience too many obstacles and therefore there is no real feeling of something important happening.Also, the highest point of the book happens at about 300-page mark. What comes after is just added-on drama that comes out of nowhere (is Richelle paid per page?). I just can't believe that this kind of story is what Mead had pre-planned for the series (according to her, she plots her series in advance). If I knew that's the shape the series would take, I wouldn't have bothered to read Vampire Academy.Another thing. What kind of relationship do Rose and Adrian have? It's not only unhealthy, it's just wrong. What Mead has achieved with it is that now I am all on board with Rose/Adrian pairing in the end (I used to be a Team Dimitri girl), but not because I like Adrian now, but because they would make a mighty good couple: Rose can fantasize about Dimitri while blood-whoring with Adrian (he seems to be just fine with his status of sloppy seconds/doormat) and Adrian can get drunk, continue spending his daddy's money and drag Rose around to parties to get a kick out of his parents and get Rose humiliated by Moroi snobs. What a pair they make! Then there is Rose's inconsistent behavior (one minute she wants to kill Dimitri, another she will do anything to save him; one moment she is in love with Dimitri, another she is getting it on with Adrian), deus-ex machina (Mikhail anyone? how convenient!); redundant conversations; masked party (what was the point?); miraculous prison break, etc., etc...I can go on and on with this tirade, but honestly, why? I think I am done with this series. For all I care, the entire cast of characters can die (well, they are sort of already dead to me due to the author's \"skillful treatment\") and I won't blink an eye. Why, oh why did I buy previous installments? There is no chance I will ever re-read them!"}, {"userName": "Emma Giordano", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30604861-emma-giordano", "userReview": "You know you've read a good book when you turn the final page so ready to start the next chapter but instead you find the acknowledgements and audibly scream \"WHAT THE FUCK?!\""}, {"userName": "Jessica's Totally Over The Top Book Obsession", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28967089-jessica-s-totally-over-the-top-book-obsession", "userReview": "4 Restored Stars\nSpoilersSpirit Bound, the 5th book in the Vampire Academy series, was a good read, but it was a bit slow. On top of the slow down in the book Rose was with Adrian and that bugged me. Rose loved Dimitri yet she was kissing and almost having sex with Adrian. It made her seem fickle. I liked Adrian but I don't want him with Rose. Then there was the fact that the whole time she was with Adrian she was telling Dimitri that she loves him and wants them to be together again. I mean I can get that Rose liked Adrian, he is sexy and sweet, but she should have stayed away from him until she was sure her and Dimitri were over. Dimitri was so depressed in this book. I can totally understand his guilt over all the things he did as strigoi. My heart broke that Dimitri kept pushing Rose away. Overall this book was good but I would have like more Rose and Dimitri time.

The character of Rose, for me, takes a huge hit in this installment. Spirit Bound is fairly well written. The pacing is pretty good in that you don't have an opportunity to get bored. There are three points in the book that I really feel SHOULD have received far more attention and detail than they should:Rose's exam, Victor's rescue (What shall be hereto referred to from now on as the stupidest act performed by Rose. Ever.) and the battle with Dimitri.There are many things in this book that I wish hadn't received quite so much attention, such as parties, family visits and general faffing about (To use another strange colloquialism)Despite that, the book is great - except I'd really like to strangle Rose. Really.I wouldn't necessarily consider myself Team Dimitri or Team Adrian. I may lean towards Adrian a little but her obsession for Dimitri makes me think that she's nowhere near good enough for him and therefor should stay with Dimitri AND DIE!How am I supposed to respect a heroine who uses her boyfriend's credit card to pay for her trip to Vegas with friends? Not to mention the money that she had already swindled from him to finance her little trip through Serbia! Then what was with her running around loudly declaring her love to Dimitri WHILE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DATING ADRIAN?Seriously. I just wanted to smack her. Dimitri wasn't much better. As my little computer gaming brother would say - Less QQ and more PewPew. Other characters were awesome and well written. it ended on the most horrible cliff hanger and I'm considering starting a petition to make it illegal for authors to finish on such a very tense note!Over all, it's a a much better read than Blood Promises. There were aspects of this book that annoyed me but I really enjoyed reading it regardless and now I'm eagerly awaiting the sixth and final installment."}, {"userName": "Shelly Farez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2866455-shelly-farez", "userReview": "heres for u people 2 enjoy found itVampire Academy 5 - Spirit BoundAuthor -- -- Richelle MeadChapter OneLissa stared at the letter in shock. But not as much shock as me. I memorized the letter the Dimitri wrote me.You forgot another lesson: Never turn your back until you know your enemyis dead. Looks like we'll have to go over the lesson again the next timeI see you-which will be soon.Love, DThe words were strapped into my head and they weren't moving anywhere. The words 'Which shall be soon' kept on running through my head. Like a fish that's stuck on a hook. I paced around the room frantically, hoping for something to come to my head. The stake was still in my hands and was starting to get really sweaty.\"Rose! Are you even listening to me? I mean, what are we going to do!?\" She was freaking more then me. \"I don't want you to get hurt. Please. I need to help.\"Her words sunk into me. Giving me no choice but to bring her with me. My mind blew up with questions when my thought was decided. What if she got hurt? What about killed? What if her spirit starts to take over her again? What if starts to take over me? My head start to hurt. It isn't natural for a girl like me to think this much.\"Rose!\" She yelled in my face. \"Talk. Let it out. Dont keep everything inside. I know you dont want me to control you're life, but you have had that same facial expression for almost 2 minutes straight and thats not normal,\" She pleaded. \"You're scaring me.\"\"Jeez, what are you? My therapist\" I told her.She gave me a sincere smile since i changed my expression and spoke out loud. However, i still needed time to think, so i just sat on her bed and dug my face into my hands hoping for her to understand. Her response was to sit by me and wrap her arm around me. Close enough.I cant just bring Lissa alone. I would bring my mom. Maybe. But if i said even a word about leaving the academy again, she would lock me in my room. So mom is definitely off the list. Uhmmm, Christian? Nope, there fighting anyways and i do NOT want to lose my concentration if those two are arguing. Damn. I can think of anyone. I'll think of someone later.\"Alright, Liss, you can come with me,\" I told her. \"But, i don't want any questions about it right now. I'm still not even sure im going yet,\" Which i- we, probably are. \"But for now, i think im going to stay at the academy.\"\"Lissa's eyes flew up with a huge grin across her face like a 5 year old on Christmas morning. \"Oh, Rose! You have no idea on how much i missed you!\" She squealed\"Alright Liss,\" I laughed. \"I need to go and talk to Alberta and enroll into this hell school again.\"This going to just like when me and Lissa came back to St. Vladamir's before, except this time, I'm facing it alone. Right when i walked out of Lissa's door, eyes turned to me. Oh great, i thought to myself. And so it has begun.The walk to the office was totally akward. I saw some faces i knew stare at me. Like the girls that Lissa hung out with when she was going through her crazy phase with spirit. Then i saw Christian look at me like i was some ghost that came back from the grave. I mean, he was staring at me like when in movie some kid that randomly stares at you and then a second later they hit a wall or fall into a trash can, but no. There was no trash can. Making that expression stay on his face.But it wasn't just Christian, it was everyone. They were staring at me with same confused and surprised expression. Except for Mia. Mia was standing there with a grin slapped onto her face, she walked up to me, which everyone of her other friends were to scared to do.Mia's blond curls bounced as she walked toward me. Her grin was still placed on her face. Me and Mia have been on okay terms now ever since Mason died. I gues you could call us friends.\"Hey Rose, havent seen you in a while,\" She smiled. \"How has it been?\"\"Uhmm good?\" Me and Mia may not hate each other, but that doesn't mean i like her enough to trust her.She just gave me one of her smiles and left. Guess she had nothing to start gossip about. Good, i thought.When i reached Alberta's, old but, again, new office, she was sitting in her desk reading something on her computer. When she looked up and saw me she waved me to come and sit down.\"So Rose? Have you decieded yet?\" She smiled at me.\"Yup. I'm going to stay. But have you talked to anyone about putting me back in line to be Lissa's guardian?\" I asked.\"That's wonderful Rose,\" Then she smiled, and it wasn't one of her i-feel-bad-for-you smiles. \"And yes, i have Rose. I see that you are wearing you're hair up today and almost everyone has noticed the marks on you're neck. After seeing how well you do, they have decided to give you're position as Lissa's guardian back. However, you must remain at the academy.\"\"Really?! It was that easy!\" I cheered. \"Thank you SO much Alberta!\"With that i walked out of the room. Then i saw the perfect person to take with Lissa and I at the end of the year. I walked up to him on put on my sly grin. He was already smiling before i even started to walk.Spirit Bound -- chapter 2\"Rose Hathaway is asking me, Adrian, to help assist her?\" Adrian smirked.My smile was long gone by now and this converstation was really starting to turn out more annoything then i thought. \"How many times do i have to go over this. You. Are. Coming. With. Me. And. Lissa. To. Kill. Dimitri.\"\"Wait. I thought you told Alberta, that you;re staying until you graduate?\" He questioned.\"I am.\"\"What if he gets here before you and Lissa graduate? He might bring a whole army by the sounds of what you did to him,\" He smirked.I ignored that second part not wanting to get the thought in my head. \"You think i havent considered that? It's just that i cant make Lissa leave. Not now at least.\"\"So, leave her behind.\"\"This coming from the guy who was actually begging me to come back to Lissa because i left her.\"He didnt have a reply. Good, i thought.\"Well, i said i would come,\" was his reply.\"Uhmm, no. No, you didnt say anything, yet,\" I smirked with a wink. That outta' get his attention.\"Hmm,\" He started. \"I guess that queen Tatina wouldnt mind a responsible adult taking care of her apperntice, So, i guess i should come.\"\"You? Responsible? Thats rich,\" I laughed. \"But good. You're a go.\" Lets just hope Dimitri doesnt come before then.He just smiled, excused himself and went to go find Lissa for there sunday lessons. Since i was going to be doing things like i used to, before i left i thought i should go to church. For old times sake.The walk to the chapel was worse to the walk to Albertas office. Maybe i should go to my room, i thought. No. Im going to have to have to face this sooner or later, and sooner is way better. People were going to ask how my journey went, so instead of telling them i tied up my hair into a bun showing my marks. The second my mark was visible, i heard people gasp. Jeez, wannabes, i thought to myself.\"When i finally reached the church, there was a new priest. Yet somehow, he knew me. \"Rose Hathaway,\" he smiled. \"It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Father Shay, please sit down.\"What happened to the other guy? He was pretty old, but i'll miss him. He gave me the first clue with Lissa and her powers and out bond.I forgot how boring curch was when Father Shay started talking. I remember why i went to church before, to see Lissa. And only Lissa. After another 10 minutes i just tuned my self out.The thing finished about an hour later. I nearly ran out of the chapel, happy to smell the fresh air not some strong vinegar type scent that the priest calls 'holy water'. The air was cool and moist, just the way it was in Russia. THat reminded me, I should call the Belikovs soon to let them know im okay. I might even call Abe because of the good mood im in.I walked back to the dorm, more eyes then before for some strange reason. People were still gasping and making a big fuss over my marks. I thankfully saw Lissa and ran over to her.\"Lissa! Lissa!\" I yelled at her. \"Wait for a second.\"Not that she needed to, i could catch up to her easily as a dhaphir.\"Rose! How was church?\" She laughed.I shot her the look of death, she remembered how much i hated church. Even though i forgot. \"You know how much i hate church.\" I shot back at her.\"Then why would you go?\" She mused.\"I dont know! People were staring and i saw the chapel and the old priest was so nice- what happened to him anyways?\" Curiosity popped in my head again.\"Rose, he was almost a 100 years old,\" Those eyes were deep and full of sorrow. \"And get this, the new preist is only human. He's not a moroi or dhampir or anyhing. Just human.\"Thats strange, i thought. Why would the academy higher a human priest? Why would a human priest want to talk about history thats not even from his own race? Why would he even want to talk about any history? Liss, probably missed the priest more then me. He helped us so much before we knew about spirit and when she was in the chapel but not in the attic, he would help her inderstand her powers from what he knew.\"That is strange, but he seemed nice enough,\" I said. \"Probably to scared to say anything to us.\"She laughed and rolled her eyes, \" Probably.\""}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "3.5 starsI can't believe I listened to this in one day. 500 pages has never gone by so fast.At this point in the vampire academy series, I'm kinda ready for it to be over.

No contentos con todo el drama de Dimitri, entran ahora en juego dramas con Adrian, con Lissa, con Christian y con conspiradores que ni siquiera tienen cara todav\u00eda, ASDFGHJKL\u00d1. Vampire Academy es esa saga que no deja de mejorar con cada libro que lees, de verdad, las emociones siempre son m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s intensas a medida que vas pasando las p\u00e1ginas. Aunque, s\u00ed, hay que admitirlo, al menos hasta el quinto, el pico dram\u00e1tico de sufrimiento y fangirleo es el tercero, Shadow Kiss. Ahora, este, Promesa de Sangre, tiene un tinte de emociones completamente diferentes y m\u00e1s oscuras. Adem\u00e1s, a diferencia del anterior, que se centra en ser un libro con poqu\u00edsima acci\u00f3n y con mucha carga emocional, este tiene acci\u00f3n e intrigas por doquier. No nos quedamos cortos en peleas contra strigoi, en intrigas de la Corte Moroi, en conspiraciones que afectan incluso a los alquimistas y en manipulaciones, asesinatos y planes macabros que hacen que Rose quede en un precipicio al final del libro. Como para los perdidos, este quinto libro de Vampire Academy empieza con Rose y Lissa a punto de graduarse del instituto y empezar a ser adultas dentro de la sociedad moroi de la Corte Real. Sin embargo, para ellas dos el acabar el instituto significa que se tienen que embarcar en una de las misiones locas de Rose para intentar salvar el alma de Dimitri y evitar que siga siendo un strigoi. Si lo recuerdan por el final del cuarto libro, Abe (quien, sorpresivamente, es el padre de Rose) consigue informaci\u00f3n que apunta a que el hermano de Victor Dashkov, un moroi que puede controlar el esp\u00edritu, fue capaz de revertir la conversi\u00f3n de un strigoi. Esta misi\u00f3n loca de Rose implica, claramente, sacar a Victor Dashkov de la c\u00e1rcel, conseguir que los re\u00fana con su hermano y que este sujeto les diga a Lissa y a Rose exactamente c\u00f3mo hacer que Dimitri vuelva a ser un dhampir. Y s\u00ed, as\u00ed es como empieza el libro......y empieza a darte cachetadas en la cara porque NADA de lo que piensas que va a pasar o que es factible que pase pasa. vaya trabalenguas. El punto es que la trama se va desarrollando tan bien y conectando de una manera tan sutil todos los cabos sueltos que se han ido dejando a lo largo de los libros, que la experiencia de leerlo es tan genial que te vas sorprendiendo cada vez m\u00e1s con lo que le pasa a Rose y a sus amigos. De hecho, creo que una de las cosas que m\u00e1s me gustaron de este libro fue el hecho de que la historia no se centra ego\u00edstamente en una Rose obsesionada con revertir la conversi\u00f3n de Dimitri (que s\u00ed, obviamente est\u00e1 ah\u00ed), sino que tambi\u00e9n nos introducimos en historias m\u00e1s propias de la Corte de los moroi, de la situaci\u00f3n de los dhampir, de los debates del Pleno de los moroi, de alianzas entre las familias reales, de un mont\u00f3n de cosas que se escapan del control de Rose y que hacen del libro algo much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s completo y m\u00e1s real.

Yo no me f\u00edo ni un poquito de Victor Dashkov y menos de su hermano loco. S\u00ed, ya s\u00e9 que les dijeron a Rose y a Lissa lo que deb\u00edan hacer para revertir el cambio de Dimitri, PEEEEERO se escaparon convenientemente despu\u00e9s. NO. ME. F\u00cdO. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal que haya efectos secundarios? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no le preguntaron al hermano de Dashkov que pas\u00f3 con la strigoi a la que logr\u00f3 salvar? A m\u00ed esto me huele muy mal...En cuanto llegu\u00e9 a la parte en la que Lissa le clavaba la estaca a Dimitri con ayuda de Christian (una escena genial, si me lo preguntan) y vi que apenas estaba en la mitad del libro, la situaci\u00f3n me pint\u00f3 muy mal. Es decir, SAB\u00cdA que no todo iba a ser color de rosas entre Rose y Dimitri si a\u00fan quedaban como 250 p\u00e1ginas de libro. Y SUFR\u00cd PORQUE TEN\u00cdA RAZ\u00d3N. JO-DER. \u00bfY saben qu\u00e9 me sab\u00eda a\u00fan peor? Que Dimitri estuviera en plan \"Oh, Lissa, eres una diosa por salvarme, ser\u00e9 tu esclavo para toda la eternidad... Pero, Rose, no quiero verte porque no tengo perd\u00f3n por todo lo que te he hecho\" y AHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Mira, si yo odiaba a Lissa antes de que todo esto pasara, ahora la odio a\u00fan m\u00e1s. Es decir, s\u00ed, ayud\u00f3 a que Dimitri no fuera m\u00e1s un strigoi, pero m\u00e1s o menos sin quererlo lo convirti\u00f3 en su adorador Y ESO NO SE PUEDE. Adem\u00e1s, era tremendamente doloroso leer a Rose cuando le dec\u00edan que Dimitri no quer\u00eda verlo... y m\u00e1s doloroso a\u00fan leerla cuando Dimitri le dec\u00eda que ya no sent\u00eda nada por ella. QUE TODO ESO TIENE QUE SER UNA PATRA\u00d1A. ELLOS SON OTP Y SE TIENEN QUE AMAR HASTA EL FIN DE LOS TIEMPOS. Pero... y aqu\u00ed va un pero que me dol\u00eda mucho a lo largo del libro... ADRIAN. Ay, dioses del Olimpo, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 me hacen esto? Leer lo buen novio que era con Rose y lo mucho que se nota que la quiere... y luego leer a Rose olvid\u00e1ndose casi por completo de \u00e9l ante la mera menci\u00f3n del nombre de Dimitri me romp\u00eda el coraz\u00f3n. Y que lo usara de desparche cuando Dimitri le dijo que ya nunca la volver\u00eda a amar... MAL. Aghhhh... No s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo sentirme con respecto a esto. Est\u00e1 claro que quiero que Rose al final est\u00e9 con Dimitri, pero no quiero ver a Adrian con el coraz\u00f3n roto o con otra en plan \"te sigo queriendo, Rose, pero es lo mejor para los dos que yo est\u00e9 con otra\" o algo as\u00ed. CREEN UN HAR\u00c9N PARA DIMITRI-ROSE-ADRIAN (?) Okay, no xDAhora, EL FINAL. HOLY F*CK, EL FINAL. \u00bfAlguien se vio venir eso de que supuestamente Rose hab\u00eda matado a la Reina Tatiana? I mean, WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL... Y ahora que lo recuerdo, MOMENTOS \u00c9PICOS Y CUANDO ROSE HABLA FRENTE AL PLENO DE LOS MOROI REALES Y LES PLANTA CARA POR LA LEY DE LA EDAD DE LOS DHAMPIR. OL\u00c9 T\u00da, ROSE. Volviendo a la conspiraci\u00f3n... VAYA. Es que ni siquiera me puedo imaginar qu\u00e9 demonios puede ser eso, si est\u00e1 conectado con los archivos del padre de Lissa que robaron de los alquimistas o qu\u00e9. Y luego est\u00e1 la nota de Tatiana que le da Ambrose a Rose... Y Abe apareciendo para defender a su hija como su abogado en la vista preliminar y cuando han decidido que va a ir a juicio dici\u00e9ndole que tenga absoluta certeza de que no la condenar\u00e1n. AHHHHH, DEMASIADAS COSAS PARA POCAS P\u00c1GINAS. Y, por cierto, me devuelvo un poco, pero \u00bfpodemos pensar en el momento en el que la Guardia Real llega para llevarse a Rose y Dimitri la defiende a capa y espada como en los viejos tiempos?

Love fades. Mine has.\"\nThis fifth installment of the Vampire Academy did surprise me. It has a boring and slow start, but when I got into the middle part of it, I was dumbstrucked with all its epicness.I could not say much about the plot since it will spoil those who haven't yet read this, but the pacing became better. There were more surprising things in the second half of it. Mostly I was stunned by the turn of events-- including that plot twist at the end!Rose was quite annoying in this book. I couldn't deny the fact that I was irritated by her immaturity here but thankfully, her character became better at the final chapters.I could never express how I love this series. Seriously, it becomes more and more incredible in each sequel. The final book will surely be a blast!Rating: 5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2098381-heather", "userReview": "I did it. I know I said that I wouldn\u2019t, but I read Spirit Bound in spite of my boycott. I have no excuse. I\u2019m almost as big a hypocrite as Rose Hathaway. Almost. In my defense, I didn\u2019t decide to read it until after I read every spoiler available via Amazon.com. Therefore, I knew every plot point within this book before I read it, and ironically, it was the very thing that compelled me to read it. Curse my morbid curiosity. Worse, I liked it! I may never forgive myself.Before I say anything else, I have to state this officially, for the review record\u2026I HATE Rose. HATE her. I have resigned myself to the fact that we shall never, ever see any character growth from her, if anything, we can expect consistent digression, but still, this knowledge does not make me hate her any less. She is whinny, self involved, selfish, brash, manipulative, dishonest, and hypocritical. My favorite line to hate from her appears several times throughout this novel\u2026\u201dIt was hard, but I pushed the guilt aside.\u201d Hold the phone; I\u2019m supposed to feel sorry for you because you are somehow able to overcome your guilt about destroying the lives of the people who love you while you get innocent people killed for your own selfish gains? Not likely. Even worse, I think I actually saw red while reading Rose's flippant, often condesending treatment of Adrian. Rose doesn\u2019t deserve any of the people who love her, not Lissa, not Adrian, not Christian, Eddie, or the help or respect of any of the people that assist her on her journey. The only reason I root for her is because not rooting for her would be a betrayal to the characters I do love, namely Adrian, Lissa and Christian.Any of those who know my thoughts on this series know I am team Adrian through and through. He appears morally ambiguous upon first glance, when in fact; I think he may have the strongest moral character of any of them. He may drink and smoke like a freight train. He may even be a bit of a sloth, but there isn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do for the people he loves, even to his own detriment. His willingness to help maybe self motivated, but he has never ever operated under false pretenses, has never lied and never manipulated those he claims to love. Because I love Adrian, I want him to have that which he desires most, Rose. And I was so glad that he has finally been given the opportunity to have her. However, that does not mean that I think he should end up with her. Though for Adrian\u2019s sake I hoped for the pairing, I have always known, and know, that Rose and Dimitri will end up together, as they should. Rose doesn\u2019t deserve Adrian on her best day. Let's face it, I don't even think she deserves Dimtri. But I am so glad that Mead gave Adrian a chance to shine. And this fact along with two others is the only reason I liked this book and broke my vow to not read Spirit Bound. I can turn my back on Rose, but I could never turn my back on Adrian.Thankfully, Mead also decided to devote more page time not only to Adrian, but to Lissa and Christian as well. These characters are so full of win in this installment that they somehow allowed me to overlook my hatred for Rose. That is a tremendous testament to their awesomeness. I know many people resent Lissa, though I have never understood why, she has always proven her friendship and loyalty to Rose, if anything, I\u2019ve always felt that Rose had something to prove, but once again, Lissa outshines Rose in every way and puts her to extreme shame. *Spoilers Ahead*. I was proud of Lissa for restoring Dimitri, not because I felt that she owed it to Rose, but because if showed Lissa\u2019s immense, all consuming selflessness, as well as her development in the use of Spirit. Lissa is just awesome, in an angelic sort of way. And Christian, oh how I missed him in Blood Promise. Thankfully, he is back on par with his snide antics, shrewd observations, and endless love for Lissa, which is filled with that delicious tension that makes your stomach clench. I ate it up.As for Dimitri, I have never really liked or disliked him, except in Blood Promise. I clearly disliked Strigoi Dimitri. He was such a forgone clich\u00e9 as a Strigoi. Nevertheless, I am glad his humanity was restored and even better, he upped the angst ante with his rejection of Rose. Mead may be brilliant at destroying her characters (Seth from Georgia Kincaid series anyone?) as she has proven with Rose, but you can\u2019t deny her ability to rip your heart out. I don\u2019t even really care if Rose gets her happy ending, in fact, I hope she meets a tragic end in the last installment, but even I was in a state over Dimitri\u2019s words in the church. Oh the angst! Rose and Dimitri belong together, even though it makes me kind of sick. I can't help but want it to happen, for Dimitri's sake.So Mead has redeemed herself a bit in my eyes. I may despise Rose with a fiery passion, but she knocked one out of the park by allowing Adrian and Lissa to surpass the narrator and steal the show and for peppering this book with so much emotional turmoil, deceit, tension and steam, that I couldn\u2019t help but read it and like it. Kudos.P.S. If Mead turns Adrain into any more of a sacraficial lamb I will be truly devestated. Give the man a break for Christ's sake, he's been through enough already."}, {"userName": "Juliana Zapata", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28636277-juliana-zapata", "userReview": "Estoy muy sorprendida con este libro, estuve atrapada en la historia de principio a fin, mi opini\u00f3n sobre Lissa mejor\u00f3 enormemente en esta parte de la historia y Adrian se ha ganado mi coraz\u00f3n.Rose como siempre incre\u00edble, impulsiva, fuerte, decidida, terca, intensa, un poco ego\u00edsta y metida en much\u00edsimos problemas.La trama tiene giros que te dejan sin palabras y el final... dioses, es tan impactante que quieres seguir con el sexto y \u00faltimo libro de la saga de una vez"}, {"userName": "Fuzaila", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55299343-fuzaila", "userReview": "What is this book? I was planning on ditching it up until 80% of it, and in a bizarre turn of events, I lost a night to this book and jumped onto the sequel right after wtf I blame this book for making me a messy insomniac.? That\u2019s extraordinary. Not that this book was any good. Richelle Mead is one manipulative author. Like really, really manipulative. How dare she light my heart with fury like that and become the fireman all of a sudden? Ugh, this one\u2019s going to be hard to review, not to mention rate. First half of the book? 1/5 stars The 60%-80% potion of the book? 3/5 stars That ending though? 4.5/5 stars Overall, 2.5/5 stars**As always, please be aware of spoilers in case you have not read the previous books**\n\nTHE PLOT\n\nLet\u2019s say um, where did that previous book end? I am not so sure. But this one started quite sometime after. Rose and Adrian are dating. Yeah, finally. But she is not very sure of her feelings for him. She is \nconfused\n. Because, duh, her ex-boyfriend is dead (undead-whatever) and might have a shot at being bought to life which would mean busting a notorious criminal out from his high-security prison. So what does \ninvincible, reckless, i-am-in-control-of-everything\n Rose do? She emotionally manipulates, Lissa, her best friend, who thinks she owes her, in coming with her to bust that monster out and try to regain a Strigoi, which might not even be possible. In doing so, they are risking the entire Vampire world, Rose and Lissa\u2019s future, the love and life of everyone they hold dear, to accomplish what? To bring a dead man out alive because Rose loved him. (Raise your hands if you didn\u2019t cringe at that?)Anyways, Miracles do happen and it happens here, but one problem leads to another, and in the end, Rose finds herself tackled in a web of conspiracies and an impossible quest; she isn\u2019t even sure how she got herself there, or even worse, how she\u2019d ever be able to get herself out. MY THOUGHTS more like, my tangled chain of emotions\u2022\tLet\u2019s be real and admit this: Rose is the most annoying, whiny, emotionally manipulative, utterly-selfish, reckless brat who does EVERYTHING with selfish notions and regrets every bit of her recklessness later. Like, for most part of this book, I ABSOLUTELY HATED HER. In fact, I can\u2019t even remember an instant when she was bearable. She was awful to those who loved her, using them to get her way in and out of things, and not even giving a second thought on how much her actions might affect them. \u2022\tBtw, the way she described her love-life. Disgusting. It was as if the only good thing about being in love was the kisses, cuddles and sex. \u2022\tI DON\u2019T SHIP ROSE AND DIMITRI. There \u2013 I say it again and I will say this all the time. I didn\u2019t see any development in their relationship. I don\u2019t even think they make a good pair. Because, honestly, Dimitri and Rose are the most annoying MCs I\u2019ve read yet. Oh, Heck. They make the best pair. They are perfect for each other.\u2022\tBut darn, Rose, why do you hurt my baby Adrian so much??? You know you aren\u2019t going to stick around when Dimitri is back and yet you stay in hopes of comforting him. Are you crazy??? You don\u2019t get to control everybody\u2019s mind by just being there!!! \u2022\tOh, sorry, I totally forgot. She IS crazy.\u2022\tLissa has to be the best thing to happen in this book. Her character development was remarkable. I loved her better than Rose, but still, it\u2019s not completely enough.\u2022\tLikewise, I LOVE CHRISTIAN\u2019s character. Amazing. Bold. Ready-for-action. Cool. Just right for Lissa. \u2022\tAnd not to mention, Adrian. How could he be such a bundle of pitiful-cutie-pie? I hate that he is still bowled over by Rose, but nevertheless. HE IS AMAZING.\u2022\tThe thing is, Mead doesn\u2019t give much thought to her side-characters. The whole thing is just about Rose, Rose and Rose. Plus Dimitri (thankfully, not as much as in the last book though)\u2022\tIf she had given Adrian, Lissa, Christian and some others, a fair chance, a bit more role, development, this book would have been so much better. Where is Jill btw?\u2022\tAnother thing about Rose that I hate \u2013 the whole book might be about her \u2013 but it is impossible how she gets her way ALL THE DAMN TIME. Come on! She\u2019s barely adult, she is stupid even. There is no explanation as to how those \u2018ideas\u2019 come to her. Everything seems way too convenient for her and it\u2019s unrealistic how EVERYTHING happens in her favor.\u2022\tBe reasonable Mead, you don\u2019t have to go out of the way to make us like Rose. It can\u2019t be always her. She\u2019s the heroine of the story, true. Doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no other person who\u2019s a hero too. Doesn\u2019t have to be Rose all the time.\u2022\tLike, people have turned Strigoi for centuries now and they\u2019ve earned the title as evil-creatures-of-the-night. But when Rose\u2019s so-called-soulmate turns into one, there suddenly appears to be a way to restore them back to human? Ofcourse, MIRACLE. Duh. So simple.\u2022 And I\u2019m now going to address another important but highly overlooked issue here - MONEY Yeah I know, it might be the least of your concerns, but really, the way money is made out to be the most commonly available thing ever? It\u2019s offending. Rose is rich by no means, but she says she is funded by Adrian who is royal, but come one! Even Royals have their limit! Living in luxurious hotels and flying to some country every other minute? It\u2019s not just costly, IT IS SUPER EXPENSIVE. How can anyone not see that? From the way Mead writes it, Rose might sctuslly be walking over a carpet of money. IT. IS. INSANE. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY \u2013 NOT HERS \u2013 SHE SPENDS.\u2022\tI\u2019ve said this once, (twice? Idk), the plot is as repetitive as it can get. It is always the same thing over and over again. Someone gets kidnapped. Mostly Lissa. Rose leads a group of guardians to them. They emerge victorious. End of story. Happily Ever After. Cool.Overall, this book was way too long for what good it did to the series. The plot is repetitive, but the ending came as a total surprise even when I was spoiled on the book\u2019s happenings. I love the action part though, not too confusing, just enough to grip you on edge. But it\u2019s still annoying \u2013 this technique of Mead to write horribly for most of the book and finally grab us with the endings. No one\u2019s complaining tbh."}, {"userName": "Elena Salvatore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44325911-elena-salvatore", "userReview": "[Towards the end when he finally comes back as a Dhampir and we're all excited because Now they finally can be together and be happy, he doesn't wants to see her...but he adores Lissa and she doesn't let Rose see him either??

Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!*****sigh*Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s move on....That was incredible. Just incredible! I cannot believe all that went on in that book.Firstly, Dimitri was saved! Yes, yes, yes! I can\u2019t be happier about that, I swear. I actually shrieked when I read Lissa had actually managed to restore his soul. Let\u2019s face it- it\u2019s what every VA fan has wanted since the end of Shadow Kiss. And I\u2019m no exception. My heart breaks over the guilt he feels and I know he can\u2019t take back the things he\u2019s done, but surely he can move on. And what about him not wanting to be with Rose? I understand how bad knowing he\u2019d hurt the person he loves most would be, but there is NO WAY I believe he no longer loves her. That\u2019s an outright lie! You only have to read how he looks at her and how he was willing to fight a bunch of guardians for her. He aint fooling anybody! Oh, Rose. Dearest Rose..... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? She loves Dimka, that\u2019s clear, but what about Adrian? I know her feelings are confused, especially knowing she does care about Adrian, but she is only going to make things harder on herself. And on Adrian if she does end up getting back with Dimitri. I believe Adrian does actually love her and his heart will break if they split.That being said, I wouldn\u2019t be true to myself or honest if I didn\u2019t say that even though I have a soft spot for Adrian, I\u2019ll be cheering for Rose and Dimitri all the way to the very end.Lissa and Christian seemed to work things out, which was great to see. And many of the other awesome characters I love were back. Eddie, Abe, Mia, Rose\u2019s Mum, Jill, even Sydney had a small cameo. It was soooo great to see them all again!Now on to the shocks! How can they believe that Rose killed the Queen? It\u2019s an exceptional twist in the story, but I do wonder who actually did kill her and why? Now that Rose is going to trial it\u2019s gonna be up to Lissa and all her friends to save her and get her out of trouble.And Lissa has a sibling! Can you believe it? That totally blew me away, and I never saw it coming. I can\u2019t wait to find out how that impacts the storyline. Even though it\u2019s a surprise, I think a younger sis or bro would be good for Lissa. It means she\u2019s not as alone as she\u2019s always been. I CANNOT WAIT to find out what happens in the final book. I\u2019m sad that Last Sacrifice will be the end of the VA series, but I\u2019m looking forward to what I know will be a gripping, explosive, heart racing conclusion.Now I just gotta wait until December. Seriously, it\u2019s gonna kill me!!!"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1489224-lisa", "userReview": "Since a large part of this review is dedicated to my hatred of the romances in this series, I'll start by saying I never liked Rose and Dimitri together because I never understood why they liked each other. Richelle Mead told us that Dimitri and Rose were alike and that's why they were soul mates but she never showed that in the writing. How is Dimitri at all like Rose? Other than fighting, wanting to protect Moroi, and being in love with Rose, which are three things that apply to almost every male guardian in this book, they have nothing in common. Also, I have to admit that I was uncomfortable with their relationship because he was her teacher, but I might have been able to overlook that if they had been written better and if I had liked Dimitri more.I agree with others that despite all of the action, this book was slow and boring. Everything was too easy and the plot was very contrived. Why did Victor need Lissa in the first book if his brother was a Spirit user? Eddie just does whatever Rose says because he trusts her and then conveniently goes missing for the rest of the book once he's served his purpose. Someone needs to remind me why Adrian is in love with Rose. I think they have good chemistry at times but it's impossible to root for them when she treats him like crap and uses him constantly.And I'll reiterate what I said in my review of Blood Promise, the love triangle was completely useless because it's completely obvious who Rose is going to end up with. Mead, who is clearly in love with Dimitri the same way Stephenie Meyer is in love with Edward, can't let Rose have real feelings for Adrian and move on with him. That would have created tension and added complexity to Rose's feelings. In real life people can have meaningful relationships with more than one person (just not at the same time) without diminishing the the love felt for either partner. If Rose had moved on with Adrian it would have also explained why he would stick around when her feelings began to waver since he would have had something real to miss and want to hold on to.But all of the problems with this book are common to books that star Mary Sues. Rose has been a Mary Sue from the beginning but at least there were consequences to her actions some of the time and she had faults that the characters in the book acknowledged. By Spirit Bound, the consequences she faced were not in response to things she should have been punished for. She's not punished for her selfish behavior regarding Dimitri or Adrian. Adrian forgives her for using him and Dimitri rejects her to protect her, not because of the means she used to save him or because he realizes what a selfish person she is. Nor is she punished for letting loose an evil man who hurt her best friend. She has to file papers for a few days for sneaking out, hardly the appropriate punishment for what she actually did. The only consequence she really faced was in response to her rightfully speaking out against the Queen for lowering the guardian age and that was only a small part of why she was accused of murder. Most of it was because she was framed.Honestly, I wouldn't continue reading this series except that I have a masochistic need to finish a series that I've started."}, {"userName": "\u2665Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52207144-christina", "userReview": "[ At the beginning of this book Rose keep receiving threat/love letters from Dimitri. I thought it was a really nice touch. Adrian and Rose start dating...Yeahhh. I hope it's not just me but Oh Come Onnn, this is bound to end badly and hearts will be broken. Don't get me wrong I love Adrian but NOT with Rose. They are just so different and they handle things completely different. But I guess he'll be a good distraction for Rose. Poor guy. Adrian really is a great guy but Rose will always belong with Dimitri. I have to mention Ibrahim \"Abe\" Mazur. This man Roses father is freaking Fantastic! I can't get enough. Ever time there is a part with him you know your gonna have a good laugh. In Spirit Bound, When Rose was in Russia she was told a story of a man named Robert Doru who restored a Strigoi back to its former self. Who just so happens to be Victor Dashkov's half-brother. So Rose formulates a plan to break Victor out of Tarasov prison. Consequences be damned. She recruits Mikhail Tanner (lover of Sonya Karp) to help get her, Lissa and Eddie out of the Academy. I love Eddie and his loyalty to his friends but I wish he wouldn't take so many risks with his promising future. Anyways after the prison break, they meet up with Robert in Las Vagus. They learn it's true, you can indeed restore a Strigoi but it's not so easy. You must use a stake charmed with Spirit and it must be used by a Spirit user in order for it to work. Dimitri tracks down Rose, there is a fight, people die, and Victor and Robert escape.Rose and her friends go back to the Academy after that. Rose wants Lissa to have no part in the staking of Dimitri. But Lissa is determined to do this even if she has to go behind Rose's back. I love that this also brings Lissa and Christian back together. They have a common goal. Learn how to Stake a Strigoi!When Lissa and Christian are on there way back from the Royal Court to the Academy they are attacked by Strigoi. Both of them are taken by Dimitri to draw out Rose. Fast forward >>> Dimitri is NO LONGER A STIGOI!!!! OMG finally! Things are crazy after that. Back at the Academy the Moroi and guardians keep Dimitri locked up.Dimitri is so filed with Guilt. He's not the same. He's broken inside. And worst of all is how he feels about what he did to Rose. He refuses to see her and he pushes her away. Not quite the reunion Rose or hell even us readers were expecting right? But it makes sense. That man has been through hell. Roses' heart gets broken by Dimitris rejection. After everything, she has done to bring him and he turns her away. She couldn't handle that. So what does she do? She turns to Adrian. But Rose isn't going to give up. Quitting isn't in her blood. Then at the end, Rose is arrested for \"supposedly\" killing the Queen Tatiana Marina Ivashkov. She gets handed a letter from Ambrose. Before her death, Tatiana wrote a letter to Rose and this is what it said.Rose,If you're reading this, then something terrible has happened. You probably hate me, and I don't blame you. I can only ask that you trust that what I did with the age decree was better for your people than what others had planned. There are some Moroi who want to force all dhampirs into service, whether they want it or not, by using compulsion. The age decree has slowed that faction down. However, I write to you with a secret you must put right, and it is a secret you must share with as few as possible. Vasilisa needs her spot on the Council, and it can be done. She is not the last Dragomir. Another lives, the illegitimate child of Eric Dragomir. I know nothing else, but if you can find this son or daughter, you will give Vasilisa the power she deserves. No matter your faults and dangerous temperament, you are the only one I feel can take on this task. Waste no time in fulfilling it.

As a result, I don't remember every single thing that I was going to write in my review that I would have likedOne thing that I really liked was all of the plot twists. There were so many things that surprised me in this book and I was very glad for it. During the middle of the book however, I gotten a little bored. I kept going on though because I was (and still am) so interested about learning about Dimitri and how Rose is going to fix everything. I loved reading and learning more about the side characters such as Lissa and Christian and Adrean. The ending of this book was excellent and something that I am very excited about reading more in the 6th and final book.Overall this book was a little less than I expected but I did enjoy reading it."}, {"userName": "Bex", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3283584-bex", "userReview": "I find it very challenging to review this book because it was good in so many ways that can't be explained without spoilers. But worry not, this review is Spirit Bound Spoilers Free. I will do my best to express you the passion I felt reading this book, but I'm afraid it's beyond what words can explain. Spirit Bound starts back at the Academy, it's finally graduation time and Rose has only one more challenge in front of her: The Trials. A final exam planned by guardians to test their ability to protect Moroi \"in the real world\". But what worries Rose the most is the after-graduation. She always thought it rimed with freedom but reality hit her in the face. She will spend her life protecting Moroi and her own desires won't matter anymore. There's not only the weight of responsibilities though, she knows Dimitri is out there, lurking in shadows, waiting for an opportunity to kill her. In this installment, Rose is more determined than ever and will use extremely illegal ways to reach her objectives. Desperation to save Dimitri, while she still can, drives her actions and consequences won't be light. She is not risking only her future and her life but also the ones of people she loves. When we love a book, we all say \"I couldn't put it down\", well in this case, I loved the book so much I HAD to put it down and take deep breaths because it was just too much. Love, Passion, Treason, Fear, Sadness, Grief, all these emotions laid on paper in a so intense way it almost became unbearable. At times I couldn't believe my own eyes, events happening in that book triggered reactions in me that are beyond words! I really love both Rose and Lissa for their very distinct qualities, and even though they are very different, they have one thing in common: they would do anything for each other. Adrian is as snarky as ever but we get to discover a new side to him. I really like the guy and it's clear he cares about Rose and I loved to watch them together. Dimitri, oh Dimitri! He broke my heart in Blood Promise and Spirit Bound wasn't any easier. At times I really felt like hitting him in the head to knock some sense into him and even though I would have a lot to say, I won't spill the beans and ruin surprises. I will mention though that chapters 20 and 24 nearly killed me. I was glad that Abe was in SB, he didn't play a major role but it was nice to have him around and I think he will have a bigger role in The Last Sacrifice. The end is as usual a cliff hanger, if suspense could kill Richelle Mead would be in danger of trial for massive murder, because I really don't know how I will be able to wait until December to know how this epic story ends. Vampire Academy is my favorite series and Richelle delivered. Spirit Bound was action-packed, full of surprises, emotions and magic. I was in awe so many times during this book, it really was fabulous. I think Shadow Kiss is still my favorite of the series because I'm such a romantic but Spirit Bound is very close second. I really hope Rose will have her happy ending in The Last Sacrifice (even though the title doesn't point that way), she's been through so much, she really deserves her happily ever after."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "Wow!!! Just wow!! I can now say with certainty that Vampire Academy has just become the classic example of why great books should not be allowed to become series. Spirit Bound IMHO has one of the most angsty demonstrations of how an author can seamlessly annihilate a beloved character to epic proportions. Dimitri and Rose were the two main reasons I loved Vampire Academy and half of that equation is now missing. What Mead did to Dimitri in Blood Promise and now Spirit Bound has me wondering if I'll ever be able to redeem him as a character.I have a tough time when characters in a book either physically or emotionally hurt or injure a protagonist that I've come to like, in this case Rose, and Dimitri has flawlessly done both to her. There was a time when I'd wave my Save Team Dimitri flag with pride and hope, but that flag is no more. If it wasn't sacrilegious to burn flags, I'd burn that one in a heartbeat. I just keep running in my head the hated lines of I've given up on you. Love fades. Mine has. Really?!!??!! After everything Rose did to try and save Dimtri that's what she gets and deserves? W.T.F.!! I don't care what mental monsters he's battling in his heart or head, you just don't say that to someone that not only loved you, but risked their life for you\u2026 time and time again.Most of my reviews include a smidge of a recap of the book. I just don't have the heart to revisit that just yet. In all fairness though, the book was written flawlessly, but at the same time the character annihilation was executed with precision. I am officially putting my Team Adrian shirt on and wearing it with pride."}, {"userName": "Alycea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3112747-alycea", "userReview": "ugh! i wish i hadnt read the first 4 books so fast! may 18th is soo far away!any who, im a huge fan of this series and its been very interesting to read about people's thoughts as to what may happen in spirit bound; here are mine...As far as Rose and Dimitri go... I love the dhampire Dimitri and Rose relationship dearly but sadly i dont think its gonna work out too well. I was hoping that Dimitri would be un-happy being strigoi or that somehow his love for Rose would transcend the evil and darkness that comes with being a strigoi but it didnt and because of that i dont think their relationship will ever be the same...How ever part of me still has hope for them...in more detail i think that 2 things can happen here. 1. Dimitri (most likely) wont kill Rose, but not because he doesnt want to...but i think that wanting to torture her more than actually wanting forever with her will be more the reason he wants to \"awaken\" her now, becuase lets face it- rose would rather die, and why would her what she wants?? because he loves her deep down?? maybe-but he seems to be more interested in his own person gain and holding power over people. anyway, he will be unsuccessful in turning her strigoi and she will \"save\" him by turning him back into a dhampir. however, i think he will most likely resent her for doing so because he loves being strigoi. OR he will be like everyone hopes and he and rose will live happily ever after..either way their relationship wont be the same.. 2.he WILL turn Rose into Strigoi and 1 of 3 things could happen. she actually likes being strigoi (which i wouldnt be able to fathon that happening), she has to choose between herself and dimitri and she kills him and lissa and adrian etc turn her back to dhampir, or she finds away to \"save\" herself and dimitri...which goes back to what i think will happen in her first senerior.as far as the other characters go...adrian may or may not die or end up with Rose..idkChirstian and Lissa will get back together...mia and eddie will get together..jill, mia, or eddie may die either fighting strigoi (i dont want anyone to die) for some reason i think alberta may die as well..rose will end up with dimitri, adrian, or singlevictor and lissa will start the revolution against tatiana and then victor will turn on lissa and rose will either get him back into jail or kill him...and a lot of other stuff that i forgot...loltell me what you think :) or if you agree with me."}, {"userName": "elena", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41185165-elena", "userReview": "I can't believe I have only one more book left in the series!

I feel like she does things to achieve her goals without thinking of the people she might hurt in the process.
