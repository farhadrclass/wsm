It has a very Heroes (the show) feel where kids are born with abnormal abilities. I\u2019ll definitely give the authors kudos for coming up with \u201cpowers\u201d I\u2019ve never seen before, such as controlling a crowd\u2019s energy, electronics manipulation, and \u201cthrowing\u201d vision (to name a few). They were extremely odd, but oddly interesting at the same time. I\u2019ll most remember the series for it\u2019s diverse cast of characters (with different ethnicities and sexual orientations, something I love seeing more of in books). I also liked the overall plot progression. This final novel offered a nice story arc that seemed a lot grander than the self-induced problems the characters faced in the first book and I appreciated how everything played out. Overall, this trilogy is a fun read, especially if you\u2019re in the mood for something kind of different. It didn\u2019t knock my socks off, but it definitely entertained.Via The Obsessive Bookseller at www.NikiHawkes.com Other books you might like:"}, {"userName": "Thalia Grace", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38478401-thalia-grace", "userReview": "10/18/16:Just like last year when I finished Zeroes, I NEED THIS THIRD BOOK HOLY WHY MUST I WAIT SO LONG"}, {"userName": "Jack Heath", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2848292-jack-heath", "userReview": "In the third and final ZEROES book, things look grim. There's an external threat, in the form of Piper - a new Zero with powers unknown, leading an army to some kind of apolocalyptic event in New Orleans. There are internal threats, too: Scam is starting to realise what harm his omniscient voice could do in the wrong hands, which could well be his own, since he's just unwittingly revealed to Crash that people are essentially mechanical, and that she therefore has the power to kill with her mind. Bellwether's stint in a maximum security prison has left an impression on both him and Mob, who would do anything to avoid finding herself in one. Meanwhile, Flicker is no longer sure she can trust Anon, who has discovered The Nowhere, a place where he is free from the pain of existing.The ZEROES series - and NEXUS in particular - represent everything that's good about YA. The genre-blending. The risk-taking. The scenes which wouldn't work on a screen but feel so real on a page. Young characters who seem utterly convincing, even as they are grappling to control abilities which are delightfully preposterous. Through a succession of carefully orchestrated scenes, every power comes together to make an ending that you won't see coming.I'll miss Scam most of all. Every time the voice takes control of his mouth, the dialogue crackles.

It was pretty fast paced overall and a little confusing with all the different perspectives, but I do recommend reading all 3 books consecutively. (I did Swarm and Nexus consecutively and I'm very glad I did!)This ending felt a little rushed to me. I only wish we had gotten more answers at the ending of this final book! I'm left with so many more questions - and not just about their futures, but about their powers in general. Especially Ethan's voice - his power is unique but, why? How?

The motivations of the characters were all over the place, the point of view changed too often, and there was to much change to the setting to make it easy to follow. I feel like they never spent more than a chapter in the same location. Also, they work better as a team, but were frequently split up throughout this book, weakening them and leaving opening for semi-forced conflict. I was impressed with the few battles they were involved in, the interactions with their inside out powers, and the internal war of Kelsie, but I felt like there were too many new characters to keep track of, several of which weren't important to the story. That being said, finally establishing that the Zeroes are small fish in a very large pond was pretty great plot shifting.

They're so full of stuff that it's hard for me to review it or even give any sort of synopsis. All I can say it Westerfeld has been a favorite of mine for many years, and even though he's probably writing content that's \"too young\" for me, I'll always read his works. This is just another reminder that I love how he creates worlds and makes them so easy to submerge yourself in. He's one of those writers that is able to make up words and concepts that make perfect sense to you when you read it, but if you try and explain it to someone else you have to go back a million steps, and eventually lay out the entire plot just to explain why a certain line is so funny, or heartbreaking, or exciting, because it has all of these moments.

This is the final book in the Zeroes series. You can click the links for my review of the first two books, Zeroes and Swarm.I enjoyed both Zeroes and Swarm more than I thought I would. So I was looking forward to finding out how the story would end. I didn\u2019t want to go into Nexus with any expectations so there was no way I could be disappointed. However the story ended. I did have one thing that I wanted to happen though. I won\u2019t say what here.I think Nate has annoyed me in all three books now. I never liked that his power meant he had control over the Zeroes and the fact that he loved it. But his obsession in Nexus with the leader of the group in New Orleans was ridiculous. He didn\u2019t even know what this person was up to \u2013 good or bad. But I am glad Riley found her voice. I definitely preferred her as a leader over Nate.Speaking of the leader in New Orleans\u2026 I have no idea what happened to make them come up with this insane plan but clearly it wasn\u2019t worth it. I don\u2019t know if I want to know their story but I think it might have been interesting. Or maybe not.I am glad that there was kind of an epilogue to Nexus and there was a way to see what happened to most of the characters. But I did feel bad for Ethan. I definitely prefer when a series has an actual ending.I can\u2019t remember if there was ever an answer to where their powers came from though? It was a question I had when I was reading the first book. I think all the Zeroes were born in 2000? Or I could be completely wrong. But I did want to know where they came from. Especially because Riley got a power but her twin didn\u2019t\u2026The Zeroes series was really good. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d like it at first.

It has been a pleasure to spend time with the Zeroes and all of their faults and insecurities. This is a totally different take on the kids with super powers storyline. Yes, these kids have powers, but they are not the usual kind of powers, they are all based in the connections we have to each other, our emotions and technology and all of the social dilemmas that brings. This series has been more about society and it\u2019s difficulties with morality and what is right. This is more evident in this last book then in the other two. All of the kids have a tremendous growth in this last book, mostly for the better although there are moments when I was worried about a few of them.None of these kids are heroes, although they try to do what is right, they mostly struggle with learning how to control and understand their powers and come to terms with them. This is most evident in this final book as they meet other kids with powers similar to theirs. But unlike our Zeroes, these kids want to destroy the world and rebuild it into something that would benefit them. It is interesting to see the Zeroes meet others like them, and to learn that their powers have two sides, the one that they currently use, but also the opposite. Chizara (aka Crash) who can crash technology, but also fix it, knew this in the first book, but the others did not. She does finds out a new horrifying aspect of her power in this book, which she comes to terms with. We meet some kids with some interesting new powers, most of them are the opposite of the Zeroes, but none of the new kids are quite like them in their understanding of what is right. Throughout all three books the authors focused on the downside of having powers, instead of making everyone a hero that comes to save the day, they often make mistakes and sometimes things go wrong for them. At times the Zeroes do not get along which causes issues among them and they don\u2019t often tell each other what they are up to. But when it counts they do work together and some how make it all work.I loved all of the characters, but I most related to Thibault, whose power was to be anonymous. He could make people not see him, or forget him. He really struggles with staying with others especially in crowds. I am sure there are times where we have all felt invisible in a crowd, so it was easy to get inside his head. I also like Nate, even though he struggles with his time in prison and what it did to him to be away from crowds. I really felt that all of the powers were realistic, whose has not felt the power of a crowd and how one or two people can make or break that crowd. I also liked the fact that although there were some couples with in the group and then one love interest outside of the group, the romance was kept to a minimum. Actually I wouldn\u2019t even call it romance in the usual YA way. It was very realistic in how it plays out and I appreciated that it never got in the way of the plot. I must say that the writing is absolutely consistent and amazing through out the books. You would never think that there are three people writing these books. I understand that they each wrote two character\u2019s story lines, but the styles of writing are consistent and not jarring at all, as I have sometimes encountered when more than one author writes a book. The finale is mind blowing and not what I expected. It has left the door open to spin off series which is great. I would love to revisit this world and the next generation of Zeroes. I want to reread this series from the beginning, now that it is complete. Especially as it takes place over a short few months of time, it will be interesting to read it all together. https://elnadesbookchat.com/"}, {"userName": "Llyr Heller-Humphreys", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5646252-llyr-heller-humphreys", "userReview": "Enjoyed this last in the series (or is it).

Kinda like a poor man's version of the better authors in this genres (which surprised me as Westerfeld is a good writer usually). I read this book just to finish things out and I hope that there isn't another in the series lest I be forced to endure page after page of the main characters bitch, whine and complain chapter after chapter and maybe throw an actual story in there a tenth of the time.And that's the problem I had with the first two books. The characters...and what I disliked about them in those seemed to be the main focus of this entire book.I get character development and all but when the characters are so easy to dislike I really don't want almost the ENTIRE BOOK to be about their development when all it does is make me wish I was somewhere listening to someone scrape their nails across a chalkboard. Seriously, it's like the 3 authors couldn't decide or agree on a plot so they just spend chapter after chapter after chapter forcing the reader to listen to the most annoying group of people I can imagine and their inner monologue that spends chapter after chapter after chapter telling the reader how selfish, stupid and illogical they are combined with a huge serving of feeling sorry for themselves.Oh, and in between we get to hear them whine some more, contradict themselves just so they can whine, and make very little sense when explaining their feelings... feelings which amount to a \"woe is me\" attitude.I get what he was trying to do. Trying to piggyback off the moral genre going around in the Marvel and DC movies right now, but it certainly didn't accomplish that. Not even close.I also get conflicting emotions and characters not being so black and white, but again the writers don't come close to portraying such.And while I am sure the authors want us to view characters as complicated and question the line between what is good and what is evil and the ramifications of using powers on the world around us, all I was left with was a strong loathing of the people whom the book focuses on. And not because of any moral conundrum, but because all they do is whine, bitch and moan. And even worse, the authors kept inventing reasons for them to whine, bitch and moan just for the sake of filling more and more and more pages with developing characters which I ended up loathing even more.The entire Thibault arc was just so over the top ridiculous that it's frustrating. He was the one character I didn't hate during the second book and then through crappy writing we have no idea what happened to him at the end of the second book. So we find out in the 3rd book that the authors decided to take the one character who wasn't obnoxious and make him a complete and utter moron who turns into the biggest drama queen of them all. Yes, he shot someone... someone who was about to kill a crap ton of people, including his only friends and the one person he was in love with. I guess he should have let all of them die and then he wouldn't want to kill himself? Like COME ON! Actually, after reading this book, I can now say that I wish Swarm would have succeeded and that would have been the end of the zeroes.And Chizara? Well it's clear that is the character who he is trying to make into the hero role and she is the dumbest one of them all. The authors keep trying to make her sound deep and logical but every single word from her mouth is bitch or complain. If it's not one of those 2 things then it's selfish or argumentative. And seriously full of crap. Every single time she uses her powers she complains about them making her use her powers and yet you portray her coming across as a strong young woman who has a moral balance and depth. Problem being, a strong young woman with a moral balance wouldn't continue to be such an obvious follower and would have left that group long ago. Another problem is in her inner monologue half the time she enjoys crashing stuff and then turns around and bitches about having to crash the stuff that she just confesses enjoying. So you decide to fill up pages by her whining and complaining to what? Show that you are talented at writing a character who is well versed at bitching? Awesome guys! You got your point across. Noone does it better.I could go on and on about this book and if you've read this then you may notice that this review is nothing but bitching and complaining about the book. And you're right. Not an entertaining kind of review, right?Now imagine an entire freaking book filled of this, not by just one, but every P.O.V. character throughout the entire thing and you may get a glimpse of why I hated this book so much.Seriously authors, if y'all have writer's block then it's best to just be patient rather than to write a bunch of pages of 6 spoiled emo kids inner monologue and throw in a weak plot just to get something out. Because I for one would rather wait until you 3 came up with an actual story than be subjected to reading something masked as a book on how you think young adults think, or should be thinking about their powers.I have never read a book where I want so bad for the main characters to lose. And not for any moral reasons, but just because they are so freaking irritating, obnoxious, spoiled and loathsome.Character development is great and all but this is a prime example of how to much of it, (especially when you decide to spend the entire book on it and it comes at the expense of an actual story or plot...or in this case, lack thereof) can go horribly wrong.Awful book."}, {"userName": "Nicole Eastwick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43100642-nicole-eastwick", "userReview": "This series began with Ethan and the words \"more coffee?\", and ended with Ethan and the words \"more coffee\".

Ardell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/983503-e-ardell", "userReview": "*SPOILERS*Overall, this series really never had an over-arching plot. Each book read like an \"Adventures of the Zeroes\" installment, until we got to the second book with it's killer cliffhanger. In the first book, Zeroes, the plot happened because they kept screwing up and getting themselves into trouble. It was great because we got to know them and their powers and saw them bungle things up and try to fix it all. The book could have been a standalone but I was glad it wasn't, because I liked the kids.Book Two, this book had an actual villain out to get the Zeroes. It was fantastic and creepy. I loved Thibault's going home and seeing how his family forgot him, his mother's break downs, his father's anger. I loved Nate's shaken confidence, Ethan's self-doubt, Chelsie feeling the dark side of her power. The Zeroes win this one for losing, and losing big. It ends with a cliffhanger so evil I almost threw the book out the window of a moving car. I was hungry for the last book.Book Three, it started out so wonderfully. I was so pleased. Everything was so exciting. They were on the run. They have a member that's in danger of fading out of existence, they've got a shaky Glorious Leader, Flicker trying to lead and take care of Thibault at the same time, Ethan trying to figure out what the heck his power really is and finding love (cuteness), and Chizara discovers her power can truly kill. The Zeroes find out how weak they are. It seems everyone had leveled up but them. They bumble and fumble, as usual, but they have grown. They're better at planning and working together. I got a lot of smirks and giggles as I read. I really enjoyed the characters, as usual.Problems with the story:Nitpick: The code names the Zeroes assign to people are names that their group came up with on their own. This means, other groups should not know or use the same code names. Example: Piper calls Ren \"Glitch.\" \"Glitch\" is the name Nate gave Ren. Piper should have another name for her as I'm sure Ren's own name for herself was not \"Glitch\", just like Davey's name for himself probably was not \"Coin\".Major issue: A big glossing over of facts: Finally, someone is going to tell us what the Zeroes are, how they got their powers but the explanation that comes is \"meh\". There's no better way for me to put it. \"We're Y2K! The internet and social networks through it just catching on and being created made us!\" I almost felt that they could have just left the Zero power as a mystery. Nobody knows. Guess we'll have to ask God after we die. I probably would have been more okay with that. The ending: it did for me what the epilogue of Deathly Hallows did, make me angry. I didn't want to hear about anyone's far future. I want to know how their current issues are resolved. Did Thibault go back home to his family to try again, did he figure out how to inverse his powers to be more like Nate's? That would help him go home again and have his family remember. Does Nate's criminal record get cleared and how? What do his parents think? Does Riley make up with Lily and her parents? Does Chelsie make a relationship with her mom and new family? How does Chizara's family feel about Chizara having a girlfriend? Ethan... Now I liked his resolution. That was interesting. But still, what happened when they had to go back to Cambria? That was the ending I needed, not the far future and plugs that there may be a future series called The Ones.Overall, I give the whole series 4 stars. I usually give series I enjoy 5 stars for the last book as an overall rating for the entire series. I couldn't do that for this series because of the last few chapters. I would give the first 85% of this book 4 stars and had the book concluded with that power, it would have earned the 5 star overall from me. But hey, it makes me want to go and write some fan fiction about the immediate end for the characters instead of the far future and even some fan fiction stretching out their road trip to add some adventures. So, that's great!"}, {"userName": "Leah Szepesi", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55185540-leah-szepesi", "userReview": "Rating: 71/100Full Review on Planet Audiobook: https://planetaudiobook.wordpress.com...Overall Takeaway:I am so torn on this book. There were so many truly bad elements, but I still really enjoyed it. In particular, I found the characters really easy to root for -it wasn't that they were likable, but rather that I found their struggles resonated with real life, and their stories genuinely heart breaking. This is a dark YA trilogy, and I felt like it walked the line between serious and depressing really well. That being said, almost every character is robbed of closure in the end and the worldbuilding, while incredibly creative and SUPER interesting, is extremely sloppy and makes little sense. I kept expecting things to come together, for the details to click, and for the characters to wrap up all those story lines with the various secondary characters and within the zeroes. I thought there would be some kind of explanation, even a bad one! But instead, the book has a very rushed ending that ties things up without explaining why anything happened and left me with the feeling that even if the protagonist weren't involved in the story at all, essentially the same things would have all happened. It's really too bad -these are some of the most creative super powers I've read, and some very likable, real characters, but the book wasn't able to bring the plot together in a logical way in the end.On a final note -the audiobook for this book is PHENOMENAL. I was blown away by the talent of the reader, and I wouldn't want to take away from her performance because of the material she was reading! I definitely intend to listen to more from her."}, {"userName": "bjneary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62411-bjneary", "userReview": "I was mesmerized from page 1, the Zeroes are still reeling from their run in from enemies intent on destruction and evil.

Thank you to NetGalley and Simon and Schuster Children\u2019s Publishing and Simon Pulse for the advance reader copy Nexus by Scott Westerfeld, Margo Lanagan and Deborah Biancotti in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ricky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7644190-ricky", "userReview": "Westerfeld, Lanagan, and Biancotti bring the Zeroes trilogy to a pretty action-packed conclusion in Nexus - not quite on the same one-year cycle as the first two books, more like almost a year and a half after Swarm. Which, given the second book's massive cliffhanger, was a pretty aggravatingly long wait.Sure, at times, Nexus moves a little too fast for its own good, and adds a few too many characters for its own good - some of whom are, deliberately, repeats of some of the first book's original Zeroes. Multiple Bellwethers, multiple Crashes, etc. At least we don't get multiple Scams, that would've annoyed me to no end. But I'm actually glad we get a lot of Bellwether's side of things in this book, because while he was always flat and underwritten to me before, here he hits rock bottom and has to claw his way back up. Finally, he validates his presence for me.Perhaps the best part of the book is that it ends with a surprisingly happy ending. Sure, it's a bit bittersweet, but not as lethal as I expected. A breath of fresh air and hope going forward, even though we won't be seeing any more from the Zeroes. Unless Westerfeld et al. decide to reboot the series in the future the way Westerfeld's doing with Uglies now? Je ne sais pas.But for now, I hereby bid the Zeroes trilogy vas ir...anoshe."}, {"userName": "Catie Currie", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27455185-catie-currie", "userReview": "[I reallllly hope he does a \"Ones\" spinoff series (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60949-tony", "userReview": "Dear Net Galley, Thank you for the ARC. I have another book from Scott to read. I will get there soon. I promise. Years and years ago, the greatest X-men comic of all time was written. It was called God Loves Man Kills. If you have not read it, that is OK because the third, and final, installment of Zeroes is that book, just longer and with a lot more chaos. On a purely superhero vs super villain level, this book does not work as the villains just want something good for themselves. I can not imagine being hunted and threatened in the way the Zeroes were and not going a bit crazy. That was captured pretty perfectly. What keeps this from being a five star book? Well, most of the final chapters are the problem. I do not want to be spoiler McGhee, so read this book. If you have not read the whole series, read it. It is hard for me to say anything is as good as Midnighters or I like any character as much as I like Dess, but this series is Midnighters equal and Thibault is every bit Dess' equal. Run, do not walk people. Scott, is Netflix banging down your door to get the rights to this? If not, they should be."}], "description": "X-Men meets Heroes when New York Times bestselling author Scott Westerfeld teams up with award-winning authors Margo Lanagan and Deborah Biancotti in the final book of an explosive trilogy about a group of teens with amazing abilities.After the shocking conclusion to Swarm, the zeroes are scattered, on the run, and desperate.
