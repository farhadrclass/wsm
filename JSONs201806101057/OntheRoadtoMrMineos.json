What a wonderful mix of characters introduced throughout the book! What a ruckus one little one-legged homing pigeon can cause! What beautifully flawed characters Barbara O'Connor creates. Fantastic community story. Loved it. Highly recommend for students 4th grade and up! (Maybe even third grade when they're strong readers!) Reading any Barbara O'Connor book puts a huge smile on my face, to be honest."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2342686-amy", "userReview": "I think my Mr. Mineo lives in my quaint little village...along with Stella, Gerald, Mutt and the others. Or maybe he once lived here....during a time when barbershops were gathering places and children spent their time creating memories in tree houses or riding their bikes. I enjoyed the multi-generational pursuit of the one legged pigeon and the ways he literally flew in and out of their lives while unknowingly creating such angst among them. While I enjoyed the book, I try to put myself into the hearts and minds of my students and ask myself \"Will there be anything to hold their attention and make them feel a connection with the story? I just don't know. Will they be able to relate to some of the characters? Yes. Will they be able to keep track of all their names as the story unfolds? Not sure. Can they embrace the pursuit of a one-legged pigeon by a group of townspeople? Possibly... if you give them reasons to. My strong readers will be able to deduce why each character desires the pigeon in a different way. My reluctant readers will not see it...at least without some assistance. This might make a good classroom read aloud or a wonderful chapter book for a select few. Not sure how wide of an audience it will reach."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225934-karen", "userReview": "This story starts at a very slow pace, and the reader gets to view events through multiple characters, even though the story is done in all 3rd person. Barbara O'Connor was masterful at writing a book about a very small, but unique thing - a one-legged pigeon - and each time she circles around to the same characters, she very deftly adds layers to the story that help it build. But in the end, much like The Small Adventure of Popeye and Elvis, the reader gets to celebrate with O'Connor the small things in life that mean so much to each of us for different reasons. It's a simpler life. I find it ironic that just today in the newspaper, I read an article about the lovely simplicity of Mayberry and how much those of us who watched it each week, loved that simplicity of life. That's exactly what Barbara O'Connor has created with On the Road to Mr. Mineo's."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419395-betsy", "userReview": "Hmm\u2026 I read this book over Christmas and today I sat down to finally write a review of it. But I didn't remember ANYTHING about it until after reading the summery again. Telling? I think so. It's a fine story, well written, just not memorable for me in the least. I remember thinking I was glad it was over, and I could move on to more interesting fare. No doubt there are some kids out there who will enjoy it, especially those who enjoy stories in which the setting is almost a character in its own right and in which the plot meanders through the book--giving you plenty of time to get to know everyone. But it was not a book that grabbed me."}, {"userName": "Ms.Gaye", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3710758-ms-gaye", "userReview": "O'Connor is good at bringing characters to life and there exists a tension among the various people trying to catch the pigeon, but other than being curious about the connection between the dog and the pigeon, I had little desire to find out what would happen. Adult characters with names Edsel, Luther, and Ethel and words like 'diddly-squat', 'gol-dern-it' and 'hisself' held no appeal for me. While I loved the regional dialogue used in Three Times Lucky, this book lacked the same appeal.

I loved this one. The spare language, the simple story, the endearing, country characters, the authentic kids, the dusty roads, and southern tone all make it a quintessential O'Connor book. I think, for me, it's an escape into a world in which I want to live. I want to escape the strife, polarization, and angst and just look for a one-legged pigeon and make sure its safe and sound where it belongs, along with a little brown dog.

First, Stella tries to catch it with the help of her friend Gerald, because she really wants a dog, and she has nothing better to do. Stella's brother Levi see the bird, and think it would be a good idea to catch it. Mutt has the bird land on his head, but no one believes him, so he wants to catch it. The pigeon hides a lot of the time in the barn of an argumentative old couple, the Ropers, who also have a small brown mutt staying there. Mr. Mineo is oblivious to the sightings of Sherman around town, and is sad that Sherman is missing, because he got the pigeons from his brother, who passed away. Eventually, the people who are trying to catch Sherman figure out the connection to Mr. Mineo, and everyone works together to get the pigeon where he belongs. Strengths: This is very well-written, and I can see it being the sort of book that fourth grade teachers read aloud to their classes. The cadence of the paragraphs changes nicely, there are lots of good descriptions of people and places, and it's just the right length.Weaknesses: I had a hard time getting away from the \"pigeons are rats with feathers\" point of view, and the quirky Southern setting was something I never enjoy. Elementary students could be sold on this, but for middle school students, there is not enough action."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "You won't find car chases or superheroes, but you'll find a gentle story of the dreams, worries, and hopes that Sherman, a homing pigeon who has wandered from his home evokes among the townsfolk of Meadville, South Carolina. Stella wants him as a pet, and enlists her friend Gerald to help her, and a the same time thwart her brother Levi (and his scabby kneed, germ infested gang of friend) from getting him. Amos and Ethel Roper, the Meadville version of the Bickersons, argue about the one legged pigeon (and a little brown dog) who have invaded their barn and their lives. Mr Mineo and his dog Ernie spend their days searching for the wayward Sherman. Mutt Reynard, the Meadville boy who cried wolf, wants to catch him to prove to everyone he wasn't lying about a one legged pigeon landing on his head. And Luther and Edsel play checkers outside the Chinese restaurant, and watch the town children run around town on their hunt for the bird. The plot isn't complicated, but is told in such a droll, delightful way, with the characters all very real. I could see a teacher using this as a discussion book in a class. The descriptions, style of writing (with humorous descriptors repeating frequently in the text), and the winding threads of the story would be great to dissect and discuss.

Meet Stella, her friend, Gerald, Arthur Mineo, rightful owner of the pigeon along with his dog, Ernie, Luther and Edsel who play checkers and battle a mischievous truck engine, Amos and Ethel Roper who love to argue, and Mutt Raynard who lies.This is a story of friendship, of bullies, of partners in crime, and of the magical power of dogs and birds to transform the ordinary, the routine, the possibly hopeless into something oh so much more.Barbara O'Connor has magic in her pen and in her heart. She is one of those authors who notices, remembers and shares the little feelings and the small moments and intersections in lives that weave together to make a big story. Here she laces the lives of all of her wonderful small town characters together. They all have the same mission it turns out whether they know it or not. It has something to do with a bird and something to do with the wonder of our stories and our lives and how we share them with each other. Delightful. Refreshing.

I liked the quirkiness of the characters from Stella and Gerald to Mr Mineo, to Sherman the one-legged pigeon.The story is told by switching from one narrative perspective to another\u2014although not in first person. I was engaged in the action throughout the story\u2014an effect I believe is due to the swiftly shifting narrative perspectives, it backfires as a literary device when it comes to character. I found myself wanting deeper character development particularly in the children: Stella and Gerald. It seems to me that there is so much more to be learned about them, but each time we approach some insightful, revealing moment the narrative switches to two old men playing checkers for half a page.I do not recommend this as a read-aloud selection because there is so little character development. I do not see this story holding the interest of the majority of students in a classroom. A much better choice by this author is FAME AND GLORY IN FREEDOM, GEORGIA (my absolute favorite by this author) or for slightly older readers (middle school and up): GREETINGS FROM NOWHERE."}, {"userName": "C.E.

No one has special powers? But then as I read more I remembered all those weird ambitions I chased after so stubbornly as a child -- I'm going to develop telekinesis by staring at this pencil every day for hours and willing it to move. I'm going to dig a hole to China with this spade in the garden. I'm going to get this dying bat I found in my garage to imprint on me and fly behind me wherever I go.
