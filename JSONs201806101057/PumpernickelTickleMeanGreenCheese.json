By the time I started high school I had completely forgotten about it, except some vague recollection of the title. It wasn't until I tracked down a copy and re-read it that I remembered it, and loved it just as much as I did the first time."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132033-stephanie", "userReview": "This is another childhood book of my brother's that I have revisted with my daughter. It is the story of Benjamin and Elephant, who have been asked by Benjamin's mother to go to the grocer's with a short list of items to buy for lunch. On the way, the two friends' conversation devolves into word-play and rhymes, leading Benjamin to forget what he was supposed to remember and culminating in my favorite insult in the whole world (from Benj to El): \"You're a hunk-a-bunk with a big fat trunk!\" Thankfully (spolier alert), Benjamin eventually remembers what he was supposed to buy and disaster is averted."}], "description": "Benjamin and Elephant are sent to the store to buy some groceries but Elephant makes so many rhymes and puns on the list that they forget what they are supposed to buy.", "title": "Pumpernickel Tickle & Mean Green Cheese", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1370018.Pumpernickel_Tickle_Mean_Green_Cheese", "average": 4.43, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1266784784l/1370018.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/479577.Nancy_Patz", "name": "Nancy Patz"}], "type": ["Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1370018.Pumpernickel_Tickle_Mean_Green_Cheese", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/942981.Who_Was_the_Woman_Who_Wore_the_Hat_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1157378.Babies_Can_t_Eat_Kimchee_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1446215.Moses_Supposes_His_Toeses_Are_Roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253700.Gina_Farina_and_the_Prince_of_Mintz", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1676008.Nobody_Knows_I_Have_Delicate_Toes"]}
