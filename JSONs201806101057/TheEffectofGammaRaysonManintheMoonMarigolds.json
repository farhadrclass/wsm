The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds  as a film resonated strongly with me, so I figured I should read the play and perhaps even compare the literary work and the movie. But after reading the play, I realized just how well Paul Newman had captured Tillie's situation and transferred it to the screen. The living conditions that border on deplorable, being just a few steps above abject poverty, living with an embittered mother and unwell sister, constantly being disregarded as the youngest and quietest, being the odd-one out at school thanks to all of the above... yes, both the play and the movie encapsulate the feelings of aloneness, distance, differentness. Tillie is radically different from her setting, both in her demeanor and tastes. She is an introverted, scientifically minded girl who does her Science fair project with so much diligence, and despite being used as a verbal punching bag, she still finds enough kindness in herself to nurture a bunny, do things for her mother (more than she is supposed to do!) and treat Nanny, the elderly boarder her mother has taken in, with respect.The symbolism of Tillie's science project - Man-in-the-Moon marigolds exposed to various degrees of radiation - becomes obvious after being immersed in Tillie's life. Just as the modestly radiated marigolds, which have grown into wonderful specimens with useful mutations, it's hinted that that will be the outcome of Tillie's growing up in a toxic environment - a beautiful and strong human being."}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7027982-shawn", "userReview": "What a devastatingly great play. The play does show its age a bit, a little rust around the edges, but nothing that a good director couldn\u2019t adjust. This is an emotional play about a mother and her relationship with both of her daughters. In some ways you can say there are parallels to of the mother and Willie Loman from Death of a Salesman. Both have not accomplished what they thought they would in life, and both fooling themselves to an extent, only the mother in this is so much more self aware of her failures. Her misery she inflicts on to both her daughters with little to no thought as to what she is doing to them. One daughter is at the point or rebelling the other is there trying to appease. I thought this was a very accurate portrayal of this kind of unhealthy family dynamic, you often see this in families with an alcoholic parent."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2218174-michelle", "userReview": "I've always wanted to read this play because of the title -it's a great title. One of the worst mothers in all of literary history and one of the most hopeful, sweet protagonists.

I'm not quite sure how it arrived there, although I think I may have acquired it for free at a book giveaway at my alma mater's library. To be completely transparent, I was simply looking for a quick book to read and noticed that this one was short and appeared relatively interesting, so I grabbed it and flipped through it to find out it was actually a short play, and also found the text to be quite spaced out on the page\u2014two things that encouraged my reading of it.A bit of brief history: The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds had its world premier in the theatre in 1964 and was published in book form in 1970. It was later adapted for the screen in 1972. Its author is Paul Zindel, a playwright and science teacher from Staten Island, New York.The plot centers around a dysfunctional family: a widow named Beatrice Hunsdorfer and her two daughters, Matilda (\"Tillie\") and Ruth. Throughout the play, the introverted-yet-highly-intelligent child Tillie prepares an experiment for her school's science fair involving marigolds raised from seeds exposed to varying degrees of radioactivity. However, her self-centered and abusive mother, Beatrice, continuously attempts to halt Tillie's progress due to her own self-loathing and overall abusive nature toward her children. The other daughter, Ruth, is more extroverted than Tillie but considerably mentally unstable. As the play develops, Tillie wins the science fair through perseverance, Ruth repeatedly attempts to stand up to her mother but experiences several nervous breakdowns, and Beatrice is eventually driven insane and commits several violent acts toward her family and local community. However, despite it all, Tillie continues to believe that everyone is truly valuable.I greatly enjoyed this play\u2014even though I don't have much experience reading plays. The story is much more character-driven than plot driven, as there isn't a whole lot going on plot-wise, but the characters are fascinating to observe. Watching Beatrice treat her daughters with such vitriol and warden-like control is difficult but it makes for an intriguing book that is difficult to put down. Zindel does an excellent job of keeping the reader in the dark about many of the plot points and character reveals, waiting until the right moment to present new information that will help to understand what is going on in the family's overall dynamic. Even though I don't typically go to the theatre, I would certainly consider seeing this play performed live, and I highly recommend giving it a read if you get a chance, as I was pleasantly surprised."}, {"userName": "Jori Richardson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089955-jori-richardson", "userReview": "This heart wrenching story has to be my favorite play of all time.Written from the innocent, simplistically factual view of a bright young middle-schooler, Tillie, we are introduced to a tense family scene where love and hate often blur into indistinguishable lines. The two supporting characters, her sister Ruth and her embittered mother Beatrice, are some of the strongest characters I have ever read.This book is short, concise, and easy to get through, writing at the approximate level of a middle schooler. However, the story-line remains entirely adult, mature, and haunting. Regardless of its number of pages, this is one of the most powerful books I have ever read.Paul Zindel has brilliantly combined childhood with mature and sobering conflicts - this book is depressing and a bit disturbing, unabashedly honest, and extraordinarily written. One of my favorite books of all time."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia", "userReview": "Such an intense little play around a single mother doing the best she can, which is not very! She doesn't understand either of her daughters, she uses emotional manipulation with everyone, and seems so broken at the end. Tillie, the Zindel alter-ego, is a spunky little girl who sees a future, starting with her mutatant marigold seeds. She's a survivor we root for. I love it when students force their books -- and plays -- on me.

I have such a strong sense of familiarity with this play that know I\u2019ve read or seen this one before but I entirely forget when and where--maybe I saw it as a play in the park or read it in high school when my parents would have probably lent it to me because I was in the science fair, or both. In any case, that deja-vu let it have an even more haunting effect. It\u2019s about a damaged woman who lets her own self-destructive(?) nature take a toll on her children. Her one daughter Ruth suffers from epilepsy and is hungry for love and attention, getting rewarded in cigarettes and lipstick for scratching her mother\u2019s back. Her other daughter, Tillie, shows promise and interest in science but is often kept home from school. When Tillie wins the science fair at school her mother implodes from shame or jealousy or helplessness or desperation, or all of these at once. Tillie\u2019s science fair project involves the effects of radiation on marigolds and she finds that though some flowers die from over-exposure, others with less exposure mutate in strange and wonderful ways. This, of course, is a metaphor for her mother\u2019s emotional radiation on her daughters, producing harm in Ruth but perhaps a more resilient and unexpected result in Tillie. What impressed me in this short play was the perfection of the mutation theme. We often see abusive homes in a purely destructive light--that the children who are products of a divorced family are \u201charmed,\u201d for instance, but the reality is somewhat more complex. Instead of \u201charm,\u201d \u201cmutation\u201d is perhaps a more apt and optimistic comparison--these children are changed, and some perhaps even damaged, but this may be a strange and wonderful condition rather than a wholly pathetic one."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2308768-erin", "userReview": "I was required to read this play in Language Arts class when I was a middle school student, and I just re-read it this week as I am preparing to coach the Academic Superbowl team at the middle school where I now teach.While I might describe the storyline as powerful and thought-provoking, I would not say that I enjoyed it (then or now).

The Beverly Clearly ones gave me a slight smile, the Frances Lattimore ones which I adored in the late 60s were nice to read again, but were clearly dated. Judy Blume's Deenie was fine, but when I got to Forever, I was bored stiff and stopped. Now it was time to move on to Paul Zindel a huge favorite of my as a tween and young teen. He has not disappointed.I re-read his Pigman for the first time since the early 70s and it was great. I loved this play probably even a bit more now than then, as I can look back clearly at my dysfunctional childhood with an extremely damaged, abusive and unstable mother. Sometimes when you are young your surroundings affect you deeply, but you are in the midst of it and you know somehow your home is not like other kid's homes, but you deal with it as there is no alternative, especially if you have no other family and your father does not live with you.Now @ 55, I get to look back and see what other unstable mothers do and say to their daughters, and wonder how they turn out once adults.

With a sister, Ruth, who suffers from convulsions and a mother, Beatrice, who is mentally and emotionally abusive, Tillie stays true to herself and finds beauty in the world.I like Tillie. She keeps her emotions even and steady, as if showing enthusiasm or excitement will be the spark that starts the wild fire at home. Her mother's frequent statement, \"you're giving me a headache,\" comes when she expresses a little passion for what she is learning. You only see her true emotion in those last few hopeful lines.Ruth responds differently to her mother's abuse. She pushes the limits, as if she is tackling the conflict head on. Ironically, Ruth seems to have a better relationship with Beatrice, though she is less reserved and more likely to cause drama. Ruth also suffers from convulsions. She has nightmares. Ruth implies that her illness is caused by her mother driving her nuts, and there is an incomplete memory which implies that Ruth has had to deal with disease and possibly even death. Her boldness covers up the vulnerability we glimpse throughout the second act.Beatrice is the most disturbing and intricate character of all. I tread lightly here to avoid spoilers. Her mutation under the effects of public high school, combined with events later in life, result in a vicious, petty, snide woman who hates the ugly world in a way that directly contradicts Tillie's appreciation for it. What makes her most interesting is that she fails to shape Tillie into a duplicate of herself. Despite her toxic environment, Tillie chooses to create life for her science experiment, instead of choosing to destroy life."}, {"userName": "Swankivy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy", "userReview": "I didn't know anything about this book going into reading it, so I was surprised (but not at all disappointed) when I found it was a play. I think I would have enjoyed a play more than I enjoyed reading it, but what stood out to me most was the way the words managed to relay an ambiance that felt desperate, disorganized, and inspiring at the same time. The mother, Beatrice, felt almost like a caricature, but I understand from reading the author's notes that this was an autobiographical play to some extent and the author based Beatrice on his own mother. She was abusive and unhinged to both her daughters, and used the mental instability of one of them against her even though she was also mentally ill--I found that heart-rending and realistic. I liked Tillie's steadfast desire to be more and to stop living in fear, and I liked the way you could feel the history from the characters' conversations in a way that didn't feel entirely contrived despite its dependence on as-you-know-Bob type storytelling sometimes. Still, the darkness and despair left me in the dumps while reading it even though there was inspiration around its edges.

Whoopi Goldberg raised herself and her little girl out of poverty, why don't they write a play about that. I don't want a sunshiny happy ending, just for a play with roles for women as varied and complex as those offered to men or a play were the poor are not just portrayed as alcohol fueled abusers. O'Neil's play Long Day's Journey into Night is also about self destruction, but the mother is not treated with as much distain or ranker as is reflected in Marigold's monstrous mother and older daughter characters.
