Real life interference did not help either. This is going to be long so I made some headlines for easier navigation. The Author and the novel in shortIsmail Kadare is probably the best know Albanian writer and one of the best resources to learn about the country\u2019s tumultuous past, culture and mentality. He started writing during the Communist regime in Albania and most of his work was either criticized or banned in the country because it appeared to criticized the regime. Kadare became famous internationally when his novel, The General of the Dead Army, was published in France. In Broken April, Kadare writes about one of them most peculiar and specific parts of Albanian culture, the feudal set of laws, Kanun, and its terrible Vendetta rules, Gjakmarrja. When one person is killed the family members are bound to revenge the murder by taking the life of the killer and so on. In the novel, Gjorgu, kills his brother\u2019s murderer and is waiting his turn to be hunted down by the dead man\u2019s family. He has to perform all the necessary preparations for the vendetta to continue its bloody course, including a walk to a distant village to pay a ``blood tax'' to the region's ruling family.Bessian and Diana are in their Honeymoon. Since the husband makes a living writing about the Kanun, he proposed to visit the remote mountain villages where the laws are most prevalent. Although at the beginning the couple is close, as they continue their journey and discover more about the traditions they become more and more distant. While Bessian finds himself fascinated by the Kanun and Gjakmarrja, Diana is silently appalled. One day, Diana sees Gjorgu as he returns from the blood tax payment and becomes fascinated by the young man and marked by his sad destiny. During the remaining of their trip the couple will be followed by the specter of Gorju\u2019s impending death. Albanian HistoryTo understand the appearance of The Kanun in Albania I believe the history of the country should be understood. It was the victim of numerous wars, occupations and sorrows, like almost all Balkan countries. My Albanian GR friend. Lorena, wrote this to me about her country\u2019s history and I believe it explains a lot. \u201cAlbania was always a cross country where rulers, kings, princes, leaders of various countries came and went away, each of them draining the people's energy and motive. Don't forget the roman empire rule, the Byzantium rule, ottoman empire rule for almost 500 years, 2 world wars and later the Italian protectorate. Just think about what a mixture of mentalities and circumstance behaviours developed throughout history.\u201d The different rulers and lack of trust in justice made the remote villages in the mountains to develop their own set of rules.The Kanun According to Wikipedia, The Kanun was developed by Lek\u00eb Dukagjini, who codified the existing customary laws. It was spread mainly in the mountainous North of the country where foregners and their laws could not enter. It can also be found in the surrounding areas formerly in Yugoslavia where there is a large\u00a0ethnic Albanian\u00a0population;\u00a0Montenegro,\u00a0Kosovo\u00a0and\u00a0Macedonia. It was first codified in the 15th century and it was used in that for until 20th century. It was recently after the fall of the\u00a0communist regime\u00a0in the early 1990s. While not unique in concept it\u2019s strict set of rules made Albanian Kanun probably the most feared.Regarding the Gjakmarrja, the laws say that if someone is killed the family members have to find and revenge the murder with blood. However, it doesn\u2019t stop here. The family of the initial murderer now has to revenge their death and so on. The result is generations old family feuds and hundreds of deaths, resulting even in the complete decimation of a family. If this was crazy, note that if a person is murdered as a guest, the host is responsible to revenge the death. So, if you are lucky enough to have your guest killed, then the course is on you. The person is someone\u2019s guest until it leaves the borders of the village where the host\u2019s house is located. If the murdered person is outside the village but still looking towards it then the responsibility is still with the host. Maybe this is a good reason not to have any visitors in your house, isn\u2019t it? Well you can\u2019t. According to the Kanun, visitors cannot be denied entrance in a house without facing serious punishment. In the novel, an entire village was burned down because they refused to shelter a visitor. As such, if a stranger knock on the door he has to be received, no matter if he wears the Gjakmarrja mark, a black bandana around the arm. I also have to mention a few marriage rules. Marriage is never cancelled. Even if the future wife is dying she will be brought to get married. If there is a death in the family the marriage will continue. The dead goes out of the house and the wife inside. The husband receives from the woman\u2019s family, together with the dowry, a bullet in case the wife is unfaithful. I was appalled by all these rules, which in my opinion are barbaric and illogic. I might be able to understand them in feudal ages but some of them are still used Today. Many Albanian have left the country citing the blood feuds as the reason for their refugee seeking. Some were fake, true, as the endemic corruption in Albania found a way to make money from this as well. Corruption and bad management of the state is actually one of the main reasons of the Kanun revival. People believe that when the law does nothing to help then the responsibility for justice falls in one\u2019s own hands. Feelings about Broken AprilThe writing is simple, clinical, without embroideries. However, the feeling of doom and irreversibility is masterfully done. The repetition of the Kanun laws coming from different characters only adds to the overhanging dark atmosphere. Gorju\u2019s silent reluctance to fulfill the laws which are bound to lead to his ultimate death and his preparations gave me goose bumps. The relationship between the married couple and their equally silent fallout added to the story and give two opposing perspectives that a stranger to these customs could have when he/she is faced with them. I am thankful that I read Broken April even if it haunted my dreams for a while. Also, now I understand the Taken movie plot."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "286.\tBroken April, Ismail KadareBroken April is a novel by award winning Albanian author Ismail Kadare.

There are not many novels around with such a simple and yet powerfully evocative style. More than the plot in itself what counts here is the atmosphere Kadare is able to recreate.I actually perceived the mist and the cold as well as the brightless nights and the wind-swept landscapes where the novel takes place with an uncommon intensity.As a reader who gets easily distracted, \"Broken April\" meant an unusual business to me: this book never lost its grip over me from the very first to the last page.I don't know that much about Albania apart from being aware that Italian fought a useless and aggressive war there (\"We will break the kidneys of Albania!\" barked Mussolini back in 1939) and that the country hosted one of the most senseless dictators - even for the crazy communist standards - in the world, Enver Hoxha.For a striking majority of Italians, contemporary Albania is a God-forsaken country, a place good for ruffians, pimps, prostitutes and hosting bogus universities where our dull politicians get their fake degrees. Besides, the massive waves of desperate immigration coming from the coasts of Albania which reached Italy in the 1990s didn't help in the way our neighbours are perceived. It's true how there are Albanians involved in criminal activities in Italy, but then again it's always the bad guys who get all the news. Just like it happens with Romanians - who share a similar bad reputation in Italy and had a megalomaniac dictator too - there are thousands of good, honest, hardworking and considerate Albanian immigrants between the Alps and Sicily. But this is pretty obvious, isn't it?\"Broken April\" deals at the same time with backwardness and cultural heritage of Albania introducing the equally wonderful and terrifying \"Kanun\" an ancient code to settle arguments and controversies in the remote Albanian plateaus. A code where vengeance through family feuds under brutal but strict rules is a focal point and that reminded me quite a lot the way disputes were handled in some parts of southern Italy and Sardinia. The Albanian Kanun, however, seem to be more structured and taken more seriously by the local inhabitants than its Italian less official counterparts.This novel speaks about the Kanun and the people living (and quite often dying) according to its principles, but it's also an excellent cross-section of the Albanian mountaineers, a people able to welcome the Church and the Islam without losing most of its peculiar habits and with a fascination for towers. There is a distinct beauty in the uniqueness of \"Broken April\" and this quality more than compensates the slight disappointment of a plot and an ending which could have been a bit better. Not that it really matters as what makes this novel very good is not its storytelling, but where the story itself happens. This is the first book by Ismail Kadare I've ever read and most likely the first of a long series. Here we have an author who definitely has something to say and somewhere to speak about. I'd like to listen more of it."}, {"userName": "May", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20416955-may", "userReview": "Una novela muy interesante, con unos personajes muy bien trabajados y que trata un tema que hace que la lectura sea muy amena: el Kanun."}, {"userName": "Ataur Rahman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369909-ataur-rahman", "userReview": "When reading this book I recalled \"Blindness\" of Saramago. Broken April is haunting, dark, disturbing and yet strangely attractive. The narration is so matter of fact yet the chill of death is looming in every word.

There is always a sense of weirdness and unreality in the way the Mountainsmen deal with death, revenge, honour, realtionships,obeisance. Yet there is the uncanny feeling that our so called modern society is perhaps no different in the way it kills and mechanises death.

However, I thought a particular plot device, an ancient book of laws and social mores which is the source of the problems that the main character, Gjorg Berisha, endures, was a fictional invention of the author. Ffs, what real-life culture would codify into their common law rules about ritual assassinations, a cascading continuation of murder after murder of selected individuals to be passed down from generation to generation? No society would make up such an idiotic Code! Right? No, never happened! Uh, wait...The mind-boggling discoveries I made after googling some of the elements in this translated story, written in 1978, are that ritual blood feuds actually happened in Albania's past and are STILL happening today in the rural areas and mountains of Albania. Plus, an ancient book of laws and mores, a book called the Kanun which describes how when and where these murders should occur, along with required ritual chanting which must be performed while murdering, is actually a real book STILL followed religiously by some rural villages in Albania!The descriptions of what this ancient book contains remind me of parts of the Qu'ran, Bible and Torah, only WAY more bizarre since the laws in this book demand people follow additional social rules of ritual murder that seem insane to me. Any kind of death, whether accidental or intentional, begins an endless spiral of ritualized murder which must be performed within a year to restore the dead person's family's or village's honor. The dead person who is being avenged does not even have to be known to anyone in the village where the person died. The person who died could be a total stranger who was a temporary guest of a villager, like a thirsty traveler stopping to ask for a drink of water, who then was attacked by an unknown robber after leaving the village. The villager, not the unknown robber, becomes responsible for satisfying the Code of Blood Feud as stated in the Kanun.Unbelievably, there is a traditional legal system set up in the participating villages of Albania to adjudicate the Code. Certain Albanian elders are judged to be sufficiently learned in interpreting the laws of the Kanun. These gentlemen are sent for whenever there is a question who should be killed in response to a death, and who should be the 'justicer', as the murderer is officially named. It does not matter if the honor murder is performed on an innocent man or a guilty one as long as the selected individual satisfies the Kanun laws and rituals. The murder must be undertaken only in certain areas of a home or a town, in certain times of the day, within a year. A person selected to be murdered can travel safely while on certain designated roads and paths, but as soon as that person leaves the 'safe' road or path, then that person can be murdered. There are also designated 'safe houses', which actually are towers made of stone built here and there across the landscape in Albania. These towers are full of ex-justicers who are now vulnerable to revenge in the chain of murders in these blood feuds. These men can never leave the tower without fearing a bullet to the head. The Code requires that a murdered man's death must be avenged, and then that person's murder must be avenged, and then that murder must be avenged, and then that murder must be avenged, etc. Forever. Literally forever. I am not joking or exaggerating. In addition, if the murder is bungled, and only wounds are sustained by the selected person to have been murdered, then the justicer has to pay the victim a fine for each wound. Or they could count the wound as part settlement of the blood that was owed. In that case, the justicer can inflict wounds until the blood account was fully paid. Else, the clock is still ticking when the murder must occur by the justicer on the victim, and a fine is still owed the victim for each wound. Once the justicer accomplishes his blood-feud revenge murder, then he must pay a death tax to the local authorities (the authority who is in charge of collecting the blood tax is called 'The Steward of the Blood'). The justicer can be granted the short bessa - a 24-hour truce by the murdered man's family, or the murdered man's family can agree to giving the justicer a month-long truce - the long bessa. At the end of the bessa, the justicer can be killed by another appointed justicer in revenge, unless he goes to live in a tower of refuge, unable to ever leave the tower for the rest of his life.Traditional law is a bitch, gentle reader.Another character in the novel, Bessian Vorpsi, is a journalist. He is on his honeymoon with his beautiful wife, Diana, traveling to the high plateaus of the Albanian mountains. They both are modern urbanites, but Bessian has always wanted to see the Code at work. He thinks the Kanun is a romantic relic of Albanian history, majestic and legendary. But as their journey proceeds, he is puzzled more and more by Diana's behavior. As they pass men wearing black ribbons, the sign of the wearer being part of a blood feud and thus a walking dead man, Diana becomes withdrawn. Was it a mistake to have a honeymoon in the mountains? She did not know much about the Code, but as he explains it to her as they travel, she gets quieter and quieter. What is wrong? Does she not see it is the glorious choice of Shakespeare's Hamlet made large?Author Ismail Kadare is probably unknown to most of us, gentle reader. But he is famous in Europe, especially in France and Albania. In 2005 he won the Man Booker International Prize. He also has been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was born in Albania and went to University in Tirana, Albania. He attended the Gorky Institute for World Literature, a school for writers and critics in Moscow. Because of governmental disapproval of his books and other writings, he asked for and was granted asylum in 1990 in France.At first, I believed I was reading only a historical fiction novel about the culture of Albania that existed long ago in the past, and later, as I progressed deeper into the story of 'Broken April', I thought maybe it was also a symbolic folktale of Albania because of the novel's literary architecture. No. The story is not only those things. Instead, I learned that Kadare's story about the early 20th-century Albanian mountain and village people of the past is a real-life culture of people who still live outside of the legal governmental framework of Albania as if they were in the midst of the Middle Ages and not part of the 21st century. I read that 'Broken April' takes place between the World Wars, but it is difficult for me to believe that. The people of the Albanian plateaus live like people of the 13th century, in my opinion. The protagonists travel by horse and carriage, horseback and of course, on foot. However, on page 35, Gjorg Berisha, one of the main characters, sees an airplane in the sky flying overhead, and knows what it is. Amazing. I am still in shock by this story. https://www.theguardian.com/world/201...http://www.spiegel.de/international/w...Wikipedia link to a description and history of the Kanun:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanun...Here is a link to an interview with the author:http://pajtimi.com/faqebrenda.php?new...The American version of a blood feud:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfi..."}, {"userName": "Maryam Hosseini", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32974175-maryam-hosseini", "userReview": "\u0648\u0642\u0640\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0640\u0648\u0646 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u0634\u0640\u062e\u0640\u0635\u06cc \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0640\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f\u060c \u063a\u0644\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u062f\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0640\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u062c\u0640\u0627 \u0633\u0631\u0686\u0634\u0640\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0640\u06cc\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u06a9\u062c\u0627 \u062e\u0640\u0634\u0640\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0640\u0648\u062f \u0686\u0640\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0640\u0631\u062f\u061f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0644\u06a9\u0647 \u0633\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u0644 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0641\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u0634\u062f\u060c \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u060c \u0627\u0632 ...\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u067e\u0640\u06cc\u0634"}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7177008-jane", "userReview": "Set in the interwar years, this haunting novel tells of an Albanian blood feud: Gyakmarrja, as it affects several people: Gjorg [George], the unwilling killer of his murdered brother's killer; Bessian and Diana, a honeymooning couple who want to see the mountain area of Albania and to investigate the customs firsthand; and Mark, the \"steward of the blood\" [He collects what is called a \"blood-tax\" from a murderer's family and maintains Book of the Blood, giving details of every blood feud going back centuries]. Gjorg has a grace period or truce: bessa of thirty days before he becomes fair game for the bullet of his victim's family. Should a member of the victim's family kill Gjorg, this will restore their honor. Gjorg's story was the most fascinating--the murder, what he does in his time of reprieve, and his final shocking though inevitable fate. I felt Bessian was only a mouthpiece to explain the Kanun, the rigid set of laws governing every aspect of life and death of the mountain folk. Diana represented an outsider's view of the culture and Mark represented officialdom upholding the Kanun. This was a glimpse into a violent, brutal culture. Remote Albania still lives under its tenets in the present. The simple, unvarnished style made it readable in a short time for me. This dark short novel is a good introduction to Kadare. Dec. 27, 2014--I've recently viewed \"Beneath the sun\", a 2001 Brazilian movie with setting changed from Albania [the novel] to rural Brazil, but with the same theme of blood feud. I did reread the novel and it was just as good the second time."}, {"userName": "Nastaran", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22656442-nastaran",

Just about the most depressing book I have ever read: powerful, bleak and timeless. It's sometime in post-Ottoman, pre-Hoxha Albania and a blood feud is playing itself out through the eyes of a young mountaineer, who is hopelessly caught in the game, while a couple of urban honeymooners are rubbernecking their way around the High Plateau. Then it gets a bit Passage to India as done by Kafka. And it's drizzling in the grey mountains, where the widow in black sits by the road above the village where all the men are hiding in towers.REREAD: A year later, now in Albania, and with a year 11 class as a class text. We haven't had time to do it in much depth but I at least have had a deeper plunge into it, and frankly, it's a towering thing. Truly great European literature with rich, layered images and subtle, devastating truths. Not all of Kadare is like this, and so far in my reading this is by far the best.REREAD, AGAIN: and again with a class, this time in more depth. I'm still blown away.

I had no idea what to expect since I didn\u2019t know anything about the plot, or Kadare, or, as a matter of fact, Albania. I thought I saw an Albanian movie once, but I just checked and it\u2019s actually a Serbian film [not the Serbian film, if you know what I mean, I hope you don\u2019t, don\u2019t google it!]. Anyway, the story begins with a man lying behind a ridge, freezing his butt off, a rifle in his hands, waiting for some guy to show up so he can put a bullet in his head. He finishes the job, goes home, and it soon becomes clear that his family is involved in a blood feud with very strict rules, a practice that appears to be common in the Northern part of Albania where he lives. The government has no authority over the population in the area, the laws of the state are rejected, and the region is under the jurisdiction of an ancient social code called the Kanun which is basically a \u201cconstitution of death\u201d that endorses blood vengeance. At this point, I genuinely thought I was reading dystopian fiction, but listen to this: the Kanun is an actual, published set of laws whose influence, although much diminished, still leads to killings in modern-day Albania. Wikipedia says that \u201cIn 2014 about 3,000 Albanian families were estimated to be involved in blood feuds and this since the fall of Communism has led to the deaths of 10,000 people.\u201d This is according to an estimate by a large Albanian non-profit organization that states that 10447 people have been killed in blood feuds since the fall of Communism in the early 1990s and claims that more than 1000 families were in isolation in 2012 as a result of blood feuds. The organization was, however, accused of corruption and the statistics they claim are most likely exaggerated. Blood feuds still exist, but local prosecutors offer lower numbers that are seemingly more accurate. [more on this here and here]In any case, the Kanun isn\u2019t a figment of Kadare\u2019s imagination and I\u2019ll have to look somewhere else for dystopian fiction. It isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned when the story takes place, but it can be assumed that it\u2019s sometime in the 20th century. Most of the book concerns itself with explaining the workings of the Kanun through the changing perspective of a few characters and the story is tinged with a measure of absurdism and surrealism that establish a faint resemblance to Kafka (notably in the segment following Gjorg\u2019s trip to the castle to pay the blood tax). Obviously, Broken April has little in common with the Albania of today, but it offers a glimpse of a specific aspect of its past and easily takes the cake for the most fascinating book I\u2019ve read this year."}, {"userName": "George K.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4675995-george-k", "userReview":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728127-judy", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written, bleak and haunting novel, set between the wars in the mountains of northern Albania. It is very short and I read it in a day. The story centres on a family caught up in the blood feuds of this region, which sadly still exist, according to recent newspaper reports. The book centres on a complicated etiquette of death included in the Kanun, a set of traditional laws. After one man kills to avenge an insult, a duty of revenge continues until all the men of a household are either dead or sheltering in towers of sanctuary, unable to go out during daylight.Gjorg, the central character, is put under pressure by his family to kill the man who killed his brother - but, after carrying out the killing, he knows his own life is likely to be forfeit. He has just 30 days to live during a stay of execution (also laid down in the laws), before the family of his victim will in turn come after him. Can he escape, or is he in effect a dead man walking?As Gjorg struggles to come to terms with his probable fate, the book also features a honeymooning couple who come to visit the area, travelling in a dark carriage. The bridegroom, a writer, is fascinated by the blood feud culture, and sees it as material for future work, but his bride is understandably horrified. Through these characters, I get the impression that the author is wrestling with his own reasons for writing about the blood feuds and expressing some of his conflicting feelings. Lastly, I'm sorry not to know who the translator was (the title page just says that it was translated from the Albanian, presumably in-house by the publisher), because the prose style is great."}, {"userName": "Felix", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60690146-felix", "userReview": "The Albanian highlands are a gloomy place where hard-nosed and hard-scrabble peasants eke out a precarious living farming corn. Even the mountain fairies in their tales seem to be hard-nosed and hard-scrabble. What glamour there is in the peasants' lives derives from their participation in self-perpetuating blood-feuds, regulated (like everything else) by the ancient set of oral laws known as the Kanun.What sort of person goes there on his honeymoon? A fool, if you ask me. A somewhat romantic fool, perhaps - I will grant you that - but a fool nevertheless. Bessian is a fashionable writer from Tirana, the capital of Albania. He has made his name by works in which he waxed lyrical about the highlands, the peasants, and the Kanun. But he has never actually been there. So he takes his young, beautiful, and impressionable wife Diana to the highlands on their honeymoon-cum-research-trip. Predictably, nothing good comes out of it. At a late point in the novel, Bessian somewhat casually drops the name of Marx. It is not clear whether he has actually read or understood him, but in my opinion, he would have done far better by himself to attend carefully to Nietzsche's famous dictum \"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you\"."}, {"userName": "Mikheil", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10518229-mikheil", "userReview":

As in his other works, Ismail Kadare captures a great deal with a few words.Read this and anything else by this author."}, {"userName": "Oto Bakradze", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56284035-oto-bakradze", "userReview": "\u10d0\u10e0 \u10db\u10d4\u10d2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e1\u10ee\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10e6\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10d3\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8\u10d0 \u10e1\u10ee\u10d5\u10d0\u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10ea \u10d7\u10e3 \u10d8\u10e7\u10dd \u10e1\u10d0\u10d3\u10db\u10d4. \u10d7\u10e3\u10e0\u10db\u10d4 \u10e7\u10dd\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d0 \u10d0\u10da\u10d1\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10d7\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10e8\u10d8. \u10d9\u10d0\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8\u10d0. \u10db\u10eb\u10d8\u10db\u10d4, \u10d3\u10d4\u10de\u10e0\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10e3\u10da\u10d8. \u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d2\u10db\u10d8\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e4\u10d8\u10e5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10d7 \u10d9\u10d0\u10dc\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e3\u10d0\u10d6\u10e0\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \u10e1\u10d8\u10e0\u10ea\u10ee\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e8\u10d8\u10e8\u10d8\u10d7 \u10db\u10d0\u10e1\u10d6\u10d4 \u10d5\u10d4\u10e0 \u10dc\u10d0\u10d7\u10e5\u10d5\u10d0\u10db \u10e3\u10d0\u10e0\u10d6\u10d4. \u10d0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d5\u10d4 \u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4 \u10d7\u10e3 \u10e0\u10dd\u10d2\u10dd\u10e0 \u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc \u10d3\u10d0\u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d9\u10d0\u10dc\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10de\u10e0\u10d8\u10dc\u10ea\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 \u10dd\u10ef\u10d0\u10ee\u10d8, \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e8\u10d4\u10d8\u10eb\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d9\u10d5\u10da\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10ee\u10d3\u10d4\u10e1 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10e8\u10d8 \u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0 \u10db\u10d4\u10e2\u10d8 \u10e4\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10e8\u10d4\u10e3\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d7 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e1\u10ee\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10ee\u10d3\u10d8\u10d7.\u10d0\u10e0 \u10d5\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8 \u10e0\u10d0\u10db\u10d3\u10d4\u10dc\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e7\u10d8\u10d3\u10d5\u10d0\u10d3\u10d8 \u10d8\u10e5\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0 \u10ec\u10d8\u10d2\u10dc\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10e8\u10d4, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \u10db\u10d4 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10d4\u10ec\u10dd\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e4\u10d0\u10e5\u10e2\u10d8\u10d0."}, {"userName": "Susanne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21336635-susanne", "userReview": "Gro\u00dfartig.

April\", Ismael Kadare, Albania's best-known writer, focuses on the blood feud traditions of his country's uplands. The Albanian blood feud is far beyond the angry impulse that compels even the studious Hamlet to revenge his father; instead, its rituals are laid down in the law that governs this part of Albania. The intent of the law is to regulate the blood feud, to channel it in a way that keeps it from raging out of control, but the practical effect is to create a landscape of nightmare. Dead men's shirts are hung from their houses to remind living relatives that they are waiting for vengeance. The first act of the killers is to request temporary truces from the families of their victims. The revengers pay a tax for their murder. People who have committed revenge killings hide out together in towers dedicated to that purpose. A stranger murdered on a family's property draws its members into a fate of endless blood revenge until its men are all dead. This all sounds like the middle ages gone mad, but the novel set in the thirties. Kadare starts the novel with a man who almost against his will continues the blood feud by committing a revenge murder that he knows will require the victim's family to kill him. Then Kadare shifts to a young married couple on honeymoon--the husband has a romantic view of these customs as folklore. The naive anthropologist as resident fool can be found elsewhere in Kadare's work, but the wife who plays a pivotal and not fully explained role, all without really coming to life except to ask questions of her husband and wander mysteriously. The novel is strongest when it stays with the doomed mountaineers; by inserting the young couple whose idea of a honeymoon is to travel uncomfortably in a carriage through this nightmare, Kadare strains credibility, dissipates tension, explain without explaining, and deprives what should be a tragedy of the power it needs to become one."}, {"userName": "Brenda C Kayne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4440997-brenda-c-kayne", "userReview": "An amazing work of fiction that explains a dismal, distressing, oppressive, and highly ritualized code of revenge in an obscure area of Albania. Much to my dismay, this code of revenge is fact. (I googled it.) Perhaps this is Kadare's point. The book, hands down, is my favorite \"dark\" book because it so explictly depicts the karmic absurdity of revenge.One wonders if revenge is actually a natural response or perhaps a form of defensive behavior gone wrong. At any rate, our desires for revenge deserve analysis after any horrible act so that at least there might be conversation on how they might be satisfied in some productive, creative way. I am not one who supports the concept of \"proportionate response\". And although turning the other cheek seems equally absurd, I think there is more to it than that. It seems a code is born when there is no turning back, no analysis (or perhaps an analysis that is given up on); there is only perpetual repetition of deed. Maybe over the course of time when enough change surroundinga code of revenge occurs, the code dissipates such as with the Hatfields and McCoys. This books shares a lot with Lorca's play, \"Blood Wedding\". What I find interesting in both book and play, is how much the code is perpetuated by the women, who in the traditional stance of motherhood and nurturance, maintain and encourage a code of revenge within their troubled communities."}, {"userName": "Javier de la Pe\u00f1a Ontanaya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8546580-javier-de-la-pe-a-ontanaya", "userReview": "Esta breve pero intensa novela de Kadar\u00e9 es simplemente adictiva.

The novel really explores the lifestyle of those who lived on the high plateaus of the country in the early 20th century and their code of ethics, (namely the never-ending blood feuds that allow a death for a death, with family constantly having to sacrifice one of their own)."}, {"userName": "Chris Blocker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318724-chris-blocker", "userReview": "Last year, I made a goal of \u201creading around the world,\u201d an effort to read at least one book from every country. I'm not working down the list regionally or alphabetically. I'm not oversaturating my reading list all at once with these titles. I'm just making a conscious effort to explore the world through books as I'm able.Broken April is perhaps the most eye-opening view of a world I knew nothing about. Set in mountains of Albania, Broken April is the story of a man bound to an extremely strict set of rules called the Kanun. The Kanun is a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d that focuses on honor and hospitality, dictating the everyday actions of a person. It makes the American west of the 1800s seem very tame, the Levitical law lenient. Once one has become ensnared by the rules of the Kanun, there is no escape.Initially, I imagined that these rules were a product of the author's imagination. If nothing else, they had to have been exaggerated. No group of people would willingly live under such rigorous regulations century upon century. Sadly, they're all true. Though I hate to knock on the beliefs and cultures of another group, these rules are ridiculous and very dangerous. It's a wonder that those who subscribe to the Kanun as a rule for life have not gone extinct by now.As far as a novel goes, Broken April is a bit uneven. When the story focuses on Gjorg, it is riveting and breathtaking. I felt his anxiety. He is a marked man and though the reader must know it's impossible for him to escape, you hope there is a way. Also, I was enraptured with Diana, a newlywed who does not live under the Kanun, but who is similarly held captive by the authority of her husband. But the novel spends far too much time on the boring, ridiculous Bessian and on characters such as Mark, who merely provided a different visual perspective. Without these interruptions, I likely would've made my way through this novel in very little time; unfortunately, I felt too much of what Diana must've felt: God, I wish Bessian would just shut up.There is a haunting atmosphere to Broken April, especially as we follow Gjorg around. It reminds me of John Steinbeck's time in Mexico. There is a similarity in theme and setting to both \u201cFlight\u201d and The Pearl, though there is a feeling of timelessness in Broken April. It is this timelessness, this sense that these rules will continue until everyone is finally dead, that give this novel its most grievous quality."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30071749-pamela", "userReview": "Haunting and powerful novel set in the remote mountains of Albania. Gjorg has killed the murderer of his brother, in accordance with the  Kanun  an ancient and complex code that governs the lives of the mountain people.

This is how the blood feud continues between the families involved.Bessian, a writer, and his wife Diana are visiting the area on honeymoon. They briefly encounter Gjorg, and the impact of this passing moment affects all three in unexpected ways.This novel explores the conflicting views of the protagonists about the blood feud. Bessian has a romanticised view of it as an honourable and noble thing, while for Gjorg it is just something he has accepted as an inevitable part of his life. Both of them find their view challenged by later events, and by the ambiguous presence of Diana.
