White my entire life, and his books have followed me like a frisky shadow throughout my childhood, adolescence and adulthood. And now, I've found him here again, in my middle age and his middle age (circa 1948), each of us part-optimist, part-curmudgeon. . . arms not necessarily outstretched, but lovers of humanity both (as long as we're mostly shielded from it).His assignment here? To leave the peace of his domesticated bliss in North Brooklin, Maine and return to New York City to write a travel article for his stepson's then-magazine, Holiday. White, as described in the introduction, was an \"inveterate non-traveler\" and no longer a city boy, but he agreed to do the article for, most likely, the advancement of his stepson's career.So, he's reluctant, and it's hot, and he's walking the streets of the new New York (he had lived there 20 years prior), and he's hoping to get inspired just taking in what's familiar and what's old, and he's just. . . you know. . . jotting down observations, not taking himself too seriously.And he's observing things like:Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion.And:The island of Manhattan is without any doubt the greatest human concentrate on earth, the poem whose magic is comprehensible to millions of permanent residents but whose full meaning will always remain elusive.And I'm outside on my porch, on a stunning fall day, almost an entire nation's distance away from New York City and nowhere near E.B. White, who passed away in 1985. . . and all I can think is. . .

Yes, the competition is stiff, but this is it. You could underline this entire book, and I very nearly did.I've lived in several cities, and come to the conclusion that they're all more or less alike. As homes for many different people, they must do many different things; there is no room for a city with a distinct personality, because there is no identifiable personality within it. Attempts to force personalities onto cities are reductive. They have many stores and many streets and many people.But New York is different, and here's E.B. White on why.\nThere are roughly three New Yorks:There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable.Second, there is the New York of the commuter \u2014 the city that is devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night.Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in search of something. Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last - the city of final destination, the city that is a goal. It is this third city that accounts for New York's high-strung disposition, its poetical deportment, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable achievements.It's New York's status as \"the city that is a goal\" that makes it different. You walk down the street and nearly everyone you pass came here on purpose - not to any city but to this one, the big one. They chose not to make it anywhere, but to make it here. When you see images like this recent, viral one:This is precisely New York. Which is of course not to say that either of these people weren't born in New York - how would I know? - just that they both belong here. (PS pop quiz, which of these people is least likely to stand up for a pregnant lady? A: trick question, the answer is the suited douchebag sitting next to them playing Temple Run on his phone.)The wonderful thing about Here is New York, written in 1948, is that it still perfectly describes New York today. It still operates - surprisingly to some - as \"a composite of tens of thousands of tiny neighborhood units.\" I think about that every time I walk to the bodega (almost daily), where Sandra complains that my serious son refuses to smile at her.This, too, is more true than ever: \"The city has never been so uncomfortable, so crowded, so tense. Money has been plentiful and New York has responded. Restaurants are hard to get into; businessmen stand in line for a Schraff's luncheon as meekly as idle men used to stand in soup lines.\" I don't know what the hell Schraff's is - now it's fucking Ramen burgers or whatever - but the lines are still there. BTW Ramen burgers are bullshit.And then there's this, from the very last page: \"All dwellers in cities must live with the stubborn fact of annihilation; in New York the fact is somewhat more concentrated because of the concentration of the city itself, and because, of all targets, new York has a certain clear priority. In the mind of whatever perverted dreamer might loose the lightning, New York must hold a steady, irresistible charm.\" Oof. I'm originally from Boston, so I've spent most of my life talking shit about New York. (NYC is also the greatest city in the world to talk shit about!) But then I came here, because I was in search of something. I've found it* and someday I might leave with it; New York is a city of arrivals but also of departures. It's been a very special time in my life, and I've learned something valuable from it: the Yankees still suck.* \"it\" = a girl"}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/422137-carla", "userReview": "Don't tell New Yorkers I said so, but...

In this short book, he details many aspects of Manhattan. The book was published mid-twentieth century, so many of his observations are now faded memories of a time that was.His recollection of brand and building names, his comments on shows and restaurants, or where to catch a train or hitch your mare, was quite definitely before my time.But because I am a resident of Nuuk, Greenland, I was fascinated by how many people live in that small island. Here, I occasionally see an Arctic wolf or a reindeer, but never have I viewed a Broadway show, like \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d with Bernadette Peters or Ethel Merman (whoever they are). I can do anything better than they can in Nuuk, so there, Mr. White.They seem to have a million tall buildings in NYC, whereas here, each town can only build two buildings and the height is regulated to a double igloo, one on top of another. That is about six feet high, my height, when I am re-born next time.Okay, it is noontime and it is getting darker. A \u2018shout out\u2019 to my gr friend for the recommendation.

This essay has got me pining to go back to New York, to set up shop and live in those cramped quarters with those hellish humid summers and subways (oh NOT to drive!!) And though this was written in 1949, when black people were still acceptably referred to as \"Negros\" and Prohibition was not so long ago, E.B. White still captures the soul of New York that has remained constant. Reading this book, though it refers to now obsolete neighborhoods that have been gentrified for ages now, I feel the familiar spirit of walking the streets, feeling the pulse and poetry of the city, that amazing sense of endless possibility that only New York can provide in its way. And as much as it's been emphasized how quickly and utterly New York has changed and is always changing, it's incredible how much can really remain the same. Even post-9.11, which we thought would undo it all. On that note, the following passage was intensely unsettling. It is strange to me that it wasn't written in October, 2001. Keep in mind this was 1949, and E.B. White died in 1985. He had remarkable foresight: \"The subtlest change in New York is something people don't speak much about but that is in everyone's mind. The city, for the first time in its long history, is destructible. A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate the millions.

White\u2014yes, of Charlotte's Web fame\u2014wrote in 1948 for Holiday, a long-since defunct travel magazine. The essay reads as you would expect up until its last few pages. White is crisp and concise, and, as far as essays go, \"Here Is New York\" is enjoyable. It's interesting how few surprises there are throughout the essay, whether White is discussing his personal experiences of living in New York or about the tourist's, the outsider's, limited understanding of the city. At the time of White's writing, New York City was slightly less extravagant and built up (there are a million more people in the city now), but some parts of the culture remain the same.Perhaps New York really is as unchanging as White sometimes says he thinks it is or perhaps his opinion of the Big Apple\u2014that it is a sprawling, diverse, detached, noisy, busy, and lonesome place, all at once\u2014has become mainstream over the decades. This complex understanding of a multifaceted, contradictory New York is what I've grown up with in music, books, and movies. I think most of us, whether we have visited the city or not, know New York is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as most big cities are. Some dreams are realized there, while others are destroyed.It's toward the end of the essay that White takes a decidedly gloomy turn as he more critically analyzes various elements of New York (e.g., its racism) and imagines the city's future, which he sees as being overshadowed by a subtle fear of its own demise. With such a change in tone, \"Here Is New York\" becomes an unusual and slightly eerie tale by its closing. White is wary of overpopulation and disturbed by the neon lights and advertising displays that are sprouting up all over the city. (If he could see it now!) Media changes before his eyes as newspapers disappear or merge with others. He senses a \"greater tension, increased irritability\" that is, these days, quintessentially tied to New York and the average New Yorker. \"The city has never been so uncomfortable,\" he writes. To White, this comes down to the underlying fear of destruction, the fear that New York has grown to be so large, so important, that there are some who will want to destroy it and may even succeed in doing so. There's a reason many have said White's words seem prophetic.I'm not sure what you can learn about New York from White's essay that you won't already know. But the writing is elegant, and the powerful closing makes up for any initial slowness. I may not \"heart\" New York as so many do, but E.B. White simultaneously makes me thankful for the passage of time and wistful for a younger, slightly stripped-down version of the city.\n========================================Quotes From the Book(Apply your own positive/negative connotations.)\n========================================I think that although many persons are here from some excess of spirit (which caused them to break away from their small town), some, too, are here from a deficiency of spirit, who find in New York a protection, or an easy substitution.---It is a miracle that New York works at all. The whole thing is implausible. Every time the residents brush their teeth, millions of gallons of water must be drawn from the Catskills and the hills of Westchester. When a young man in Manhattan writes a letter to his girl in Brooklyn, the love message gets blown to her through a pneumatic tube\u2014pfft\u2014just like that. ---All dwellers in cities must live with the stubborn fact of annihilation; in New York the fact is somewhat more concentrated because of the concentration of the city itself, and because, of all targets, New York has a certain clear priority.

White's Here Is New York has been described as a 'remarkable, pristine essay', and The New York Times lists it as one of the best ten books ever written about the 'grand metropolis' of the city. White's essay was originally an article written for Holiday magazine; he declined to revise it at all before it was published in book form in 1948. New York is one of my absolute favourite cities, and I have been eager to read White's essay for years; thankfully, my parents bought me a lovely slim hardback copy, introduced by Roger Angell, for Christmas.In Here Is New York, the reader receives the privilege of going 'arm-in-arm' with White as he strolls around Manhattan. Of course, the view which we receive of the city is an antiquated one - seventy years can hardly pass without a great deal of change, after all. White himself writes of his decision not to revise the piece: 'The reader will find certain observations to be no longer true of the city, owing to the passage of time and the swing of the pendulum.' Angell justifies this lack of revision: 'The thought occurs that this book should now be called Here Was New York, except that White himself has foreseen this dilemma, The tone of his text is already valedictory, and even as he describes the city's gifts he sees alterations \"in tempo and temper\". Change is what this book is all about.' Angell rather touchingly adds that 'Even as he looked at the great city, [White] was missing what it had been.' Here Is New York is not a long essay, by any means, and is made up of just 7,500 words. In his introduction, Ansell writes that whilst this book is 'of modest length... it speaks more eloquently about what lasts and what really matters than other, more expansive pieces.' White is not always complimentary about the city, although one can tell that he is impassioned of his chosen topic; rather early on in the essay, he writes: 'The capacity to make such dubious gifts is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an individual, or it can fulfill him, depending a good deal on luck. No one should come to New York to live unless he is willing to be lucky.'As a modern reader, I was obviously unfamiliar with many of the places which White mentions. However, his descriptions feel wonderfully vivid, as though one could walk around the corner and find oneself somewhere he has mentioned, which has not stood in that particular place for decades. Much of what he says, with regard to the inhabitants of the city for instance, still feels pertinent: 'Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion.'Here Is New York has a wonderfully, and sometimes sadly, nostalgic feel to it, and throughout, White's writing is both measured and intelligent. New York is a character in itself throughout the essay, and it is recognised in all of its grit and beauty. I shall end my review with a gorgeous and sweeping description of the city, as White saw it all of those years ago: 'The city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races and breeds, into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines. The island of Manhattan is without any doubt the greatest human concentrate on earth, the poem whose magic is comprehensible to millions of permanent residents but whose full meaning will always remain elusive.'"}, {"userName": "Sofija", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7017200-sofija", "userReview": "It's going to be so so so hard to leave this city.

Third, there is the New Tork of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something. Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last - the city of final destination, the city that is a goal.\"It is this excerpt, perhaps, that best sums up EB White's Here Is New York for me. An assertive, unapologetic, yet nostalgic portrait of New York post-WWII, Here Is New York was commissioned by Holiday, an upmarket travel magazine. White's prose is a pleasure to read - crisp, clean and yet evocative. It was only after reading the book that I made the connection that E.B. White was the same White of Strunk and White's Elements of Style, the writing bible that had accompanied me faithfully throughout college. It feels a little pointless trying to find words to describe White's prose so I'll just take the easy way out a reproduce another extract from the book:\"New York blends the gift of privacy with the excitement of participation; and better than most dense communities it succeeds in insulating the individual (if he wants it, and almost everybody wants or needs it) against all enormous and violent and wonderful events that are taking place every minute...Although New York often imparts a feeling of great forlornness or forsakenness, it seldom seems dead or unresourceful; and you always feel that either by shifting your location ten blocks or by reducing your fortune by five dollars you can experience rejuvenation. Many people who have no real independence of spirit depend on the city's tremendous variety and sources of excitement for spiritual sustenance and maintenance of morale.\"Those who know and love New York will enjoy reading this love letter to a city as it stood more than half a century ago.

White is in the Zone in this slim but ample effusion, written with the fervor of a lover and the persuasive elan of a passionate scholar wishing to persuade, and if you want to quickly understand New York City and why it is loved, these fast, flowing, piquantly observant pages make it all very clear.(KR@KY 2017)"}, {"userName": "Dave Gaston", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1269880-dave-gaston", "userReview": "White wraps his master level talent around a wide-eyed Manhattan love story. A classic from the 1940\u2019s, \u201cHere is New York,\u201d is well thought and well penned. What was fundamentally true about New York City yesterday, is still true today and will likely be true again in 2040 when this little novella turns 100. Since any town is really a reflection of it\u2019s people, White describes NY as three towns made up of three distinct groups. The first circle is the establishment, it includes those select families that keep guard of the famous (and infamous) institutions of New York City. The second set represent the public hordes of daily commuters, without this massive mobile workforce the city would screech to a halt. Finally, the magical third group, right-off-the-boat immigrants, domestic and foreign. Men and women arriving with nothing more then their robust hearts and minds. White romantically and justifiably concludes that without this third injection of new blood, new ideas, and new dreams, New York City would never be as colorful and successful as it is. He wraps up his charming tale dicing New York City up another way. He describes the 100\u2019s of small micro towns within a town. Each 2-block-set is truly a self contained neighborhood as distinct and self contained as the smallest country hamlet. I live in downtown Chicago and this rang so true to me.

New York is the concentrate of art and commerce and sport and religion and entertainment and finance, bringing to a single compact arena the gladiator, the evangelist, the promoter, the actor, the trader and the merchant. It carries on its lapel the unexpungeable odor of the long past, so that no matter where you sit in New York you feel the vibrations of great times and tall deeds, of queer people and events and undertakings. New York blends the gift of privacy with the excitement of participation; and better than most dense communities it succeeds in insulating the individual (if he wants it, and almost everybody wants or needs it) against all enormous and violent and wonderful events that are taking place every minute. New York is peculiarly constructed to absorb almost anything that comes along (whether a thousand-foot liner out of the East or a twenty-thousand-man convention out of the West) without inflicting the event on its inhabitants; so that every event is, in a sense, optional, and the inhabitant is in the happy position of being able to choose his spectacle and so conserve his soul. There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable. Second, there is the New York of the commuter\u2014the city that is devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something... It is this third city that accounts for New York\u2019s high-strung disposition, its poetical deportment, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable achievements. Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion. A poem compresses much in a small space and adds music, thus heightening its meaning. The city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races and breeds, into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines. The island of Manhattan is without any doubt the greatest human concentrate on earth, the poem whose magic is comprehensible to millions of permanent residents but whose full meaning will always remain elusive. Manhattan has been compelled to expand skyward because of the absence of any other direction in which to grow. This, more than any other thing, is responsible for its physical majesty. It is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village\u2014the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying that the way is up. By rights New York should have destroyed itself long ago, from panic or fire or rioting or failure of some vital supply line in its circulatory system or from some deep labyrinthine short circuit... But the city makes up for its hazards and its deficiencies by supplying its citizens with massive doses of a supplementary vitamin\u2014the sense of belonging to something unique, cosmopolitan, mighty and unparalleled. Each area is a city within a city within a city. The city is always full of young worshipful beginners\u2014young actors, young aspiring poets, ballerinas, painters, reporters, singers\u2014each depending on his own brand of tonic to stay alive, each with his own stable of giants. The collision and the intermingling of these millions of foreign-born people representing so many races and creeds make New York a permanent exhibit of the phenomenon of one world. To a New Yorker the city is both changeless and changing. By comparison with other less hectic days, the city is uncomfortable and inconvenient; but New Yorkers temperamentally do not crave comfort and convenience\u2014if they did they would live elsewhere. All dwellers in cities must live with the stubborn fact of annihilation; in New York the fact is somewhat more concentrated because of the concentration of the city itself, and because, of all targets, New York has a certain clear priority. In the mind of whatever perverted dreamer might loose the lightning, New York must hold a steady, irresistible charm. New York is not a capital city\u2014it is not a national capital or a state capital. But it is by way of becoming the capital of the world. The buildings, as conceived by architects, will be cigar boxes set on end. Traffic will flow in a new tunnel under First Avenue. Forty-seventh Street will be widened (and if my guess is any good, trucks will appear late at night to plant tall trees surreptitiously, their roots to mingle with the intestines of the town). Once again the city will absorb, almost without showing any sign of it, a congress of visitors. A block or two west of the new City of Man in Turtle Bay there is an old willow tree that presides over an interior garden. It is a battered tree, long suffering and much climbed, held together by strands of wire but beloved of those who know it. In a way it symbolizes the city: life under difficulties, growth against odds, sap-rise in the midst of concrete, and the steady reaching for the sun. Whenever I look at it nowadays, and feel the cold shadow of the planes, I think: \u201cThis must be saved, this particular thing, this very tree.\u201d If it were to go, all would go\u2014this city, this mischievous and marvelous monument which not to look upon would be like death."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6924594-alison", "userReview": "I loved this essay about New York.

White summarized and put into words so beautifully many conclusions I myself have discovered while living in New York. He speaks to many aspects of the city; the thrill of being so close to someone influential, the necessity to be understanding and nonjudgmental to everyone you meet, the possibility of always being a part of something -- or not be, the types of people who live/come to live here, the architecture, how everything seems to change and yet be exactly the same. It is extremely comforting to my soul to know that the nostalgia I feel for old New York has been a shared feeling across decades of NY denizens."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12365650-mike", "userReview": "Before he wrote Charlotte\u2019s Web and after he wrote Stuart Little, E.B White penned a 54 page book about his life in New York City.
