With new secrets surfacing and tension growing with unanswered questions. Sarah's search grows more desperate as mistrusts everyone she knows. Is someone covering up what they saw seven hears ago? Will they do everything they can to keep the truth buried?I loved this novel. A story of secrets, lies, betrayal and hidden connections. The two women take turns at narrating the story. We also get flashbacks of their past. There are a lot of twist and turns to keep your attention. It's gripping, tense and has a well kept paced. I was kept guessing throughout this book and the ending was unexpected.

The second half was much better as secrets were revealed, making it hard to put down. I personally wouldn't describe Last Seen as an overly tense thriller, in that I didn't find myself holding my breath. It had more of a family saga feel to it, covering topics such as love, jealousy and grief. There were a lot of secrets and lies. Some things I worked out in advance, but there were also some surprises in there too.This book left me with a sickening and haunting feeling that some things can\u2019t be undone no matter how hard you try ignore them or wish them away, and can shape you and your whole future.Definitely one I recommend if you like the sound of the blurb."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "I loved this novel \u2013 it is an extremely clever, emotionally resonant psychological family drama in which Lucy Clarke explores many levels of relationships and what can happen when something goes horribly wrong.Two best friends. Two sons. One is lost, one is not. That moment in time ripples both outwards and inwards during \u201cLast Seen\u201d as both families come to terms (or not) with a genuinely horrible loss. Too many people are keeping too many secrets but it is still utterly authentic and completely believable from the first moment to the last.I love it when a novel in this genre gives you divisive and sympathetic characters, Lucy Clarke brings a huge amount of reality both to Sarah and to Isla. I will confess that I actually ended up detesting one of them (no spoilers!) but the road to that was rocky and incredibly addictive and the oceans (yes I did that) of depth in the storytelling, well, simply brilliant.I genuinely did not see where this one was going, that of course is a big tick for me as so much is so predictable (not necessarily making it bad but just taking something away) \u2013 Last Seen really DID keep me guessing as to what really happened the day two little boys ended up in the sea, on the way to that knowledge was a twisted and intelligently drawn plot that kept me immersed throughout.In the end there was a bit of a tear in my eye. For what was lost and what was gained and for the child that didn\u2019t make it out to grow up, but there was such a wonderful sense of closure to it all eventually that it was a genuinely satisfying read.Yep.

I have read other books by this author and have always found them to be wonderful, entertaining, thought-provoking reads, and this book was no exception.This is the story of two women, Isla and Sarah, very close friends for years. They have remained close, and each own a beach hut located next door to each other, where they spend every summer, with their families. A tragedy happened on the beach seven years ago, but they still meet up every summer.This book tells the story of one summer, when everything unravels for the women, but it is about so much more than that. It's about the choices that they make and the sacrifices and guilt that come with being a mother.I loved this book. It is easily one of my favourite books of the year. I received this to read through Netgalley but will definitely be buying a copy as I will most certainly be reading this again.My emotions were all over the place whilst reading. At first, I sympathised with both women but with Sarah in particular as she is desperate for news of her son. Then as the story unfolds, I liked and sympathised with Isla more and more. The ending, and the twist, floored me. I am a mother, and it was so easy to imagine the desperation of both women, and the actions that they took.Wonderful, riveting read that I would certainly recommend."}, {"userName": "Whispering Stories", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20354973-whispering-stories", "userReview": "Sarah and Isla were best friends, they grew up together and always dreamed of owning beach huts next to one another. They did everything together, even having their sons in the same year.Seven years ago tragedy struck when Jacob, Sarah\u2019s son, and Marley, Isla son, were ten years old. The two went swimming, but only one of them returned.Now on the anniversary of Marley\u2019s death, Jacob has gone missing. Sarah is trying to stay strong and positive, but something isn\u2019t right, and someone knows where her son is, but who is that person?Last Seen is a psychological thriller. It starts off with the drowning of Marley, (though you don\u2019t know this at the time). Once we get into the main story it begins quite slowly, and I must admit I almost gave up. I found Sarah boring and rather old headed for her age.Then the book reached a turning point, the pace quickened and the intense plot took over. The cast and situation are very believable, plus with the very descriptive scenery, it felt like I could of been reading a news article about a real event.It is written from two viewpoints, Sarah and Isla\u2019s, both past and present. I\u2019m not a great lover of multiple viewpoint books, especially when I personally feel that the story would of worked just as well being written in the third person, but I stuck with it, and did enjoy it.There are a lot of twists, and just when you think you might have the answer, Ms. Clarke throws in a curve ball, and you are back to square one. Everyone was a suspect, and I found it hard to decipher who was telling the truth, and who had something to hide.I was gripped to the pages with the need to know where Jacob was, and what had happened to him. The book is quite dark in places, and it certainly kept me guessing right up until the end.One moment in time shattered the lives of the two best friends, a friendship that never managed to repair itself. Something lurking in the past was holding the key to the present, but what did happen on that fateful night seven years ago, and how was it connected to the present?Reviewed by Stacey on www.whisperingstories.com"}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "Shortlisted for my Top 17 Reads of 2017. Winners announced on January 1st 2018.An absolutely stunning, emotional and fascinating read! This book had me well and truly riveted. I dove into the pages of this and only came up for air at the very end. I could not put it down.This is a book that has a strong and steady pace, don't expect it to hit peaks and lows. It moves along smoothly and kept my attention at all times. Lucy Clarke has done a brilliant job on her characters in this novel and it is very character driven. Each character is created so I felt I really knew them, even peripheral characters were very intriguing.Many of the lead characters are damaged and flawed and I love that in a novel. It's got quite a powerful and also emotional undercurrent all through the book that truly ramps up for the amazing ending.The book had me questioning motives and loyalties between friends and families. I did my fair bit of guessing throughout my reading time but that ending!It blew me away...A fantastic reveal, I started to see it coming but still it left me breathless with very tumbled emotions about the outcome. I was thrilled to bits reading this well-written, perfectly formed and deeply moving novel. It's got a lot going for it and will appeal to a huge range of different readers. Definitely get this book on your to-read list or better yet, go and grab it!If you like books that keep you guessing, character driven fiction and stories that really pull you into the heart of the matter then you'll love this.

Last Seen is another hit, a suspenseful and beguiling tale of secrets and lies set on an English sandbank where two lifelong friends, Sarah and Isla, have neighbouring beach huts. As the story begins, Sarah's 17-year-old son Jacob has gone missing \u2013 on the exact day that Isla's son Marley drowned seven years earlier. As the days go by, a tangled knot of hidden connections and betrayals begins to unravel, leading all the way back to the early days of Sarah and Isla's friendship. The two women take turns as narrators, with frequent flashbacks illuminating their pasts.Last time I reviewed one of Clarke's novels (2015's The Blue), I mentioned that I felt her three books formed a kind of loose trilogy. Now there are four, I'd say that still stands, as Last Seen feels a little different \u2013 more mature and grounded, and correspondingly more domestic. At the same time, it nods to the author's evident love of travel and flair for an evocative setting: the sandbank may not qualify as exotic, and the characters might be fortysomething parents rather than carefree backpackers, but there's still an irresistible charm to it all.As I raced through Last Seen, my imagination was consumed by life on the sandbank. The intimacy of the setting is absorbing and authentic; the characters are convincing; the plot has an effortless natural momentum. As a cross between a suspenseful thriller and a feelgood wish-you-were-here read, I can't fault it. My only regret is that I didn't save it for my holidays.(Apropos of nothing... I couldn't help but smile at the children being named Jacob and Marley. Is this a deliberate reference to A Christmas Carol, or something that wasn't flagged as sounding a bit odd in edits? If Last Seen is a retelling, it's a very, very subtle one.)I received an advance review copy of Last Seen from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "When the author of our best book of its year releases a new offering, we greet it with overwhelming enthusiasm, & equal disappointment when we miss the old thrill. I loved The Blue, & whilst I\u2019d not say I exactly hated Last Seen, just compare a fifty-foot offshore sailing yacht with a beach hut. We go from a book seriously comparable to Joseph Conrad\u2019s to the world of . . . well, beach-reads. Not that this one is lacking in the qualities sought by beach readers: adultery, betrayal, teen pregnancy, who\u2019s your dad stuff, BFs who are worst frenemies, a 1st person narrator who loves to jerk you around by letting it slip that she\u2019s got a secret she\u2019s saving for the denouement (how do 1st-person narrators know they are characters in a story book whose job is to keep readers in suspense by withholding the truth?). I\u2019d also award a prize for the most unlikely boys\u2019 names: Jacob & Marley. Apparently nobody in this book had read Dickens or seen the movie about a cute dog. Tho\u2019 as Marley is supposed to have perished seven years ago in a swimming accident (I\u2019ve never enjoyed swimming as a recreation - as opposed to being a way of saving your life should you fall in the water), his ghost indeed haunts his mother Isla (I am not making this name up) & her supposed BF Sarah (shouldn\u2019t it be Rebecca?), mother of Jacob, his boyhood friend. I found Jacob a thoroughly nasty piece of work long before the secrets come out - his treatment of his girlfriend & of his mother was abominable - but remembering he is but 17 must make allowances. How often when we think back on our own childhoods and teen years do most of us not feel an immense sense of guilt - with just a little more bad luck we could have done serious harm. Often I ask myself, \u201cCould I have done something as sleazy as that?\u201d Yes, actually.) Like Sharon Bolton\u2019s Little Black Lies, this book is a superb study of the destructive effects of nourishing chronic grief & also about lying. If these characters had told the truth in the 1st place, they\u2019d have faced some very embarrassing situations, but perhaps emerged as morally better people. Unfortunately, beach combing brings out the inner slacker in all of us (these characters spend most of their free time - they don\u2019t have anything else to do - smoking both funny and regular cigarettes and drinking). Whereas sailing an offshore yacht brings out our better selves, every relationship is a threesome because it includes a very high maintenance relationship with the boat.)Tho\u2019 very disappointed, I found as a suspense novel the final chapters of this one to be un-put-downable & as a animadversion of what not to do in your relationships, Last Seen morally admirable. So I\u2019m not sorry I read it. But please, Lucy Clarke, get off the beach & back on the boat!"}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8862640-nicki", "userReview": "Wow,reading this book is like riding a roller coaster whilst wearing a blindfold.It's packed full of twists and turns,you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next but you definitely know you don't want to get off until the ride is over and are very disappointed when you get to the end.Sarah and Isla have been best friends for many years and have been there for each other through everything that life has thrown their way including giving birth to their sons Jacob and Marley within weeks of each other.Every year the two women spend the summer months relaxing and having fun at their adjoining beach huts on the south coast.But on the year of Jacob and Harley`s 10th birthdays the boys go missing at sea and only Sarah`s son Jacob is brought back to the shore.Seven years later on the anniversary of the accident Jacob disappears without trace.As Sarah begins a desperate search for her son she slowly begins to mistrust everyone - and she is right toSomeone knows what really happened on the day of the accident and will do anything to keep the truth buried.This book is packed full of twists,lies,unreliable,untrustworthy characters and loads more lies,you cannot trust a word that anyone says.You think you know the truth about what happened on the day of the accident and why Jacob has disappeared then another twist is thrown into the mix and all your theories go out the window.The story is narrated by the alternating perspectives is Sarah and Isla and flips back and forth between the past and the present.I can't honestly say that any of the characters where very likeable but it was hard not to feel a tiny bit of sympathy for Isla,losing a child is every parents worst nightmare.It's a totally gripping story that kept me guessing from the first page right to the shocking and totally unexpected ending.Many thanks to Harper Collins UK,Harper Fiction for a arc of this book via netgalley in exchange for a honest review"}, {"userName": "Trish at Between My Lines", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15939692-trish-at-between-my-lines", "userReview": "Holy moly!

Every book so far has been the ultimate beach read but Last Seen has a definite edge for me due to the wonderfully described beach hut setting that conjured up picture perfect, warm and sunny days by the sea. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a book where the main characters lived in a beach hut before so I loved the whole \u201cliving the simple life\u201d ethos. Having been born and raised in Norfolk, I have always had a fascination for those brightly coloured little huts that can only be compared to The Tardis\u2026. \u201cit\u2019s bigger on the inside!\u201d Where I lived there were very strict rules about not sleeping in them but everywhere is different and if I had one of the gorgeous but expensive huts in somewhere like Southwold then I would definitely want to spend every second of every single day and night there!The plot here is a heart wrenching one for any parent to face, let alone one living right on the waters edge. When Sarah\u2019s son goes missing, she firstly thinks that it is due to a row between them on his birthday. But as the days pass by, things come to light that may mean all is not as it first seemed. There are secrets galore to uncover but will any of them lead to the answer of what has happened to Jacob?What an atmospheric slow burner this book was! I couldn\u2019t put it down until I had discovered what had happened to Jacob! There\u2019s a lot tightly packed into the plot and lots of teasers so that you think you know what\u2019s going on but ultimately, if you\u2019re like me, then Lucy Clarke will keep you in suspense right up until the very end. There are many themes twisting themselves throughout the narrative, friendship and loyalty, jealousy and suspicion and what it really means to be a mother. I felt for Sarah as she fought her feelings that something was seriously wrong when she realised Jacob was first missing. She did what many parents of teenagers do, tried to give her child the freedom to spread their wings but it\u2019s difficult when that goes against every protective bone in a mother\u2019s body! Both Sarah and Isla were clearly drawn characters and their relationships with their sons, and especially with each other, were cleverly constructed throughout. There were many eye opening surprises along the way to maintain the level of tension and the readers interest.This is a brilliantly written book that will tug at your heartstrings. I almost felt like I was there on the beach with Sarah, looking out to sea, tasting the salty breeze as it swirled around my body and feeling the warm sunshine spreading itself over my skin. In fact, when I took my sandals off whilst reading it I half expected a little gritty pile of shimmering sand to fall out of them. So if you want to feel like you\u2019re on holiday but you\u2019re only in your back garden then this evocative book is the one for you.I feel like I have been waiting forever for Last Seen to be published and I\u2019m now incredibly sad that it\u2019s all over. The final few pages had the hairs on the back of my neck standing to attention as I felt the summer slowly fade away. It was an emotional farewell, both to the characters that I\u2019d come to love and the questions in my head that had finally been answered.

On the surface, Sarah and Isla's friendship continues but when disaster strikes for a second time, long hidden secrets and betrayals bubble upwards threatening all they've clung onto for so long.

This is an Amazon Vine review. Do pop by and visit me here! I'm always up for a chat!When two boys go swimming and only one comes back, a small seaside community are devastated by the news. Years later, new secrets surface threatening to disrupt the peaceful beach and the lives of those who live there. It's a place where everyone seems to know each others business. A place where secrets are hard to keep. Here are my thoughts: ^^ I really like Lucy Clarke's writing and have read her previous books; they've all been good and this is no exception. It's the type of story that is full of family drama and I can easily imagine as a BBC adaptation. I truly hope this happens. ^^ This is the story of two women, Isla and Sarah, who are best of friends and have been for years. In the summer, they live in beach huts right by the sea. It's a small community that's like one big happy family. At least, it was.^^ As the story unfolds we see the cracks in their relationship and what lead them to be the women they are today. The sacrifices they made. The heartbreak they've felt. What happened between them to turn their relationship sour? And why does Sarah always feel like she's being watched? ^^ Ms Clarke has a fascinating way of delving into the minds of her characters and showing you what life is all about. It's not all hearts and roses, even if it looks like it from the outside in. This book is about making choices, trying to sort out what's right from wrong. There's tragedy, death, and untold truths. Yep, it's life and for these characters it's messy, upsetting and these are desperate times. But as always, the truth comes out in the end. Or does it? Overall: This is a story about families, the secrets they hold and the lengths a mother will go through to protect the ones she loves at all cost. I really enjoyed this book, which had a great twisty and revealing ending. Some of which I saw coming, but not all of it! Lucy Clarke is immensely talented."}, {"userName": "Lynda Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3565785-lynda-kelly", "userReview": "Another gem from this author, this makes the hat-trick of 5* reads for me by her. Job well done. And I'm more than picky so she does write tremendous books. I really enjoyed the beach hut setting as well with this. I've lived in places that have huts but they're nowhere near as grand as the ones featured here in Bognor and Hill Head....I don't recall any having a second floor, unless they're like Tardises inside. Although they do cost a LOT of money and do have waiting lists......that olde worlde English thing a bit like allotments.I love the cover on this one, it's my favourite of hers by far so I hope she doesn't keep altering it. I don't really know why authors do this but it can catch you out as well a few years down the line if you're not keeping track.I didn't warm to Sarah very much at all. She didn't come out of this very well at all. She has some dodgy habits and LIES....the lies she tells over and over !! I think she had a really unhealthy obsession with Isla along with the \"friendship\" as well. I guessed a few times where things were heading and got it wrong, which is always good for me as it makes the ending way more interesting. Parts I figured out but still had some surprises. However, the very last line baffled me. I didn't really understand that at all...But it's another story about how lies can affect lives and I think it's hopefully a good lesson to learn.I wasn't sure about the names Jacob and Marley....I'd have renamed Jacob myself !! This book she went with American spellings, too, which I don't believe she's done until now, but it's not good enough in a book clearly based here. It should be written in PROPER English.There were a few missing apostrophes and seventeenyear-old needed another hyphen and twice she used enflamed and not inflamed. Then paleblue needs a space but that was it for any errors I spotted. I was surprised the author writes with headphones on. I'd be sooooo distracted I'd not be able to do that.

On the surface its a reasonably easy story to understand. Jacob and Marley were inseparable best friends. 7 years ago unfortunately Marley drowned on Jacob's birthday when they were 10 years old. Now on the night of his 17th birthday Jacob is last seen in The Sandbank area and no one knows what happened to him or where he is. The story is told from the points of view of Isla and Sarah. Sarah is Jacob's mother and Isla was Marleys. Between them we discover just what happened this summer, and also the hidden details of what happened 7 years before, as well as developments in between. I found it really hard to like Sarah as a character and I wasn't overly keen on Isla either, but as the book progressed the writing had be so absorbed, and I was very interested to see just what happened to Jacob that I was able to see past my dislike of them and just not stop thinking about the book. The timeline of the book is easy to follow, and the pacing was great. Although I didn't think too much happened in the first bit of the book, it was really laying the foundation for the rest of the story. There are so many secrets and half truths in the book, that every time you thought you knew what would happen, or had just about grasped the current theory, then something else occurred that had you thinking in a different direction. Originally I was slightly upset that Lucy Clarke hadn't featured another exotic location for this book's setting, like some of her previous ones, but that was forgotten just a few pages into the book, when the writing grasped me regardless and wouldn't let me go. Regardless The Sandbank was in fact an excellent setting for a book, being a sandbank that is only generally accessed by boat when the tides are right, and that it contains a row of beach huts, and not too much else. Which gave the book a really atmospheric setting, while still coming across as summery but in a slightly sinister way! Unfortunately I had no choice but to put Last Seen down a few times, but given half a choice I would have read this in one sitting. Even when I wasn't reading it my mind was on the book, as it really is compelling storytelling.

As the novel continues we learn neither are perfect, which I quite liked \u2013 I am a fan of reading about flawed characters and often find these are far more realistic and convincing than those character who are clearly just \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019.I won\u2019t say too much about the story as I don\u2019t want to ruin it or alert readers to any potential surprises but I will say that I didn\u2019t guess the ending at all, which is always fun, and loved the twisty nature of the characters, as Sarah wonders who is being truthful and who may be hiding something. Some parts are a little slower, and focus on the relationship between Sarah, Isla and Nick and their sons too, and I felt this made up more of the book rather than 'thriller'-style action or suspense. However there was a definite underlying sense of danger and of the unknown, as we the readers have no idea where Jacob\u2019s actually gone, and if he\u2019s even still alive.Last Seen is definitely not a \u2018thriller\u2019 as such; it's more of an exploration into family dynamics and the way one mistake \u2013 like not paying enough attention to kids at the beach - can change everything.* Many thanks to HarperCollins for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write and honest and unbiased review. *"}, {"userName": "Gem ~ Bee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19918266-gem-bee", "userReview": "A really gripping read that I couldn't put down until the final page.A devastatingly dramatic psychological thriller/family drama that is full of twists and unearthed secrets. Lucy always builds a beautiful story based on honest, flawed characters and poetic scenery and this book is no exception. Set in a community of beach hut owners on the coast the story centres around what happens when a teenage boy goes missing on his birthday that is no ordinary day. Exploring many themes including heartbreak, grief, unrequited love, toxic friendships, guilt, deception and jealousy this book cleverly details many aspects of human relationships, and how our actions can have long reaching and devastating consequences.From being a fan of her photos on Instagram I know she herself has a beach hut (that she writes from) and enjoys family life on the coast so from this you can easily picture the details in this book and see her inspiration and passion for the coastline.Thank you to the author, publisher and Netgalley for this copy."}, {"userName": "Bex (Beckie Bookworm)", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9460945-bex-beckie-bookworm", "userReview": "OMG, First book I have read by Lucy Clarke, but so not the last, Last Seen for me was a five-star experience.So we have two friends Sarah and Isla, best friends whose lives are so interwoven it's hard to see where one starts and the other ends. Must be lovely to have a friend so close you can experience everything together and share each other's lives, you would think?But even the closest friendships can turn toxic when tragedy strikes as it does to these two when only one little boy returns from the sea.as the cracks begin to show and insecurities rear their little heads, you have to ask yourself, were the splinters always there under the surface just waiting for a reason to fracture and detonate.What happens when all that has been brushed under the carpet bubbles to the surface.When Seven years to the day of little Marley's tragic drowning Jacob, now celebrating his seventeenth birthday, vanishes without a trace its now time for Sarah's world to implode and shatter.This was such a good read, I loved the way the story was laid out, jumping from Sarah to Isla's perspective, I found myself jumping from one camp to the other when it came to my sympathies as we the reader are drip-fed information about each girl.we get to see the two woman stript bare, all their flaws showing, as a friendship disintegrates before our very eyes, it's so excruciatingly addictive to watch, a train wreck derailing.I really wasn't expecting to enjoy Last seen so much, but it has to be one of my favourite reads of the year so far. I was glued to this till the shocking, unexpected end. A job well done Lucy Clarke you now have a new fan in me, I really didn't see it coming at all.I Can't recommend this book enough, give it a go, I really don't think you will be disappointed.Thank you so much to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a free advance reader copy of Last Seen by Lucy Clarke.

The novel alternates between the two voices of Sarah and Isla friends since school and both having sons of the same age. However Isla's son Marly disappeared seven years previously presumed drowned. The book starts in the present day with the disappearance of Sarah's son Jacob. I found it a compelling read an liked the beach hut setting. A really good holiday read.

Imagine how you would feel if that were you? I admit I found the alternating chapters a bit tricky to read on a kindle as it wasn\u2019t always clear who was talking \u2013 I did start writing it down but at least you could flick back in a real book.Lucy always captures the settings she writes about so well and the sea is a theme here as in her other books \u2013 the way it can represent something so tragic here and the significance of the pull of the water and that never ending horizon is very well evoked.

Spending their summers in side-by side beach huts at the edge of the British shore they are inseparable growing up. Even when Isla goes travelling and Sarah stays home to make a life for herself the psychical distance between them doesn't lessen their friendship. And when Isla comes home pregnant at the same time that Sarah is expecting too, their shared experiences seem to bring them closer than ever.Their sons are born close together and Jacob and Marley too grow up best friends. Until one faithful day at the seaside the then 10-year-old boys go out to play in the sea but only one returns to the beach. Marley was Isla's entire world and losing him breaks her. The seaside and beach huts that have been at the heart of all her happiness suddenly have the exact opposite effect and she distances herself from Sarah first mentally and eventually physically by moving to Chile.However, when Jacob disappears seven years to the day of Marley's disappearance, Sarah's desperate search for her son stirs up old memories and secrets, and both she and Isla are forced to relive the terrible nightmares once more to uncover the truth of the boys' disappearances once and for all...I am not normally a reader of missing person thrillers, but Lucy Clarke's name on the cover persuaded me to pick this one up and boy am I glad that I did. Last Seen was a constantly surprising and superbly plotted novel, which completely pulled me in with its multifaceted characters and intriguing developments. There was so much depth to this story and the quietly unravelling secrets of the beach hut community, that I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of reading this novel.Sarah and Isla were fascinating characters; hugely flawed and incredibly realistic as they faced unfathomable grief and despair. No parent should ever have to go through what they had to go through. Twice. And while their journeys were difficult, raw and heart-wrenching, they were also strangely alluring as you couldn't help but wonder about the secrets lingering at the edges of the pages \u2013 and whether both women were telling the truth about what really happened to their sons. Last Seen was a hugely intriguing story that will keep the reader guessing until the very end about the carefully crafted mystery at its core as it's led by unreliable narrators and shocking secrets. Each of Lucy's novels is different from the one before, the pull of the sea and her beautifully descriptive writing being what connects one to the next. And even though I only just finished Last Seen, I already can't wait to discover what she'll surprise her readers with next."}, {"userName": "Megan Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18958766-megan-jones", "userReview": "Seven years ago, two boys, Jacob and Marley, went missing at sea. Only one of them, Jacob, returned. The event scarred The Sandbank, a remote stretch of coast dotted with beach huts, forever. Jacob is Sarah's son and now seven years later, on the anniversary of the tragedy, Jacob disappears. New secrets are revealed in the desperate search for Jacob and The Sandbank is full of tension. As the hopeless search continues, Sarah begins to doubt everyone she knows and she is right to.\u00a0I loved and enjoyed this novel for so many reasons. 'Last Seen' does not really fit the typical thriller category, it is thrilling but this is much more powerful when focusing on the tragic, heartbreaking events of seven years ago and the life-changing consequences for Isla, Marley's mum, Jacob and Sarah. Clarke portrays Isla's never-ending grief for her son beautifully and realistically and as a reader I felt for her the whole way through. Through telling this story, Clarke focuses on how the accident altered the friendship between Isla and Sarah and the relationship between Jacob and Isla, again making for heartbreaking reading as we see how the event has changed everyone's lives. 'Last Seen' is flooded with secrets and Clarke drip releases them throughout the plot, making the novel even more suspenseful. The revelations carry on until the final page meaning you will always be kept on your toes. Setting this on The Sandbank and in Summer, creates the perfect atmosphere for 'Last Seen'. The claustrophobia of a hot summer coupled with people living on top of each in a remote location gives a real sense of the characters being trapped with the truths that are just waiting to spill out and I enjoyed every second of reading it.Clarke alternates between telling this from the perspectives of Sarah and Isla, allowing the reader to understand both women and see where things went so wrong for their friendship. With Sarah and Isla, Clarke explores an intense female friendship and how dark things can get when they fall out. This focus on their disappearing friendship made for strong reading as we ultimately learn why they are both behaving the way they are, I will not reveal anything but it shows us they are strong, protective women.\u00a0'Last Seen' is an intense, suspenseful, heartbreaking read that will tug at your heart strings. I adored the characters at the heart of this and following them as they learn to live with some truths makes for thrilling, enticing reading."}, {"userName": "AnnaSalvatore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42867771-annasalvatore", "userReview": "GANZE REZENSION: http://annasalvatoresbuchblog.blogspo...GESTALTUNGIch bin wieder sehr angetan. Highlight ist nat\u00fcrlich der Buchschnitt mit den blauen Seesternen darauf, aber auch sonst ist wieder alles sehr stimmig und passt zur mysteri\u00f6sen Stimmung des Buches. Auch die sch\u00f6nen Innenklappen sind zu erw\u00e4hnen.MEINUNGDer Einstieg fiel mir etwas schwer, aber bei den vielen Personen, Konstellationen sowie den zwei Zeitlinien ist das nicht verwunderlich.Doch nach kurzer Zeit ist man dann voll dabei und fiebert mit.Erst einmal zu den Charakteren:Isla und Sarah sind sehr faszinierend. Ich liebe die Vorgeschichte, die Freundschaft der beiden, aber es war genauso faszinierend den Verlauf mitzuverfolgen. Die Konstellationen und unterschwelligen Konflikte, auch mit den Kindern und Nick, sorgt f\u00fcr ordentlich Spannung.Der Schreibstil ist wieder besonders. Zum einen nat\u00fcrlich die zwei Zeitlinien, die aber wunderbar miteinander harmonieren und Einblicke sowohl in Isla als auch Sarah geben. Der Stil ist weder besonders hochgestochen noch einfach, er ist sehr fl\u00fcssig zu lesen und erzeugt eine wunderbare Atmosph\u00e4re.Clarke schafft es mit ihren Worten sowohl die Sandbank und das wunderbare Gef\u00fchl am Meer zu sein einzufangen, als auch dieses G\u00e4nsehautgef\u00fchl zu erschaffen. Denn auch Thriller Elemente spielen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Und diese haben mir sehr gefallen.Die Handlung n\u00e4mlich \u00fcberzeugt komplett. Ich h\u00e4tte nie gedacht, dass mich solch ein Thema so sehr fesseln k\u00f6nnte, doch das hat Clarke bravor\u00f6s gemeistert. \u00dcberraschende Wendungen und ein Ende mit dem ich nie gerechnet h\u00e4tte, verst\u00e4rkten den Effekt nat\u00fcrlich.FAZITIch klebte an den Seiten, und war gefangen in einer Mischung aus Urlaubsfeeling und paranoidem Thriller. Wieder hat mich Clarke absolut begeistert, sowohl von sich selbst als auch ihrem Genre, dem ich sonst eher fern bleibe.Wer auf der Suche nach einer Geschichte ist, die man so leicht nicht vergisst, ist hier richtig.- Dringende Leseempfehlung meinerseits: 5 von 5 Feenfaltern -Vielen Dank an den Piper Verlag f\u00fcr das Rezensionsexemplar!\u00a9 Anna Salvatore's B\u00fccherreich"}, {"userName": "Louise Roach", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41529144-louise-roach", "userReview": "Wow!! This book was amazing. Yet another piece of writing brilliance from the immensely talented Lucy Clarke. Each book she writes, she gets better and better, and it just adds more and more to her wonderful collection of amazing stories. This story will sweep you away and take you on a journey of mystery, intrigue, suspense, drama and mind bending emotions. Sarah and Isla are best friends, they have been friends for years, with their lives connected in so many different ways, which as the book goes on we discover more and more. All of the characters in this book are wonderfully developed and interlinked. With all of the characters hiding secrets, lies and surprises, there is a constant sense of wonder and intrigue.The book is written in a dual POV, from both Sarah and Isla's perspectives. This works wonderfully, with the past and present flashbacks and writing, really adds to the suspense and overall flow of the story.There are twists aplenty in this superbly written, fast-paced novel, which will have you turning those pages, just wanting to get to the bottom of the mystery that unfolds. There are so many twists to this story, and some parts that had me shocked!! I felt all the emotions whilst reading this book and even shed a tear or two. The setting of this book is simply spot on perfection! Living on the South Coast of the UK myself, I can see exactly where so much of the inspiration of this story was taken from and could really imagine myself there, with the characters, immersed in the story.
