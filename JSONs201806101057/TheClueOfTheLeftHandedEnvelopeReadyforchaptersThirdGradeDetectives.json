Stanley and Sal Murdocca. It's a fascinating story that introduces children to the art and science of cryptography as well as forensics. Our oldest loved this book and immediately engaged her sister in creating messages in hidden code using a simple letter substitution. I love it when the books we read get our girls excited about a new subject and teach them about math, science and other puzzles. We recognize the illustrator's work from his collaboration with Mary Pope Osborne on the Magic Tree House stories.Overall, I thought this was an interesting story and we will certainly look for more books in this series at our local library."}, {"userName": "Sean Harding", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/308707-sean-harding", "userReview": "A detective story with no real crime, but rather a gentle mystery for children of working out who sent another person a nice letter.The main character feels a bit needy and the rivalry with another student very cliched, but the story itself is fine, and introducing children to puzzles, cryptography, how police, and in particular police scientists solve crime, and things like DNA in a short well executed read is quite a good thing. Far from perfect but with great intentions and a fun read for the youngster.This was the fourth and final book I read from my Goddaughters library on a weekend visit.Next time I visit I may return to their library :)"}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2128705-monica", "userReview": "Cute story about a mystery envelope sent to a classmate in the third grade. The teacher uses this as a way to teach the students about problem solving and looking for clues."}, {"userName": "Meyaka", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/624647-meyaka", "userReview": "As an attempt to get my third-grader to read more, I selected this mystery series. The book introduces two best friends who have a \"new\" teacher as their third-grade teacher. They speculate what the teacher did before he came to their school and during the first day of class, the teacher squashes all of the mystery by saying that he used to be a spy. The teacher uses his \"spy-skills\" to grab the attention of his students and encourages them to critically think to solve mysteries that arise in their school. Surprisingly, I was as into the book as my son was. We had a good time attempting to solve the mystery before we made it to the end of the book. We read the second book, as well and look forward to exploring other books by this author."}, {"userName": "Conan Tigard", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48525684-conan-tigard", "userReview": "My daughter read this book to me and quite enjoyed trying to figure out the secret codes in The Clue of the Left-Handed Envelope. The lead character, Noelle, is a completive girl who only wants to beat Amber Lee in solving the mystery. She is really funny and the children that read this story will really like her, even though they may have trouble figuring out how to pronounce her name. The story is quite light and a fun read and should be enjoyed by all third graders. Overall, I would recommend The Clue of the Left-Handed Envelope to any young reader that likes a good mystery.I rated this book an 8 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Danielle Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7375642-danielle-simmons", "userReview": "I always loved being the detective as a child. And knowing children who are like that now, this book can be a good way to get children to read at a young age. The book keeps you guessing at what the messages mean. Mr. Merlin knows all about being a detective and solving mysteries. Being a third grade detective can lead children to use their imagination and lead them into problem solving and adventure. This story can be a good transitional book that keeps. Hidden guessing at the anonymous notes being sent."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/881287-carolyn", "userReview": "This is the first in the Third-Grade Detectives series, but they are all good. I wish there were more. These are \"mystery\" books with a cryptology twist. Each mystery is solved as the kids decipher different kinds of codes from their teacher. Fun for any kid who has figured out how to write in code."}, {"userName": "Amy Varchetti", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29919080-amy-varchetti", "userReview": "Nothing earth-shattering or fantastic here, but a good solid little beginner mystery. The inclusion of a few coded messages for readers to solve adds some extra fun. Students who like mysteries, science, and puzzles will especially find the book enjoyable. A good choice for reluctant third-grade readers."}, {"userName": "Jo Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55556376-jo-miller", "userReview": "This is the first book of the series and I can see the fun in reading these books.
