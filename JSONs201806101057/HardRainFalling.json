He did not feel \u2018wanted\u2019---he felt very unwanted. He had desires, and nobody was going to drop out of the sky to satisfy them. He tried to milk a little self-pity out of this thought, but it did not work: he had to recognize that he preferred his singularity, his freedom. All right. He knew what he wanted. He wanted money. He wanted a piece of ass. He wanted a big dinner, with all the trimmings. He wanted a bottle of whiskey. He wanted a car, in which he could drive a hundred miles an hour. He wanted some new clothes and thirty-dollar shoes. He wanted a .45 automatic. He wanted a record player in the big hotel room he wanted, so he could lie in bed with the whiskey and the piece of ass and listen to\u2026.That was what he wanted. So it was up to him to get those things.\u201dThose are not big dreams, right? I mean a guy should expect to have a slutty girlfriend, a gun (it is America after all; there are more guns than people), decent clothes, good music, a fast car, a big meal once in awhile, and be able to spin the cap off a fresh bottle of whiskey when he needs to forget how shitty his life is, even when he is walking around in his thirty dollar shoes. For Jack Levitt, who has never had anything, those dreams are so big they seem like millionaire dreams. His parents came to violent ends at very young ages. Jack was not cute; in fact, even when he was little, he was kind of tough looking. It is hard to find adoptive parents when you look like a future felon at eight. He is in the system so long he becomes part of the system. Jack meets a pool shark by the name of Billy Lancing, and though they only intersect for a few hours, before Jack is hauled back to juvie, that meeting will prove fateful. They don\u2019t meet again for decades. Jack might be white, and Billy might be black, but there is no color barrier for poverty, desperation, and the feeling that there has to be more than this. \u201dBut I don\u2019t want to be a negro; I don\u2019t want to be a white man; I don\u2019t want to be a married man; I don\u2019t want to be a businessman; I don\u2019t want to be lonely. Life seemed to be a figure eight. It terrified him, sitting on the bus, as if time had opened black jaws and swallowed him.\u201dJack has a similar epiphany about his life. He meets up with an old friend, Denny. \u201dLived in half a hundred arid furnished rooms, pretended the vacuum was freedom, wakened almost daily to the fear that time was a dry wind brushing away his youth and his strength, and slept through as many nightmares as there were nights to dream. He just sat and smiled at Denny and saw what time had done to him and wondered, now comfortably, why he was so bothered by time. It happens to everybody this way, he thought, we sit here and get older and die and nothing happens.\u201dAnybody who has ever been to a high school reunion knows about the ravages of time. I\u2019ve never been to one, but someone always sends me pictures from the latest reunion as enticements, I\u2019m sure, to come to the next one. I\u2019m getting old enough now where people have warped, melted, and expanded to such an extent that they are becoming unrecognizable. Little Tommy has become BIG Tommy, and there is barely a glimmer left of the beauty that made the prom queen the lead actress in a series of pornographic dreams. I find myself having to agree with Jack and Billy...this is it? This is where we strive to arrive? I\u2019ve had a much better start, middle, and hopefully, finish to my life than what Jack and Billy experienced. Regardless, life is a heartless, cold blooded witch, and no one gets through life unscathed. The scale is constantly tilting back and forth between bitter experiences and sweet experiences. I try to focus on the good memories and blur the bad memories, but the older we get, the battle scars start to show. We become unrecognizable at high school reunions. Billy and Jack end up incarcerated in the same prison and, in fact, the same cell. They have both failed at almost everything in life. Jack spent some time boxing but discovered he is too thin skinned and bleeds too easily, but he can take care of himself physically. Billy made it briefly into the middle class, but he felt trapped by the responsibility that proved too heavy, and all he could think about was running away from... the weight. He is smaller and gets the wrong kind of attention in prison. (Never die protecting a virgin asshole.) They forge an alliance that becomes built on more than friendship. This book is hardboiled with a capital H. Once institutionalized, it is hard for people to ever not be institutionalized. They don\u2019t teach you how to survive outside the system. Is it any wonder that too many orphans of the state end up being wards of the state in prison or halfway houses? They have no blueprint to achieve their dreams. They struggle, and when they fail, there is always some judge willing to put them back into the system. They understand life inside. They don\u2019t understand the real world. After all, isn\u2019t it just as hopeless with more responsibility on the outside? Well written, clipped, hard prose with philosophical musings that will have you nodding your head as you realize that the difference between us and Jack and Billy is the fickleness of fate.

Hard Rain Falliing was his first novel, published in 1966.Hard Rain Falling - A clear, honest story of Jack Levitt, a young man abused and brutalized in his years growing up in an orphanage and, after running away to Portland, Oregon at age sixteen, living his hardscrabble life among his buddies and cheap whores, in and out of sleazy pool halls, dilapidated boarding houses and hotels, reform school and prison, lots of prison, all the while drinking whiskey and fist fighting his way through seething anger and rage. Author Don Carpenter\u2019s prose is so sharp and vibrant, I had the feeling of standing next to Jack every step of the way. I also got to know, up close and personal, a few other men and women in Jack\u2019s life, like Billy, a teenage pool shark with yellow skin and kinky reddish-brown hair, young tough Denny who loves any kind of dangerous, illegal action and, last but hardly least, wild woman Sally. This is such a powerful novel, other than my own brief comments, I\u2019ll stand aside and let the author\u2019s words speak for themselves.Although he had clear blue eyes and curly blonde hair, even at age seven Jack looked like a seasoned boxer. Here\u2019s Jack on his experience at the orphanage \u2013 and no wonder he ran away as soon as he could:\u201cBecause the children of the orphanage were taught, all week long every week of their lives, that the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, was purely a question of feeling: if it felt good, it was bad, if it felt bad, it was good. . . . And work, they were taught that work was good, especially hard work, and the harder the work the better it was, their bodies screaming to them that this was a lie, it was all a terrible, God-originated, filthy lie, a monstrous attempt to keep them from screaming out their rage and anguish and murdering the authorities.\u201d One night a reform school guard lines the boys up and accuses them of unnatural sex practices, then grabs one of the frightened kids around the neck. Jack lashes out at this injustice, fists first, nearly killing the guard, an action that lands him in a dark, isolated cell for over four months. And that\u2019s dark as in completely black; no light for 126 days:\u201cThe punishment cell was about seven feet long, four feet wide, and six feet high. The floor and walls were concrete, and there were no windows. In the iron door near the bottom was a slot through which he passed his slop can, and through which his food and water were delivered to him. They did not feed him every day, and because of that he had no way of knowing how much time had passed. . . . At times, all his senses deserted him, and he could not feel the coldness of the concrete or smell his excrement, and the small sounds he made and the sounds that filtered in through the door gradually dimmed, and he was left along inside his mind, without a past to envision, since his inner vision was gone, too, and without a future to dream, because there was nothing but this emptiness and himself.\u201dWhen Jack is in his early 20s, after stealing a car and breaking into a house of rich people away on vacation and being caught drunk in bed, he is sent to a county jail:\u201cThe boredom of it all, the sameness, the constant noise and smell of the tank, were driving him crazy. The fact that he was in was driving him crazy. . . . They had no right to do this to me, or to anybody else. He hated them all. But was crazy to hate them. So he decided he was going crazy. It was a relief for him to go berserk at last: it was an act of pure rationality that had nothing to do with McHenry or the poor fool Mac was taking over the bumps. It was an expression of sanity, a howl of rage at a world that put men in county jails. Everything finally got to be too much and he let go of his passion.\u201dJack in San Quentin prison, on his bunk, looking up at the stark white ceiling, reflecting on our constant itch for sexual pleasure and the reason he was born in the first place:\u201cIt struck him with horrible force. His parents, whoever they were, had probably made love out of just such an itch. For fun, for this momentary satisfaction, they had conceived him, and because he was obviously inconvenient, dumped him in the orphanage, because he, the life they had created while they were being careless and thoughtless, was not part of the fun of it all; he was just a harmful side effect of the scratching of the itch; he was the snot in the handkerchief after the nose had been blown, just something disgusting to be gotten rid of in secret and forgotten. Cold rage filled him, rage at his unknown parents, rage at the life he had been given, and for such trivial, stupid reasons!\"There's a lot of scenes where Jack Levitt talks, drinks, smokes and takes action with Billy, Denny, Sally and others, even reaching a point in his life where he reads Joyce and Faulkner, but day and night, and that's ever day and every night, Jack has to deal with his rage. Again, as honest and as clear a novel as you will ever read.Special thanks to Goodreads friend Jeffrey Keeten for writing his penetrating review of this American classic thus prompting me to read Hard Rain Falling and write my own review."}, {"userName": "D. Pow", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2182799-d-pow", "userReview": "Don Carpenter\u2019s Hard Rain Falling is the best novel I\u2019ve read this year. Originally published in 1966, and long out of print, it has been brought back to readers in a handsome trade paperback edition by the New York Review Books Classics imprint, with a thoughtful introduction by current crime writing doyen George Pelecanos. The book is epic in scope, covering over three decades of eventful action, from late 1920\u2019s subsistence horse ranches to the San Francisco of the early \u201860\u2019s, on the cusp of the sexual revolution, but still in thrall to more repressive mores. The book is mainly set in the Pacific Northwest and in Frisco. Its main protagonist is Jack Levitt- who when we first meet him, is a hard-bitten reform school thug with no talent other than fighting and a capacity to endure physical pain. Levitt\u2019s parents are the subject of a heartbreaking opening chapter where they meet, mate and part, in a collision as ultimately as destructive for its principals as two asteroids colliding in the silent abyss of space, one that leaves you little hope for little Jack\u2019s life trajectory. The book follows Jack through low-end working class postwar America, the pool halls of Portland and flop houses of Frisco, thorough tortuous episodes in reform school and an arc of ascending criminal activity until Levitt finds himself in San Quentin doing hard time.Jack\u2019s life intertwines with Billy Lancing, whom we first meet as a young, talented pool hustler in Portland when both Jack and Billy are teenagers. Billy is black and a runaway. One of the unique strengths of Hard Rain Falling, especially in comparison to its ostensible genre and other major novels published in the same era, is the clear eye and lucid prose it casts on race in America, post WWII. Carpenter poignantly captures Billy\u2019s hurt core of being, when he recognizes his skin color makes him outcast among outcasts. There is none of the hipster jive Mailer tossed out at blacks, nor the muddled glorification some of the beats viewed blacks with.Sexuality too is displayed in a mature, thought-provoking manner. Levitt begins his life in an orphanage because of an `itch\u2019 his parents couldn\u2019t help but scratch. And that same itch hounds Jack and befuddles him throughout the book, makes him feel one moment gloriously alive, one moment less than human. Carpenter\u2019s compassion and empathy in this arena of life extends to homosexual love when it is encountered in San Quentin. It is neither viewed with contempt like latter-day tough guy scribes like Tarentino or Guillermo Arriaga nor fetishized into absurdity as in Genet. It merely is.When Jack and Billy meet again in San Quentin, after equally heartbreaking paths, Jack further into crime and violence, Billy with an aborted attempt to maintain a family, the relationship takes on a searing intimacy and naked vulnerability that is found nowhere else in the book and that is unlike anything else I\u2019ve read in 1960\u2019s American Literature.If Hard Rain Falling was merely a prison/coming of age novel it would be a wonderful success-it is a model of clarity, brevity and precise observation. But what sets it apart is the wonderful interior ramblings of Jack Levitt as he tries to make sense of the brutally senseless world he lives in, of his own rabid dog impulses, the nature of power and powerlessness, and the labyrinth and often self-lacerating ways of the human heart.It is not merely about prisons made of concrete and steel, but of the prisons of failed relationships, the odious lock-ups of diminished and dying expectations, the unforgiving solitary confinement of our own screaming skulls. NYRB on the back cover has dared to compare the novel to Dostoevsky. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbole. Levitt\u2019s journey from violent thug, through the bowels of the prison system and out the other side with something like wisdom and grace touching him, easily echoes Raskolnikov or the narrator of Memoirs from the House of The Dead in its capacity to evoke redemption in the face of brutality. Hard Rain Falling is a great American novel that NYRB deserves lasting credit for pulling from the bonfire of oblivion, even if for a short time. Carpenter deserves to be read into posterity for his technique and for his genuinely wise and empathic take on the marginals of this society, the society that marginalizes them thoughtlessly, and the tenderness, sacrifice and love that can blossom in the most heartless places imaginable."}, {"userName": "brian   ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian", "userReview": "eighth grade i had an economics teacher called dr. cole. first day of class he gave us a list of qualities we'd potentially possess as adults. wanted us to rank them from 1 - 20 in order of importance. some of the stuff on the list: richhealthy happy marriedemployed famousintelligentpowerfulcole was a strange bird. a thin meticulous type; kind of a well-toned george will with a contemptuous sneer. he watched as we scored the rankings and held them up to be collected. he didn't want them. he stood up front and asked how many people put 'happy' as number one. a bunch of us raised our hands. he looked out at the class and said 'anyone who didn't raise their hand is an idiot'. and that was it. no more on that. he handed out the syllabus and went into all the class requirement bullshit. most of the kids thought he was a typical teacher asshole but all that 'happy' and 'idiot' palaver stuck with some of us.i love love love lerve luff looooooove hard rain falling. let's make it the next goodreads cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, yeah? let's resist the temptation to be mannered and reasonable and not shout our heads off so as not to feel like an asshole later, ok? let's just belt it all out and have a few extra slugs and get all giddy and excited and dance around a little and get behind this one. it's a ten-ton truck of existential dread. and we love it. donald wrote a review i can't top, won't even try, lays out all that is great about this book: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...carpenter should've been a bestseller and acknowledged great-writer-of-our-time. instead he fell between the cracks and his book came back into print sixteen years after he blew his brains out."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073544-david", "userReview": "Okay. You can go ahead and believe the hype. This thing is pretty great. Initially, based on a few hot steaming barely-legal facials this book has been given on this very website, I was all ready to step up on Hard Rain Falling, throw my hands up in the air, and say, 'What you got, bitch? I di'n't think so.' Or, alternately, serve up the ever-effective 'You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! You ain't nothin'!' -- in which scenario Hard Rain Falling is played by Wesley Snipes, and my black combat jumpsuit is really, really zippery and buckly. In other words, I served this book a challenge, and it answered accordingly.I usually don't have high hopes for novels about angry young toughguys because, c'mon, hasn't the angry young toughguy schtick been done to death? When you read another one of these authors going on about another drunken or drugged-out lout who's 'livin' the life' (that's my code-phrase for an authentic\u00ae, antibourgeois, antisocial, antiauthoritarian life), you are really tempted -- if you're me -- to fiddle with your hangnail, sigh fortissimo, and let fly something semi-snide like: 'Oh goodie. I'm glad the grossly underrepresented angry young white male demographic finally gets its say in the vagicentric world of 20th-century American literary.' But then, if you read (or don't read) on the basis of these prejudices, the terrorists have won. And you, more importantly, have lost.Hard Rain Falling is about this kid named Jack Levitt who's really mean and despicable, mostly. Sometimes he just gets a craving to go out and beat the shit out of some random stranger, so he hopes a passerby looks at him funny or brushes up against him on the street so he'll have a reason to unleash the beast. It's really horrifying in a way because it reminds you that there really are Jack Levitts out there in the world, and the only thing that's really protecting you from them is the statistical probability that you probably won't run into one of them. As a prologue, Carpenter includes a short chapter, set in the 1920s, about Jack's parents who -- if we wanted to be flippant and elitist (which, of course, we do) -- would be described in contemporary culture as paragons of Wal-Mart Culture. I almost think it would have been better if Carpenter would have left out this seedy little prelude because it seems to want to provide some justification or impetus for Jack's later delinquency. But since both his parents died young and Jack grew up in an orphanage, it either appears to suggest (intentionally or not) a biological basis for his badassness or to point at some kind of degenerative contagion infecting and spreading through society in general. At any rate, the prologue (six-and-a-half pages) is not nearly as unfortunate as the epilogue (three-and-a-half pages), which makes an awkward, unsatisfying leap from gritty toughmindedness to a gauzy, sun-dappled coda borrowed from Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night. I really, really despised the epilogue to this book, but because I loved the rest of it so much, I am willing to selectively forget that it ever existed, just as I refuse to believe that the Star Wars prequels were anything but the product of a fever-dream. They were never in fact made. I have to believe that. The religion of my youth depends upon it.What is truly remarkable about Hard Rain Falling is that it feels refreshingly honest. So many midcentury contenders for 'the great American novel' seem so artificial and burnished to me. It's like when you watch one of those Merchant-Ivory adaptations of an E.M. Forster novel... Life was never really like that. I'm sorry. It just wasn't. This is reality refracted through Forster's concept of 'polite literature' and Merchant-Ivory's concept of 'tasteful filmmaking.' A double refraction, my friends. But yes, even in the rarified halls of Howards End, life was never quite so neat and tidy. How do I know this? I'm a human being, that's how. Ruth Wilcox farted. And Margaret Schlegel queefed. And when people 'only connected' sometimes it was just for a second-rate blowjob. (But -- to rephrase Woody Allen -- even a second-rate blowjob is a-okay in my book.) What I am saying is that there is a messiness in life that literature and art (necessarily) tidies up. We would be frustrated by a novel that was as pointless, random, unstructured, meandering, and unintelligible as real life. But I think Hard Rain Falling contends with this messiness to a greater extent than do most novels of its era. You won't find anything approaching ethical simplicity in this novel, so if you crave high-contrast moralism, avoid this. Don Carpenter does something fairly noteworthy here. He creates a character (Jack Levitt) who is reasonably unlikeable in an abstract sense; if I listed off his traits, attitudes, and behaviors from most of the novel, you'd be left with a mental image of the bastard offspring of Courtney Love and Dick Cheney. In a word, unsympathetic. And yet... and yet... Carpenter does not trick you into condoning Jack's behavior by providing cheap rationalizations, but he nevertheless creates a real, complex character whom you, the reader, wants to see better himself, on many levels. Carpenter makes you care. And let me tell you... that's hard work! It's hard to make people care about (mostly) uncaring characters. Carpenter's treatment of race and homosexuality is also worthy of mention here. We can not, with any degree of sincerity, deny that racism and homophobia were significant components of mainstream American culture in the 1950s and 1960s. Hell, we can't deny that they're still fucking things up in a major way even today... not just in America, of course, but everywhere; perhaps the categories of 'otherness' are different in other cultures, but they're almost always there. But when an average black man lives his life, I feel confident saying that racism is a 'mere' fact; now it may be a fact to be combatted or acquiesced to, but there are always other facts. An average black man's life isn't structured like a novel about racism (as an issue to be foregrounded), and Carpenter recognizes that. Ditto for homosexuality. These realities may be more significant and influential to the individual's life, but they never express the totality of experience. I think that many authors tend to fetishize social injustice. It might seem as though I am saying that they overstate it -- which is far from the case; I actually believe that by rendering it so extraordinary, they understate it. I mean, racism is depressing, yes, but racism standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the banal miseries of everyday life is almost unbearable. But this is real life, and I think Don Carpenter does an admirable job of approaching it in a way no author of his generation did."}, {"userName": "Garima", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915003-garima", "userReview": "When a book starts with a line which is immediately reminiscent of Infinite Jest, then it\u2019s alright to have some unrestrained expectations from it. \n They can kill you, but they can\u2019t eat you.\nBut with Hard Rain Falling I had to keep a lot many things in mind before letting my expectations go out of hand and to eventually give what I may immodestly pronounce as a fair reaction. The fact that this book was written in 1960\u2019s was something I constantly reminded myself. It helped when I came across lines like:  Nobody ever escaped from The Rock. Sean Connery? I digressed and I had to Focus. This went on for almost halfway through the novel because I was coming across one thing or the other I have either read or seen before. So what kept me going? Don Carpenter\u2019s writing is one of the most honest narrative voices I have ever come across. There\u2019s almost a childlike innocence in his account of some of the events that I even let out a corny awww on certain occasions. This book is all Americana and a little more. It has orphanages, reform homes and Jack Levitt. It has pool-halls, runaway children and Billy Lancing. It has petty crimes, prisons, paroling and philosophy. And since it\u2019s so huge in scope, the elements within are described in moderation. Nothing is over the top, nothing is under the bottom. Everything is there and that\u2019s it. Except one or two instances, this novel failed to excite me as a reader. It takes a long straight road stretching over a period of three decades, hardly takes any interesting turns and the episodic stops at the road side joints a.k.a philosophizing usually serves the same old existential food. It\u2019s like watching a documentary where the chronicles of a lonely person moves you in some inexplicable way but the same when written on a piece of paper doesn\u2019t deliver the same kind of impact. But I better give this book its due where it deserves. The scenes dealing with homosexuality are handled beautifully and if nothing else this book can be read for that part only. The internal monologues are good, again thanks to the honesty of Don\u2019s writing but at times most of the things read like the paraphrasing of the same ideas. So what was his life? Look out there at all the ten million things life can be, and tell yourself which are yours, and which you will never do. And there was the agony of it; so much he wanted to do, and so little he could do.The above sentence sums the whole book pretty well. Just replace few words with freedom, sex and money. Considering it was Don\u2019s debut novel evoked some sensitivity in me but I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t seem to have the power to leave an ever lasting impression. 3 Stars averaging out on I really liked it, I liked it and It was Ok because the rain must be falling hard but all I felt was a mild drizzle."}, {"userName": "kohey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8936504-kohey", "userReview": "Though it is hard to categorize this novel(it might not be necessary),I'd say it is more of a human tragedy than a noir or a crime.Prologue is superb and I\u2019d go so far as to say that this part strongly influences the entire story and the way of life the protagonist tries to lead or avoid.The story line is simple yet somewhat destined so that readers can leisurely stop to consider why the charcters think and act in the way they do in certain situations and relationships.It seems like they try to get out of a life of spider web in which they go elsewhere at some points,but always end up where they started.Fate plays a nasty part there.The ending is not so clear as I expected,but me being a reader who favors strong characters and good passages rather than plots,it is for me a great read."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "[Billy and Jack (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "RandomAnthony", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony", "userReview": "How much emotional strength does a man have, and does it matter?Hard Rain Falling might be as stark and uncompromising a novel as I\u2019ve ever read. The story focuses on Jack, raised in an orphanage and proficient in petty crime and bad decisions, and Billy, a pool hustler who starts losing his touch at the tables and makes his own harrowing mistakes. The two meet in Portland as teenagers and reconnect years later in a California prison. Jack\u2019s post-incarceration search for meaning comprise the novel\u2019s last third.Carpenter\u2019s talents lie in his psychological analysis of desperate, dead-end characters; his reference to Jack reading classic Russian novels is no accident. Both Jack and Billy are too smart to engage in self-pity, but when they face the world without it, their clear-eyed perceptions don\u2019t leave much on which to hang meaning. Physical and emotional hunger can be sated but not for long, and neither hold much substance. And while a man with a very slim margin of error and no status can stay out of trouble for a stretch, under duress, one mistake and he\u2019s totally fucked. No one is inviting Jack or Billy up the social ladder. There is no relative to bail them out. They find a small measure love and significance in both their own relationship and, later, Jack\u2019s relationship with his son. Still, the terror of losing both, along with the fear of the effect they\u2019ll have on each other and their children, leads to sacrifice of the saddest nature.Holy hell, if I\u2019m going to be straight, Hard Rain Falling is 99% fucking depressing, but I felt like if I didn\u2019t finish I would be A) missing out on some deep, honest writing, and B) I would be a big wuss. Some passages are mesmerizing. Carpenter\u2019s description, for example, of Jack helplessness when his son is sick, is brilliant. This is a brave book, and you better be in damn good mental health to tackle this sucker. Joy Division has nothing on Don Carpenter. I\u2019m not surprised this novel is respected but not popular.

It's a fair question because Jack asks himself that. It's just an itch, he rationalizes. Think of a creature so constructed that in order to survive, eat, sleep, procreate, get the snot out of its nose, it had to be triggered by pleasure instead of rationality.Jack has a lot of time to think, see, because he is often in the slammer. And he's there for things he's done, for things he hasn't done; but mostly because of who and what he's not. A parable? So he scratches his itch, at least situationally if not fundamentally, and gets to the more philosophical question: what would you do for love?And he thinks of life on the inside and life on the outside:But these people were not in prison, not even in a metaphorical prison. Jack had known convicts who said that everybody was in prison, that life was a prison, or society a prison, even being stuck with your own identity was a prison; but Jack no longer believed that: prison was a prison, nothing else. People might be in trouble, or feel stifled or restricted, or even trapped, but they weren't in prison. It just wasn't the same thing at all.

Reading it required a degree of commitment that I was unprepared for and it took a beat to adjust to the relentless cycle of desire> action>consequence which enacts quietly, intently. It\u2019s like everything transpires within a tight fist, fists flyin and all.  Out of the wild action, truth is delivered with clear-eyed lucidity and although the characters talk of self-pity quite a bit, the truth is clean of it. Clean of regret. There is something amazing about this novel. I\u2019m a little awed. I've always been fascinated with the concept of personal freedom and what that entails and although the novel explores societal, sexual and moral territory - there is an undefinable emphasis on a truer form of freedom. You know enough to know how you feel is senseless, but you don\u2019t know enough to know why. Sitting in another lousy hotel room waiting for a couple of girls you\u2019ve never seen before to do a bunch of things you\u2019ve done so many times it makes your skin crawl just o think about it. Things. To do. That you dreamed about when you couldn\u2019t have them. When there was only one thing, really, that made you feel good, and now you\u2019ve done that so many times it\u2019s like masturbating. Except you never really made it, did you. Never really killed anybody. That\u2019s what you always wanted to do, smash the brains out of somebody\u2019s head; break him apart until nothing is left but you. But you never made it. If I had to boil this down, Hard Rain Falling is immensity. Jack had the right idea; his first reaction to the immensity of the ocean was to smile, wild with curiosity. Did anyone expect that of Jack? I just didn\u2019t. But it was so perfect that he did. In that moment, I believe he 'made it' in a way that really counted."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "Whatever made him run away from Oakland to the Wild West seemed to have been taken care of, one way or another.

The obvious distinction being that an architect plans out every aspect of their story in advance, whereas a gardener starts out with an idea, and waits to see where it goes. (I know the definitions are obvious in this context, but bear with me, I\u2019ve been conditioned to write this way for three years, and I feel naked without attaching a clear definition or explanation for things.) Murakami himself, identifies himself as a mix of the two. Personally, my experience with writing is limited to an academic or legal setting. I\u2019m not a creative writer, and eschew spontaneity in pretty much every aspect of my life. Thus, I firmly classify myself as an \u201carchitect,\u201d (I always wanted to pretend to be an architect!*) I can\u2019t write anything without constructing an outline first - I feel lost without a definite plan. I think Carpenter is an architect that got a little bit sloppy in Hard Rain Falling. I think he started out with a distinct idea of where he wanted the story to go from the outset, and executed it well for the first 2/3 of the novel. In the last 1/3 or so, he started to lose me; and here\u2019s why: he starts out with a protagonist that is completely abominable in every way; despite his tragic beginning, it was truly difficult to find anything redeeming about him, and thus be able to sympathize with him. But, as the story progressed, I suddenly found myself on Jack\u2019s side. I realized that Carpenter had managed to successfully lure me in by slowly revealing the vulnerabilities of an otherwise repugnant character. However, I felt that Carpenter was less successful in developing other aspects of Jack\u2019s evolution. Throughout the story, Jack is a character that is full of rage, and completely devoid of any kind of introspective qualities. Therefore, I thought Carpenter was asking a lot of his readers by accepting certain developments in Jack\u2019s character in the last 1/3 of the book, namely his newly self-aware, philosophical tendencies, his interests in literature, and his feelings on raising children. It didn\u2019t feel natural or consistent with the story to have Jack acquire these characteristics, especially after being released from prison, where he witnessed the violent death of the only person that ever loved him. To me, it\u2019s counterintuitive and inconsistent with his character that he didn\u2019t become more destructive and enraged after that. It seemed problematic that Billy\u2019s death served as a catalyst for Jack\u2019s rehabilitation without more insight on his internal development subsequent to that traumatic event. It\u2019s almost as if my copy of the book is missing 20 pages or so. For the above mentioned reasons, I vacillated between giving this three or four stars. In the absence of an articulable standard of what exactly differentiates a three star book from a four star book, I\u2019ve given this four stars. And admittedly, I\u2019m grading on a curve. It would be unconscionable to give this three stars when I\u2019ve given far lesser books three stars. However, I reserve the right to later amend this rating.*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DUPfQ..."}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "First published in 1966, Don Carpenter's hard-hitting existential tale of young hustlers follows the adventures of Jack Levitt, an orphaned teenager living off his wits in the fleabag hotels and seedy pool halls of Portland, Oregon. Jack befriends Billy Lancing, a young black runaway and pool hustler extraordinaire. Both young men were destined for different paths after a heist goes tragically wrong.

Richard Price and George Pelecanos both praised the novel as one of the most important American novels of the 60's generation. Although it had elements of a crime novel, there is far more to it than that. Infused with a tender intensity that is open and frank on both friendship and sexual passion, which makes the novel multi-layered and deeply meaningful.

The book blurb says it's a \"Dostoyevskian tale of crime, punishment, and the pursuit of an ever-elusive redemption,\" but Jack Levitt, the protagonist, is far from feeling the psychological guilt of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment. Abandoned in an orphanage in Portland, Oregon, he pursues a life of crime and ends up naked in an isolation cell for four months and three days without light (in a scene so eerie that I doubt I'll ever forget it). There is no sentimentality in this book. Jack's amorality is purely human, completely understandable, and has nothing to do with God, the devil, or the possibility of the afterlife. As the novel progresses, Jack's awakening - intellectual and emotional - is produced so realistically that there is nowhere I can point to say \"this, or this, or this, does not seem believable.\" Don Carpenter's writing is astounding. The third-person narrative, which is so close to Jack, expresses his heart's deepest knowledge without ever feeling false or over-intellectualized. At the beginning of the novel, Jack thinks: \"If he got caught, he accepted his punishment. He had always known that what he had wanted most was freedom, escape from the orphanage, and when he was ready, he escaped. That was all. Then he no longer wanted his freedom, because he had it.\" By the end of the novel there is this: \"Later, after it was all over [. . .] he would realize that the freedom he had always yearned for and never understood was beyond his or any man's reach, and that all men must yearn for it equally.\" This is not doing justice to his thoughts about freedom, but the depth of his final understanding is inspired. Early in his life, there was not much to love about Jack Levitt, but by the final scene I feel nothing but hope and compassion for him.His time in San Quentin is brilliantly done. The loneliness, the dangerous social systems, race, work details, prison sex - it's all here, written without contrivance. The wardens and guards are not evil. The prisoners are not caricatures. The sex isn't funny or gross. But the social commentary is tremendously interesting. As here: \"The perfect convict, the man who lived entirely by the rules set down for him, was not a man but a vegetable. And the constant troublemaker, no matter how sick he was inside, was actually doing just what the State expected of him, therefore justifying the existence of the prison. So it was a matter of delicate balance between defiance and obedience.\"Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment focuses most intently on \"punishment,\" but Don Carpenter's book shows, in all its nuance, HOW redemption might be achieved. It's not through God's salvation. Jack Levitt earns it through his very human efforts, and I am damn proud of him."}, {"userName": "Rayroy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622891-rayroy", "userReview": "Never before have I read a novel that was so true, so raw and so heartbreaking, I was often filled with dread and anxiety for the characters in Hard Rain Falling, because they are flawed and can\u2019t escape who and what they are no matter how hopeful they are, they keep failing in life and it\u2019s as if their doomed from the start.

Actually he is not revelling in anything as he died about twenty years ago. However if the quality of his novel Hard Rain Falling is an accurate compass, he should probably be considered one of the great 20th century American authors. Hard Rain Falling is simply brilliant. Written completely without ostentation or pretence, it is a rigorous study of the suffering and isolation of those who are born without the benefit of good fortune. For what else can explain those who are born into wealth and glory and those who are not. Well......it is more than this, too. It is also the narration of a man who drags himself from the abyss of hard luck and degradation to find a modicum of redemption and mercy. Through an orphanage, a reform school and finally prison, Don Carpenter examines how an individual attains a kind of freedom from the more oppressive components of the societal machine without submitting himself to isolation from the society.In the great tradition of Hubert Selby and Charles Bukowski, Don Carpenter has made a stunning and absorbing contribution to 20th century American realism.

Hard and fast stuff. Excellent. Now read about 90 pages and it just gets better and better, it is almost miraculously good..SPOILER ALERT...This is how I experienced this book: read up to page 60 thinking yes this is good stuff, appreciating it, the set up, the characters 'hardboiled' and petty criminals, a lot about pool about which I know little, then Billy a black newcomer to the scene is invited to a party and waits for a lift, after standing at a big smelly urinal trying to pee, near to tears and thinking he is unwanted and left, and then the car arrives. For some reason from this moment, I was absolutely there, something about the unflashy prose had worked its way into me, it was more than just a good book, it was great, I was getting in the crowded car with them, Billy sitting on Jack Levitt's lap - the only place he could sit - he said, 'now every time we go over a bump, you owe me a dollar'. I was at the party, held in a place they break into and wreck, where Jack falls asleep drunk. He is awakened by two big plainsclothesmen, fights them, gets coshed, ends up in reform school where his urge to kill (not the result of a process of brutalization) lands him in solitary confinement. Here after a while time ceased to exist. Time slipped in a strange way. First he was aware there was no present, no such thing as a moment.. At first he could not see because there was no light in his cell; then that became a delusion, and he could not see because he could not see, and then even that lost its reality, he could not see because there was nothing to see and never had been - his mind had tricked him into believing there were colors and shapes and he knew there were no such things....But then there would be a clank and a rattle at the door, followed by the smell of food and everything would rush back into him as the smell of food hit him and aroused him and he would begin to tremble and slather and giggle.The book goes on to follow Jack and Billy's lives and they meet again in prison, in San Quentin where they have a sexual relationship. There are some moving moments here, one especially 'Brokeback Mountain' moment later but I don't want to spoil it too much for prospective readers. (I do wonder if Annie Proulx read this though before she wrote BM).Jack goes on to marry a rich girl (or so he thinks), and the book broadens out to include meditations on marriage and fatherhood. The book is wide ranging, and will frequently break off to consider questions of existence and race and relationships which sounds pretentious, and not normally something I like, but it grows naturally out of the story.It is hard to quote a passage that will show you why this book is so good, because it is the cumulative effect of the story and the simple prose, the clear eyed view of the author which makes it so, it might take you a little while to feel it but by page 60 you will be away.

In his introduction, Pelecanos suggests that it \"might be the most unheralded important American novel of the 1960s.\"I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but it is a very good book with brilliantly drawn characters. The main protagonist is Jack Levitt, an orphan whom we first meet on the streets of Portland, Oregon, in 1947. Jack is 17 at the time and has fallen in with a gang of rough boys who live by their wits on the margins of society. The book follows Jack's life until 1960, and it's not a pretty picture. Jack is in and out of trouble and, as a consequence, is also in and out of jail through most of this time. Some of the prison scenes are harrowing but, for that matter, so are many of the scenes when Jack is out on the streets, technically a \"free\" man.Early on, Jack meets Billy Lancing, a young black pool hustler from Seattle. Jack, who has no special skills or talents, envies Billy who has a great natural gift as a pool player. Initially, Jack targets Billy as a mark, but the two form a bond that will carry them as they cross paths through the years. Jack and Billy both spend a great deal of time contemplating their own lives and the nature of life in general, and there are times when Carpenter extends these ruminations for a bit longer than he should. But that is really the only flaw in this book whose principal strength lies in its characters, even the most minor of whom are fully realized and unforgettable. There is not a single phony or contrived moment in \"Hard Rain Falling,\" and from start to finish, the reader is immersed into a universe that seems completely real and that is totally compelling. This is not a pretty world, but once Carpenter has grabbed hold of you, you can't turn away from watching it. This is very much a book of the early 1960s, and the universe that Carpenter has recreated here is long since gone. He serves up a slice of American life that few of us would want to experience first hand. But readers will be grateful to George Pelecanos and New York Review Books for giving them the opportunity to visit it from a safe distance."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken", "userReview": "Where has THIS oddity been hiding since its inception in the 60's? NYRB is certainly to be commended for doing all the hard work and finding gold chips in the salsa for us. Not that I found it Nirvana. Just nervy for its day. It's a pool (billiards, I mean) book, a prison book, and an echoes-of-Hemingway book all in one. Let's start with the hustling.Carpenter has done some time in a pool hall or two. With the character of Billy Lancing, he captures the thrill of the kill (as in, killing suckers and separating them from their money) as well as the edgy sass and mind games that go into a hustler's talk. This being the 60s and Billy being black (albeit a light-skinned one), race is in the hall, too. Billy utilizes his \"handicap\" to perfection, using it to gall and taunt his white challengers. End result of these color games? Green. For Billy.But the main character is Jack Levitt, an orphan from practically the get-go. A 20-something tough guy without a job, he's to fistfights what Billy is to pool -- only fistfights pay considerably less. He also likes booze and women (until he hits prison -- more on that later). This book HAD to do time not just in prison but on Bukowski's night stand. Meaning? If riding shotgun with the lowlifes is your thrill, HARD RAIN FALLING might be your book.Eventually Jack lands in San Quentin. Oh, he's in a few other prisons beforehand and it looks like Carpenter did time in the Big House, too -- or so the precise description of Jack's time in the complete darkness of solitary would indicate. It's uncannily real, or what passes for real, given that few readers can compare notes. Billy winds up in prison, too, where he becomes Jack's cellmate. Here Carpenter takes on homosexuality about as frankly as a 60s writer could be expected to. It's three choices, according to him: celibacy, secret masturbation in a place with little privacy, or another guy. The way it's described here, Billy and Jack take a long time to come to it, but they're both in their 20s and feeling the heat, so Door Number 3 it is!Carpenter describes it like so: \"It was an arrangement, coldly conceived for sexual satisfaction, without even words that first time, but limited by coldly precise and rational language from there on out. The terms were that they would use each other's bodies for that ornate form of masturbation called Making Love, but there was to be no question of emotional involvement, or prying into one another's soul. This, they decided coldly, would keep them from going crazy or queer.\" I loved that bit: \"an ornate form of masturbation.\" I don't think the word \"ornate\" has ever carried such an onerous weight! And note how \"cold\" that love sex is! \"Coldly\" has three cameos in one paragraph!After they get out of prison comes the part of the book I like best. On parole, Jack gets a job in a bakery and one day a bunch of rich drunks straight out of Fitzgerald come in, running into this ex-con straight out of Hemingway (well, if Hem's homophobia were unleashed). Jack falls for Sally, a rich girl with a penchant for sex and money (now THERE'S a familiar combo). They try to make a go of it, and the mismatch of this educated spoiled girl and this trying-to-learn ne'er do well (she has him reading ULYSSES, for chrissakes!) is reminiscent of some of the Hemingway mismatched couples we've read in the past. (Note: Jack finds Joyce to be horse crap and prefers FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Jim Jones fans, take a rare victory!). Anyway, they wed. No kidding. And you get a front row scene to the train wreck. Choo-choo interrupted, and all that! Interesting writing. Not consistent, but certainly good more often than not. This is for the minimalists among us. If you like fancy Henry James and Wee Willie Faulkner sentences longer than a boa before it constricts her, take a pass. Otherwise, get your rain gear and give HARD RAIN FALLING a rip.

It is dark, gritty and real, a no-holds barred kind of novel that goes well beyond the much overdone \u201cangry young man\u201d trope to become a story that is intrepidly honest. Considering its initial publication date of 1966, it\u2019s also a novel much ahead of its time in the way that the author deals with racism, homosexuality and the harshness of unreasoned authority.The main character is Jack Levitt, whose parents were young and stupid when he was born, leaving him in a hellhole of an orphanage. Jack runs away from there when he is older, lands in Portland, Oregon. There he meets Billy Lancing, a young black man from Seattle who gets by as a pool hustler, and with whom Jack finds friendship. But Jack can't stay out of trouble, and eventually lands in a reform school, where he spent much of his time in a dark cell in solitary confinement after nearly killing one of the guards. There  \"At times, all his senses deserted him, and he could not feel the coldness of the concrete or smell his excrement, and the small sounds he made and the sounds that filtered in through the door gradually dimmed, and he was left alone inside his mind, without a past to envision, since his inner vision was gone, too, and without a future to dream, because there was nothing but this emptiness and himself. It was not uncomfortable, not comfortable. These things this did not exist. It was colorless, senseless, mindless, and he sometimes just disappeared into it.\" (81)This feeling of utter isolation pervades Jack Levitt's character throughout the novel. Eventually Jack finds himself in San Quentin on a trumped-up charge. It is there he meets up again with Billy Lancing, who maneuvers things so that he and Levitt become cell mates, and what starts out as just prison sex turns into something else, a human and feeling connection between the two, although Jack can't bring himself to admit it until it's too late and Jack is once more in the depths of loneliness. And even though Jack is eventually somewhat transformed after his release, when he marries and has a kid, the freedom he envisioned in the past continues to escape him.Hard Rain Falling is a book that is raw in emotion. Every character is real and feels. This in itself is an incredible achievement - I can't think of another book in which the characters are so powerfully alive, especially Jack. And while so many novelists are into the game of blaming society for an individual's lifelong ills, that's really not the case here. As George Pelecanos notes in the introduction to this story, \"the damage done to Jack at his very core can never truly be healed (xi),\" and Jack notes that underneath it all, it wasn't really society that had abandoned him, but his parents.Truly an amazing novel that I can recommend wholeheartedly."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "'Hard Rain Falling' (1966)by Don CarpenterI came across 'Hard Rain Falling' (1966) by Don Carpenter as it was an Audible deal of the day.

'Hard Rain Falling' is a modern classic.5/5"}, {"userName": "Eugene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76519-eugene", "userReview": "who knew macho came in so many delicate colors? evidently don carpenter did. and displayed the entire spectrum in his great brutal HARD RAIN FALLING... with a palpable adherence to some unsaid code of defiant honesty, carpenter's first novel anchors itself in a historically determined idea of manhood that dates itself much less than one might at first assume.three very different eras in one man's life:\u00a0a raging early hoodlum boyhood of poolhalls and not-so-petty crimes; then stints at prison including one tremendous tear of writing and existential fury describing a solitary confinement episode and also, later, a very moving and tragic love story between inmates at san quentin... the book perhaps should have ended there but gives us a final portrait of the ex-con as a young father... this bit, while burning not quite as hot, also has its philosophical rewards. this last domestic section may also only seem a letdown because by then you've become accustomed to the explosive miracles carpenter seems to be pulling off scene after extended scene.usually i dislike books where i'm\u00a0constantly\u00a0wondering what happens next because i feel manipulated, as if i'm on some kind of ride. i wondered what came next here, but i didn't mind.when he\u00a0took his life at the age of 64\u00a0don carpenter was at work on a final book called\u00a0FRIDAYS AT ENRICO's\u00a0about his particular san franciscio literary scene. he was good friends with evan connell, anne lamott, and richard brautigan. the obits report that carpenter was badly effected by his friend brautigan's suicide.\u00a0here's a memorial written by carpenter about their friendship.here's\u00a0an interview with NYRB editor edwin frank\u00a0about how the reprint came about -- mostly it seems from the support of george pelecanos.and here's\u00a0pelecanos reading from HARD RAIN FALLING.pick it up from the library or from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Lorenzo Berardi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/183865-lorenzo-berardi", "userReview": "This novel was four star material for a long while of the reading process due to too much of pool games descriptions in the early and middle chapters. Masterful pool games descriptions, I reckon. Save that I cannot stand billiard. Anyway, just like it happened with all that baseball business in 'Underworld' by Don De Lillo, eventually I won over my lack of interest (and knowledge) for the sake of the engaging plot. For Don Carpenter certainly knew where to find pool joints of ill fame in the US West Coast and spent days looking at the fellows playing there, but - most importantly - he knew how to write a eight ball of a first novel at the age of 33. Yes, it's hard to believe that, but this is a first novel. I won't lie here. 'Hard Rain Falling' took a good 50 pages to get me (blame it on the snooker), but at the end of the day it deserves the highest mark. This is a sincere, brave and poignant novel. It's sincere because the author never tries to be cheeky, but rewards the reader writing about people rather than characters. People who think and double-think, bluff and double-bluff. People who pose questions to themselves and often struggle to find the appropriate answer, but never stop trying. It's brave because Carpenter writes about heavy topics such as social isolation, gambling, racial issues, alcoholism, flawed justice, incarceration, masturbation, homosexuality, and postpartum depression. These contents are always handled at just the right time and delivered in a straightforward and yet profound way. It's poignant because one cannot help but feeling more and more emotionally attached to Jack Levitt and Billy Lancing - the two protagonists of the novel - in all their misadventures. Levitt and Lancing are actually pretty distasteful cats at the beginning of the novel, but Carpenter let them be and somehow they both grew on me. I'm glad this book got republished. It was a shame to let it fade neglected. In some parts this novel reminded me of 'In Cold Blood' by Truman Capote, but 'Hard Rain Falling' is more realistic than that and displays a much better psychological insight on the main protagonists. Which is kind of funny if you think that this is a work of fiction while Capote wrote about something that really happened.Unlike the one by Capote this is not a novel about crime and its punishment. And neither a novel about moral redemption and its social rewards. 'Hard Rain Falling' is a book about outcasts looking for something they're not fully aware of: their real selves. Johnny Cash would have loved it."}, {"userName": "Daniel Villines", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines", "userReview": "I once spent five hours flying on board an aircraft watching consecutive episodes of Lockup Raw. I was hooked by the inmates and their stories. In episode after episode, prisoners, outcasts of society, were interviewed and each one told of their crimes (or of their innocence) in an honest straight forward manner. While on camera, they acted like they were talking to their next door neighbor. And yet, during all those hours of Lockup Raw, there was never an understanding of who these people were and the question of choice was never resolved. Why couldn't these criminals simply decide to not do the things they did?Hard Rain Falling provides some portion of understanding into who these people might be through its main character, Jack Levitt. While Jack Levitt was an outcast of society, it was not due to his poor decisions. Jack made the best decisions possible based on the content of his beliefs. It was also not due to his laziness. Jack worked as hard as he could to the physical and intellectual limits of his abilities. Nor was it due to a disinterest in learning. Jack had a hunger to learn and constantly sought to expand his understanding of the world. And it was not due to some sort of pure evilness of heart. Jack pursued love to the point of pain. If Jack Levitt was an outcast of society, then the only real reason for his position in life was the randomness associated with his creation.The strength of this book rests in the intricate development of its characters in the first two parts of the book. Carpenter succeeds in defining characters that are rational unto themselves, while at the same time appearing irrational when viewed from a societal perspective. Reasons for violence and crime abounded in the mind of Jack Levitt even though society would see things differently. This duplicity of perspective was engrossing and it makes Hard Rain Falling into a reading experience.The book's shortcomings rest in the third and final part. After being drawn into Carpenters world of complex characters, the third part of the book seems light and rushed. Rather than achieving a sense of duplicity that was previously relished, the characters in the third part of the book seemed, at times, contradictory. Hard Rain Falling is still a great book, but another hundred pages devoted to the last part of the book would have made it unique."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2242482-david", "userReview": "I loved this for the prisons and the pool halls. Absolutely fantastic. Thrilling action, enjoyable dialogue ... and interior monologues that felt incredibly special.The canter through the marriage weakened it, however.

They\u2019ve got good literary taste, sure, but they\u2019ve also have a sense of style. I\u2019m very easily influenced by style. I judge a book by its cover, and the New York Review of Books has developed a strong brand with its text box floating over an alluring image. The cover of Don Carpenter\u2019s HARD RAIN FALLING is especially evocative: the speeding muscle car, just out of focus, on a lonely country road. I wanted to read the novel the moment I saw that cover. I\u2019m also unduly swayed by blurbs. That\u2019s where I got into trouble, for on the back of the book is a quote from author Anne LaMott. I really don\u2019t like Anne LaMott. Whenever she writes something I find myself either disagreeing or shaking my head at the triteness of her statement. Her endorsement almost stopped me from cracking the spine on this great book. It\u2019s everything that Anne LaMott isn\u2019t: honest, truthful, engaging. The story is emotionally gripping, philosophically probing and existentially compelling. At the beginning, I was reminded of THE STRANGER, with it\u2019s theme of crime and punishment in an indifferent world, but Carpenter is more human than Camus in his depiction of life. There\u2019s blood in Carpenter\u2019s characters rather than theory. I love Camus and THE STRANGER, but Carpenter moved me. Maybe I\u2019m just a sentimental jerk, but if that\u2019s the hand I\u2019ve been dealt then I\u2019m playing it."}], "description": "Don Carpenter's Hard Rain Falling is a tough-as-nails account of being down and out, but never down for good?a Dostoyevskian tale of crime, punishment, and the pursuit of an ever-elusive redemption.
