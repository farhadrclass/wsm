When I first read this years ago I loved it, I could not put it down. As Stranger in a Strange Land was a Robert A. Heinlein vehicle for theology, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress to ideology. And just as The Fountainhead is the better, though less epic, of the pair with Atlas Shrugged, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress, the more focused and simple of the two, better than Stranger in a Strange Land. I liked the setting, the use of libertarian principles and of course the brilliant work of the Grandmaster himself.This is a virtuoso science fiction futuristic re-telling of the American Revolution. Told from the first person recollection of a computer technician (with thick Russian accent) and of the birth and progress of the Lunar independence.The Moon (Luna to it\u2019s residents \u2013 who call themselves Loonies) has been a penal colony for decades. It is the perfect prison, get outside the underground warrens and beyond the air locks and you\u2019re on the moon. Without a pressure suit, you\u2019re dead. There are very little rules and no real laws, so a hardscrabble anarchy has created a loose but tough and resilient populace who want freedom.Certainly this libertarian paradise could have become an anarchistic hell, but in Heinlein\u2019s hard loving hands, his creation is the Free State of Luna. This story tracks with the American Revolution with unfair and distant landowners, inept and uncaring provisional governors (the warden) and even a declaration of independence on the fourth of July. Students of revolutionary movements will also see an allegory for \u201cthrowing rocks\u201d as a statement about the earliest stages of discontent and reaction.First published in 1966, this was written at the zenith of his considerable powers and stands as a true classic of the genre. I just re-read this (one the very few books that I have read more than once) and may re-read it again \u2013 it\u2019s that good."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "do you play games where you know the outcome of the game itself is without question... where any fun to be had is not so much in the winning - that's predetermined - but in figuring out how exactly you will win, what moves you will make, how you will overcome all those minor hurdles along the way? that's sometimes how i feel when playing chess with some folks. for me, it's not the most exciting thing in the world; it's a little eye-rolling. i think others may have more excitement when playing a game they know they'll win. my little nephews seem to have a really enjoyable time kicking my ass at their various new-fangled video games. personally i don't get it, but they seem to love illustrating how easy and exciting it is, the thrill of watching all their strategies and skills coming to predictable fruition. even when there is no real competition. their eventual win is obvious. and that's the impression that i'm left with after reading the enjoyable Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.the novel is about a revolution on Luna by its oppressed permanent labor force. far in the future, the moon is the newest Prison Island... once you are transported there, you can't come back. and there you work, mainly to export grain, and live a life of economic exploitation by The Lunar Authority. you will alway live in this proletariat society. overall, it is actually not a horrible existence. the \"Loonies\" are an enjoyable lot, unpretentious and down to earth, concerned mainly with beer, gambling, and the ladies. Heinlein creates an odd and i suppose semi-utopic world, with a pleasing lack of laws (a kind of libertarian anarchy of sorts) and a surprisingly liberated view on women. basically, women are the social/family/romantic Boss of It All... not truly a matriarchal society per se, but rather one built around the need to make sure women are completely empowered. apparently due to the 2-to-1 status of men to women on the moon, and the need for women to be 'available' to much more than monogamy, if they so chose.still, despite the basic lack of horror in this odd world... it's no fun to be exploited by bureaucratic overseers. and so must come REVOLUTION! we have our friendly & no-nonsense Everyman, we have our bewitching & passionate Lady in Hiding, we have our amusing & highly intellectual Idealistic Professor. and of course we have our sentient computer Mike, who likes to play games. and revolution is just another kind of game, right?the writing is breezy, casual, and in a sort of pidgen english - a kind of cross between baby talk and our very own text messaging style. that style should be annoying but actually isn't. much like with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, we have a fascinating computer who provides all of the genuinely emotional and resonant moments in the narrative. and - perhaps because of the time period in which the novel was written, but certainly topical today - we have a step-by-step account of How To Make A Revolution Work. Heinlein's passions come across mainly in the world-building of this almost-utopia and in the very detailed expression of how exactly to overthrow the chains of oppression through revolution (and i suppose a bit of terrorism, at times).so back to my original point. i liked this novel, but i would never consider reading it a second time. it was fun. but the outcome was never in question. Heinlein loads the dice by making sure that everything happens as projected, each step of the way. no tension... and a tension-free revolution is a curiously child-like enterprise. child-like but not childish. there is a sweet na\u00efvet\u00e9 to it all. Heinlein jerry-built this revolution to be won and so i never felt any kind of nervousness, i never worried. the only stakes that were meaningful to me were the (rather slight) emotional stakes around Mike the computer: his past loneliness, his concern about whether he is actually sentient, and his need to have friends, to talk to people who are 'not-stupid'. aww... that's adorable! Mike, i'm not super-smart or anything, but i'll be your friend! cute little revolutionary computer minds are very appealing to me."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360681-mark", "userReview": "Ah, Heinlein: SF's great paradox artist. I am fairly certain that I have personally held every possible wrong viewpoint on the man. Namely, that he was:1) A radically forward-thinking visionary of libertarianism2) A raging fascist, homophobe, and misogynist3) Any point on the sociopolitical spectrum in between.It's not my fault. Over the course of his career, Heinlein seemed to espouse every possible viewpoint on religion, government, and gender relations (obviously, he liked to stick to small themes), showing little tolerance for moderate opinions. Without a blink of irony, he also placed a premium on pragmatism. And the balance of pragmatism and idealism -- or, rather, the illusion that the two can coexist effortlessly -- is what The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is all about. It is the story of a lunar colony's revolt, in the same way that The Fountainhead is a book about architects (an insulting comparison; Heinlein's prose is significantly more readable than Ayn Rand's). You see, it's really about libertarianism -- or, as one of the book's heroes characterizes it, \"rational anarchism.\"So, a small group of revolutionaries attempts to liberate the moon from her Earthbound oppressors, and institute a perfect anarcho-syndicalist commune in their stead. They set about doing this, of course, with the help of a sentient supercomputer. They organize the people of Luna, and succeed in overthrowing the existing government, but in so doing upset the nations of Earth. After all, the moon has been shipping grain down to help feed Earth's starving masses, so they're a little cranky when the \"Lunies\" threaten to cut off the supply (you'd be cranky living on 1,800 calories a day too). Coincidentally, the ruling philosophy on Luna is the maxim \"TANSTAAFL\" -- There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch. I mentioned that Heinlein was subtle, right?So they go to war, and then, in the novel's single biggest twist, the computer doesn't turn evil. I could hardly believe it.Although the book is riddled with bizarre moments that nag one's attempts to suspend disbelief (the most persistent being Mike the Computer's regular updates as to the revolutionaries' \"probability of success,\" which starts out at 1/7, and then -- as everything proceeds to go perfectly to plan -- drops to as low as 1/100, in unapologetic defiance of all mathematical logic), the plot's weaknesses don't matter. Heinlein is a gifted novelist, and a natural storyteller. Even when the characters decide to take 10 pages off and simply talk politics for a while, it's enthralling. And talk politics they do. No one flinches at the notion of attempting to institute a perfect democracy run entirely by a handful of exceptional individuals, who themselves defer to the managerial expertise of a supercomputer (no tyrannic potential there, right?). Nor do they worry themselves with the philosophical contradiction of attempting to forge a pacifistic state by means of terrorism and interplanetary warfare (those who raise the issue, and thus violate Heinlein's worship at the Altar of Pragmatism, are conveniently Roslined out of the nearest airlock; it's okay, they're wormy enough that you won't miss 'em). But all of this simply serves to illustrate Heinlein's mastery of the ideological paradox. He's more than smart enough to recognize the inconsistencies of his own personal politics, and to play with them to terrific effect. Notably, Heinlein did not self-dentify with the majority of his protagonists. Instead, his Mary Sues are characters like Stranger in a Strange Land's Jubal Harshaw and, in the case of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Professor Bernardo de la Harshaw--er, Paz. They are cynical old men who are, in novel after novel, infallible, brilliant, well-connected, and almost disturbingly capable.Exit thought: why is it that the computer that makes the revolution possible just happens to share its name with the superhuman hero of Stranger In a Strange Land, both of whom disappear suddenly and inexplicably upon concluding their tasks?"}, {"userName": "J.L.

Having recently reread Robert Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, I couldn't stop thinking about the parallels between the awakened computer, Mycroft (Mike) in this novel and Alexa. This connection was reinforced when people kept asking Alexa to tell a joke. While he helps the former convict Lunar settlers in a rebellion against Earth, MIke's obsession remains fixated on jokes (and whether they are funny only once, in a given situation or always funny). Maybe Alexa is not on the verge of becoming self-aware; however, the idea that artificial intelligence could awaken is explored in an interesting way by Heinlein (in 1967) without the knowledge of what AI looks like now. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress feels a little clunky in my reread, but this side plot (Mike awakening) works well with the main plot (overthrowing Earth's control of the Moon). I would also have liked more on the implications of Mike's awakening, but overall Heinlein tells an interesting and enjoyable story about the not so distant future."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "What do you want us to do? Throw rocks at them?Nah, but we could have a tea party.Wow. I'm still amazed at how good this Revolution novel has held up over the years. I had read it twice before this latest re-read, but it hasn't lost any of its charm.Of course, I love Heinlein's heavy reliance on self-reliance, libertarianism, and TANSTAAFL. I'm lucky to have read him early so as to be fully indoctrinated in this gung-ho politicism of Rational Anarchy and I can laugh and whoop and grin foolishly all the while.But I'm weird.Still. When it comes to the story, the most amazing thing about this novel is not that it's set on the moon or that it has been populated with all of Earth's undesirables, or that they're economic slaves to the Earth. Nope. It's amazing that this book is actually a How-To-Guide on how to stage a successful revolution against a technologically and militarily superior foe, from initial planning, leverage, sleeper cells, and of course, political preparation, communication, diplomacy, and economics. And, of course, the resulting MASS DEATH of so many innocents. Can't forget that.But I suppose the one thing that sticks in my mind most strongly is the planetary computer, Mycroft. What a guy/gal. He/she always gets me in the feels. That's leverage.Fortunately or unfortunately, I keep on seeing tons of good revolution books or modern SF still stealing from this classic, either knowingly or unknowingly. Perhaps all AIs that show up in SF are a reply to Mycroft in one way or another. Who knows? This is the one that stands out supreme in my mind and perhaps always shall.Call me a Lunatic. I dare you. ;)This one won the Hugo in '66, but I also place it firmly in one of my top 100 novels of all time. :) Great stuff. :)"}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "[ war (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "She-Who-Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185720-she-who-reads", "userReview": "This is an excellent novel, action-packed, exciting, and deftly-plotted, with fascinating, complex characters and some interesting science-fictional ideas. I also enjoyed reading about Luna's culture; I thought the marriage customs were particularly interesting.One thing I noticed right off was the way the Loonies use language differently than people from earth do. In fact, it threw me at first -- I couldn't figure out what was going on or why the language was so rough and unpolished and choppy. Eventually, though, I found the rhythm of it and settled in just fine -- I didn't even notice it after a while. It makes sense; Luna started off as a penal colony and has since developed completely separate from Earth and relatively unmolested. Of course they would have their own dialect and speech patterns! To my mind, their language seems to be as efficient as possible. They trimmed away any unnecessary deadwood -- they don't use articles, for example, and very few personal pronouns, and they seem to prefer to use fragments to complete sentences. Only the essentials remain, much the same as the original colonists/prisoners had to start their lives over with only the bare essentials and sometimes not even that.This book was written about forty years ago, and it has stood the test of time quite well, but there are some aspects of it that do seem rather dated. For example, the idea behind the character of Mike -- the computer that is connected to everything and has \"woken up\" or become alive -- is one that is very familiar to modern readers, one that we accept easily. Apparently, we accept it much more easily than Heinlen expected his readers in 1965 to accept it, because he spends more time explaining it than he really needs to. When Mannie, the narrator, tells Wyoh about Mike and introduces them via a telephone conversation, she is shocked that Mike already knows what she looks like. He looked up her medical records and found a picture of her immediately after being introduced to her. To modern readers familiar with the internet, this is an obvious step and hardly shocking; we expect it, and Wyoh's shock and apparent need to have every detail and implication of Mike's \"life\" spelled out for her makes her seem a little bit stupid to us. If we don't remember that Heinlen is using Wyoh to explain things to his 1965 audience that his 2005 audience intuitively understands, then we'll get a little frustrated with Wyoh's denseness.All in all, though, this is a novel about politics -- a very complex, deep, intellectual and sophisticated look at politics, government, revolution and war. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress has a very definite world-view and political philosophy, some of which I agreed with, and some of which I really, really didn't. My agreement (or lack thereof) with the politics espoused in this book didn't seem to have much bearing on my enjoyment of it. This is a book that requires the reader to think. And that, I think, is why I loved it so much."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MULTIPLE HEINLEIN SPOILERSRobert Heinlein was a good friend of AI legend Marvin Minsky (check out his people page! It's interesting!), and I've heard that they often used to chat about AI, science-fiction, and the connections between them.

OK, love the idea of the guy from Mars, who doesn't understand how people work and has to learn the most basic things about emotions, society, etc from first principles. You have some good stuff there. But I think you got a bit distracted with the super-powers and the sex. Sure, put in sex, all for it, but don't get Mike so involved in that part of the book. He should be more abstract I think. And I wasn't so thrilled by the fact that he never actually does anything much with his powers, except for start a minor cult and get martyred. Seems a bit negative. What does his martyrdom achieve, exactly?Wait. I have an idea. Why don't you rewrite it so that he's an artificial intelligence? Really, that makes more sense. He's even more alien than a human raised by Martians. Oh, don't worry about that, I can help you with the technical details. Feel free to drop in at the AI Lab any time, we're all huge fans. People will be delighted. So, yes, as I was saying, he needs to do something. Maybe he's... the central computer in a future Lunar society? And he helps them start a revolution, and break free from Earth's tyranny? Even though what he's really most interested in is understanding how humor works? I don't think you need to change that much else. Call him Mike again by all means, so that people see the link. And you should absolutely martyr him at the end. Only, I think this time you should do it in a subtler and more ambiguous way. But sure, leave the door open about whether he's really dead.\"\"Hey, thanks Marvin! Terrific ideas!

It was, in a word, bad. So I gave up on Heinlein all together, figuring if his most famous and critically acclaimed book was no good, what chance did the others have? This conviction was met with protests from Heinlein fans, saying I need to read some \"good\" Heinlein before making the call. So I did, though it took me an unusually long time to finish. I just couldn't get into it. The characters were two-dimensional and shared too many qualities with those in SiaSL: the brilliant innocent (here, a self-aware computer named Mike), the levelheaded and elderly teacher/father-figure (Prof the anarchist philosopher), and the beautiful, \"smart\" woman whose most highly praised attribute is her ability to keep her mouth shut when the men are talking about important things (Wyoh, a revolutionary with a thing for older men - another SiaSL staple). Another recycled idea (though I don't know which book came first) was the group/line marriages, where the women are said to be in charge but actually spend most of their time at home worrying about their men. These characters weren't that great the first time around; the second time was just tedious.The idea behind the story is fine: the moon is more or less a penal colony under totalitarian rule. With the help of Mike the computer, Mannie (a computer tech who talks - and narrates the story - in an obnoxious dialect that sounds like someone faking a Russian accent very poorly), Prof, and Wyoh engineer a revolution. There is some interesting discussion of political ideals and governmental structure, but without sympathetic characters to bring it to life the story is about as gripping as your average high school civics class. I simply could not bring myself to care one way or the other. Now I wonder, how many more of his books do I need to read before I can officially say I don't like Heinlein?"}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "HAL before HAL.

Oh yeah, and there happens to be an omniscient, all-powerful AI named Mike who helps the Loonies stage their revolution against the oppressive Lunar Authority (can you say DEUS EX MACHINA?). The outcome is never really in doubt, so what we are given instead is a 300-page lecture on what Heinlein\u2019s ideal society would be.Basically Heinlein thinks that most politicians are self-serving and corrupt (tough to argue with that), nothing important can be decided with more than three people, and intellectuals are useless yammerheads that just do a lot of talk-talk. However, for someone who doesn\u2019t like talk-talk, I\u2019d say about 85% of this book was just that, with almost a complete lack of action or tension and rest being an ultra-detailed description of how a revolution could be planned and executed. The critical flaw here is that none of the revolution would work without the comprehensive computer powers of AI Mike. The rest of the revolutionaries are simply depending on him to work his magic. So what does that say about the realizability of a libertarian utopia like the Free Luna State??? Deep down, I don\u2019t think Heinlein really believes that any such society could ever come to fruition, since regular people just aren\u2019t smart enough to pull it off.In the end, it\u2019s pretty clear that Heinlein can only really be satisfied with two types of people in the world: The super-competent blue-collar engineer-type everyman that most of his protagonists are, and the super-intelligent, totally-sexy, and yet thoroughly subservient women that dig guys like that. The only thing better is a polyandry/group marriage society where you can be married to several of these delectable creatures! It\u2019s too bad the story takes such a backseat to the political daydreaming, since Mike the AI is such a likeable super-computer and the Loonie society is carefully constructed.There are many readers who think this is probably Heinlein's last readable and thought-provoking novel before he went off the deep end into his libertarian, female-worship, crotchety old man stage, and I would certainly be in agreement."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811687-sandi", "userReview": "I read Stranger in a Strange Land twice.

There just aren't enough reading hours in a lifetime to spend trying to discover why this author is considered to be a science fiction great.The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress started off promising. A computer repair guy learns that the computer he's working on has become sentient and they become good friends. Computer guy gets involved with revolutionaries and computer becomes a key figure in the revolution. However, the novel quickly digresses into lecturing about politics, gender relations, economics, and a plethora of other topics. It was a primer on revolution. There was a lot of talking, but not much action.

There are many dialogues in there that will make you think. You want to start a revolution? Why, here is a great handbook for you! Seriously thought, this is one of my favourites by Heinlein. It is political SF at its best. Besides being a great handbook on staging a revolution, this novel has others things going for it. Let\u2019s start with the setting.Luna Is A Harsh Mistress is set on Moon. No surprise there! What is somewhat surprising is the incredibly detail with which Heinlein describes this Lunar society. The Moon is a colony of Earth and as such has a very different culture, language and just about everything. The way the writer set the story and the care he gave to developing this setting is bloody brilliant.So, the setting is pretty awesome. Moreover, the story is entertaing and high paced while giving you enough food for the thought. What else? Another great thing about this novel is that it has such as a fantastic cast of characters. There is Mike- and he\u2019s a doll. I don't recall any other A.I or computer character that was so loveable. Yet, Mike is definitely my favourite character, but other (human) characters are not any less fascinating, for example there's Miguel. This slightly cynical loonie ( an ingenious term coined to describe a resident of Moon) is for most part a pretty easy-going guy despite the fact that he had his hand cut off and replaced with a tool in order to make a living. I remember this premise being used in some third rate Hollywood movie and it really annoyed me, how they stole that idea like that. But let's back to the characters: Professor Bernardo de la Paz is there for smart ideas and dialogues. Mimi the matriarch was also a lovely character. I'll stop here, although there are more of them that are worthy of mentioning.There are many aspects of this novel that make it such a great read. It is a very thought provoking novel, though it may not seem that way at first. Sure it is the story about a rebellion against government and there is some action, but another thing you will get is a lot of interesting lessons about human societies wrapped up in nice dialogues. Dialogues, you say? Yes, many of them between an AI and human beings. I did say there is a fantastic cast of characters in this one. Accomplishing a complete racial integrity in a natural way is something that many novels still fail to do, but this novel does it. That\u2019s exceptional considering the time when this novel was published. The concept of line marriages is something that was developed nicely and it fit in with character\u2019s development. Loonies feel very much real both as individuals and members of society. By that I mean they are very convincingly portrayed, not just as individuals but as society as well. Now, some may say that it is kind of convenient for a Moon revolution to have a computer that basically controls every aspect of life on Moon on its side. Well, I can\u2019t deny that but that doesn\u2019t mean that is the only reason why our AI is there. He ( I can\u2019t make myself to call AI it) does help the revolution but his motivation actually makes sense. Heinlein wrote him in a very convincing way, right from his \u2018awakening\u2019, through his character development and finally to him becoming a well-rounded character with unique characteristics and a sense of humour. Sure, in our world today, a SF author wouldn\u2019t need to explain what AI stands for. However, all these descriptions that wouldn\u2019t be needed today don\u2019t really make Mike\u2019s characterization boring. They also don\u2019t make the novel dated. Maybe they just feel a bit out of place, but that's all. Back to my point. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with our AI being conveniently there. Sometimes in life, we do get a little lucky. I didn\u2019t see that as weakness in a plot.Political ideas expressed in this novel are often the kind that make one really think. The idea of writing a constitution in negative was a very refreshing one. There is a lot of interesting quotes to be found in this novel, for example: \"In writing your constitution let me invite attention to the wonderful virtue of the negative! Accentuate the negative! Let your document be studded with things the government is forever forbidden to do. No conscript armies... no interference however slight with freedom of press, or speech, or travel, or assembly, or of religion, or of instruction, or communication, or occupation... no involuntary taxation.\" I think this novel can also be viewed as a warning against government control and colonization. Take this quote for example: \"In past history popularly elected governments have been no better and sometimes far worse than overt tyrannies.\" Well, as depressing as it sounds, that\u2019s actually true. One only needs to remember a few history lessons ( Hitler, Stalin) to realize the horrible truth behind this sentence. Just because a government was elected doesn\u2019t make it a good one. Injustice is often our reality and it is injustice that fuels the rebellion/revolution in this book. Every government is an organism that defends itself, an organism whose sole purpose is to sustain itself\u2026and is it any wonder that it can\u2019t do much good? Is there such a thing as a good government or is it always a choice between lesser evil? This novel does raise some really interesting questions, but in a way that is anything but overbearing. I suppose there is nothing extraordinary in stating that high government control often results in suppressed citizens. What is remarkable is writing a novel that expresses various issues with government control intelligently, using dialogue, while at the same time fluently talking about various other subjects (for example what does it mean to be human?) and having a decent plot and set of characters. What is remarkable is the novel itself. It is interesting to read, the plot develops well and quickly, there are no boring parts and all of the political and philosophical ideas are effortlessly included. What are you waiting for?"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "I\u2019ve read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress twice in twenty years. Two decades between readings and it still holds up surprisingly well. Heinlein\u2019s Lunar Revolution, his benevolent AI, Mycroft (aka Mike), and Professor de la Paz\u2019s ideas for government were all exactly how I remembered them. Yet I found that my favourite part of the rereading experience was the tale it told about me. When I read this book the first time, I was an idealistic youth who believed that change was possible and worth fighting for, maybe even worth dying for. I disdained inequality, injustice, tyranny, blah, blah, blah, and I wanted to do something to fix the problems I saw. I went on to do many things about those problems over the next twenty years. It didn\u2019t do a damn bit of good.So now I am a cynical man who desires change as greatly as I ever did but knows it is impossible, and that the fight is increasingly futile. I still disdain inequality, injustice, tyranny, along with capitalism, consumerism, imperialism, yada, yada yada, and I\u2019ve given up trying to fix the problems. Now I just do the little things for myself and those I love, mostly to make myself feel good, and the rest of the world can be damned. Not doing anything should do as much good as all the things I did for twenty years (I say this, but then our plan is to do aid work somewhere in the next couple years; don't take my cynicism too seriously). The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the same book it was twenty years ago, but back then I saw it as a call to arms. Now I see it as a flight of fancy, a pure act of wishful thinking, a revolution the way I wish it could be but know it never will. Still, there\u2019s nothing wrong with an act of pure imagination now and then, even if the hopefulness is play and only serves to underline my deep hopelessness."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe", "userReview": "The opening chapter of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress presents an intriguing character study; Mike is a computer who wants to grow up. Mike doesn't understand humor or human nature but he wants to learn and he's got a willing teacher in the form of his assigned engineer, the clever but casual Mannie. Sound interesting? Do not get your hopes up (DNGYHU!) Because this novel isn't about Mike's quest to make sense of humanity, it's about a libertarian revolution on the moon! (Liberty! Economic freedom! Extended-family polygamous communes!) And for this revolution to get off the ground it's going to need a supercomputer to lead it. Before you know it, he's organizing a secret phone system and issuing clandestine proclamations to revolutionaries who think he's human. Kids these days grow up so fast! But maybe it's OK that the child-with-the-microprocessor-brain plot-line gets cut short; revolutions can be fun and who doesn't like a little politics with their science-fiction? DNGYHU!Because until final act, this is the least exciting uprising since The Whiskey Rebellion (which featured shockingly few drunk battles.) Mike the supercomputer can control all electronic systems on the moon, generate infinite money and maneuver guidance-outfitted asteroids with the precision of a master pool player. The imperious government forces don't stand a chance and the gritty lunar rebels barely matter. Mike could have won a bloodless revolution on his own; let me reiterate that he's a super-genius who can generate infinite money and control all electronic systems on the moon. The bad guys don't win a single battle and never suspect the identity of the rebel commander.But even if the revolution is a let down, that's not the point right? Surely Heinlein scores some clever political points defending his ideology? DNGYHU! As mentioned earlier, the purported superiority of the Moon's wild-west polygamous society isn't what powers their victory over the government. And when Mannie is quizzed about how Lunar society's mob-rule ethic functions, his reply is basically that it just seems to work.Heinlein isn't even interested in giving the novel's antagonists (corrupt government officials and mealy-mouthed moralizers) much of a literary lashing; they tend to be nameless, faceless, personality-less props. Most of them don't even qualify for straw-man status because they don't receive any dialogue. Near the novel's end, Mannie does have one dick-swinging standoff with a self-important busy-body during a council of revolutionary leaders; it's a clash of wills that injects the story with some much needed drama and is the closest the story comes to passionate politics. Alas, a few paragraphs later, the busy-body is tossed out on his busy-keister never to be seen again. Paradoxically, Heinlein's most adroit political observation regards the greatest weakness of hardcore libertarianism that, much like communism, it is virtually impossible to put into practice. For in the end even the freedom-loving moon-folk bail on the notion 'That government is best which governs least.' This final-page turnabout makes Heinlein's lukewarm support of libertarianism fit better, but makes for boring ideological conflict.This novel is more interested in the technical details. Mike and Mannie spend countless pages detailing an undercover phone-system, picking when and where to bombard the Earth, organizing their underlings and figuring ways to avoid detection. Heinlein was a naval engineer and a radioman, so it's fitting that he writes most comfortably about communications and mechanical systems. And perhaps it's for the best that Heinlein's focus is on the mechanical over the personal as his writing betrays a worldview that is, at turns, psychologically incompetent or odious. A few examples; Mannie's love-interest Wyoh, a purportedly intelligent, practical woman, makes rape jokes around men she barely knows. Africa is described as a place where human life has never been valued. Mannie gets the hots for a preteen girl and employs his family to help him stalk her. A group of lunar citizens pay an exorbitant fee to have an impartial judge rule on a matter that should be obvious. Mannie makes the worst baseball bet of all time.But for all my complaints this review is long for a reason, this is a hugely ambitious work that touches on a multitude of themes, technical ideas and arguments. Trying to encapsulate a majority (gibbous?) of the book's theses has proven one hell of a mental exercise. Heinlein may have aimed for the moon and missed by miles, but at least he enforced one useful acronym.

It then segues into a revolution whereby the Moon, a penal colony used primarily as a farm to grow wheat to feed Earth's beleaguered masses, attempts to become an independent state. The revolution is planned and executed primarily by Mike, essentially an omniscient God, and everything which can go right goes right and everything which might go wrong does not. It seems then that The Moon is, in fact, a rather Lenient Mistress.\u2026and na\u00efve, sexist, and outdated. But let\u2019s start with the first one.New Title: The Moon is a Lenient Mistress. A clothesline with a pair of whitey-tighties has more dramatic tension than this book. Though there is, ostensibly, a macro-conflict in the form of Luna\u2019s revolution, it doesn\u2019t come across as such because everything always works out. Even when the plan appears to stumble, it actually turns out NOPE, it was all part of the plan. Computer Mike has no limitations and knows all. It's no surprise, and no spoiler either, to tell you the revolution succeeds. Manuel is clearly narrating in retrospect, a fact referenced multiple times throughout the book, which is itself largely told in summary, rather than depicted scene-by-scene.What about micro-conflict? Ha! You may not have known this \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t \u2013 but revolutionaries are all extremely polite and well-behaved. The three main characters always agree or, if disagreeing slightly, happily defer to Professor (a blatant analogue of Heinlein himself). Any character who strongly disagrees just sort of vanishes. Any character who isn\u2019t on the good side is portrayed as a bumbling, blithering idiot.Course maybe Heinlein is just that good at mapping out a revolution. Maybe he\u2019s a master of human nature. Maybe, should I ever plan a revolution, perhaps against our future McWalmart Overlords, I should exhume Heinlein\u2019s body and use my necromantic powers to raise him as a zombie adviser. Except...New Title: The Moon is a Na\u00efve Mistress. I\u2019ll get to the dated technology in a moment, which has some excuse, but is there any excuse for an inaccurate depiction of human nature? To some degree, the lack of conflict makes sense because this is Old Sci-fi and in Old Sci-fi, drama and character often play a subordinate role to ideas and science. Much of the joy (and there is some) comes from reading this book as a Revolution For Dummies. But the joy is hampered by this book\u2019s inauthentic depiction of the turbulence of revolution and of humanity and society in general.Case in point: The very premise is absurd. Luna is a penal colony, filled almost exclusively with convicts (in the future, capital punishment is considered \u2018inhumane\u2019). Simultaneously, Loonies (those who live on the moon) are portrayed as being exceptionally polite. Simultaneously, a good HALF of those who arrive on Luna end up dead either through carelessness or murder. Simultaneously, there are no laws. Zero. Simultaneously with all this, Luna is depicted as a stable, healthy semi-utopia. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... (wait for it) ...hhhhhhhhhhhhhh... (wait for it) ...hhhhhh no. Next up, I am a Nigerian prince who has $10,000,000 to give you. I just need your bank account information. We all know that in the absence of societal structure, the strong rule the weak. In fact, we have places without laws in the world, Somalia being one of them. Don\u2019t think anyone would call it utopian.In addition to his wildly na\u00efve depiction of a libertarian society, Heinlein\u2019s grasp of gender dynamics leaves much to be desired. On Luna, the ratio of female to males is wildly skewed, a 1:2 ratio at time of story but even worse in the years before. The result, according to Heinlein, is the empowerment of women. Because that\u2019s definitely what's happening in India. Oh wait. No, the opposite occurred. Duh. Ironically, because Heinlein obviously attempted to do otherwise, the book\u2019s depiction of women is nothing less than creepy thereby granting TITLE NUMBER THREE. Cue drumroll\u2026:New Title: The Moon is a Sexist Mistress. Heinlein\u2019s depiction of women is bad. He tries and if this were kindergarten, that\u2019d earn him some points. But we\u2019re in the big leagues of literature, aren\u2019t we?! So it\u2019s just creepy and sexist:Practically every woman of note mentioned is described as beautiful. No ugly women allowed, apparently. When beautiful woman #1, Wyoming Knott, was introduced, I thought to myself, \u201cOh man. Dollars to donuts, main character sleeps with her.\u201d For a bit, I thought I'd be owing myself some donuts but then in a surprise twist... she gets married into Mannie\u2019s line marriage!You know that rule in theater about how if a gun is mentioned or introduced in act one of a play, it will go off by act three? I propose a similar rule for beautiful women. If a \"beautiful\" woman is mentioned in the beginning of the book then she will be slept with by the end. That or she\u2019ll be an evil murderess. Sorry beautiful women out there. That\u2019s your fate in life, apparently.I mean, despite narrator telling us that Loonie women are empowered and in charge of society, the book consistently depicts them in subordinate or domestic roles. Wyoming Knott is one of three main revolutionaries, right? The book suggests she's essential. Which is because she does\u2026 wait\u2026 what does she do? OH THAT\u2019S RIGHT. NOTHING. She flirts, she spurs the men on. All other women are likewise depicted in this bizarre cheerleading role, or as mothers. Every woman (or girl!) of note eventually gets married, like it's the penultimate fate. Well what can ya say? It's a universal truth, right Jane Austen?This book is super hardcore about placing women on a pedestal. Heinlein, who obviously doesn\u2019t get human nature and even less woman nature, seems to believe that this is a GOOD depiction of women. Like omg they\u2019re so amazing and dynamic and look at this SPUNKY female, free with her kisses and sexuality and can take and dish out insults with the best of em. Please, God of Literature, spare me from such inadvertently Lovecraftian horrors. The spunky female stereotype of an \u201cempowered woman\u201d is so eerie. It\u2019s outdated, at the least, and you know what else is? The technology!New Title: The Moon is an Outdated Mistress. This book is lauded for its supposedly accurate depiction of engineering and technology. Huh? What? You mean, like how one of the main characters uses a phone with like a hundred meter cord in order to talk to the computer? Don\u2019t even give me that context of the past nonsense. We had radios back then. Is it really that hard to extrapolate that we\u2019d have personal radios (i.e. cellphones) in the future? Or how about when the main character uses PUNCHCARDS to program a super computer? Hahahahaha. Or here\u2019s a good one: nuclear-warhead interceptor missiles cost \u201cthousands\u201d of dollars. Do I buy a used car or hydrogen bomb? Choices, choices.That is the very definition of sci-fi failure. It\u2019s a sci-fi writer\u2019s job (particularly one writing in this hard sci-fi mode) to infer future ideologies and technologies. It\u2019d be the equivalent of my writing a story set a hundred years in the future and having people still drive around in cars with internal combustion engines. Barring Mad Max style post-apocalypse, that is NOT going to happen. Or talking about a hamburger costing $5 a century from now. (In fact, for your information, at average rates of inflation, a $5 hamburger will cost $96 in a hundred years. Jeez.)In summary, is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress? Nope. The Moon is a Lenient, Na\u00efve, Sexist, and Outdated Mistress. This book doesn\u2019t grant insight into humanity, it doesn\u2019t depict a realistic future, it doesn\u2019t even entertain. And it's creepy. At any given point while I was reading this, I could have put it down for good and been content. Basically, The Moon is a Boring Mistress. No one wants a boring mistress \u2013 and that\u2019s the truth."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/192006-dan", "userReview": "My favorite Heinlein novel - a great revolution story, a great AI story, and a great Hard Sci-Fi, if the science in question is political.

Heinlein has a political conversation with himself here, definitely coming down on the side of Libertarianism, but also acknowledges & points out the holes in his arguments himself. I've read some rants about Heinlein pushing his politics & I disagree with them. I think he's doing more questioning than pushing & that leads to some fun with the characters, especially Prof.Prof is the Heinlein wise elder character while Manny is the middle aged incarnation. Hazel (who shows up as the grandmother in The Rolling Stones) is the youthful, female version. Yes, Heinlein only has 1 main character, he just changes age & sex to suit the situation. I don't consider this a horrible flaw in his books, though. They're more situational, so a steady character actually helps them out.Prof has a wonderful political philosophy. He's a Rational Anarchist. Actually, that seems to pretty much be his take on life & I dare say it's more honest than most. He'll accept any laws you think you need & obey those he can, when he can, otherwise ignore them, but will pay up if caught. (Come to think of it, that's pretty much how I go through life.) His remarks to the new Lunar Congress on how to pay for government & what laws to make are well worth thinking about & certainly does point out the perennial problem they all have. One suggestion was they start by making laws of what the government could never do. Another was a house devoted to repealing poor laws.Stu's observations on governing were more amusing. He wants to name Prof king because that would protect people from their biggest enemy, themselves. How true! The woman with the list of proscribed items in the early Congress is a perfect example. Anyone with half a brain can't help but make the comparisons to our own society & the creeping repressiveness as we democratically vote away our rights.Heinlein points out another fallacy in government, one that he never explicitly states: What works for a small group often won't for a large one & that needs change over time. He makes this argument as a thread throughout the book: Manny's reflections from the future when Luna is much more populated & his other comments on its early days. The justice system of Terra versus that of Luna of Manny's time. It's important to note that Heinlein offers up no concrete answers, just a lot of questions, & he is pointing them out through a first person narrator. Manny is fairly reliable, but he's human & thus comfortable in the society he knows. There are multiple examples of how poorly this fits others - many of whom wind up paying the ultimate penalty.The language of the book is notable. Sentences are clipped with a lot of polyglot slang & - possibly most important - he popularized the word \ntanstaafl\n: \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\". The link is to the Wikipedia article on it. I wish people would use & think of it more. Racial, religious, & national slang names are commonly used & are now considered politically incorrect, but they are used in such a way that no prejudice can possibly be attached. The moon is such a mix that such designations are merely descriptive. Marriage is another institution that receives a thorough cleansing of preconceptions & homosexuality is also briefly addressed. IOW, Heinlein has a lot of fun with Civil Rights. Since this book was originally published in 1966, that's not surprising, especially given his views on the matter, but this book was well before he almost died & he hasn't gone overboard yet.The DownsideHeinlein attempted to give women a bigger role, but they were just homemakers in too many ways. Still, he deserves a nod for trying pretty hard. The story is quite dated as far as technology goes, but that didn't hurt it much. There are tape recorders, wall phones, & computer punch cards, but the overall experience of the moon is well done. Mike, the self-aware computer is fun, too. Not particularly realistic, but enjoyable & played his part well.Read by Lloyd James, downloaded from my public library. James does Manny with a horrible accent, but I lived with it, although the teary Manny voice is even worse. I liked Mike's & the rest are pretty good except Stu. He had such a thick French accent that I couldn't understand him sometimes, especially when he's pronouncing Russian or other languages. This is definitely a case of the reader acting too much. Worse, he pronounces some words & names in ways I wouldn't. He pronounces 'Prof' as 'Proof'. Yuck.All in all, it's a must-read for anyone exploring SF. It is a classic & is a hell of a lot of fun, but gives plenty of food for thought, too. Just what an SF classic is supposed to do.Wikipedia has a so-so write up on it here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon...This gets 4 stars only because of the reader. Otherwise, as I point out in my review of the paperback, it's a 5 star read."}, {"userName": "Mr. Matt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15984059-mr-matt", "userReview": "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is like a comfortable old shoe. I've read the thing multiple times - the first when I was maybe twelve or thirteen. I know every nook and cranny of the book; however, like an old shoe, it's no longer shiny and new - it even stinks a little bit. Fortunately, like an old shoe, it feels good reading it and that is enough.The story is about a handful of souls, well, really two - Manuel (a.k.a., Man) and Mike (a.k.a., Mycroft Holmes) - who are drawn into a rebellion against Earth. What's neat about the whole thing is that Mike is, in fact, not a person at all. He is a H.O.L.M.E.S. (\"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor\") Mark 4, a super computer that has unexpectedly become conscious and self-aware. The relationship between Mike and Man is well worth the price of admission. And as far as characters go, the real star of the show. He moves from playful, almost childlike to a mature well-adjusted adult in just a few hundred pages.Where the story suffers, I think, is in the fairly linear plot. There are no questions where things are headed from almost the get-go. Moreover, the book shamelessly co-opts from the American Revolution - even going so far as to steal from the Declaration of Independence. (Even the dates line up against 1776.) The book is, at its heart, a light-hearted romp but that's OK. Sometimes you want to slip on that old shoe.Three and a half stars rounded down to three. Even the big nostalgia boost couldn't get me to bump it up higher."}, {"userName": "Ben Babcock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-ben-babcock", "userReview": "It didn\u2019t take me long to understand why this book received such acclaim and is still regarded as a classic. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is an emblem of political science fiction. Robert Heinlein manages to take the idea of a penal colony on the moon and turn it into a romantic story of political revolution. This is an idea that has been explored repeatedly since this novel was published, but those stories almost all owe a debt to this one.Manuel/Manny/Man O\u2019Kelly-Davis is a computer repair technician. He was born on Luna to transported parents. He\u2019s also the only person, Loonie or Terran, who knows that the central lunar computer is sentient. He calls it Mike. And along with an old exiled professor and a political firebrand from Hong Kong Luna called Wyoming, Mike and Manuel plan and launch a revolution against the Terran-controlled Lunar Authority that runs their lives.Manuel isn\u2019t actually all that interested in revolting, at least not at first. (Truthfully he probably gets into it because he wants to \u201cbundle\u201d with Wyoming, and he knows the Prof.) He is a self-described apolitical, like, he tells us, most Loonies. (We could have a conversation about unreliable narrators and whether Manuel tells us the truth. Frankly, though, I don\u2019t think Heinlein was interested in that level of deconstructionism. It would have gotten in the way of his fantasy.) Initially, Manuel is happy enough with the status quo: when Mike breaks, or just tries something it thinks is a joke, Manuel gets called in to fix it, and gets paid to do so. Life is actually pretty good.But it\u2019s all an illusion, because everyone is going to starve and die in seven years unless they take over the joint! Or at least, that\u2019s what Mike tells them. And Mike wouldn\u2019t lie to them just because he thinks it\u2019s funny, would he? Mike totally isn\u2019t into pull practical jokes \u2026 oh, shit.The \u201ccharacter\u201d of Mike is my favourite thing about The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Heinlein has written here one of the earliest representations of classical strong AI (this predates HAL 9000 by a couple of years). Yet this book is decidedly not about AI in the sense that cyberpunk and Singularity fiction focuses on AI. Mike is merely a plot device, as well as part of Heinlein\u2019s extended political metaphor. However, the fact that Heinlein relies on the abilities of a networked central computer to make the lunar revolution successful probably says a lot about the extent to which he viewed such a revolution as possible in contemporary terms. As Manuel reflects at one point, Mike is their ace in the hole: a shadowy, unseen figure whose presence is nevertheless always felt. Without Mike, everyone would be out of luck.Mike evolves throughout the story too, as portrayed through its increasingly adept grasp of language, tone, and voice. Some of this evolution is directed by Manuel, but much of it is an organic consequence of Mike\u2019s role in the revolution and its portrayal of \u201cAdam Selene.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s my background with Singularity fiction, but I kept waiting for Mike to turn on our poor revolutionaries.It\u2019s important to remember, too, that this book was written before we ever visited the Moon. We had some grainy pictures, and we had managed a couple of low-Earth orbits and a spacewalk\u2014and most of that was courtesy the Soviets. (Although the Soviet-inspired dialect that the Loonies use and other Soviet influences on the setting provide a convenient way to allude to revolutionary Russia, I can\u2019t help but feel like Heinlein is also reflecting the zeitgeist. Up until the end of the 1960s, it must have felt like the Russians were dominating the Space Race, and Heinlein\u2019s future reflects that.) But we didn\u2019t really know what it was like to travel through space, much less live in it.Heinlein makes much of the idea that the 1/6th-g gravity of the moon means we couldn\u2019t live there long before permanently adapting to it, preventing us from returning to Earth. Turns out we can live in microgravity for at least a year without permanent ill effects (though one must convalesce and rebuild muscle after coming back). But Heinlein didn\u2019t know that. Interestingly, a great deal of Luna\u2019s economy revolves around the harvesting of ice, and in that respect Heinlein was a little prescient: the presence of ice, while proposed and perhaps suspected in his time, has only been confirmed much more recently.So working within the bounds of what he knew at the time, and some speculation, Heinlein creates a fascinating vision for what a lunar colony might be like. Although he employs technology like laser guns, he also invokes more realistic\u2014and, in my opinion, more frightening\u2014weapons, such as using rocks accelerated down Earth\u2019s gravity well as ballistic missiles. Heinlein shows that science is often cooler than science fiction.Are there uncomfortable libertarian politics that threaten to overwhelm the story? Yes. It took me most of a week to read this book, despite it not being very long, because it is on the dry side. Between Manuel, the Prof, and Wyoming, we get enough political theory sandwiched between the action to fill a slim textbook. Regardless, I soldiered on, because I wanted to know where we ended up. After the revolution succeeded, would heads roll?Similar to his politics, Heinlein\u2019s portrayal of gender roles is dubious at best. Though women like Wyoming, or Manuel\u2019s senior wife, Mimi, are presented as capable and having agency, they are nevertheless always subject to the male gaze. Heinlein explores alternatives to conventional marriage\u2014namely, polyandrous arrangements like the idea of the line marriage Manuel is involved in\u2014and depicts slightly different sexual mores. Yet any credit he might deserve for such things is diminished by the fact that his particular brand of 1960s sexual liberation is little more than a smokescreen for male fantasies of women as sexual objects. Heinlein tries to explain that the imbalance of genders in lunar society means women have the \u201cpower\u201d to choose men. In actuality, this means women are always presented in the novel as objects of sexual desire who frustrate or reward men capriciously. I\u2019m trying and failing to come up with a woman character who isn\u2019t defined somehow by a relationship to a man\u2014Hazel comes close, but ultimately gets pigeonholed into being a sexual object for Slim as well as the \u201cmother\u201d figure to the Baker Street Irregulars. But no, there are no women judges, no women politicians, nothing like that.So, ultimately, Heinlein\u2019s diverting sexual politics here just go to show that, when you get right down to it, you can have all the weird gender stuff you want, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you forget that women are people too. The default in this book is still very much \u201cheterosexual male,\u201d and that\u2019s what makes it problematic.With these two things in mind, I can see why some don\u2019t enjoy The Moon is a Harsh Mistress at all, and I didn\u2019t enjoy it unreservedly. Rather, I appreciate Heinlein\u2019s artistry and skill at science fiction as a setting and as a vehicle for political storytelling (even if I find the actual politics somewhat strange). There\u2019s a curious mixture of intelligence and romance here, so it\u2019s capable of grabbing at both head and heart. The tension between these two modes, however, results in a story that vacillates most disharmoniously even as it impresses with the scope of its ambition."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "This is a classic SF story of the moon fighting for its independence from Earth, with a lot of parallels to the American Revolution. Heinlein has a political conversation with himself here, definitely coming down on the side of Libertarianism, but also acknowledges & points out the holes in his arguments himself. I've read some rants about Heinlein pushing his politics & I disagree with them. I think he's doing more questioning than pushing & that leads to some fun with the characters, especially Prof.Prof is the Heinlein wise elder character while Manny is the middle aged incarnation. Hazel (who shows up as the grandmother in The Rolling Stones) is the youthful, female version. Yes, Heinlein only has 1 main character, he just changes age & sex to suit the situation. I don't consider this a horrible flaw in his books, though. They're more situational, so a steady character actually helps them out.Prof has a wonderful political philosophy. He's a Rational Anarchist. Actually, that seems to pretty much be his take on life & I dare say it's more honest than most. He'll accept any laws you think you need & obey those he can, when he can, otherwise ignore them, but will pay up if caught. (Come to think of it, that's pretty much how I go through life.) His remarks to the new Lunar Congress on how to pay for government & what laws to make are well worth thinking about & certainly does point out the perennial problem they all have. One suggestion was they start by making laws of what the government could never do. Another was a house devoted to repealing poor laws.Stu's observations on governing were more amusing. He wants to name Prof king because that would protect people from their biggest enemy, themselves. How true! The woman with the list of proscribed items in the early Congress is a perfect example. Anyone with half a brain can't help but make the comparisons to our own society & the creeping repressiveness as we democratically vote away our rights.Heinlein points out another fallacy in government, one that he never explicitly states: What works for a small group often won't for a large one & that needs change over time. He makes this argument as a thread throughout the book: Manny's reflections from the future when Luna is much more populated & his other comments on its early days. The justice system of Terra versus that of Luna of Manny's time. It's important to note that Heinlein offers up no concrete answers, just a lot of questions, & he is pointing them out through a first person narrator. Manny is fairly reliable, but he's human & thus comfortable in the society he knows. There are multiple examples of how poorly this fits others - many of whom wind up paying the ultimate penalty.The language of the book is notable. Sentences are clipped with a lot of polyglot slang & - possibly most important - he popularized the word \ntanstaafl\n: \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\". The link is to the Wikipedia article on it. I wish people would use & think of it more. Racial, religious, & national slang names are commonly used & are now considered politically incorrect, but they are used in such a way that no prejudice can possibly be attached. The moon is such a mix that such designations are merely descriptive. Marriage is another institution that receives a thorough cleansing of preconceptions & homosexuality is also briefly addressed. IOW, Heinlein has a lot of fun with Civil Rights. Since this book was originally published in 1966, that's not surprising, especially given his views on the matter, but this book was well before he almost died & he hasn't gone overboard yet.The story is quite dated as far as technology goes, but that didn't hurt it much. There are tape recorders, wall phones, & computer punch cards, but the overall experience of the moon is well done. Mike, the self-aware computer is fun, too. Not particularly realistic, but enjoyable & played his part well.All in all, it's a must-read for anyone exploring SF. It is a classic & is a hell of a lot of fun, but gives plenty of food for thought, too.Wikipedia has a so-so write up on it here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon..."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana", "userReview": "My favorite book by Robert Heinlein, and he wrote some good ones.

As if civilizations need to curb fossil fuel use (or other rare resources) early enough to turn them towards space travel, instead of one use coffee cups. I boiled that down to: humans will become conscious or die. I reduced that to, humans probably go extinct, with a nod to George Carlin.This book is slightly more interesting than watching smart people chat philosophy on the internet, but only because it's more organized. Where's the sense of urgency?\u00a0I think of this as a clean space novel versus, \"Alien,\" a dirty space novel. That's no commentary on sexiness, its the invisible demarcation that exists in Science Fiction. Sometime in the late seventies SF lost the (inertia) notion that a spacefaring people will be more orderly and rational. Instead humans remained fallible, but somehow managed to travel into space. I'd call this Pigs in Space, but not everyone likes Muppet jokes.\u00a0These lines aren't easy to define because you have Asimov and PKD on the android train--while still in the clean space era, but they can be observed as trends on a long enough timeline.If current trends prevail, SF has crossed yet another line due to trans-humanism. It looks like consciousness might be transferable to robots who\u00a0go into space without the tedious meat-suit. This disables my opening concern\u00a0since man achieves no real enlightenment (as a group) before it gains the ability to travel the stars. After all, a conscious person would have no need to live forever (the egoic delusion) because it wouldn't define itself as being separate from the cosmos. \u00a0This book is about miners and hard scrabble farmers, yet the dirtiest thing in this PRISON, was an illegal assembly. Books need to do more than serve as a backdrop for neat ideas. They need to be emotional. This is too antiseptic to accept\u00a0that a revolution would happen or even matter.If I stick this out, it won't earn more than two stars, so I'm abandoning it. I could be reading someone like Huxley, who had a much deeper understanding of the nature of people and the universe."}, {"userName": "David Sarkies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies", "userReview": "An anatomy of a revolution19 November 2012\tSome have suggested that this is one of Heinlein's most political books, and while it this is only the forth that I have read so far, I am probably not that inclined to agree. While it was much better than Podkayne of Mars, it was pretty much on par with Stranger in a Strange Land (the other one I read was Starship Troopers). In a way, one could say that this novel is an anatomy of a revolution, in the same what that Stranger in a Strange Land is an anatomy of a religious cult (and while I could say that Starship Troopers is an anatomy of an army, the army in that book seems to be of a different sort than what we know of armies today).\tThe book is set about 100 years in the future at the time of writing, which at the time was in the middle of the space race. Basically the novel appeared almost half way between Kennedy proclaiming that by the end of the decade they would have put a man on the moon, and Nixon actually doing it, and this was played out in the background of Russia attempting to do the same thing. However, despite a number of voyages during the 70s, all of the sudden the idea of visiting the moon suddenly dropped off, and nobody has been back since.\tAnyway, at the time of writing, people were still looking forward to the possibilities of what might come of the space race, and one of them was a full fledged colony on the moon. However, it appears that in Heinlein's future, the colonisation of space had ended with the moon. Luna has become a penal colony, and it was sustained by the enormous amounts of ice found there (which solves the water problem) and has been turned into a farming community that exports grain to Earth (which to an extent solves the oxygen problem as well). It is also suggested that much of the food is grown hydroponically.\tHowever, life on the moon is not pleasant. In a way it reflects the world of the late 18th and early 19th century, where the Great Powers of Europe would establish penal colonies in far away locations (such as Australia and Siberia) and if one was sent there there generally was no hope of ever returning. This is the case with Luna, because it is too expensive to send people there and back, and while there is some two-way traffic, it is not common, and in fact the colony is run from Earth by an organisation known as the Lunar Authority, though there is a Warden who lives on the moon.\tSome have said that this is a handbook on revolution, but I do not think that that is the case. Rather Heinlein is telling a sort of future history. The story is written as a memoir of by one of the leaders of the revolution, though it is interesting to note that everything is meticulously planned, and the person writing the memoir, a techie named Manuel, is little more than a puppet. It is also interesting that the head of the revolution is a computer named Mike who is convinced to participate because he is interested in learning about humour, but also because the only person that he considers a friend is Manuel. While Mike was built by the authority, it is his programmer than he comes to trust, which makes us wonder whether it is the owner, or the maintainer, that truly controls a computer system.\tHeinlein says a lot of really interesting things in this book. Sort of short one liners that make you think quite deeply about what is going on. At the beginning of the book he talks about Mike's processor speed, and in fact this is raised a number of times during the story. Remember, this was written in 1965 when computers still pretty much filled a room (and were much less powerful that the computer currently sitting on my lap on which I am writing this). What caught me though, and it is something that I have read elsewhere, is that the faster the computer processes information, the slower time appears to the computer. It made me think that if I could actually speed up my brain's processing ability, I could actually slow time down, at least to my perception. Obviously, the problem with that is that if my brain was operating a four times the speed that it currently is, that means that I would simply not be able to communicate with anybody around me (because I would be talking at four times the speed that I am currently speaking). However, it would mean that my train trips into the city, and my plane flights would be four times as long, which means I would be able to get through much more reading than I currently do. However, watching movies would be an absolute pain, unless I could effectively speed them up as well, but unfortunately it generally does not work that way.\tAnother thing that I found intriguing was when the professor (the real brains behind the whole revolution) outlined how a constitution should be drafted, and that is that it should be full of things that a government cannot do. Many constitutions are like that, though others simply outline how the government bodies are constituted and how laws are passed and interpreted. It is interesting that when Napoleon went storming across Europe, he would set up constitutions in countries that he conquered modelled on the new French Constitution, though I suspect that the states that the Americans are 'helping' to establish, are begin directed through their own imperialist agenda. The Australian constitution is set up to give the government restrictive powers, in that there are a set of powers that it has and can use, and only use. I guess that reflect's John Locke's idea that nothing is beyond the power of a parliament. I suspect that Heinlein was thinking of that idea when he wrote the passage about filling a constitution up with restrictions on what a government can do.\tAnyway, all of this is idealistic, and Heinlein knows this as well, because despite the revolution that runs perfectly (but he does give good reasons behind that as well), human nature is human nature, and he knows that. We see this when the Earth is being bombarded from orbit. Despite warnings that the people of Earth should stay away from certain places, and despite the attempts to hit places that people would not be, people instead flock to those locations, believing that the Loonies (inhabitants of Luna) are bluffing. Mind you, in the end, the whole idea of the revolution is based entirely on bluff and counterbluff, and who is willing to call which bluff. The problem with calling a bluff though, is that you can never know if your opponent is bluffing until you call their bluff, and by then it is too late.\tOne final thing, I really did like how Heinlein structured the language of the Loonies. It seems a bit odd at first, but you soon get used to it. Basically it is full of redundancies, namely anything that is not needed is tossed out. He also indicates that it has borrowed from other languages, sort of a result of the mixtures of cultures that have appeared on the moon, though he restricts this to da (yes in Russian) and Nyat (no in Russian), and a small smattering of German sounding words that Google Translate doesn't seem to recognise. I guess he was very restricted in that way since he was writing to an English audience, and too many borrowings from too many languages would have made the book unreadable."}, {"userName": "Jeraviz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12429299-jeraviz", "userReview": "Se\u00f1or/a Anarquista del Futuro:Cuando vaya usted a rebelarse contra la tiran\u00eda de la Tierra para liberar la Luna acu\u00e9rdese de este libro, que le dar\u00e1 todas las claves necesarias para montar una Revoluci\u00f3n como Dios (o Lenin) manda.Eso s\u00ed, esp\u00e9rense a tener un ordenador superinteligente con conciencia de s\u00ed mismo para poder tener \u00e9xito.Heinlein cuenta aqu\u00ed una historia universal: la rebeli\u00f3n del pueblo contra la tiran\u00eda, la lucha para conseguir esa utop\u00eda y los problemas para mantenerla una vez que lo consigues.
