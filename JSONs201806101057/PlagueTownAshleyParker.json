I would like to be clear that the author is descriptive and has no trouble putting sentences together. It was only my opinion of the the plot content that I had trouble with as outlined below, and as stated, each person should make their own decision.~~Original Review - I hate giving bad reviews but it happens. My tolerance levels are pretty high for trash fiction. When I begin reading a book, I work hard to ensure instances when I am unable to finish it are as rare as possible. I reserve the right to stop and remove myself from a bad novel, but keep this right minimally acted upon.This novel is part of the fairly exclusive club called \u201cBooks I couldn\u2019t reasonably spend more time on\u201d also referred to as \u201cI can never get those minutes of my life back\u201d.. I made it eighty-three pages and just had to stop. It could get better later but I will never know.Dana Fredsti\u2019s novel Plague Town is just another book in the over-saturated Z market. It\u2019s a shame, I had high hopes based on the author\u2019s background in cinema and other genre. The fact that this made it to print through an actual publishing house blows me away.Annoyances experienced in a quarter of the book:--- A strain of influenza is taking down old and young, healthy and sickly. It is called \u2018Walkers\u2019 after the last name of the first person who contracted it. Gimme an effin break. I cant be the only person rolling my eyes because of this.--- The female lead intended to be strong and independent, a woman who can handle anything. Turns out she is more joke than hero. She is a pre-cougar who\u2019s primary defense is knee jerk sarcasm. I found myself rooting for her demise. I wanted her to be MORE, but ended up with MEH.--- Apparently we have been fighting zombies for thousands of years. More eye rolling ensues:Pompeii was infested and either luck kicked in and Vesuvius blew, or someone magically caused it to occur\u2026 Suspension of disbelief, it gets a pass. Apparently Atlantis was also destroyed to keep zombies at bay.. *sigh.. Okay, it gets a pass as well, but very grudgingly. The Black Plague was a mixture of Bubonic and zombie infestations? Ok so why even read this book if peasants with pitchforks and torches in the 1300s can stop the apocalypse\u2026 It should be slam dunk for modern characters if even a quarter of a percent of the 75 Million Black Plague deaths could be attributed to Zombies were rekilled by pitchfork and sword\u2026 My wife helped me with the math cause I are stupid, but a quarter of a percent would be 187,500 zombies).--- A key character advises the main character that she is part of the point zero zero one percent who can be bitten by a zombie and not become infected. Also advises that she will gain greater speed agility reaction times healing abilities\u2026. So she is Wolverine or Blade.. Either way she\u2019s passe.-It is just too much. I cant get behind this novel. I had high expectation and wish luck to others picking this novel up. I hope you have a better experience.As Levar Burton says on Reading Rainbow \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it\u201d. Could be that you might like this book were you to read it..Chances are that you would be the point zero zero one percent immune to it\u2019s badness and it will make you faster and more agile. Could be that i will wait in stand by mode with a ready made \u201cI told you so\u201d and destroy you like Pompeii.--xpost https://toastx2.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Kristin  (MyBookishWays Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3491365-kristin-mybookishways-reviews", "userReview": "You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2012/03/...Ashley Parker is attending college in the small town of Redwood Grove and dating a pleasant enough guy. Life isn\u2019t too bad, so when she and her boyfriend are attacked by shambling, rotting corpses one night while on a date, and said boyfriend runs away and leaves her for dead, things suddenly take a turn for the worse. That\u2019s an understatement. Ashley is bitten, but instead of turning into one of the zombie horde, she fights off the virus, and comes out of it stronger, faster, and\u2026immune. After being nursed back to health by a super-secret military organization, they ask her to join an elite group of fighters called the Wild Cards, which are made up of civilians that are immune to the virus, just like Ashley. She knows something has to be done to save as many survivors as necessary, so agrees to join the group. Little does she know how terrifying things are about to become\u2026Author Dana Fredsti has a background that folks like me will totally geek out about. We\u2019re talking stuff like sword-fighting on the set of Army of Darkness, guys, and it shows in Plague Town. The lady knows her weapons (especially those of the bladed variety), and isn\u2019t afraid to take Ashley to new heights of ass-kicking. Plus, she gave her heroine a name that can be shortened to Ash\u2026yeah, you know you like it. Ashley Parker is a pretty normal chick with a smart mouth that just won\u2019t quit. She\u2019s a lot smarter than your average girl, though, and the pop culture references come hard and fast. More geeking out, of the awesome kind. The author does a wonderful job of balancing the serious, the funny, and the downright grotesque, creating a zom novel that will please fans of Jonathan Maberry\u2019s Dead of Night, etc.Ashley takes on her new role with chutzpah and more than an ounce of bravery and her attraction to her handsome and enigmatic instructor Gabriel isn\u2019t without drama, and adds a nice little dash of romance to the story. Ms. Fredsti also manages to throw in some interesting twists to the zombie virus that will have those little hairs on the back of your neck standing on end. I chuckled, I cringed, and I cheered (quietly, so as not to disturb the rest of the house), as Ashley and her rather ragtag (and somewhat charming) band of zombie warriors fight the hordes and rescued survivors. If you love zombies, strong, sarcastic heroines with heart, and fight scenes that will knock your socks off, you\u2019ll devour Plague Town!"}, {"userName": "Loren", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286958-loren", "userReview": "I don\u2019t especially like zombies. I\u2019ve seen a couple of zombie movies, the big ones that everyone\u2019s seen. I\u2019ve read a couple of zombie books. Some of them have even been good. I watched the first season of the zombie series that\u2019s on TV, but I didn't go back for season two. Overall, though, I can take or leave zombies, since the slavering hungry masses often seem an excuse for authors (usually male) or filmmakers (always male) to objectify women in the most graphic way possible and prove just how much we need a big strong man to take care of us.And then I read Dana Fredsti\u2019s Plague Town.Dana\u2019s heroine Ashley doesn\u2019t need taking care of. She nurses herself through a hardcore flu epidemic, then fends off the first zombie that attacks her in a hilarious scene that turns all those \u201ccoeds who have sex have to die\u201d tropes on their heads and paddles their behinds. Ashley has seen a lot of zombie movies, so while she\u2019s freaked out by what\u2019s going on around her, she also knows what needs to be done. She\u2019s not afraid to step up and get her hands dirty. She never frets about breaking a nail or losing a heel. She\u2019s not butch, but she is tough. She speaks her mind. She cares about people. She\u2019s the most realistic, rounded character I\u2019ve read in a zombie novel yet.I can\u2019t call myself a zombie fan. But when I finished Plague Town, I groaned, knowing that Dana is still hard at work on the sequel. It\u2019s gonna be hard for me to wait to see what Ashley will get herself into \u2013 and out of \u2013 next.And what\u2019s up with the hunky paramilitary former vegan who\u2019s now subsisting on raw steaks? Love \u2013 or sexual attraction \u2013 can overlook a lot of flaws, but inquiring minds are dying to know"}, {"userName": "Cat Russell  (Addicted2Heroines)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250664-cat-russell-addicted2heroines", "userReview": "A new must-read series for fans of intense, gory, action-packed novels.Fredsti has a real talent for creating zombie fiction. The carnage and details of the zombie infestation were spot on and I looked forward to every moment that would bring Ashley back into contact with one of the infected. The zombies are very descriptive, which I loved. Young female zombies in Juicy velour and bear-sized flannel shirt wearing zombies are detailed individually and not just collectively as a horde. It created action scenes that were more vivid and entertaining. The original cause of infection remains a mystery to the characters, but not the reader. I enjoyed the anticipation of wondering how and when they would discover the cause. There are also rare individuals, like Ashley, who are immune to the infection along with one other twist that involved a scene that had my jaw dropping in surprise. It was so disturbing and vomit-inducing...and I mean that in an entirely complimentary way. While the story is told from Ashely's point of view, we are occasionally given glimpses into situations minutes before people become infected and some scenes from the zombie's point of view. These brief glimpses tie back into situations that correspond to Ashley, her team members, and the spread of the infection. I was a little disappointed when these scenes became scarce after passing the halfway point in the story, simply because I wanted more. Why, might you ask, am I giving this story a four star rating as opposed to a five when I've done nothing but sing its praises? Well, Ashley's character was a little difficult for me to warm up to in the beginning. She's a 29 year-old college student, but her dialogue and behavior came off as a little immature. Fortunately, she became more likable and this became less of an issue as the story progressed. Also, there were some social interactions between characters that didn't feel believable and occasionally had me scratching my head. But these were minor issues and weren't enough to take away from my enjoyment of this story.Overall, I highly recommend this to any of my fellow addicts who enjoy a good zombie novel. And as I'm sure you've gathered from the synopsis, this is ideal for those of you who enjoy The Walking Dead.

Perfect addition to my zombie shelf!What I Loved: The thing I loved most about Plague Town: the banter. I was pretty much living for the moments of dialogue between the characters. There were some pretty witty, fast-paced barbs traded and I loved each and every one! Ash was a great leading lady! She manages to get in and out of so many troubling spots that you can't help but root for her. Plus, you have to love her little screw you's to the system. Nathan was my favorite male character! Once he got in the mix the fun level just sky rocketed!What I Liked: Pretty much the rest of the characters in the book were dead-on perfect for the story. Each brought something to the table and had moments to shine. I really liked all the action too. Plague Town had a great combo of action/story.Final Thought: I will be counting down to book 2! It needs to be here already :)Some great lines: \"At least part of me sparkled. Although not in a Twilight kind of way\"\"Yeah.

I devoured this book, and that's no pun. Some people say zombie stories are a dime a dozen these days, and maybe they are right.

If you like stories of the undead, then this is a must read. If you don't like zombies, it's a should read, cause you might just find yourself changing your mind. Now I must leave you.

Unfortunately, after 350 pages, I didn\u2019t find anything original in the book.The prologue had me hooked! I loved seeing the zombie virus starting at such a small, intimate point. Something about that opening was extremely powerful and gripping. However, even with that amazing start, the book went downhill in a hurry. Looking back at it, the quote at the onset should have been a big clue into the rest of the book: \u201c\u2019That\u2019s how it always beings. Very small.\u2019\u201dOne of the things that will really set me off with any novel is a whiny, sanctimonious, arrogant, and cocky heroine. Add to that heroine the fact that she has an entitled attitude and cannot understand why people don\u2019t kowtow to her. For me, that is the perfect description of Ashley Parker. She is an extremely one dimensional character, lacks the maturity of a twenty-nine-year-old, and is downright annoying. I found myself getting excited when she was first bitten by zombies. I was completely baffled as to why a twenty-nine-year-old divorcee would act just like a fresh faced, eighteen-year-old freshman who expects the world to bow to them. After being married to a professor, I would have thought she might be a little more respectful. I guess I was wrong. Honestly, I could understand why her husband went after an eighteen-year-old coed. The incident with her TA, Gabriel, almost caused me to choke on my water. I couldn\u2019t believe that a TA would behave that way! Granted, he had every right to be pissed that she walked in late. He was also well within his rights to throw her out of the classroom. However, that being said, he was belligerent in his treatment of her diet in the classroom. Add to that, he was way out of line in the student union. There is no way in hell that he would have gotten away with that type of behavior! I also couldn\u2019t understand why no one called the campus police when he assaulted Matt. To say I was appalled at the author\u2019s treatment of this is an extreme understatement! When I read the incidents to my father, a professor, he was equally disgusted. Further, if Professor Fraser excused Ashley\u2019s absence, her TAs would have been made aware of that. That being said, what is Ashley doing walking into class late? If she was too sick to make it class on time, stay home! In addition, if you\u2019re late, don\u2019t make lame excuses for your absence while holding a cappuccino and a muffin. It shows a deep lack of respect. The whole conspiracy theory behind Pompeii and Atlantis is too farfetched; it made me suspend my disbelief too much. If the author had said that drawings and early writings led them to believe that Pompeii was overrun by zombies, they had reason to believe that this virus was traveling alongside the Bubonic Plague (maybe gaining a foothold due to decreased immune systems), etc., I could have handled that. As it is, I found myself thinking the author should have used Dan Brown as a consultant.Aside from a terrible heroine and the ludicrous incidents with her TA, the pop culture movie references were way too much. Honestly, as a reader, I felt as though the author was beating me about the head and shoulders with them. It felt as though the author was trying to show off her movie prowess, and the fact that she was in one. Using actors to describe people is also a cheap way of not doing the work (14). As a reader, I felt kind of cheated. Further, for a book to last, it has to stand the test of time. Ten years from now, people will not understand over half of the references the author dishes out. It won't be culturally relevant. \u201c\u2019It\u2019s okay, Rico . . . cough cough,\u2019 Tony grinned at us. \u2018I don\u2019t mind dying, because I got to have you.\u2019 Another dramatic cough.\u201d (315) If I hadn\u2019t seen Starship Troopers a few years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have caught this reference. Before that, the last time I saw the movie is when it came out in 1997. To me, the quote only made sense in context of the movie, and, even with that, it was completely out of place. This is a prime example of the movie allusions throughout the book. They only make sense if you\u2019ve seen the movie and sometimes that is a stretch. In addition, it was not lost on me that\u2014after name dropping Evil Dead and the author\u2019s role in the movie\u2014the main character in a zombie book is named Ashley and called Ash. Obvious? Oh, wait, they decided to give her a codename of Ash because of Evil Dead >.< It was as though the author was saying, \u201cLook, here are my credentials! I was in Evil Dead; therefore, I am an authority on zombies!\u201d On top of that, when Tony wanted to listen to the score from Army of Darkness, I almost beat my head on the coffee table. If I thought it couldn\u2019t have gotten any worse, it did . . .And, just as an aside, the publisher needs to invest in a good editor. Wow, the inconsistencies between sentences in the same paragraph, pages, etc., were just priceless. On all fronts, this book was a total bust. It was not an enjoyable read, the characters were one dimensional at best, the clich\u00e9s were over the top, and the movie quotes/references were enough to kill anyone. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but it felt as though the author was trying to cash in on the rising popularity in zombie fiction. This book wasn\u2019t original, it was underdeveloped, and in serious need of major content editing. As it stands, Plague Town is on top of my \u201cused bookstore\u201d stack."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (Bad Bird Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6864850-jennifer-bad-bird-reads", "userReview": "From my Blog: http://readingandwritingurbanfantasy....4.5 starsThe GoodZombiefied... Though I love zombie movies, for some reason I don't read a lot of zombie fiction. So I was super excited to get the chance to review this book so I could finally see if the whole zombie craze is something I would like to be a part of. And guess what? I have been zombiefied! I loved this book. It was action packed, had tons of gore, and even had a little lovin' on the side. Wild Card...After a vicious attack by zombies, Ashley wakes up to find out she is a wild card, a person immune to the zombie virus. There are only a few of her kind in the town overrun by the dead flesh eaters. But together they have to fight to keep the virus from spreading outside town borders. They may have enhanced strength and senses, but how can only a small group of people go against a town full of zombies? With the training from the sexy and mysterious Gabriel and the backing from a secretive government agency, Ashley and her ragtag group of wild cards may just win the zombie war. Foreboding...The best part of Plague Town was the amazing foreboding we experience for most of the book. There were so many hints that were slickly and strategically placed throughout the novel that I knew they might mean something in the end but couldn't imagine the extent of what was revealed later on. I love being surprised like that. It really made this book a roller-coaster of a read. Humor, the Cure All...Ashley was an intriguing, likable, and snarky character. She was also very relatable, especially to me since I tend to find humor in everything. Even when it's inappropriate. But that's the fun part, laughing when you want to cry or scream. Ashley is that kind of person who takes things in stride and it made me respect her. She was also fiercely loyal to her friends, pretty much doing anything for them. I also loved her reluctance towards liking Gabriel because it seemed realistic. Gabriel was that kind of character that was a total jerk, then kind of a bully, then a jerk again, then for some reason he starts to grow on you. He loses some of his cockiness and all of a sudden he's a little adorbale and all out sexy. A Zombie's Perspective...Fredsti took a fantastical concept and made it seem plausible. The writing was streamline and the description really helped me visualize and even smell each scene. I really liked the short chapters about the zombies' perspective or how others got infected that were sprinkled throughout the novel. It added something special, something I haven't seen before. The references and quotes from popular movies and TV shows really drove home that this book is set in our current world and time, which made the zombie concept even more creepy. There was a perfect amount of action and suspense. Even the small romance was just enough to help me care about the couple. I can't wait for the next book, which was very nicely set up by this book's end. The BadI truly can't think of anything I disliked about Plague Town. Maybe I could complain that there was some lull moments, so the book didn't hold my attention the whole time but that was pretty rare. The ending also felt a little unfinished but since this is going to be a series, I didn't mind too much. The SnugglyThis is not a romance novel but we do get some budding love and some sex. Nothing over the top. Ashley and Gabriel were a cute couple, though it took them a long time to figure it out. We get a lot of misunderstandings before they give into their desires. OverallThough I haven't read a lot of zombie books, this one is by far the best. The characters were realistic and I ended up caring about them. I was genuinely scared half the time and couldn't believe the kinds of situations Ashley got herself in and actually survived. Plague Town was a well written thrill ride that took me by surprise. Highly Recommended. ExcerptsWe were both moaning with desire at this point, all panting with eagerness to take things to the next level...when suddenly his hand squeezed my left breast way too hard. \"What the f**ck?\" I said. \"Get off me!\" I shoved Matt and rolled away from the moaning. The hand on my breast stayed there, accompanied by a nasty tearing noise, like the sound of a drumstick being ripped off a whole chicken. Matt grabbed the lantern and turned it up. I gasped in grossed-out disbelief. The glow revealed a rotted hand clutching my 34-C, ragged nails digging into the flesh. Even worse, said hand was attached to an equally gross arm...And nothing else. ~~~~~~~~~~~~I backed away into the blackberry bushes, hemmed in by zombies on both sides of the path. No retreat, no way forward. Thorns dug into my back, poking through the fabric of my sweater and jeans, and grabbed at my arms. My hair snarled in some branches, trapping me as effectively as a fly in spider web, no matter how hard I tried to pull free. Death closed in from all sides, reaching for me with implacable hands and ravenous mouths. I gave one last scream of despair mixed with fury. This was so not how I wanted to die. I mean, zombie chow?

I have to say, I'm smitten.This book was just so effing fun! If it wasn't for my numerous responsibilities, I would've devoured it in a day. In my wife's review, she described this story as \"Buffy + Walking Dead + Anita Blake! I LOVED it!\" I say, while we're making comparisons, toss in a little Stephanie Plum. Ashley is a lovable ditz, with a fiery 'tude, quirky personality, and some killer moves. The other \"Wild Cards\" are also lovable in their own unique ways and each seemed to have their own personalities. They're all very relatable, too. I'd really like to see some deeper story arcs for the \"Wild Cards\" in future books.The story was predictable, but didn't detract from the fun. Some of the foreshadowing was a little heavy-handed so I never got that \"OMG\" feeling, but I never really cared because I was enjoying the character interaction too much. As silly as it sounds, I actually wanted to climb in the book and live in this zombie infested world.There are a LOT of pop-culture references in this book. I mean, A LOT!!!! At first, I was a bit overwhelmed and just wanted to shout, \"Yes, I know you watch a lot of TV and movies. Can we please move on now?\" Some of the cornier references, like the \"Independence Day\" speech at the end, earned a well-deserved facepalm, but overall I felt like they actually contributed to the quirky nature of the narrative.My only real, honest-to-god, complaint was that I felt the story could have been longer and Ashley's emotional state could have been explored more. It felt at times like Ashley didn't have normal emotions, because they were glossed over so fast in order to push the story along. For example (SPOILER ALERT), Ashley finds out her boyfriend's big secret and, instead of being disgusted and having to come to terms with his... appetites,... she takes approximately two pages worth of \"How dare you! Let's screw!\" and then everything's peachy again. A little unrealistic. The action is top notch, I just wish she would have added 50 to 100 pages worth of content to help us connect a little better to Ashley's mental state.All that being said, this is still one of the most fun books I've ever read and I can't wait for the next one!!

Fredsti's writing is always full of good humour and arch observations, but it's also chock full of action and really gruesome horror. The alternation in narrative between zombie hunters and zombie sufferers gives a chance to recognise the human price of the plague, something that doesn't come across in a lot of more depersonalised tales. At times the in-jokes come a little heavy, but the story cracks right along with both intense and grisly action, but also complicated interactions between characters you will root for.

Because of this they ask her to join their team, along with a few other \u2018wild card\u2019s\u2019 they\u2019ve come across, to help clear the area and rescue any survivors. Thus ensues lots of action, zombie brain splattering, suspense and fab character interaction with a dash of sexual tension.PLAGUE TOWN is such a fun read. Full of zombie munching, gory entrails, sassy heroine and a hero you \u2018love to hate\u2019, but soon end up just loving. The descriptions of the zombies are great, and worthy of any horror novel. They are gory and detailed, just the way I like \u2018em.The world Fredsti has created is fantastic, very visual and realistic. The dialogue is very smooth and I was completely immersed in the characters and their lives. There were a few scenes that made my hairs stand on end, which is great, exactly what I want when reading a book such as this.\u201cIn here!\u201d Lil joined me and banged on the front door. We watched as zombies peeled off from the steady stream wandering past and staggered to join the ever-increasing crown in front of the store. I glanced at Lil, and could tell from her set expression that she was scanning the crowd for a familiar face.One I hoped she didn\u2019t see.\u201cMaybe we should\u2013\u201d I stopped short as the zombie that used to be Annie suddenly let go of the gate and veered off to its left, pushing through the crowd with what almost seemed like a sense of purpose.\u201cOkay, now that\u2019s just weird.\u201d\u201cDo you think she remembers the back door?\u201dA chill ran up my spine.Ashley, the main character, is a firecracker; feisty, sassy and not afraid to get into the thick of it. She deals with what life throws at her with ease, sometimes a bit too easily, but I did like her for it. Ashley\u2019s love interest and mentor, is Gabriel. When we first meet him, before the virus and zombie outbreak, he was an absolute pig. He acted superior and talked down to Ashley and tried to embarrass her whenever possible, but as the story moves along, he thaws out and becomes a sweet guy, but also doesn\u2019t lose that hard edge. There\u2019s also a twist to his character I saw a mile off, but it is a good one.I loved the first sexy scene between Ashley and Gabriel. There had been a bit of sexual tension between them but the intensity of Gabriel\u2019s feelings which showed in this scene shocked me as much as it did Ashley. Did he let the side down by acting like a jerk a little later, yep, but the lead up was sexy and hot.I gasped in shock. Without warning, his hands tightened painfully on my upper arms and he pushed me up against the wall, his body pressed against mine. His eyes darkened so much I thought I must be imagining it.My breathing quickened as his hand shifted from my arms up to my face, fingers twining though my hair. Anger and desire warred in his gaze. Heat coiled in my stomach even as fear shuddered up my spine.I tried to shake my head, but his fingers held it in place as he muffled any protests by covering my mouth with his.Fingers massaging my scalp, he slowly increased the intensity of the kiss, his tongue entering into play as he tilled my head back and slip it in.I felt like I was following along in a dance, being led by someone who knew the steps much better than I did. I discovered that I was content to follow, matching the pressure of his lips with mine, letting my tongue play with his as he pressed his body into me, emphasising the move with a low, throaty sound.He was definitely packing heat, and it wasn\u2019t his sidearm.Ashley and Gabriel do have one other hot scene, unfortunately this isn\u2019t handled as well as the one above, in my opinion, which is a shame as they totally get it on and it\u2019s what I\u2019d been waiting for since their first connection. The reason is, I have a thing. It may just be me but I can\u2019t stand it when people snog first thing in the morning without cleaning their teeth, or, as in this instance, kiss after throwing up. It\u2019s just icky. And it\u2019s all I think about while the scene is unfolding, and I\u2019m unable to enjoy it.After finding out Gabriel\u2019s secret, Ashley is so disgusted she rushes to the bathroom and throws up. She rinses her mouth out but that\u2019s it. In bursts Gabriel and one thing leads to another. The first thing I didn\u2019t like is the above mentioned sicky mouth, but also the fact that it was all too rushed. Why did Ashley and Gabriel have to get it on then and there. With the enormous revelation I would have thought Ashley would have been a little bit more miffed and needed some time to mull everything over.There\u2019s an AMAZING action scene near the end of the book and I would have much prefered Ashley and Gabriel to have waited until after this scene. I think it would have been much better, but then\u2026 I\u2019m not the author.One of the other \u2018wild cards\u2019 I loved is Lily. She\u2019s a really sweet character. At first she seems a bit naive and shy, but put a pickaxe in her hand and she turns into a zombie killing machine. She reminded me a little bit of Jenni from Rhiannon Frater\u2019s As the World Dies trilogy in that she becomes a little nuts with everything that is going on, and to cope she goes out with guns blazing pulverising zombies whenever she can.One of my favourite scenes was when Ashley and Lil head out on their own to go back into the zombie infested town to rescue Lil\u2019s two cats Doodle and Blinkey. I love animals and I know that I would have to do everything in my power to save them and I loved that this is what the characters in this book decided to do too. It was heart-warming and sweet. The love Lil had for her pet\u2019s was really sweet. She couldn\u2019t concentrate on what she was doing without knowing they were ok. Once they were safely with her and Lil and Ashley were safely back at the UNIT she slept.I opened the door.\u201cLil?\u201d No answer. She wouldn\u2019t have bolted, would she?Gabriel came in behind me.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs she okay?\u201dI pointed to the bed where Lily had collapsed, giving in to exhaustion. Blinkey was draped around the top of her head like a furry halo, Doodle curled in the crook of her arm\u2026both cats purred loudly and the contented smile on Lil\u2019s face \u2013 even in her sleep \u2013 brought tears to my eyes.\u201cYeah,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201dThere are lots of secondary characters and they all had distinctive personalities. I didn\u2019t become lost in the sea of names as I have done with other novels. They all added their bit to the story and I ended up liking them all, hoping they would all survive.VERDICT:Other than one or two aspects, I think PLAGUE TOWN is a great zombie book. I really enjoyed it and Ashley is a fantastic heroine. I can\u2019t wait to see how she grows in subsequent books. Fredsti is now on my auto-buy list and I can\u2019t wait for the next book in the series, Zombie Nation."}, {"userName": "Beth Dawkins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604779-beth-dawkins", "userReview": "3.5Ashley goes back to college after recovering from the Walker flu. The flu seems is sweeping the campus. When she and her boyfriend go for a night time picnic they are attacked by zombies. After her zombie encounter she learns that she is a \u2018wild card.\u2019 Wild cards once bitten go through a transformation that increases their senses and reflexes. Her, and a small percentage of others make up a team to help rid the town of the zombie problem.I really enjoy zombie stories, so when asked about this one I devoured it, kind of like how zombies devour people. Plus it has an idea behind it I haven\u2019t encountered before. Not that some people are immune, that\u2019s been done, but that it transforms them into better killers of the undead. It may have been done before, but I haven\u2019t read anything that has that. From page one it reads like an urban fantasy. It is told from Ashley\u2019s POV, and like most urban fantasy heroines, she is smart, kick ass and snarky. The story carries itself really well towards the end, and its pacing keeps the plot moving forward until the last quarter of the story. The last quarter of the novel feels rushed. I started to find myself emotionally detached from the characters and the environment.The story is not that different from most zombie stories, but what is different is the scale of the infected. We learn that throughout our history there have been pockets of infection. A specialized group takes care of the infected, works with governments, and then covers up what happened. In this Ashley is bullied into the group that kills zombies to save their town. There is a side romantic plot line with the guy in charge of her group. He also has a nice little secret of his own. The story is pretty cut and dry and not fully original.Who doesn\u2019t like to read about a kick butt heroine who slays the undead? At first I was completely sold when it came to Ashley, but as more wild card characters are introduced I found myself at a distance. Ashley shows a great deal of emotion for fellow wild card Lilly, and very mixed emotions about her team leader Gabriel, but that is where things stop. Zombie stories are sometimes less about the zombies, and more about the psychological damage of the protagonists involved. It would be hard to watch people eat others to death, especially children doing it. Ashley adapts well to the horrors around her, maybe a little too well for me. There is also the strange relationship between her and Gabriel. The first tense scene between them creates a want for more, and when the reader does get more it feels unreal, or too rushed to an end.Zombies here are for the most part your classic example. They don\u2019t run, they shuffle, sway and moan. The characters are all knowledgeable of the classic zombie fiction, and even give movie quotes along the way. These small quotes and references didn\u2019t take away from the story, but made it humorous (not all the time funny, but parts). There is a good bit of rotting corpses in full display, and they do take bites of people, but the true horror of the zombies felt lost. This is mostly because we are in Ashley\u2019s head, and after a while they are just things to kill. There are POV switches at the end of chapters. The story cuts to people becoming zombies or being devoured. These small scenes are horrific goodness!Plague Town feels like a combination of urban fantasy and zombie horror which is nice. It also sprinkles in a romantic subplot that I started out enjoying, but became rushed. The plot is very simple, but it does have some original flavor when it comes to getting bit. The zombies are gross, and smell funny, but they were not as frightening as I wanted them to be. I also wanted it to bother me more emotionally than it did. I would recommend this to urban fantasy fans, but hardcore zombie lovers might have a few complaints with it."}, {"userName": "Elisa ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133558-elisa", "userReview": "Ew! This was gross and disgusting but strangly compelling and I couldn't stop reading it.I am currently walking around work, checking corners, looking behind doors and fully imaging whether I would be able to elude zombies in the workplace. I have been infected by this story! Ashley Parker and her boyfriend are attacked during a romantic evening picnic in the woods near their college. Ashley survives, as she is curiously immune to the infection. She is a wild card.She is recruited by the military to help contain the infection to their town along with a few other wild cards. This isn\u2019t the first time the dead have walked and the powers that be have always kept a lid on zombies to not incite a panic. (Government conspiracy alert! You had to know that the CDCs guide wasn\u2019t just clever marketing, right?! Am I the only one who is slightly worried about that?!)Anyway, the wild cards train, fight, kick some zombie butt and slide around in all sorts of fluids. Ewww!! Wild cards are immune to whatever makes a zombie a zombie, but they get super senses, quicker healing and extra strength from the bite.This book, while gross and disgusting, is also funny and a little sexy in a disturbed way. Ashley is in her late 20s even though back in college. She is a smart alec and deals with the horror of their new situation by finding humor and cracking a few jokes. Her fellow wild cards aren\u2019t all the same, but they are mainly young and hip. There are a lot of movie quotes and references from the Alien movies and Independence Day among others (see a trend?). The book knows it isn\u2019t breaking new ground, but it has fun telling its story. Ashley is a typical heroine these days, she has all the right attributes, good looking, funny, smart, strong, loyal and brave. She cares about her teammates and usually has something clever or funny to say.But seriously folks, there are fluids and viscera everywhere! Luckily these dead don\u2019t sprint, I don\u2019t think they would survive if they did. Smell is mentioned a lot too, blegh. I don\u2019t recommend you read this during your lunch breaks, at least not while eating. There are two more books planned. So, I am not sure they fully contain the infection\u2026I am going to look them up when they are released. I liked Ashley, her cohorts, the military dudes and her interesting love interest. I think that part was a bit out of control, but whatever. I can\u2019t talk about it because it would spoil things, but, huh. This is my first zombie book besides some zombie side characters in a few urban fantasy series I read. This is definitely the most visual and gross and filled with zombie moans and fluids. Yucky, but so readable, I couldn't put it down! I can definitely handle this better in print than on the silver screen. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951344-michelle", "userReview": "Plague Town is the first book in the Ashley Parker series by Dana Fredsti and a Horror Novel from Titan Books.Book Blurb:People are dying.

They\u2019re usually really gross and too detailed. For the most part, I steer clear of these type of books. That said I couldn\u2019t put it down! It\u2019s that good!Initially I was wary of the changing points of view, but I found it helped ease me into the story and it broke up the intensity. Fredsti did a great job of being in a zombie\u2019s head space to the point of being seriously creepy.I like the premise of some people being immune to the virus. Fredsti took it even further \u2013 the virus enhances them. The book has a solid plot bringing together science and humanity.Ashley, one of the main characters, is a bad-ass. She\u2019s tough, she\u2019s a smart-ass. I love her. She can\u2019t be intimidated and she has a mind of her own. Ashley is my ideal leading female. She has all the traits I hope for in a main character.The best thing about the book is the humor. The humor offsets the ugliness. It brings levity to an otherwise dire situation. At one point, Ashley refers to herself as a \u201cprofane munchkin\u201d which cracked me up. She has a serious potty mouth that makes her even more likeable. She\u2019s not a Barbie robot. She\u2019s flawed but in relatable ways.In spite of the number of characters, Fredsti\u2019s character development is off the charts. I didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed (as I often do) with all the characters. I felt like I knew each one of them intimately.The sex scene is perfectly placed. There\u2019s enough character development that you\u2019re ready for them to just go at it. And they did go at it. HOT!!!Bottom line: Fun and humorous. If you\u2019re a zombie fan, it\u2019s a must read.http://openbooksociety.com/article/da..."}, {"userName": "Richard Hartman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2373657-richard-hartman", "userReview": "Yet Another entry into the \"zombie disease\" genre has appeared, and it's good. \"Plague Town\" by Dana Fredsti.

There are a ton of pop culture references in the text, which makes the book more believable for me. I hate the \"sanitized\" culture you find in many books where they have no common points of reference with you because the author doesn't want to acknowledge the real world.

And I love the movie references peppered throughout the plot.Ashley riffs on Alien (Ripley never dies going for the cat), another repeats the entire President's speech from Independence Day, and so on.The combat scenes are top-notch as the team uses everything from M-4 guns to katana swords.Can't wait for the next one."}, {"userName": "Kilt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1000683-kilt", "userReview": "Sure, I'm biased, but what can I say?

She\u2019s busted out of an unhealthy marriage to a control freak of a husband and has decided to return to school to earn her undergraduate degree (so what if she\u2019s older than everyone in her classes?). Ashley\u2019s new lease on life also means that she\u2019s happily taking classes in whatever field she wants (including a class on the history of pandemics), and that she\u2019s enjoying herself, particularly with her new hot but perhaps not so bright boyfriend, Matt. One quiet evening when the couple is enjoying a romantic picnic and make-out session on campus, they are rudely interrupted\u2026by a horde of undead zombies. Things don\u2019t go so well for Matt or Ashley \u2013 the last thing Ashley remembers is getting a huge hunk of her arm ripped out by a rotting corpse before passing out from the pain.When she awakens, she\u2019s in a strange room, with her History of Pandemics Professor, of all people. It turns out that Ashley is one of the 0.001% of the population that is immune to zombie infection \u2013 a \u201cWild Card\u201d, as they like to call themselves. Not only is Ash immune to bites, scratches, or other zombified bodily fluids, but her senses, strength, and agility have been increased as a result of her body\u2019s fighting off the infection. Because of this unique immunity and the subsquent physical perk, Ashley and her fellow Wild Cards are prized, highly-sought out civilian recruits for the US Military. As it turns out, zombie outbreaks have been happening routinely throughout history, and high levels of government know, prepare, and have been fighting against uprisings since ancient times. Given everything that has happened to her, Ashley willfully agrees to work with the military group to stop the onslaught of zombies that is quickly overwhelming the quiet college town of Redwood Grove.As the zombie horde increases in size, Ashley and her fellow Wild Cards find themselves in way over the heads. And with secrets at every turn \u2013 from the nature of certain Wild Card immunity to the truth of the latest zombie outbreak \u2013 Ashley and her new friends must think quickly if they are going to survive.The first book in a new Urban Fantasy series from author Dana Fredsti, Plague Town is a diverting, entertaining zombie siege novel \u2013 complete with all the delicious bone-crunching, blood-gushing awesomeness a zombie lover could ever want. I was looking for a substitute to fill the Walking Dead sized hole in my week, and I\u2019m happy to say that for the most part, Plague Town delivers.On the premise and world-building side, Plague Town is a solid and memorable experience. I love the idea of an Urban Fantasy series that revolves around an honest-to-goodness zombie apocalypse \u2013 a conceit that is used far too sparingly in the sea of werewolf/vampire/fey/etc UF series on the market \u2013 and I love the introduction to this strange new world in which some humans are immune to the zombie virus. The setting, in a sleepy Northern California college town, is also a brilliant choice, ever so slightly reminiscent of the awesome \u201980s b-horror classic Night of the Creeps. Add to this the creation of a civilian-operated military cell with the Wild Cards (a sort of zombie-eradicating league of ragtag ordinary people-cum-badasses), and you\u2019ve got a pretty sweet party.These strengths said, there are some drawbacks that prevented the book from transcending \u201cfun\u201d to something deeper and more resonant (this novel isn\u2019t on par with Mira Grant\u2019s Newsflesh books, for example). As far as story goes, the actual development of plot takes a backseat to action \u2013 not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination, as the action and fight scenes are expertly written and a blast to read. Simply put, there\u2019s a marked lack of any deeper message or gravitas. Additionally, as is the downfall of many an Urban Fantasy heroine, there\u2019s also the overdose of snark injected into the first person narrative. I\u2019m not a huge fan of one-liner overkill, and Ashley\u2019s narrative is chock-full of them, which become increasingly unfunny with each subsequent quip. Additionally, while awesome pop-culture references abound (see \u201cThe Ripley Syndrome\u201d and why one should never go back for a cat \u2013 and then why that theory is bogus because Ripley survives), these again could be too frequent, feeling more forced than clever.Finally, an Urban Fantasy novel is only so strong as its leading man or lady, and Plague Town\u2018s heroine, Ashley Parker has her ups and her downs. Slightly abrasive and with a tendency towards over-snark (as mentioned above), Ashley starts out the book feeling like your familiar everyday chip-on-her-shoulder UF heroine. Thankfully, there are moments where Ashley breaks away from one-note UF badass to an actual layered character that is both smart and strong. While there\u2019s a requisite romance between Ashley and one prickly character that unfolds in a familiar way, there was one interaction between them that made me fall in love with Ashley, despite the abundance of her other typical UF heroine-itis symptoms. Observe this one scene, after an impromptu hookup in the bathroom, when said love interest lost all control and thrusts himself upon our (willing) heroine:I would have fallen over if I hadn\u2019t been leaning against the wall. My breathing ragged, I stared at him.His breathing was a little choppy, too, as he spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Or not, as it seemed. Frustration made me blunt. \u201cWhat the hell SHOULD have happened?\u201d\u201cI lost control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026I can\u2019t allow it.\u201dWhat, and I CAN? I thought angrily.\u201cSo it\u2019s not okay for Mister \u2018I\u2019m better than everyone else,\u2019 but it\u2019s something you\u2019d expect from the slut,\u201d I countered. Hurt wrestled with anger. \u201cThanks, but no thanks, Gabriel.\u201dHALLELUJAH. If you\u2019ve read a few paranormal or UF novels from the past few years, the alpha male pulling back because he \u201ccan\u2019t lose control\u201d is a familiar phenomenon. How often do you hear a heroine calling out the hero for this crap, though? Not nearly often enough \u2013 and I adored Ashley\u2019s response. There are other glimmers of awesomeness that make Ashley a compelling heroine, including her genuine empathy for other Wild Cards and her brutal honesty, and it\u2019s certainly more than enough to make up for any other shortcomings in the book.Overall, I truly enjoyed Plague Town and I will certainly be back for more. Recommended, especially for fans looking for a different type of Urban Fantasy."}, {"userName": "Mardel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2540631-mardel", "userReview": "After a short prologue where you read about a young mother who is exhausted, taking care of her sick husband and child then having them turn on her...Plague Town segues into a first person account of Ashley Parker.Ashley Parker lives in a college town, Northern California, and she's recently become sick from a very strong flu called Walker's flu. Seems people are dropping left and right from this flu, even the people who have been getting flu shots. Ashley notices that she's not looking too good - in fact, her skin has a kind of gray cast to it...After being sick for quite a while, she finally attends her first day of classes. Only she's missed quite a few because of her illness and has to deal with a rather judgemental teaching assistant. The next time she goes to class she notices that the lines at the local coffee shop are shorter, less people are about and even in the class where she had such a hard time finding a seat, there is now plenty of seats...and the judgemental teacher's assist is now absent. Seems this Walker's flu has really knocked people on there asses.Later she goes out with her boyfriend, they're in a secluded area, making out (sound familiar? we've watched a variation of this in many movies, lol) when they are attacked by rotting people, one of whom manages to bite her. Luckily for her, she's rescued and spends the next few days suffering from what feels like the worst flu ever - when she finally comes out of it, there is her teacher from that one crowded class (which was about plagues and diseases through the ages...hmmmm). Ashley finds out that she's fortunate - she's immune to the the zombie virus. And her teacher is actually part of a covert black ops type of company that has been around in one form or another through out time - taking care of the zombie plagues that have taken place. Wow.One of the side effects of Ashley being a wild card (immune to the zombie virus) is increased senses and strength - as well as healing ability. However, Ashley and the few other wild cards are not immortal. Just resistant and a stronger. Nice. Except that now she and the others are now strongly recruited into service with the army branch and the zombie fighting co. They are trained and sent out to do battle with the zombies.You could view parts of this book as familiar - you could also view it as a nod to all the zombie movies that have been made. I had fun reading it, though some parts of the story might considered cliche - but hey - how many truly original stories are really out there? Most of the novels we read are variations of a variety of plots. It's the different writers that give the novels depth and interesting narration, subplots, dialogue (so very very important, people! Extremely important!!!!! You could have a wonderfully narrated book, with sweeping vistas and grand plots....but the lame dialogue can totally turn it into a ....well.....okay - a piece of crap, okay? haha. a little harsh, but really, the wrong dialogue can totally ruin a book for me.) Dana Fredsti had a couple of twists in her novel and she mentions quite of few of those zombie movies and books that have become legendary in our entertainment culture. (Max Brooks-on impulse I bought my oldest son the first survival guide novel this guy wrote-Dawn of the Dead, etc) I love reading a book that has mentions of other writers and movies.Her main character was able to make new friends and keep a snarky wit about her (though it wasn't too snarky) . There were a few characters that I enjoyed reading about - the other wild cards were from a varied cross section of personality types. There was a shy girl, a postman, a punkrocker type, a handsome young black man, and a very aloof thirty something white woman, so aloof she's basically unfriendly. Now I bring up the black man because when I came across his character, I thought...oh boy, here it is. The cliche. This is the one guy that's going to get killed. With every single time that they went out, I expected him to get killed. Just remember all those movies - whether it's a slasher, horror or zombie movie - who usually gets it? The one black guy - the black guy who so handsome/personable/helpful/or even daddy-figure like. Yep - they always end up being one of the victims. Ask anyone who watches any of those films - usually that's what happens - like the red shirts in Star Trek...they're always doomed.But Nooooooooooo. At the end of Plague Town, this man was still alive - not only alive, but one of the best characters - even though he's portrayed as a playa'. There is the inevitable asshat army guy - the one that's such an asshole, yet in charge of the group. Except he's not around for long.....Mwhahahahaha....Anyway - if you like zombie horror with a bit of humor to take the edge off of what's going on with all the gore and mayhem, this is a good book. It's entertaining, humorous and shivery.

Initially I was just curious about the cover (I guess I'm a \"chicks with swords\" kinda guy). But then I came across a review based on a relatively small portion of the book -- a practice I'm not crazy about -- and decided to test the accuracy of said review. So I located a copy and gave it a whirl and ended up enjoying it much more than I expected to.First the obligatory plot summary: college student (Ashley Parker) gets bitten by zombie but finds out she's immune to the virus; ends up recruited by secret paramilitary organization to contain a zombie outbreak near small town in Northern California. The book is written from a first-person viewpoint as so many are these days, and the narrator has a quippy, pop-culture-saturated voice that the larger audience should enjoy but some may find a bit grating in large doses. I thought most of her observations and asides were pretty humorous, but by the same token there are times when they bleed the tension from what could have been more suspenseful scene. At first the narrative is interspersed with third-person sequences of zombies being \"born\" or finding prey, so we do get to see things outside of Ashley's purview, but these vignettes seem to dry up about halfway through, which is too bad. I enjoyed the variety and was looking forward to seeing the exploits of these zombie killers through eyes other than Ashley's.The characters can be a little wobbly at times, mostly toward the start. One not-so-subtle sequence has a general (who Ashley dubs \"General Brasshole\") trying to recruit her for his team. He is the standard caricature of an Evil Military Man and pretty over-the-top, and her response is not much better; she comes across so strenuously anti-military in this scene, it's like she forgot it was soldiers that just saved her bacon a few chapters earlier. Plus, why is she so angry that the military is dissecting/experimenting on zombies? Especially when she'll be hacking them to pieces herself just a short training montage later? It's an odd sequence, but once it's over a different commander is introduced and all the characters settle down and start to gel much better. Plus the action begins to pick up as well, and that's never a bad thing.The zombies are handled with obvious affection, including a creepy new hybrid introduced along the way. I especially liked one sequence where Ashley and a team member venture into the infested town to rescue the other member's cats. I'm sure some readers will roll their eyes over this, but it fits well with another book I'm currently reading, NO BUDDY LEFT BEHIND, about the private operation to rescue animals adopted by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. If you don't think people would go to extremes to protect their pets, give that book a try. I haven't finished it yet, but so far it's a very moving account and highly recommended.Tension in PLAGUE TOWN could have been increased a bit by offing a few more characters along the way to raise the stakes (as is, it sorta reminded me of Stallone's EXPENDABLES where no one was particularly expendable after all). But then this is obviously the first in a series of novels, so maybe the author will be upping the body count in later volumes. I hope so, and that she changes things up as she goes. Some of these series tend to simply reset the gameboard and replay the same book over and over again only with different names and locations, and that can get tiresome pretty fast. But I think given what she's established here, this could be the start of a very entertaining series. I will definitely check out the next book when it comes out. Even if it doesn't have a chick with a sword on the cover... :)"}, {"userName": "Tonya", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5516834-tonya", "userReview": "[ Gabriel is a wild card in the deck or wild cards, he HAS to eat HUMAN flesh to survive.
