From all accounts, he would have been an excellent influence on all those who knew him.Many good lines in this book, including:The Jesuits believed that humans could perfect themselves through hard work and dedication to excellence, principles that guided Lombardi for the rest of his life.He didn't hesitate to ask questions when he didn't understand something; didn't tolerate answers that he considered half-baked. (That is much appreciated if someone wastes a half hour or more of your time by not speaking up if they lack comprehension.)The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.Leader is defined by \"what he does in a specific situation\""}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2954157-jeff", "userReview": "I hate hate hate this book.
