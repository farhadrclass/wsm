The book could have stood by itself as a stand-alone as it does not have much of a connection to the Mountain Man (Gus) except with the lead character (Scott) of this story being featured in the 1st Mountain Man book.I thought this was a very good zombie thriller. I enjoyed the new characters introduced in this story, the good and the bad. I liked the ending where Scott & Amy were going after Tenner as well as Fist (leader of the Norsemen). Remind me to never pi*s off Amy!In this story the zombies were not really the central factor to the story, oh they were there and still munching and chewing on the regular humans, but they were more of a side bar to the villainous killer Tenner (and what a freak he was) and the cannibalistic hoard called the Norsemen. What a group of sick puppies! So, even if you have not either of the first two Mountain Man books (where are pretty good as well), you can still enjoy this thriller."}, {"userName": "Timothy Ward", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867952-timothy-ward", "userReview": "I'm not sure if I liked book three as much as book one, but it was still an outstanding zombie read. It picks up with some more character interaction after book two was mostly one person, so that was good, and we got to see more through the pov of some super baddies. Blackmore is highlighting one of the less obvious fears of a zombie apocalypse: those who survive into stage two may more likely be twisted than trustworthy. How long would you give a new acquaintance before letting down your guard? Blackmore is doing a good job building character engagement with an expanded cast. He's also finding new ways in each book to show us the terrors of surviving in the zombie apocalypse. Finished this and immediately bought book four, which I'm glad to see is 16 hours of narration (after the book 1-3 omnibus was 22 hours). R.C. Bray is one of the best narrators, and that makes this series that much better.

I read these books as part of a compilation called Mountain Man: Omnibus. The cover was like the Walking Dead in that it showed nothing but decay and an empty street. The covers on the Goodreads entries are way different and probably would have kept me from reading this story. Which would have been sad because these books were very good. As far as zombie books go. Creative and character driven (my favorite kind). I am not a fan of the zombie genre but I do like post apocalyptic books so zombies so often make an appearance these days. I do like a good scary story and zombies are one of the few horror elements I find scary. So... there you go. This third book is not about the main \u201cMountain Man\u201d Gus but instead about Scott. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the writing that keeps me reading so I enjoyed this story as much as the others. If you enjoy a good zombie tale the Mountain Man Omnibus (or Mountain Man trilogy as shown on Goodreads) is worth picking up. It is not overly gory and is heavy on the lone character development.

I'm going to write a review for the trilogy all at once, because I don't want to take the time to hunt and remember all three books. So, this is only for people, like me, who appreciate zombie apocalypse fiction. All others, ignore this.Both the author and the reader are wonderful. Entertaining and suspenseful. Characters came to life, from the two main characters in the first and last novel to the psycopathic killer and hells angel cannibalistic motorcycle gang. Blackmore scores in the little things. His first main character being an alcoholic, the prizing of toilet paper in an apocalypse, zombie babies (in his first story, Hospital, which is a prologue).

I rarely find a good zombie story/series, so I'd definitely recommend this one to others. I listened to the audiobook version of this whole series, at least up to Book 3. One thing that annoyed me with this story was that there was a new character (I forgot his name, but he was referred to as \u2018Newfoundland\u2019) and his accent. For whatever reason, the author and therefore the narrator would repeat what the guy said, only certain words, every so often throughout the story. It would be like \u2018He said it this way\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m listening so I can hear the difference, although I\u2019d imagine the spelling would have been different, so the reader should have figured that the guy was pronouncing the words differently. It was almost like the author was proving to the reader that he had done some research to find the correct spelling/pronunciation of the accented words.By the time I got to Book 3 I was curious about what was going on with Scott. Thankfully, he was brought back into the story, but prior to him meeting up with his group I couldn\u2019t help but feel there was a good amount of coincidence between him and Gus. Both men were out walking around on the snow-packed ground only to realize there were zombies under the snow who ended up chasing after them. They both end up in another attic as well. The fact that there are similarities between the two characters suggests to me that the author was low on ideas. I don\u2019t know though.This was when I started noticing such redundancies/repetitions with the writers writing style, for example, \u201cHe stepped around the corner and peeked around the corner.\u201d Or the wannabe jokes of \u201cI know there\u2019s a joke in there but\u2026\u201d. Or the repetition of \u201cHome again home again jiggity jig\u201d by two different characters that hadn\u2019t any \u2018scenes\u2019 together. There\u2019s also the only two females that like to knee people. I was confused about something\u2026At one point Tanner is hanging out and then killing the curry guy (who was all alone) in the military base. Then it goes to Scott and the Vikings parts. Once Scott meets up with his new group he learns that Tanner is with them too. They know he\u2019s looking for the armory. When did he meet this group though? If he was really interested in weapons and locating the armory why pretend to be friendly with them? It was also strange that Tanner thought he\u2019d be able to kill them one at a time without the others suspecting anything as well.So, the Vikings were essentially a mix of Tanner and the zombies. Tanner because they went around looking for survivors to kill. Zombies because they ate them.One big thing that had me knowing for a fact the author wasn\u2019t American? His use of the metric system! lol"}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "ABR's full Hellifax audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.SPOILER ALERT.

He left his SUV parked at an empty house and headed toward town. It was there that he met Amy and her friends. One of them was named Tanner. A lot of grizzly things happen after this.Tanner arrived in Hellifax and started doing his thing. He had decided to take out the members of Amy\u2019s group one at a time.

I've read parts one and two, loved them both but suspected this one might be even better, and it was. I believe it could be read as a stand alone, as any info needed from the other books is given, and this is a whole new adventure with many new characters.The main character is Scott, who became friends with mountain man Gus in the first book ~ this follows his fortunes as he sets off for Halifax (Canada, not Yorkshire!) to seek out the evil Tenner, who massacred his friends. In 'Hellifax' Scott meets up with a new group, martial arts student and teacher Amy and Vic, and former cop Buckle, amongst others. The book's written partly from his POV and partly from that of psychopath Tenner ~ and, talking of psychopaths, we also meet the terrifying Norsemen, a group of road warriors who know no fear and have an alternative strategy when it comes to keeping themselves fed and alive.Then there are the rats....This is not a zombie apocalypse book for the faint of heart, and there are no nice little groups of survivalists. It's horror, from beginning to end. Absolutely gripping, I loved it from start to finish, one of the best books I've read this year. The story itself is multi-faceted and unpredictable with never a dull or safe moment, and the characterisation is terrific, too. There are a few editing 'glitches' but they're minor, and didn't spoil it at all. At the end there's an author's note saying that Blackmore was not sure if there would be a book 4, but happily there is.

Some parts were okay, other times I wasn't even listening and didn't really mind not knowing what had happened.The zombies in these books are super inconsistent. Firstly the books never offer any explanation to how the zombies came to be in the first place--and how come there aren't any new zombies appearing? It's something that has affected the majority of the population so far, so why did it stop? Not a single new zombie is made in the books. Secondly, the zombies are sometimes described as absolutely mindless with no other purpose than feeding, yet at other times they are \"grinning at\" the people or \"considering\", even \"thinking\", which goes directly against the other times where they are described as having no thinking capabilities.This book finally has a female character though, so yay to that! Too bad she's extremely generic and boring, and only serves to direct the male protagonist's actions and thinking. Oh, and she's also sexualised hell of a lot. Not so yay after all.Two stars is me being generous, to be honest.
