More depth than many longer SF novels. His shorter stories are more creative than his best novels. There is huge variety in the shorter stories.Best stories in this collection are: \"The Moon Moth\",\"The Miracle Workers\",\"The Last Castle\",\"The Men Return\" ,\"The New Prime\",\"The Mitr\"The Dying Earth stories in this collection i dont have in the top because i have read them elsewhere in their own omnibus. You cant seprate Dying Earth stories like this collection does."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.5 to 5.0 stars. I have not read all of the stories in this excellent collection so this review is only for the stories listed below (I will update the rating/review as I read additional selections):The Dragon Masters (4.5 to 5.0 stars)- Outstanding Hugo-winning novella about a far future lost colony of Earth battling aliens. Liane the Wayfarer (6.0 stars) - One of my favorite stories from the The Dying Earth featuring Chun the Unavoidable. Guyal of Sfere (5.5 stars) - Another superb tales from the The Dying Earth.The Overworld (5.0 stars) - A classic Dying Earth tales featuring Vance most famous recurring character, Cugel. The Sorcerer Pharesm (4.5 stars) - Another excellent Cugel story set in the world of the Dying Earth. Worlds of Origin (3.5 to 4.0 stars) - A neat science fiction mystery featuring some classic Vance characters and descriptions of alien cultures. The Men Return (4.0 stars) - A classic Vance story about the last survivors of Earth living in chaos after the Earth experienced a phenomenon that has destroyed the \"cause and effect\" rule of nature (i.e. no action's consequence can be predicted).

I am rating this one a 5 because it is one of the finest Vance collections ever issued and includes two of Vance's shorter work masterpieces. Recommended to anybody who loves very well written, highly creative fiction. Each story is listed below alphabetically with a brief summary. Gift of Gab, The\"The Gift of Gab\" is a 56 page novella that was first published in Amazing Science Fiction in 1955. Fletcher works on a barge on an alien planet where they harvest barnacles and sea slugs from the ocean to make chemical compounds. One of his men turns up missing and a strange creature grabs Fletcher by the leg and tries to pull him into the sea. This is a planet where there are suppose to be nothing that is predatory toward people. All of the animals on the planet seem harmless, including the very common seal like marine creature called a dekabrach. But much more is going on with the habitants of the planet and also with his coworkers on another barge. The intrigue builds as Fletcher, who is stuck on the planet with his crew until relief arrives, tries to investigate the mystery. \"Gab,\" incidentally, refers to communication between different species. I found this enjoyable to read and I rated it a 3.5.Kokod Warriors\"The Kokod Warriors,\" a 34 page novelette first published in 1951, is one of the Magnus Ridolph series. The \"Women's League Committee for the Preservation of Moral Values\" hires Ridolph to investigate and stop ritualistic battles on another planet (Kodod) where tribes of dwarf like creatures have bloody fights with each other while tourists with their tour guide watch for entertainment. The hotel in the region makes huge profits from the tourists who visit the planet just to watch these killings. Ridolph devises a clever scheme in this interesting and easy to read story that is arguably the finest of the Magnus Ridolph stories. I rated it 5.Men Return\"The Men Return\" was first published in 1957 and is a 9 page short story. It is rather like two universes that overlap after the law of causality, physics and reality on Earth is rendered somewhat inoperable and matter now fades in and out of existence. Humans evolved into two different creatures, one rooted in the laws of science and the other having developed in the coexisting world of randomness and surrealism where nothing seems real. Both groups spend all their time seeking food and are not above eating each other. As food becomes more scarce, the groups become more desperate. It is all very bizarre, but I found it rather fascinating and rated it 3: \"Liked it.\"The Moon Moth\"The Moon Moth,\" is a marvelous work, a novelette of 39 pages that was first published in Galaxy Magazine in 1961. It takes place on the planet Sirene where adherence to specific local customs and protocol is more important than money or even life itself. Edwer Thissell was recently appointed as the new Consular Representative from Earth after the previous Representative to Sirene was killed because he violated a social norm. Thissell has been taking lessons to learn to play various musical instruments in order to communicate with the locals. All communication on Sirene must be made by playing the appropriate musical instruments and singing in a certain respectful way. Social behavior expected on Sirene is so detailed and complex that it is almost incomprehensible to anyone not born in the culture. Slight violations or mistakes might be interpreted as a grave insult or offense and can lead to bodily harm or even death. All of the Sirene residents also wear special masks as must the four men from Earth. Only certain types of masks can be worn depending on the status and musical skills of the wearer. The mask Thissell wears is of the \"moon moth.\" It is a mask of low prestige but a safe one to wear. Thissell is sent a special message by his superiors assigning him the duty of capturing an assassin from Earth who will soon arrive to Sirene. Unfortunately the message is delayed, and the assassin is able to elude capture. Thissell must begin the process of tracking him down in the town where he has to interact with the local people. He knows that violating the strict rules of behavior can lead to severe consequences but he also knows that he will lose his job if he fails. The story is complex, well thought out and skillfully written. It is probably the finest short work Vance ever wrote and is essential reading, a real classic. My rating: 5The New Prime\"The New Prime\" is also known as \"Brain of the Galaxy.\" It was first published in Startling Stories in 1952 and is a 25 page novelette. It consists of five vignettes with different characters and settings. In the first vignette a man with no memory finds himself naked at a 19th century Boston coming out party and has to decide what to do. In the second a different character is in the midst of a losing battle with insect like creatures and decides to order his men to attack the main hive of the creatures he is fighting. In the third a man is in an ancient city of ruins seeking a parchment that can save his lords life. In the fourth a person finds himself in competition to mentally project imaginative images on a screen. In the final scene our main character is captured and tortured by his enemy. It is unclear how these vignettes are related until toward the end of the story where it all comes together. I rated it a 2: \"Okay\"Noise\"Noise\" was published initially in 1952 by Startling Stories magazine. It is a 13 page short story. A man crash lands on a distant planet and begins sending out distress signals, hoping to get rescued. He gradually begins to see and hear strange seductive things and is not sure if his senses have become more responsive or if he is hallucinating. It is a bizarre and interesting story which I rated as a 3. Sail 25 Gateway\"Sail 25\" is a 29 page novelette that was first published in 1962 in the magazine Amazing Stories. It has also been known as \"Gateway to Strangers\" and \"Dust of Far Suns.\" Henry Bent is an irritable, unpleasant, overly sensitive, dictatorial character who seems to be \"a man of a different species.\" He teaches pilots to operate spaceships, in this instance it is one that has a huge sail (thus the title \"Sail 25\"). Bent tells his cadet crew that he does not expect to be liked and that if they do like him then he has failed because, \"I haven't pushed you hard enough.\" All pilots know Bent and respect his skills, but they also invariably dislike him. He has trained almost every well known pilot and is about to train a new crew. During the training flight when Bent is not drunk or hiding from the others, he is sneaking around the ship, spying on the cadets, keeping track of their behavior by making comments in his notebooks where he records demerits. These demerits will determine who passes and who gets axed from the program. Bent also says that he is retiring, that this will be his last flight and hints that he wants to die in space. Is he suicidal? Has he become an incompetent drunk? Or is this the finest training the cadets will ever receive? Each member of his crew reacts differently to Bent's behavior and the challenges of the training. It is all done with humor with a memorable character who is as difficult as any boot camp sergeant. My rating: 3.5The Secret\"The Secret\" is a ten page short story that was first published in 1966 in the British magazine \"Impulse,\" otherwise known as \"Science Fantasy\" and \"SF Impulse.\" It is pure fantasy rather than science fiction and takes place on an island that could be somewhere in Polynesia. It is inhabited by all younger people. As islanders grow older they are tempted to find out the \"secret\" by taking a solo voyage to the west. The secret is completely mysterious because nobody has ever returned to the island once they have left. Our main character, Rona ta Inga, is the oldest on the island. Many of the others have formed a group and pledged to never leave their little paradise of an island and ask him to join in the pledge. Rona, however, begins making a boat. What does he find and what is the secret? I rated this a 3.5."}, {"userName": "Charles", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1300518-charles", "userReview": "That's it. I made it to 90%, started the last story, can't read another word. I found Vance's use of archaic language annoying, and his pseudo-archaic or made-up fantastical words irritating. I want to know what the words that I read mean. I am happy to use a dictionary. When a writer uses words that aren't in the dictionary, I'd prefer that he provide some context clues for the words--which I suppose Vance does from time to time--and spare use of these neologisms for important elements of the story. What Vance does is drop neologisms and purple prose in service of setting and atmosphere. And for many of these stories, a disproportionate percent of the text is setting and atmosphere. The characters are profuse and often flat. I didn't get a sense of who many of them were, and I rarely cared for or about any of them. Maybe I was born too late for Vance. I do see how he's idiosyncratic and perhaps unique. I just didn't enjoy reading at least three-quarters of this collection. A few stories such as \"Noise\", \"Sail\", and \"The Moon Moth\" redeem it, but that's pretty slim pickins for a book of this size."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309661-john", "userReview": "Lots of my old faves in this collection: LAST CASTLE, several Cugels, a Magnus Ridolf, DRAGON MASTERS...but too much crap, particularly \"The Mitr,\" which is a lowlight about an innocent castaway being raped by passing thugs, the venturesome but unreadable \"Men Return,\" in which Earth passes into and then out of a zone of non-causality, and most of the afterwords, which are so allusive as to be free of actual insight.But at his best Vance could combine good action with wonderfully erudite mannerist prose, and I think he was also one of the funniest writers in SF:\"I will gladly perform a more comprehensive divination, though the process requires six to eight hours.\" \"So long?\" asked Cugel in astonishment. \"This is the barest minimum. First you are swathed head to foot in the intestines of fresh-killed owls, then immersed in a warm bath containing a number of secret organic substances. I must, of course, char the small toe of your left foot, and dilate your nose sufficiently to admit an explorer beetle, that he may study the conduits leading to and from your sensorium.

One problem: Six Dying Earth stories. Three of them Cugel. These are the most well known of Vance's work and the easiest to find in print. If you already own the complete Dying Earth collection, you may want to pass on this one and find the other half of this book elsewhere. The mini autobiography at the end is pretty neat though so if you are a real Vance fanatic, you will probably want to pick up this volume just for that.Each story has an afterward written by Jack Vance which more often than not has little or nothing to do with the preceding story, so throughout this book does show what is going on in Jack's head, or at least what he wants to show.Overall, highly recommended and a good gift for any speculative fictions fans who don't know Vance yet."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2683207-jeffrey", "userReview": "Jack Vance is an interesting author. He does a fantastic job of creating these rich worlds of weird nonsense without spending pages and pages on backstory. Vance simply makes up a term or technology if he needs one like a self-aware star trek episode. The stories range from obvious moral parables to strange ramblings on chaos and order.

The true gems of this Treasury, such as The Dragon Masters, The Miracle Workers, and The Last Castle perfectly display Vance's genius for effortlessly assembling an expansive cast of three dimensional, memorable characters and creating a setting both fascinatingly alien and utterly believable. Theses stories also display Vance's virtuoso talent for melding familiar tropes from fantasy and science fiction genres into a seamless whole far better and more wondrous than either were apart. A talent also on full display in the Dying Earth tales, some of which are contained in this collection including highlights from the saga of Cugel the Clever, a ceaselessly entertaining, amoral gem of a character.Even the singular clunker in this collection, The Gift of Gab, an early story where Vance's usual character and verve are swapped for technical problems of the hard sci-fi variety and journalistic description, is a better than average story by virtue of it's fully fleshed out world. A world where Vance manages to paint a believable ecosystem including an alien society working of an inhuman system of intelligence and an interstellar bureaucracy capable of exploiting that ecosystem. All that is set up effortlessly with almost no exposition inside a rather short and for the most part engaging story.Finishing the collection is an autobiographical sketch which reveals Vance's life to be as remarkable a story as anything he wrote. A life that included traveling the country performing odd jobs before studying physics at Berkeley, getting into the merchant marines despite poor eyesight by memorizing the eye chart, and building a houseboat with Frank Herbert. Perhaps it is a small wonder that his stories so crackle with life, given that he lived his so fully."}, {"userName": "Fantasy Literature", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8491232-fantasy-literature", "userReview": "While I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one novel or short story or even collection of Jack Vance\u2018s work that comes close to capturing all the best aspects of his writing, I do think that this 633-page Subterranean Press collection does a fairly good job of exposing the reader to a wide array of Vance\u2019s oeuvre. In addition to eighteen stories that span much of Vance\u2019s writing career, there\u2019s a brief comment from Vance himself after each story that gives a little view into how his mind worked while in creative mode, as well as some of the authors and factors that had a major impact on him in developing his writing (note to self after reading one of his comments: re-read P.

Sail 25 is a low-tech sci-fi boom about a terrible space ship master and his fresh out of college crew.Then there is some magical, fantasy rubbish where Vance seems to constantly use 'deus ex machina' techniques to write his hero out of a corner. The 3 Cugel stories are dreck, with a cipher for a hero, outlandish but unexamined situations, and no conclusions.I've enjoyed some of his books in the past, and will stick to his science fiction books, where he takes the tropes and creates a series of interesting worlds with oddities around them, and crafts stories which express those worlds. I will leave his fantasy far behind.I did find one quote interesting, from the Author. \"The less a writer discusses his work\u2014and himself\u2014the better. The master chef slaughters no chickens in the dining room; the doctor writes prescriptions in Latin; the magician hides his hinges, mirrors, and trapdoors with the utmost care.\" --- this was after 'A Bagful of Dreams' one of the terrible Cugel stories in the treasury."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201961-jason", "userReview": "This was the first book that I've ever read by Vance.
