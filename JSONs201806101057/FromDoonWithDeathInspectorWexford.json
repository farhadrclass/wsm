Terence HardimanTotal Runtime......... 5 Hours 28 MinsDescription: Margaret Parsons is dead. She appeared to lead a very dull life. She had been a \"good\" woman. Religious, old-fashioned, and respectable, her life had been as spotless and ordinary as her home, as unexciting and dependable as her marriage. However, it was not because of her life that Chief Inspector Wexford became involved, but her death. How is it possible that a woman who had led such a quiet, respectable, unspectacular life could have met such a death of passion and violence? To Wexford, it simply does not make sense, until he begins to slowly uncover the layers of Margaret Parsons' real life... Okay mystery, but the writing is wonderful. Looks like I will enjoy this series."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary", "userReview": "This is the 1st book in the Inspector Wexford series by author Ruth Rendell. A good read that is written in an old fashioned style that introduces the main characters and sets up the series.In this opening mystery Inspector Wexford investigates the disappearance of Margaret Parsons, a housewife who goes missing and is later found dead in the nearby woods. Margaret Parsons appears to have no enemies and seems to live a quiet life with very little excitement. So the mystery is who has killed her and why? There is very little for Wexford to go on but for a discarded match and an inscription on some of Margaret's books signed 'Doon'. But who is 'Doon'.I am pretty sure there are better books to come in this series but this is a reasonable start."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10501026-c", "userReview": "It must have taken fifteen years to obtain the series volume I needed and get started. I want to enjoy a lauded authoress and have the jury out for Ruth Rendell / Barbara Vine. However, it is not the names that I grade. \u201cFrom Doon With Death\u201d, 1964, was dry. I hear her solo stories and other Reginald Wexford / Mike Burden cases are better; a good thing, because I own nearly them all, courtesy of bargain bins! Higher marks for higher enjoyment will mean something.I initially gave three stars, for an aspect I don't recall. Two stars make sense. Reginald was an asshole! That compounded with how much I hate things allegedly stated \u201cquietly\u201d! If you are annoyed by a colleague or subordinate, like the uniquely likeable Mike: a human being raises their voice somewhat, or at least expresses themselves emphatically. This \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201ccalm\u201d idea is crap: as robotic as it is irritating! That presents no memorable personality and in this case, I was glad Reginald was not in the story until later; that Mike is an equal protagonist. Reginald was rude to Mike. He was very harsh, merely at Mike's posing of a question, or making a suggestion!The other downer is that no one else was likeable and a drabness pervaded. I surmise Ruth intentionally conveyed a depressed husband and household but that persisted too long, before the appearance of a clue brought any action at all. Finally, books belonging to that lady are inscribed with the titular name and we strive to suss out who that is. Tracking a lipstick tube was the only other clue picking-up a boring novel. The sole other interesting facet was how perplexing it was that this lady was killed. I will try Ruth's first solo novel next time."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "Update, May 6, 2015: I am undertaking a Ruth Rendell \"key\" works project -- the books The Guardian recently noted as such the day of Ruth Rendell's death. From Doon With Death is the first of these . I've just reread this novel again after six years, and while I wouldn't change my rating, I will say that it was definitely a pleasure to have taken it up again. This time through I've noticed much more than I did the first time -- back then I think I was looking much more for plot and storyline, where now I'm tending to focus more on people and what makes them do what they do. This book definitely meets my requirements. -- returning to original review now, but I still recommend this novel - it's much better the second time through. --There's a short section in the back of the edition of this book that I own which notes that Rendell did not follow along the Agatha Christie line and write mysteries based on characters of the upper class. Indeed, From Doon With Death, the first Wexford novel, focuses on the mystery of the death of a somewhat rather dowdy housewife who goes missing and then turns up dead. Margaret Parsons is the flip side of extraordinary; no enemies, lives in somewhat of a rut, and has no sordid qualities about her whatsoever. So why would anyone want this woman dead? Wexford has only a few clues: a spent match on the ground, and inscriptions in some of Margaret's books that are signed \"Doon.\" But there's no clue as to Doon's identity, so Wexford is baffled.For a series opener, it's a bit typical. What I mean is that having read other Inspector Wexford books, I know that the author takes time to more fully develop Wexford's character as the series progresses. Also, as a side note, don't forget that this book was written in 1964 and thus attitudes are a bit dated. Overall though, I love Ruth Rendell's work, and I'm very happy to have read this one.I'd recommend it to readers who enjoy a good British mystery with solid plotting."}, {"userName": "Susan Albert", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967151-susan-albert", "userReview": "My reread of the first of the Wexford series was different than my first time through the book. Back then, in the early 1990s, I was a novice mystery writer eager to learn from a master. Now, I've written quite a few mysteries myself and I know what to look for. I read, now, for deeper glimpses into Rendell's craft, and I'm not disappointed. There's an art to writing a police procedural that is also a village mystery, and Rendell is the consummate artist. Her characters--even the good-guy cops--are conflicted, flawed, stubborn, and utterly human, and her genre fiction is the best of its kind.

For some reason I had never read the Wexford novels before and it is a good beginning to the series. The story begins when Inspector Mike Burdon is alerted by a neighbour that his wife is missing. Ronald Parsons almost prides himself on his dull and respectable life. He claims it is totally out of character for his wife, Margaret, to disappear without word. Burdon tends to agree and contacts the police station. When Margaret is found murdered, it is up to Wexford and Burdon to unravel Margaret's past and discover what led to the death of a quiet, suburban housewife.Although this book does feel a little dated, that adds to the charm. Although Ruth Rendell does use certain stereotypes, it is clear that she has laid down a great basis for further books - Wexford is plain talking, intelligent and not easily swayed by a pretty face; Burdon a great sidekick and the small town of Kingsmarkham well described. Unusually, Rendell does not make any of the characters particularly sympathetic and that adds to the reality of the crime and suspects. There is also a great twist and sharp plotting, which bodes well and makes me want to read on.The next book in the series is A New Lease Of Death: (A Wexford Case). However, I do agree strongly with other reviewers that this kindle book had a large number of typos, which is very disappointing. I am sure that a proof reader could have easily rectified the mistakes and, although I expect to see them in a self published book, it is unacceptable to find so many in a traditionally published ebook. However, the story itself was good and I am looking forward to reading more."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "I've seen other reviews that say From Doon With Death is the least of Ruth Rendell's books. That's the good thing, because it's an unfair book. It hides information from the reader, and this information is vital to the solution of the case. It is not a case of intuition, it is the answer to the mystery in so many words, in a conversation between the detective and another party, to which the reader is not privy to. And yet, it is fairly easy to guess who the murderer is (although, it probably wasn't the case when it was first published). To be fair, it has a few things going for it. There is the open-minded attitude Inspector Wexford has towards people who are different from the majority. It is not a picture perfect little town, but is grimy and seedy. The people are not at all charming, and are often more than a little annoying. Also, there is no Hastings or Watson to romanticize the proceedings, and given how much I hate both characters, I'm adding a star just for that. However, it is clearly a first book. I know nothing much about Inspector Wexford or Mike Burden (who actually does decent work and doesn't go around contradicting or second-guessing his boss), just that they are the law. But the worst for me was the concealment of information, I don't like that at all.

I generally feel that when I've read three or more books featuring one character I enjoy each successive book a little bit more. That is an unnecessarily complicated way of saying that I'll try a couple more books by Rendell to see if they become \"must reads.\"Wexford brings a somewhat cold, calm, matter-of-factness to the investigation and that prohibited me from bonding with his character in any way.

However, no one would accuse a career as prolific as Rendell's as lazy and there is something very appealing about her work. I think this book was a terrific example of it. Seemingly a classic British murder mystery, much like Christie, whom Rendell apparently disliked and strived to get away from comparisons to, and yet in retrospect very different. Rendell's England is less than quaint (despite the amounts of tea put away), her world is distinctly darker and its denizens are distinctly more immoral. There is a strong sociological commentary throughout, in this book in particular as far as class differences and sexual politics go and author's attitude is stunningly, notably progressive for the time. Wexford doesn't really make a strong impression as a leading character (in fact quite a good amount of the investigating falls to his partner, the aptly named Inspector Burden), but he shows much potential, intellectual and emotional astuteness and solid detecting skills. And so, for a non quaint, psychological mystery that relies on neither sex nor violence, this is a very good read.

Her Inspector Wexford is an important mention in the canon of detective fiction. Perhaps what is the most impressive about Ruth Rendell is her exemplary consistency. She has written volumes and volumes of mysteries, but rarely has her standards fallen \u2014 one can pick up an Inspector Wexford novel, and be fairly certain of a jolly good ride. And she was not repetitive either \u2014 she wrote under the pseudonym Barbara Vine for psychological crime novels, a marked difference from the Inspector Wexford whodunits, and those are rather good too.Since our recommendation From \u2018Doon With Death\u2019 is the first in the series, it would be remiss not to give an introduction to Inspector Wexford. Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford is a middle-aged country policeman. He has a temper, and is not a man to suffer fools lightly. He is a large, ungainly man; grumpy and somewhat curmudgeonly. Just an ordinary policeman, with a stay-at-home wife and two daughters. An ordinary man, doing a job. The standardfare bumbling country policeman? Not quite. Wexford in extremely well-read, he has got a rapier-sharp intellect, is meticulous in his attention to detail, and most importantly, is remarkably persistent.From \u2018Doon With Death\u2019 starts with the murder of Margaret Parsons, a somewhat frumpy, timid woman from Kingsmarkham. She was the epitome of nondescript: conventional, religious, homely and pretty much devoted to her husband, her garden and her church. Her life was an open book, and truth to be said, not a particularly interesting one. The first question the reader will have to deal with is \u2014 Who would ever want to murder her? But murdered she is: strangled to death, her body abandoned.As the Inspector investigates the case further, a secret from Margaret Parson\u2019s past life tumbles to life. There\u2019s a stash of books in her library, all of which have passionate notes of love inscribed in them by a former lover, only identified as Doon. Who is Doon? The resolution to the crime hinges on that question, and Inspector Wexford goes about to get to the end of it.From \u2018Doon With Death\u2019 might not be as startling for today\u2019s reader as it might have been for ones who read it in 1964, the year the novel was released, but it is still a mighty fine yarn. It\u2019s a very satisfying detective novel, standalone, and a fine start to an important detective series.First published at The New Indian Express."}, {"userName": "Alexander Inglis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4150876-alexander-inglis", "userReview": "This year Chief Inspector Reg Wexford celebrated his 23rd novel (The Vault), if one may put it that way for a fictional character; and he was \"born\" in Ruth Rendell's 1964 published From Doon With Death. It was also, more remarkably, Rendell's first novel which emerged full shaped, well plotted, with believable (and memorable) characters.Margaret Parsons is the rather non-descript wife of a rather non-descript employee of a small English town hardware store who is barely able to make ends meet. But when she doesn't come home one afternoon, her husband asked Mike Burden, a neighbour, for help: Burden is Chief Inspector Reg Wexford's right-hand man. It's not long before fear turns to grief as Margaret's body turns up in a nearby wood, quite dead. As the investigation progresses, the facts of her final hours are peeled back, onion skin like, and as other local residents come within the orbit of the investigation, new clues emerge pointing to teenage love affairs re-ignited. Particularly mysterious, is Doon who authoured several frankly amorous inscriptions in the flyleaves of Margaret's packed away books of poetry. Now Doon appears to have re-entered her life ... with love to be rekindled or vengeance?Although police procedurals are commonplace today, this early outing snaps along at a goodly pace, without unnecessarily forensic details or gore to bog down the storyline. I admit I had a pretty strong clue who the killer might be by about the book's mid-point, it in no way interfered with the pleasure of the working out and final revelations.

It is a little weak in plot, and, typical of first novels, full of too many characters, but the underlying talent of the author is apparent. It addresses a principal social concern in addition to telling a complex story of murder and passion. Rendell\u2019s books \u2013 at least those involving Inspector Wexford \u2013 always manage to revolve around some social issue. I can\u2019t say what this one is without giving away the ending of the novel, but it will come as a partial surprise when you reach it. We soon learn that Wexford was born full-blown from the author\u2019s mind. When we first meet him, Rendell lets us know that he is fifty-two years old. He is also teamed up with Inspector Burden, his faithful ally in subsequent novels, and he works out of the central station in the small town of Kingsmarkham, a town that, for its size, seems to spawn most every kind of murder and mayhem that you might expect from a London.

This was a rather slow-paced police procedural, in which Wexford and his sidekick, Burden, investigate the murder of a young married woman who was found strangled in the local woods after being reported missing by her distraught husband. Was she meeting a lover? Perhaps someone from her past?

From Doon with Death, now in a striking new paperback edition, is her classic debut novel -- and the book that introduced one of the most popular sleuths of the twentieth century.There is nothing extraordinary about Margaret Parsons, a timid housewife in the quiet town of Kingsmarkham, a woman devoted to her garden, her kitchen, her husband. Except that Margaret Parsons is dead, brutally strangled, her body abandoned in the nearby woods. Who would kill someone with nothing to hide? Inspector Wexford, the formidable chief of police, feels baffled -- until he discovers Margaret's dark secret: a trove of rare books, each volume breathlessly inscribed by a passionate lover identified only as Doon. As Wexford delves deeper into both Mrs. Parsons\u2019 past and the wary community circling round her memory like wolves, the case builds with\u00a0relentless momentum to a surprise finale as clever as it is blindsiding. In From Doon with Death, Ruth Rendell instantly mastered the form that would become synonymous with her name. Chilling, richly characterized, and ingeniously constructed, this is psychological suspense at its very finest.\u201cOne of the most remarkable novelists of her generation.\u201d \u2014People\u201cShe has transcended her genre by her remarkable imaginative power to explore and illuminate the dark corners of the human psyche.\u201d \u2014P.D.
