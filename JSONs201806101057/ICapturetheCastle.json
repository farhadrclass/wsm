I mean that the novel, both through format (a very self-aware narrator's journal) and authorial intent (with a firm eye on the sort of story-telling pedigree that brought her there), anticipated my readerly needs and desires with such swiftness that I felt agreeably anticipatory and satisfied at all times. I did not have to tell myself to be patient to wait for one plot line to play out, because the book helpfully plied me with a pleasant drink while I waited. I did not feel done after it had given me a good meal, because right before the last course, it promised dessert. The summary is accurate and pointless. It is about Cassandra writing about herself in a journal. Their family is penniless. They do live in a castle. She is, as it promises, deeply, hopelessly in love. But not with any of the men in the book. They're all intriguing in their own way, don't get me wrong, and she does love many of them, in many different ways. The novel takes place in one of my favorite intellectual time periods to read and study, and this book plays across all of its nuances: artists' models and intellectuals, servants' quarters and vicars, romanticism and mysticism, the religion of church and the religion of a well-turned-out drawing room. But all of that is sort of beyond the point. The point is that Cassandra is deeply, hopelessly in love with life, and her utter, wry engagement with the castle she adores is what pulled me through the pages. Her voice is kind and self-deprecating, generous and wondering. The humans she observes \u2014 Topaz, her often-nude step-mother; Rose, her selfish and hungry sister; Mortmain, her once-famous father \u2014 are all seen through this well-meaning gaze, and even terrible events are colored with love (even when I thought characters could do with a polite punch in the mouth).This book took very good care of me. It goes onto my comfortable re-read shelf immediately."}, {"userName": "Martine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine", "userReview": "This is going to be the shortest review I've written on this site in a while. The reason I'm going to keep it short is because no description could possibly do justice to this quintessentially English coming-of-age story which ranks among the most pleasant surprises I've had, book-wise. A summary would make it sound slight, trite and predictable, all of which it is, and would not reflect the fact that it's also funny as hell, charismatic, deliciously eccentric, Austenesque and so utterly charming that I quite literally had sore cheeks after reading it because I couldn't stop smiling at the delightful nonsense the incomparable Cassandra Mortmain spilled out on the pages. I'm not exaggerating here -- this book will charm the pants off you, especially if you happen to have two X chromosomes and a bad case of Anglophilia. It's what would happen if an early-twentieth-century Jane Austen were to grow up in a dilapidated castle and get into financial trouble, and that's all I'm going say about it, except that I want to be Cassandra Mortmain when I grow down. Only I think I'll write my book on a computer rather than sitting in the kitchen sink, because it would be so much more comfortable, thank you very much."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "My name is Cassandra Mortmain, I know it sounds made up but it\u2019s true. I\u2019m 17 and bright as a button and never been kissed because it\u2019s the 1930s. My family are effortlessly bohemian, we all live in a crumbling castle \u2013 oh yes, quite literally! \u2013 and we have no money at all and we have only barely heard of the twentieth century. How poor we are since father stopped earning any money. He used to be a genius but now he does crosswords. We eat the occasional potato and scrape plaster off the walls for pudding. We have thought of cooking one of our dogs but that would not do. Also, something you should be aware of, although you will find out pretty soon I believe, is that I suffer from acute logorrhoea, which is a debilitating condition that impels its victim to write a never-ending journal into which is debouched every last possible banal but extremely charming detail of one\u2019s life and that of one\u2019s immediate family, which is, the pulchritudinous Rose, my 21 year old sister, my doughty schoolboy brother, my poor damaged papa who wrote one brilliant book once but has since sunk into a kind of bewilderment, and his nude model youngish wife, the unusual lute-playing nature-communing Topaz whom we love immoderately in spite of her frank farfetchedness, along with various cats and dogs with classically-derived names and a servant boy called Stephen who gauchely is in love with my 17 year old preciousness and whom we do not pay but who contrives to be preternaturally handsome and work for us for free. Anyone might think I have made all this up out of my own coquettish head!  We may live in a literal castle but we haven\u2019t got the price of a loaf of bread. It\u2019s enough to make a cat laugh. Our situation is so wry that fairly broad comedy oozes from its very pores. Rose said only last night that she was quite up to walking the streets to earn a crust if she thought it would do any good, but the quaint rural byways of the Suffolk countryside don\u2019t possess the required type of street. So here I am, as usual, sitting on something odd, it could be a turret, or a tuffet or a large mammal, carefully noting down in my journal everything I hear and see along with the weather at the time and the precise location of the several animals we own, what I am wearing and what my immediate family are wearing, with various passing references to the utter beauty of the crumbling literal castle that we all inhabit over which the moon sheds its downy light and lambent whatnots.Four months later Something has actually happened! Yes, new owners of the mansion have taken possession \u2013 new neighbours! And it\u2019s just like a fairytale, for they are none other than two handsome American bachelors, with whom I and my sister will fall in love, and they with ourselves, naturellement. But not before many pages of microscopic examination of every trifling occurrence so that a single evening in their company will take 30 pages for me to detail and the sisterly debate about it another ten. And certainly not before much gentle yet sharply observed observations on the romantic yearnings of two beautiful yet penniless girls who get the brothers the wrong way round at first. Now, let me explain how I first met the American brothers. I was in the bath and I had been dying clothes that day, so my entire body was coloured a violent sea-green, and they wandered into the crumbling castle thinking no one could possibly live there. Imagine the scene!

Dodie Smith is the author of The 101 Dalmatians (the original basis for the Disney movie, and the only reason I was familiar with her name), which I read many years ago and really enjoyed.This 1948 novel is a coming of age tale about an intelligent 17 year old girl, Cassandra Mortmain, who lives in semi-genteel but crushing poverty in mid-1930s England, in a dilapidated castle. Cassandra has ambitions of becoming an author like her father. Her story is told in the form of her journal entries, as she practices her writing skills to try to learn to \u201ccapture\u201d the castle, as well as the people in her life, in her writing.Cassandra skillfully describes her father\u2019s distance and failure to do anything to provide for the family, her stepmother\u2019s charm and eccentricity, and her older sister Rose\u2019s despair at their isolation and poverty. But what broke my heart was her matter-of-fact descriptions of how their poverty affects their lives every day: the too-small, worn-out clothing the girls have to wear; her gratitude for having eggs along with bread and margarine for their evening meal; the way the girls trade off sleeping in the one comfortable bed in their room (which hasn\u2019t been sold only because it\u2019s in such bad shape). Rose, the more beautiful sister, is grimly determined to escape from poverty, even if she has to marry a man she doesn't love. When two young American brothers move into town (the older son, Simon, is the family\u2019s new and wealthy landlord), the Mortmains\u2019 lives are all turned topsy-turvy, with love, romance and secrets.Cassandra\u2019s insights into own and others\u2019 personalities and motivations are sharp and witty, and occasionally even a little prophetic; I think the symbolism of her name from Greek mythology is deliberate, although she misses at least one major secret that a member of her own family is hiding. The characters are believable and human, sometimes frustratingly so with their flaws. I particularly wanted to smack Cassandra's father upside the head: he's a well-known author with one famous book to his credit, but for the last ten years he's been struggling with a massive case of writer's block, hiding away in his home office reading detective novels and working on crosswords, while his family sells the furniture to survive. I thought there were just a few missteps in the story: the chain of unrequited love interests was pushing the boundaries of believability (woman wants boy, who loves girl, who loves another guy, who loves another girl, who loves\u2026). I guessed one big reveal at the end fairly early in the story. Cassandra spends a chapter or two examining her views on religion and talking to the local vicar, and then never mentions it again, which made me wonder why it was included in the first place.But these are minor flaws. Cassandra is an enchanting character and a fantastic narrator, surrounded by some unforgettable characters. This is a lovely, bittersweet novel that doesn't go for the easy resolution."}, {"userName": "Alyson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/850662-alyson", "userReview": "i found this book to alternate between delightful and infuriating.here is the delightful:\u00a0\u00a0-images of the english countryside and the crumbling, fantastic castle-cassandra's optimism and intelligence (pre-simon)-perfect descriptions of peaceful, contemplative momentsand here is the infuriating:-cassandra's father. a supposed genius but in reality a sexist, abusive, loathsome, distant fellow. he appears sporadically to ignore his children, leave his wife lonely, make everyone question his sanity and demand his supper from the ladies of the house. the frustrating part of this character is that his terrible behavior is overlooked and often glorified when he should be taken to task. i spent a good part of this book longing for someone to throw him into the moat. -cassandra's personality meltdown after \"falling in love\". the optimistic, intelligent, loving, happy girl turns at once into a mean-spirited, self centered fool. she begins to hate her sister and engage in other sorts of petty, miserable behavior. not only is her change of heart unbelievable in how quickly and totally she becomes a different (mean, angry, self-centered) person, but\u00a0\u00a0somehow the author seems to insinuate that this very change of heart (for the worst!) is in itself the act of growing up. what a sad commentary on aging cassandra's behavior is!the back of the book declares, \"by the time she (cassandra) pens her final entry, she has captured the castle. . .\"i do not believe that cassandra \"captures the castle\" by the end of this book. i think she loses the castle. she has lost her optimism and her ability to write without a certain bitterness. her words are tainted by her own anger/sadness/jealousy about her troublesome \"love\". i feel that capturing the castle would have meant cassandra maintaining\u00a0\u00a0her original good nature, selflessness and happiness despite her failure in love. it would have been rectifying (in person) her horrid behavior towards her sister and most certainly standing up to her father."}, {"userName": "Melissa Rudder", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/824216-melissa-rudder", "userReview": "Dodie Smith's I Capture the Castle is a charming and surprising read. I was enchanted by the first paragraph, but never did I imagine that it would be the sort of book that left me speechless at the end--in awe and contemplative and wanting to read more but knowing that anything else I picked up just wouldn't feel right.The narrator, who is consciously attempting to \"capture\" in her journal her family's eccentric and impoverished life in their unfurnished, deteriorating castle home, is simply enchanting. The book is very much about writing--the seventeen-year-old protagonist Cassandra aspires to be a writer and her strange father rose to fame through the art--and Smith weaves a tale full of wit and charm. As I read, I was struck by the tension between my desire to read quickly to watch the story unfold and my desire to savor each delightful description and thoughtful reflection.The novel took me completely by surprise when it shifted tone near its middle. I realize now that the early parts of the novel were the records of a carefree and intelligent child and that, in the later parts, the child must begin to grow up. I, as a reader, felt the burden of her maturing outlook. It felt like a nineteenth-century Romance was smacked upside the head with Modernist Realism. And I think Smith was going for that. She warned me partway through. (I didn't want to listen.) The early parts of the book were sprinkled with allusions to Austen and the Bronte sisters while the latter half was more preoccupied with Cassandra's father's clearly Modernist work. There was more rural country in the beginning and more city life at the end. Even a shift in discussion of art, from Topaz's paintings and lute to Stephen's photographs and films. So I guess it had to have a more realistic end. Though Austen wouldn't have ended the book the way I'd have liked it to end anyway--Robert Martin may be suitable for Harriet Smith, but even the best of his class wouldn't have been acceptable for Emma. And perhaps even Emma could not have been taught to deserve one such as he.I still can't sum up this book. Except that I think that I loved it.Quotes:\"Contemplation seems to be about the only luxury that costs nothing.\"\"When I read a book, I put in all the imagination I can, so that it is almost like writing the book as well as reading it--or rather, it is like living it.\" \"My imagination longs to dash ahead and plan developments; but I have noticed that when things happen in one's imaginings, they never happen in one's life, so I am curbing myself.\"\"Noble deeds and hot baths are the best cures for depression.\"\"I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them.\"\"The originators among writers--perhaps, in a sense, the only true creators--dip deep and bring up one perfect work; complete, not a link in a chain.\"\"It was like the difference between the beautiful old Godsend graves and the new ones open to receive coffins... that time takes the ugliness and horror out of death and turns it into beauty.\"On Religion: \"I think it is an art, the greatest one; and extension of the communion all the other arts attempt.\"On the word God: \"It's merely shorthand for where we come from, where we're going, and what it's all about.\"\"Sacrifice is the secret--you have to sacrifice things for art and it's the same with religions; and then the sacrifice turns out to be a gain.\"\"You lose yourself in something beyond yourself and it's a lovely rest.\""}, {"userName": "Carol  \ua9c1\ua9c2 ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol", "userReview": "This novel was darn near perfect.Cassandra & her family inhabit a castle in conditions of extreme poverty.

When I first started reading I was bored and feared that the poverty of the characters would become dirty and depressing for its own sake, as in Angela's Ashes. Instead, it's more like a lovely BBC movie where people are always chewing with their mouth open, but somehow it is only charming. At first I resisted liking anything about it, including Cassandra's repeated use of the word \"capture\", but now I find myself thinking about how to describe this or that and involuntarily using the word \"capture\" in my thoughts. The story is at times screwball and at times elegant but always delightful and completely won me over.Perhaps part of the reason I resisted this book is that I came to it thinking it would be romance (because of the movie poster cover of the book, which says something like, \"A well-loved classic that has become the most romantic movie of the year\" - hate those movie poster covers), but it is actually, more than anything, a coming of age story. I say this because I think that whether you prefer coming-of-age or romance, it helps to know what you're getting into when you start a book. In my experience, romantic novels solve the problems of life by bringing characters together in true love. I Capture the Castle is written through Cassandra's eyes, so it does not rely on romantic satisfaction to tell the story, as, perhaps, it would have if it were told by another character in the same book. Rather, like any good coming of age story, develops through revelations of the unreliability of people around Cassandra and her discovery her own independence and capabilities.I must confess that what first hooked me on this book was Simon's beard. I have said that I am a sucker for a good fish story, and it turns out that I think I am a sucker for a good beard story, too. I thought the girls' fascination and horror over his beard were both hilarious and correct. I wonder why I don't see beards in stories more often. Really, when anyone I have known has a beard, it comes up in conversation almost any time the person is mentioned - and rightly so. I once asked a friend of mine, who had a bushy beard before he met his fiance, why he would have chosen to grow it out like that. He said that the reason any man who can grow a big bushy beard should is that the bigger your beard, the more authority you have over people in general and specifically over other men. He said there is something almost magical about having a big bushy beard that makes other people have to do whatever you want. I told him that was absolutely silly. Then, about a week later I was at the grocery store deciding which line to go through, and one of the checkers, who was otherwise very ordinary looking, had an enormous, bushy beard. I instinctively went to his line, and then a second later was shocked to realized that I had only done that because of the beard. I don't know if that proves my friend's point, but it has to mean something. I wonder if the castle girls weren't experiencing something like this beard-hypnosis in the beginning of the novel.To go ahead and beat this beard point to death: I also thought it was lovely how Dodie Smith developed the beard's story. I always see authors showing the physical changes love supposedly brings to women, but not men. The women are pale and thin until they fall in love, when suddenly they become healthy looking. In I Capture the Castle Simon looks suspiciously like Satan, until he falls in love and shaves the beard. Brilliant! Also, it has the self-serving overtones of Elizabeth Bennet's visit to Pemberly in Pride and Prejudice, when the mansion shows Mr. Darcy's manners in a different light. Beardless Simon makes even his actions when bearded much less sinister. Love it.You may not believe me, if you have read this far, when I say that Simon's beard was not what was personally meaningful to me about this story. Not surprisingly, I think it was Cassandra herself who seemed so profound. In many ways I did not identify with her, but I loved her. I found myself crying at times, not necessarily because her growing pains revealed my own, but only in sympathy for this new friend I found, who I love so much. I loved how wise and kind and scrappy she was. I actually loved every character in this novel, though, as they all had some kind of magical and hilarious individuality. It is tempting to copy some of the most beautiful moments here, but instead I think you should just read the book. On the one hand, I am sad that I did not read this in high school, when I think it may have been a more cathartic experience, but I wonder if its honesty might have hurt my feelings then. As it is, I found it both refreshing and comforting."}, {"userName": "April (Aprilius Maximus)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus", "userReview": "I was expecting to absolutely adore this and am so sad that I hated it :( This was honestly just SO boring and unnecessarily long and I didn't care for any of the characters.

Not being a Modern Classics person but loving Cold Comfort Farm I had the view that it would be fairly similar. It was fairly similar, but nowhere near as good: in fact, I'd say it was the same thing but written by a three-year-old like some kind of early Public School attempt at a pastiche.The story in itself is nothing particularly exciting. It is a regular family saga, with pennies missing and food scarce, selfish women who can't do any work themselves unless it involves getting naked (either modelling or for sexual intercourse reasons) and can survive only by marriage. Which LUCKILY happens, so yippee! all of which is seen and narrated through the eyes and lips of seventeen year old Cassandra.One cannot even blame the times this book was written in because, \neven though no woman has ever had a back-bone pre-2012\n, one still hopes they would at least starve to death before lowering themselves to marrying Americans, for goodness sake.The characters are all facsimiles of the lower-upper-middle class of England who probably had a bit of Old Money tucked away but spent it all on a charming castle because, well, you would, wouldn't you? The Castle was the best character of the whole piece. That thing had style and sophistication, and that's saying something considering it was half-caved in and needed blowing up with C-4, let alone new wallpaper. One would hope that at least one character would have a personality, but instead we have a mixed bunch of people who all seem to have one trait and wear it loudly. I can't even hear Celia Johnson's accent in this bunch because they all seemed to whisper a lot, even when they were apparently shouting.What more can be said? I think it was an attempt to be satirical at the posh nobs in the same way Cold Comfort Farm was, and maybe tried it's hardest to be a kind of new-wave post-Victorian classic saga of life and love but was also denouncing those flouncy writers who bloody loved the countryside too much how dare they when they lived in the Industrial Revolution and the countryside didn't even exist any more, but sadly it was nothing but utter toilet bowl water."}, {"userName": "Punk", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk", "userReview": "Young Adult Fiction. Seventeen-year-old Cassandra begins a journal in an attempt to perfectly capture her family and the run-down castle they live in. This book wasn't at all what I expected. I'm reading it for the first time as an adult, and maybe I would have felt differently about it as a kid, but now I just found it sort of upsetting, and not in a cathartic way.It's got a playful tone, yet is almost relentlessly dreary outside the narrative itself; possibly because Cassandra is too young to realize what a mess she's in. The writing is lovely and Cassandra has a wonderful voice, but I kept falling out of the story with worry. This family is so poor and hungry and cold, and it's in a time and place where it seems the only way the sisters are going to get out is through marriage. Their father is next to useless, and they've all come to depend on Stephen -- servant turned son, but remaining mostly servant -- to keep the castle up and provide their income. Cassandra does grow up during the year-long course of the novel, and the end, while somewhat overwrought with soap opera machinations, gives me hope she and her family will get through this and start taking care of each other again, but I've got a lingering uneasiness about the family dynamics. Her father shoves her against a wall and doesn't even apologize, and neither he nor Cassandra seem aware he's done anything wrong. This is not a sweet little pastoral look at the English countryside like I expected -- the \"we're poor, but it's fun!\" approach -- instead, it hides a sort of secret viciousness beneath the jovial front. Two stars. It deserves at least three, but it made me too edgy to really enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Eh?Eh!", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137273-eh-eh", "userReview": "Vacation reading continues.The story is so charming! I especially like how the main character, Cassandra, appreciated food because of her poverty. Favorites:-I shouldn't think even millionaires could eat anything nicer than new bread and real butter and honey for tea.-But I did like the restaurant; most of the people eating there were unusually ugly, but the food was splendid. We had.... We were gloriously bloat.-...ham with mustard is a meal of glory.There was a formal dinner party where Cassandra observed the oddness of gathering to eat, the servants central to the experience but not involved with conversations, the food going in and words coming out. I agree that food doesn't mix well with stiff formality. I do love how people come together over food though - meeting friends usually centers around food, my favorite gifts have been food, and nearly every party I've ever been to has ended up cramming into the kitchen at some point no matter where the host/hostness intended to contain the crowd. I've heard some people complain about kitchen-centric parties...pssh. Conversation still flows and everyone's closer to the food&drink.The charm of the story wasn't all about food. I think it was also because of the innocence of the narrator and the society described. Innocence in that it was possible to be at once delicate and matter-of-fact about adultery, jealousy, a cougar, kissing without love, confusion about love, a dress pulled down off a shoulder, but all without the salaciousness w/official veneer of prudery that is our reality now. It has the most delicately worded description of sex I'd ever read: I am not so sure I should like the facts of life, but I have got over the bitter disappointment I felt when I first heard about them, and one obviously has to try them sooner or later. Not to say innocence made things better but I wonder what it would be like to live without an implied wink or leer in certain statements. I'm misrepresenting some of these things since the book is presented as the journal entries of Cassandra.The story's charm is also in the little realizations about life and self the character has as she observes and experiences. They are the realizations of a young girl who is still very idealistic about life, unaware of some probable harsh future adjustments. This coming-of-age girl story probably wouldn't be as charming for most guys to read."}, {"userName": "Nidhi Singh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2034949-nidhi-singh", "userReview": "I don\u2019t really want to write anymore, I just want to lie here and think.

I can\u2019t get the feelings into words-it slipped away when I tried to capture it\nAs she sits in her kitchen sink writing her journal, she reminds me of myself when I was 17. I feel a wistful remembrance of my adolescent hopes, my days of wonderment. And I think of all those things I often used to think about. All those things I thought would happen; all that did not happen, all that did, and all that I never thought about. And then there is her voice, so innocent, thoughtful, and beautiful that leaves me heartbroken, bringing back to me memories like water colour paintings, of dreams that dissolved into the forgetful waters and of a future that seemed like a vision of a faraway castle shrouded by the autumn mist. Life can never be the same when you know that the mist has cleared with the passage of time. The fruits of wonderment have paid off with the seeds of maturity. And adulthood has put aside the fantasies of childhood because you have known too much, lived too much. But could I really have known Cassandra if I had never been cold and hungry like her in that cruel English winter, had never known that sometimes living in a castle alone cannot warrant a fairy tale? But perhaps if I had met her that day when she staggered out of the inn rain-drenched, with her hair dirty and her expression maudlin, I would have told her that I never thought of her as \u2018consciously na\u00efve\u2019, that I too had my long days by the window waiting for something to happen, that I had somehow found a lost part of myself through her. When she had wished to live in a Jane Austen novel, how I had often wished the same. And how hopeful I was for her when she took that train to London looking so conspicuous in her white suit, how gorgeous I thought her midsummer\u2019s eve\u2019s rites to be, how blissful indeed writing in the moonlight must have been.

No? Just look at all the comments down below -- and note all the work I had to do defending myself. It was really quite painful. So painful, in fact, that it took me something like a year or longer to actually finish the blasted book. (To be clear, I did read lots of other books in the meantime.) So, was it worth all the heartache I was subjected to on GoodReads?Well, \"I Capture the Castle\" is clearly not a book written for thirtysomething heterosexual males, and I'll be damned if I knew what first compelled me to read it. I think I must have read some loving review written somewhere when it was reissued a while back -- a loving review that probably completely mischaracterized the book -- or I never would have picked it up.Nevertheless, even though it is better suited for 15-year-old girls, it really is a well-written and charming novel told by a quite winning narrator. No, it's not the right book for me, but I did enjoy reading it, for the most part. There were a few too many parts in which Cassandra, our heroine, moons over her love interest, Simon, for pages and pages and pages. I starting throwing up in my mouth a little bit during those parts, but I just kept my head down and powered through, and came out the other side, I believe, a better man. Look, I read that brown shower of a book \"Twilight,\" so I can take almost anything. And this is a far, far, far, far better book than \"Twilight\" was -- a million times better. (Dodie Smith, unlike Stephenie Meyer, actually speaks the English language.) In fact, any 15-year-old girl who wants to read a romance suitable for age, and values her brain cells, would be well-advised to choose \"I Capture the Castle\" over \"Twilight.\"OK, sorry, didn't meant to make this yet another anti-\"Twilight\" screed. Anyway, point is, four stars for \"I Capture the Castle\" because, even though I wasn't its targeted demographic, it is well-written and charming; I'm still heterosexual even though I've used the phrase \"well-written and charming\" not once, not twice, but three times now; and all the haters can eat me.

A thoroughly dangerous girl...\"So says the vicar about Cassandra Mortmain, the semi-precocious narrator of this novel - and one has to accept that he has put his finger on the nub. Rem acu tetigisti, as Jeeves would say.Cassandra is the younger daughter of the once-famous novelist James Mortmain, and as the novel opens, we find her sitting on the draining board of the kitchen sink with her feet actually in the sink, writing her journal (which this novel is, BTW) in a cryptic speed-writing shorthand of her own invention. She is sitting there because it is the only reasonably warm room in their house, which was built in the time of Charles II and \u201cgrafted on to a fourteenth century castle that was damaged by Cromwell\u201d. The Mortmains have been living there in genteel poverty for five years as the novel opens. They have sold all their jewellery and furniture, the women have no proper wardrobe, and even day-to-day food procurement has become something of an adventure.They are a motley crew. James Mortmain, the head of the household, was once a celebrated novelist for the single avante garde novel Jacob Wrestling he had written: but a bout of bad temper had caused him to brandish a knife at his wife and knock out a neighbour who tried to intervene, earning him three months in jail. Once he came out, he has not written a single thing but spends his time reading old detective stories: hence their poverty.Rose, his elder daughter, is lovely and self-centred, and is willing to sell herself to get out of her poverty; the younger daughter Cassandra is pretty, witty and intelligent and aspires to be a novelist. Their youngest sibling Thomas is fifteen and precocious like Cassandra. Their stepmother (the girls\u2019 mother had died eight years before the story opens), who is only twety-nine and goes by the unusual name Topaz is a former artists\u2019 model who worships the ground James treads on and sometimes communes with nature by dancing on the moors stark naked. Stephen Colly, the Mortmains\u2019 maid\u2019s son who has continued to stay with them even after her mother\u2019s passing, makes himself useful about the house and is hopelessly in love with Cassandra.It is into this hopeless, bohemian world that Simon and Neil Cotton arrive. They are the inheritors of Scoatney Hall, whose owner had given Mr. Mortmain Godsend Castle on a forty-year lease. Simon Cotton, a well-read intellectual, is fascinated by England and also by James Mottmain, who is still famous in America; later on, also by Rose. Neil is American through-and\u2013through and can\u2019t wait to get out of England. When Simon falls for Rose and gets engaged to her, he is very angry as he considers her a gold-digger. To complicate matters, Cassandra also falls for Simon. And there is James, getting more eccentric every day, and practically running after Mrs. Cotton, Simon and Neil\u2019s mother, to the chagrin of Topaz. Aubrey Fox-Cotton, a distant cousin of the Cottons and a famous architect, who can\u2019t get enough of Topaz and Leda, his photographer wife who lusts after Stephen, complete the cast of characters and add spice to the plot.Here we have a potential recipe for a comedy of manners, a farce, a TV soap opera or even a Wodehouse-ian extravaganza. The narrative could have easily slid into any one of these genres and we would have had a mediocre novel. The fact that it does not happen is due to the consummate mastery of Dodie Smith over her medium, in keeping the voice of the teenage narrator so consistent and endearing throughout.For Cassandra Mortmain is truly a masterly creation. I would place her on the same pedestal on which I have put Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Scarlett O\u2019Hara (I have not read Jane Eyre, but from what I have heard, that redoubtable lady is of the same calibre). But Cassandra is not as accomplished, determined or wicked (as in the case of Ms. Sharp and Ms. O\u2019Hara) as these legendary heroines \u2013 she is very much a teenage girl, suffering all the confusions and tantrums of that difficult period of life. No, what makes Cassandra special is her candour.At one point in the novel, unaware that she is listening in, Simon wonders whether Cassandra is being \u201cconsciously naive\u201d i.e. putting it on as a show to attract people. She is incensed, and rightly so; because if there is one thing to be said for the girl, it is her perfect honesty about everything including herself! For example, you have respect a person who can say that a piece by Bach made her feel that she was being repeatedly hit on the head by a teaspoon!There are plenty of scenes worthy of Wodehouse \u2013 Topaz dancing at the foot of the castle tower at night in the buff and being taken for a ghost; Rose being chased across the country in a bearskin coat because people think that she is an escaped circus bear \u2013 but the hilarity does not slide into outright belly-laughter as with his novels. As a counterpoint, there are plenty of mellow scenes too, where the novelist relies heavily on metaphor (Rose wishing on a gargoyle and Cassandra and Simon doing the Midsummer Eve rites at the foot of the Belmonte Tower, to quote two examples). Here, we have to go beyond the written word to the story on the unwritten pages.James Mortmain\u2019s literary career is, however, the key to the novel, I feel. The reference to Jacob\u2019s Ladder in his original novel immediately points to man\u2019s connection with the infinite: as the Vicar tells Cassandra, God need not be God in the conventional sense, a bearded old man sitting up there in the clouds. God can be felt, smelt, seen, heard, tasted or simply experienced. As the novel moves to its conclusion, James has rediscovered his connection to the Godhead in him, which is literature \u2013 and Cassandra has also grown up. In discovering the key to her heart, she has learnt to put her feelings in perspective.The first part of the novel is written in a sixpenny notebook with a pencil stub. It progresses to a shilling notebook and finally to a two-guinea one, written with a pen. We started with a precocious teenager in March, at the beginning of spring: we leave the story with her standing on the threshold of womanhood as the autumn leaves start falling.Good luck, Cassandra!"}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "3.5 starsCassandra is mostly wisely honest with herself as well as being generous spirited and loving, and the combination makes for pleasant reading. There is a feast of interesting details, though the castle makes me feel cold, and some nicely sketched characters - the vicar got some good lines, and Thomas the younger brother delighted me at every appearance, reminding me of my own lil bro. I wish Leda Fox-Cotton weren't so mistreated. It's necessary to see right through Cassandra's prejudice, which is hard because she's very sympathetic. I found it funny that she loves animals so much and wishes owls were vegetarian, but eats meat herself without a shadow of a critical thought.I liked her casual explanation of England being special to her:'oh not the flag and Kipling and outposts of Empire and so on, but the country[side] and London'Quite.There is a neatly written section in which the vicar and Miss Marcy both casually encourage the stricken Cassandra to whom they are offering succour and comfort that is like water in a desert to her, to take up their own interests: religion! you might like it. helping others! you might like it. Cassandra is tempted, but then she decides that these characters are taking refuge from pain and thus from life itself in these absorbing pursuits. Cassandra even reflects that they are like children because they haven't really lived. The conclusion - that she should not throw herself into religion or good works - feels refreshing, and appropriate to the form of a novel (a medium that draws or produces the subjectivity of the subject) but... really? The only real life is one devoted to pursuing the most fully felt personal joy and suffering? Is this the only way we can imagine self actualisation? I can't accept that autonomy requires the rejection of the mortar of community. When Cassandra receives help and then pities her helpers for helping, it seems to me she affirms her class privilege even more thoroughly than her materialistic sister does when she counts her expensive new possessions.I also started my journal when I was 17.

She keeps a journal, filled with hilarious yet poignant entries about her life. But one major life event occurs between the beginning and the end of these entries - Cassandra has fallen hopelessly in love.This is a quintessentially English coming-of-age story that is the literary equivalent of rolling yourself up in a big, warm, cosy blanket. It's incredibly humorous yet heartfelt as our narrator very honestly depicts family life in their crumbling castle. When they first moved into the castle, it was meant to be maintained by the royalties made by Cassandra's novelist father. However, the reality is somewhat different. His creativity and willingness to write have dried up, and so too has the money.There's a whole range of characters to get enchanted by - Cassandra herself, her often-nude and ditzy stepmother Topaz, her selfish yet determined sister Rose, her cold father, the lovesick Stephen (who was adopted into the family yet is head-over-heels for Cassandra), and lastly, the enigmatic and curiously different Simon and Neil Cotton who come from America and turn the Mortmain family dynamics on their head. The story is predictable in some ways, yet completely surprised me in others.The juxtaposing depiction of the poverty in the Mortmain household alongside the riches and excess in the Cotton homestead is really eye-opening and pretty much forms the basis for the story. Rose no longer wants to be poor, and will do anything to remove herself from the situation in which she finds herself, namely marrying a poor man, because not only will it whisk her away, but it will also ensure the livelihood of her family. Rose isn't particularly likeable - not for me anyway - but our narrator Cassandra is the star of the show anyway. Her interpretations of her family and her own journey as she falls in love and has her heart broken are just so honest and real. She had me laughing out loud one minute and then feeling my heart hurt alongside hers in the next.I Capture the Castle is so perfectly executed. Definitely not my usual type of read these days, but too much horror and true crime can become pretty monotonous quite quickly - you need to break it up with something heartfelt and romantic (who could ever imagine me saying that!?).

For some reason I especially liked reading about their meals, both before and after the Cottons came along to provide them with better food. What is jellied soup, anyway? There was also a cutely Pollyannaesque tone to the cheerful way Cassandra would casually make note of all the things they lacked and had sold off, and her appreciation for the little that they did have. But halfway through the book I stopped being able to fully relate to Cassandra. I get that love isn't rational, but sometimes I think what's true in real life doesn't always translate well to fiction. Stephen was really too wonderful and too deserving of love, and I was just unable to process Cassandra's indifference to him as a lack of chemistry rather than utter heartlessness. He was responsible and considerate, not only to Cassandra but to the entire family, even though by the end he was their hired boy only in name, and was the only one in the family earning any income. That anecdote about his reaction to the news of his mother's illness really did it. The scene with the wirelesses was especially painful, and it was interesting to note Cassandra's perception of kindness: she is deeply impressed by and grateful to the Cottons for what she calls their \"kindness,\" and I definitely get that, given what a huge impact they've had on her family's lives and circumstances. At the same time, this really highlights how much she takes for granted, in terms of the kindness she receives from Stephen, Topaz, and Miss Marcy. In the end it almost seemed as though Cassandra's feelings were largely decided by both class and circumstance--i.e., her feelings towards a person were determined by what it is within their means to provide. For example, Topaz can only cook and scrub and clean and comfort, and Miss Marcy can go out of her way to provide somewhat insubstantial help, while Mrs. Cotton can send gigantic hams and throw lavish parties and Simon, with his age and access to education, can talk about books and composers. When she tries to comfort Stephen, she even acknowledges that his wireless was a bigger present from him because he had to work and save for it, and I think that's pretty representative of their entire relationship with the Cottons--the Cottons are kind, generous people, but it also really doesn't cost them anything and they can afford such charity. I think the author did a good job of illustrating the selfishness and single-mindedness that can come out of young love or infatuation. Again, this is all very realistic and makes sense, since it's human nature to take what you have for granted, to not appreciate family when you're starstruck or obsessed with something else, but because this was fiction, I wanted it all to wrap up neatly and for the main character to grow up. I don't mean the character shouldn't still be a work-in-progress at the end of book, but in terms of character growth, Cassandra's story and and Miss Marcy's story of being shaken out of her self-interest by grief and tragedy and then coming out of that by taking an interest in children are at different ends of the spectrum. I feel like the book offers the first part of a coming-of-age story, without actually following the character through to any major development. Since the latter portion of the book has much more to do with Cassandra's emotions and her fixation on Simon than on the unique experience of living in poverty in a castle with an eccentric family, this also made me lose some of my original interest in the book."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "I Capture the Castle is one of my favorite books for making everything out of every event until it is all absolutely important.

I've never read another review that for me personally summed up this book better that I'd want to read it (yes, it is true that it is enjoyable and charming too). It is the lighter side of turning over rocks and sometimes finding creepy crawlies underneath. Of not getting hurt by building up love stories to cushion the harsh blows of day to day life. The secrets that make you know someone better, and therefore love them better. Cassandra's scope changes and she learns to not make more or less out of everything but try and see it for what it is, while still seeing the need for valuing it that much. Her father's past with their deceased mom, his writer's block and being imprisoned in his own mind, the step-mom she took for granted, the little brother who saw more than she thought he did, being rich in more than money, the selfish but passionate Rose, her love Simon, Stephen she took for a brother who really loved her all along...(Some of my favorite parts were her conversations with the Vicar about her changing religious beliefs.)And like many others have written, it is funny and charming and quaintly fresh.

I smiled upon my first acquaintaince with Miss Cassandra Mortmain, laughed upon further conversation, and felt as if I were there clasping hands with her in the shadows of her crumbling castle near all the way through. The book is an invocation of Gothic passion, with all the repressed sensuality of the Bronte sisters, and a beach ball of ever-so-practical British and Jane Austen wit being passed back and forth among the cast. It wraps us up in mingled dreams, fantasies and reality and lets us decide which is truly which, while we watch a family trying to do the same. It is a coming-of-age tale, if one must categorize it, but it was few and far between that I was reminded of that fact. While she does 'put away childish things' one by one, she lets us see that adults build their own worlds for themselves, too, no less silly or indulgent than that which she builds for herself. I do not know why this is rated as \"YA\" literature by some people here. I certainly would not have gathered everything that I did from this at the age of 13 or 14.

Further, now that I\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s a third book in the series (hooray!), I\u2019ll have a brand-new (to me, anyway) Dodie Smith children\u2019s book to savor."}, {"userName": "William Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143572-william-thomas", "userReview": "I began to harbor a very strong dislike for this book approximately sixty pages in. And I then hated myself for hating this book. Because it seems to be so beloved that I kept beating myself up for not understanding why it was so wonderful. And then suddenly, I stopped and the book ended. And I sighed with relief as I put it away, never to be touched again.This is one of those books that most reviewers would call \"delightful\". I could imagine many would sit around reading it feeling giddy and delighted. They would then go on to describe it as \"charming\". Probably most would not go so far as to call it \"enchanting\", but I could see where some may go so far. I would use all of these words, as well, if I were trying to sell it. If I put an ad up to dump it on some other unassuming soul. The same way realtors use the words \"cozy\" and \"charming\" and \"delightful\" in order to pique interests about small, out-of-the-way holes in the wall.Now, before you beat me up over this review and the star rating, please understand that I am not a complete boor. I enjoy wit and witticism, turn-of-phrase, and I delight at smartly written prose. I am in no need of a plot of any sort in the works I read or those I fall in love with. I can enjoy a book for the poetry or for the observations or for a myriad other reasons. But this book seems to me to be a floundering piece of garbage, something akin to pond scum. It has no idea of what it intended to do except to be \"enchanting\" and \"delightful\". And that really was what it boiled down to. Something cutesy that intended to be cutesy for it's own sake. If you are big on plot, please, put the book down or lend it to a friend and forget about it. There is a family who lives in a castle. They are awkward weirdos who have no idea how to interact with people, especially men. Some men come along. An aunt dies. They collect some valuable furs. They talk to the men a little. Their father cannot write another book and they are poor. The end. What bothers me most about it is that I felt Dodie Smith smirking at all of her own lines, after reading each sentence of her own work, each sentence punctuated by a smug little old lady smile. Like someone who has just made you furious and smiles at you about it instead of fighting with you.And I hated it. I'd punctuate the book with straight jabs and uppercuts to demonstrate my rage. IF you think you saw something in this book relating to socio-political values or socio-economic plight in England, I would have to say you were mistaken. This book speaks as much to class and societal upbringing as a Janet Evanovich book does. Just put it down. You won't like it. It's like eating an entire 2 pound bag of M&M's. It's glorious for about a minute, then so sugary your mouth aches, and then a labored task that will make you feel bad about yourself for finishing it."}, {"userName": "Amy | shoutame", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10559838-amy-shoutame", "userReview": "A must read for any lover of Jane Austen! Fantastic!- This novel follows the story of the Mortmain family who live in a dilapidated old castle in the countryside. We see the world through the eyes of Cassandra Mortmain, the youngest daughter of the household and easily my favourite character from the novel! We learn how the family relies on the profits from their novelist Father's book - a book that is slowly dwindling in popularity, threatening the meagre amount of food and comfort they have left. When things just seem to be heading for devastation an unlikely source of help comes when the rightful heirs to the castle come and visit from America. The two handsome American brother's end up stealing the hearts of Cassandra and her sister but the path of love never runs smoothly... - The interactions between Cassandra and family reminded me so much of the witty voice of Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice - this was definitely my favourite aspect of the novel. The chapters are laid out as though Cassandra is writing in her journal and so I felt very connected to her story as it was as if she was talking directly to me.- The variety between the characters in this novel was brilliant and seeing the way each of them develops as the story moves on was really interesting. I especially loved the growth of Cassandra's character and how she emotionally matured over the course of the novel.- 5 out of 5 stars and into my favourites! I would recommend to any lover of Jane Austen or similar authors."}, {"userName": "Mayra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1967563-mayra", "userReview": "This, in a way, is a coming-of-age story. In just a few months, Cassandra Mortmain learns pages and pages about herself \u2013 her capabilities and her flaws.I found it no coincidence when the author, through Cassandra, expressed her views on endings that are too happy, those that close the story too shut, saying that with books like that you forget about its characters too quickly. How right she was, because after I finished her novel I spent about two hours lying in bed, resolutely incapable of going to sleep, just musing nonstop about the story, and all of them. Cassandra, Neil, Simon, Rose, Stephen\u2026It\u2019s an understatement to say that this was a modern fairy tale. Because even though it had most of the ingredients \u2013 castles, towers, pagan rituals, metaphoric prince charmings, and so much of England\u2019s picturesque charm \u2013 this novel was so many levels above the mere romance.I\u2019d say Dodie Smith not only captured the castle perfectly, but even more than their abode, she captured all the characters to such an amazing length. It had been too long since I last witnessed such expert character development.A modern romance, set in an ancient castle in the English countryside, with characters so real and refreshingly human you feel they may actually exist: that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe I Capture the Castle."}], "description": "Cassandra Mortmain is no ordinary teenager.
