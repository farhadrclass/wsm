I picked up this book before I read the first book in the series, Midnight Without a Moon, which is a bit of a shame, because, well, MIDNIGHT WITHOUT A MOON IS A NEWBERY CONTENDER FOR THIS YEAR AND WHY HAVEN\u2019T I HEARD TALK ABOUT IT but I digress. A Sky Full of Stars can be read as a standalone book.We travel back to Mississippi in the 1950s rural south, where Rosa lives in a sharecropper house with her grandma, aunts, brother and cousins. She declined the offer to go up north to St. Louis and is wondering whether that was the right decision. All around her there is unaccounted violence towards blacks by white people, whether it\u2019s the white jury\u2019s decision not to convict Emmet Till\u2019s kidnappers and murderers to a person who was murdered while pumping gas or attacked for attempting to register blacks to vote. There\u2019s tension in Rosa\u2019s universe about what should be done about the violence: some, like Ma Pearl, believe there is nothing good to be won by fighting for rights and only things to be lost. Others, like her cousin Shorty, believe that the whites need a taste of their own intimidation tactics. Still others, like the preacher\u2019s son Hallelujah, want to go the path of boycotts, peaceful activism, and self-determination that they hear about from people like Dr. T.R.M. Howard.This book is so thoughtful, so precise, and so contemporary. It will make readers astonished and uncomfortable, hopefully not to the point of saying, \u201cWell, it\u2019s FICTION, so I know that never actually happened.\u201d There were countless times I post-it noted my text just for moments to return to when I had a moment. Character development is rock-solid and characters are multi-dimensional. Jackson understands the right balance between which plot threads need resolution and which ones can be left dangling.My one critique is that this story lacks a solid plot center and I think that developing readers will find that a little frustrating. I could see how this could be a strong choice for historical fiction and teacher-led readings in middle school, but I will hold judgment on whether this will be a big hit with the young readers I work with. This is a must-buy for me, because it\u2019s a fantastic book and it will find the right reader. My fingers are crossed that the two book set achieves a War That Saved My Life status in my classroom."}, {"userName": "Jana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4051653-jana", "userReview": "I had the opportunity to read an ARC of this book that was shared with my #BookRelays group by the author. I was thrilled that I would be able to keep reading Rose Lee\u2019s story. A Sky Full of Stars is the sequel to last year\u2019s Midnight Without a Moon. Set in Mississippi in 1955, it tells the story of Rose Lee and what it must have been like to be raised by black sharecroppers at a time when racial tensions were increasing with gruesome crimes like the murder of Emmett Till and the beginning of nonviolent protests like the Montgomery Bus Boycott.The story picks up where the first book ended. Thirteen year old Rose is now able to attend school and it is there that her friend, Hallelujah, encourages her to become more involved in resistance activities. She also comes to know her own cousin, Shorty, better and he\u2019s convinced that violence is the only way things will improve. The storytelling in this book is superb! I love that Rose Lee\u2019s circumstances are very complicated and that there are no simple answers. The characters illustrate the contradictions of these complex times. Ma Pearl, the severe matriarch of the family, refuses to allow anyone in the family to become involved with any of the resistance movements being advocated by organizations like the NAACP, because of the very real danger to their jobs, their home, and their lives. At the same time, she seems to obstinately stand in the way of anyone in the family trying to improve their circumstances, especially if it means they will become big-headed or \u201cbeside themselves.\u201dI also like that Rose Lee\u2019s narrative is woven with factual information of the events of the times. This book, along with Midnight Without a Moon, would fit well in a study of the Civil Rights Movement. There are some mature themes, so I think it would be more appropriate in a middle school setting (grades 6-8) than in an elementary school classroom."}, {"userName": "Brandy Painter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840210-brandy-painter", "userReview": "Originally posted here at Random Musings of a Bibliophile.I waited all the way until February 1st to finish my first 5 star read of 2018. There was no need for me to wait that long. I had A Sky Full of Stars by Linda Williams Jackson in my house the whole month of January. But reader, sometimes I get scared about reading highly anticipated sequels to books I've loved. There was no need to worry though. A Sky Full of Stars is the perfect second half to Midnight Without a Moon.Rose made the difficult decision to stay in Mississippi rather than go with her aunt to live in St. Louis. Now that the choice has been made, Rose must find the strength and courage to stand by her conviction that Stillwater is the place she needs to be. Her strength and courage become more difficult to find as reports of more deaths of black men at the hands of white men come in. Rose's best friend, Hallelujah, is ready to begin his own junior chapter of the NAACP and start peacefully protesting. Rose's first cousin Shorty has other, more violent ideas of ways they can fight back. As tensions rise in the community and in her own home, Rose has to find inventive ways to preserve the present and plan for the future.The hard thing about sequels is that you already know and love the characters. There isn't that time you spend getting to know them because that work has been done. As a result, sequels are almost stressful from the beginning because of how concerned you are for the characters you already love. I felt that greatly reading this book. Rose and Hallelujah have become two of my favorite MG characters of all time and my concern for their continued emotional and physical well-being was high. They both do a lot of growing, changing, and learning in this book. The foundations of both their personalities were strong, and those foundations are built on in this book. Rose is told she is brave for staying behind in Mississippi, but she feels scared. She is terrified at the idea of risking herself even for a cause she knows is good and just. Hallelujah is full of fire and defiance, ready to take on the world. Through conflicts with each other, circumstances, and the greater society both gain perspective and learn a little balance. Shorty's character is fantastic addition to this mix. He acts as a foil and catalyst for both of them to learn things. He is fascinating in his own right as well and adds a new perspective on the events happening in the community. I also enjoyed getting to know Rose's Aunt Ruth and Hallelujah's Aunt Bertha better in this book. They are both great role models for Rose, though their lives are very different from each other.The story follows events in Rose's life through the Fall of 1955 and ends at Christmas. There is a lot of history touched on. The Montgomery Bus Boycott starts, Rosa Parks becomes a name everyone knows, and there are references to Martin Luther King Jr. All of this is brought into the lives of the characters through other sources. Rose feels a world away and far removed from even in Alabama. In Rose's own community, tensions are still high from the acquittal of Emmett Till's murderers. Midnight Without a Moon didn't pull any punches with this history, but I feel like A Sky Full of Stars raised it a notch and was throwing fire on almost every page. And it is magnificent. I definitely cried harder during this book than any I've read recently. (And I cried hardest at a wonderful exchange between Rose and Hallelujah about faith and heroes.) As in the first book, the church community and Rose's faith play an important role in the story and her character development. Again, I loved how integral this was and that Jackson was able to fully explore it. Rose has doubts. She feels frustrated. She feels convicted. Her journey through all of that is a thing of beauty.I was going to do a list of great quotes, but there are SO MANY. I couldn't choose. Just read the book. The underlying humor in these books plays a large part in why I like them so much too.Fans of historical fiction should not miss out on these books. Whatever age you are, they are must reads."}, {"userName": "Kester Nucum", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50217319-kester-nucum", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I received a free ARC copy of this book from the publisher HMH in exchange for an honest review.It is a hard feat to write a sequel that is as great\u2013and even rarer, better\u2013than the original, but Jackson pulled it off.\u00a0A Sky Full of Stars is much more impactful and heart-wrenching than\u00a0Midnight without a Moon, that I just could not put it down. A powerful coming-of-age tale that examines Rose\u2019s life during the aftermath of the Emmett Till murder,\u00a0A Sky Full of Stars is one of the most inspiring middle grade novels I have ever read.\u00a0One of the most stunning aspects of this book is that it takes such a different and unique arc than the first book, giving readers a refreshing new storyline that introduces new characters and conflicts and retains many beloved characters from book one. The author just blew me away with this book, and it\u2019s one of the few that I am so proud and honored to have not only as an ARC but also as a physical copy sitting on my shelf.Jackson continues to display the violence and external and internal conflicts African Americans faced in the Deep South without sugarcoating any single aspect. If you had previously read my review of\u00a0Midnight without a Moon, you would know how thought-provoking the entire duology was.\u00a0A Sky Full of Stars follows Rose as she chooses (minor spoiler alert) to stay in Mississippi to help bring about change, but she is torn between follow her best friend Hallelujah\u2019s nonviolent protests and (her cousin, I think?) Shorty\u2019s violent tactics. Because she has to figure out who to side with and how to overcome her fear, Rose\u2013as she learns to become empowered and fight for what is right regardless of the opposition she faces\u2013will inspire readers of all ages. If you look at my ARC copy, there are about 30 to 40 page flaps that have bookmarked certain passages and quotes, from the consequences of deception to finding strength in God. That is certainly a good indicator (for me) how much I just loved this book.I found myself more emotionally invested into A Sky Full of Stars to the point where I rejoiced so much with Rose\u2019s triumphs, cringed during her mistakes, and even became shocked (and possibly cried, I can\u2019t remember but it\u2019s possible) at all the plot twists.\u00a0I just could not, and I mean could NOT, put this book down at all. I found everything, from the prose to the plot to the characters to the conflict, much more improved than its prequel. It was as if I became Rose herself. I felt her moral dilemmas, her fear, her curiosity, her hope for the future. I felt very changed and impacted from this novel\u2013it\u2019s one that is so powerful it gave me an actual glimpse of racism and change that took place during the Civil Rights Movement at its inception (there is a mention of Rosa Parks in the book which I was so happy at). It effectively combined that backdrop with Rose coming of age and trying to heal, help, and learn more about her family in the process\u2013which provided the perfect recipe for a book that gave me all the chills and all the feels.A Sky Full of Stars\u00a0is the perfect conclusion for the\u00a0Rose Lee Carter\u00a0duology. It is definitely one of the most powerful middle grade books I have ever read\u2013I would recommend this to younger readers in a heart beat!\u00a0I rarely use this term a lot in a review, but this novel was just perfect.\u00a0Jackson stepped it up in this sequel to\u00a0Midnight without a Moon (which you should still read nonetheless),\u00a0and\u00a0A Sky Full of Stars\u00a0is so unforgettable that it will stick with you for a long time. If you need a last minute Christmas gift, or just a good historical fiction read for either you or your kid (the\u00a0Rose Lee Carter\u00a0series is perfect for children and adults of all ages!), then you need to get these two books. Linda Williams Jackson is one of the most promising MG authors I\u2019ve read. I am excited to see what she has in store in the future!"}, {"userName": "Karina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4230444-karina", "userReview": "This book is the sequel to MIDNIGHT WITHOUT A MOON but can also be read as a standalone. Thirteen year old Rose Lee Carter chose to stay at home in Mississippi instead of taking her aunt's offer to go to St. Louis, but recent violence against the black community is making her question her decision. Set in the 1950s when Jim Crow laws dominated the south, Rose witnesses terrible injustice when black community members are harassed, shot at, and have their businesses burned down - with no criminal charges brought against the white people who commit the atrocities. As Rose waivers between wanting to leave and wanting to stay, her classmates are divided as how to respond. While some want to meet violence with violence, others want to pursue non-violent protest. At the end, Rose has to figure out who she is and what she's willing to give up for the sake of change. This book opened my eyes to life in the south during the 1950s and the challenges young people faced.

Having not read Midnight Without a Moon, I was unsure what to expect in this sequel. After getting to know Rosa and her family, I'll definitely go back and read the first book. Set in 1955 Jim Crow Mississippi, Rosa is torn between the opinions of her cousin Shorty, who wants to answer the growing violence with violence, and her good friend Hallelujah, who believes in peaceful protesting. She is scared of the increasing racial tension in her community and struggles to understand how she can help make a change for the better. She carries on through the book, \"looking for bits of hope, bits of light.\" Similar to Lions of Little Rock and The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963, this is a must read MG historical fiction text."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29336696-arlene", "userReview": "I love Rose, I think she is such a great character that really embodies what it is like to be a young girl, working on a cotton farm with her family in 1955 Mississippi where she's unsure of what she should do as a young person wanting and needing change, but not knowing how to go about it without bringing dishonour on her family, because let me just say, Ma Pearl is no joke. In this book, we follow Rose and Hallelujah in the aftermath of the case against Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam in the kidnapping and murder of Emmett Till. After being found not guilty, the black citizens of Stillwater, Mississippi are in a state of unrest and some feel that they should be doing more on their side of things in hopes of being seen as equal citizens and having civil rights and not just wait on folks from up north and the NAACP. While on the other side of all that the white citizens feel that the black populations is getting out of pocket and need to be reminded that they live under Jim Crow here in the south. The audacity of these children to take on this fight still in the beginning stages is mind-boggling and being that marches, sit-ins, and protest are still happening to this day for  JUSTICE! This book may have been written about events in 1955, but the spirit of this book very much reflects that of today. I would highly recommend this as well as book one, Midnight Without a Moon, which I read in February (review found here on goodreads)."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756329-angie", "userReview": "Rosa is dealing with the aftermath of the Emmet Till trial where the men who killed him are let go. She sees the injustices happening all around her in Mississippi. She sees how blacks are treated by their white neighbors and she wants to do something about it, but she is afraid. She is afraid because black people are being killed all the time. They are being killed for trying to register people to vote and simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tensions are running high in the South. Rosa is also dealing with a lot of tensions at home. She never sees her father even though he lives close by and would like to, but her grandma doesn't want him in her house. The house is full of people staying there because they have no where else to go. Her grandma is a mean woman who never hesitates to take the strap to anyone she thinks deserves it. Rosa is growing up and deciding what kind of person she wants to be; does she want to be afraid and bow down to the white people or does she want to stand up for herself and others and risk it all.I haven't read the first book about Rosa so I feel like I did miss a bit of the story; however, for the most part I think everything that happened in the first book is referenced in this one. This is a fascinating time in history and it is interesting to see it from this point of view. I do wish there was a bit more to the other characters besides Rosa. She is pretty well drawn out character wise, but some of the others seem very one note. I thought Ma Pearl was especially troubling. It is fine to have a mean character to set your main character against, but why is she so mean. There is no backstory or anything to explain her. She is just mean and hateful to everyone around her. I also wish there would have been a bit more about Queenie and Aunt Ruthie. They were interesting, but had no story here. Ruthie did end up with a bit more towards the end of the book, but they were basically in the background. Maybe I would have felt differently if I read the first book?I received this book from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Barbara Senteney", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68987237-barbara-senteney", "userReview": "I enjoyed this story inspired by the author's life and surroundings. The tale is set in 1955 in Stillwater Mississippi. Rosa her friend Hallelujah and cousin shorty have heard of ll the bad things happening to people of color all over the south, and even though they are frightened they want to stand up and make a difference. Reverend Jenkins, Hallelujah's father has told them they can't sit around and wait for negroes up north to save them.It's up to us to save ourselves.A man name Emmett Till is shot down in cold blood, and yes there was a trial but the man was set free. No law against killing coloreds existed. If there had, what white man of the time would care anyway?The story also tells some of the everyday life of colored people of the time. Some whites were sympathetic, but most didn't care at all.Rosa, and Hallelujah take it upon themselves to walk in a small town protest, even tho she knows she will be beaten for it, she thinks it's worth it. Her grandmother wears her ass out, it could cost them their jobs and home, so she's mad. Stores owned and operated by negroes are burned, men , women and children are abused and murdered in this time of America's shameful history.People are hungry and get by on little, but Rosa loves her home and family, so she knows it's time to stand up and fight for what's right.The author's note in the back synced it for me and made this a 5 star read.Thank you Linda Williams Jackson for this amazing story.I was born in 1958 and lived through all sorts of racial unrest on both sides. In the 1960's we couldn't even open a window to the street or play outside due to riots. This story touched me.

These books are absolute treasures. This is the kind of middle grade fiction that transcends age and should be enjoyed by all. In addition to providing an educational timeline and authentic perspective on mid-50\u2019s civil rights, from Emmett Till to Rosa Parks, author Linda Williams Jackson weaves in honesty and nuance rarely touched in books written even for adults, like discussions of classism and colorism within the black community, fear and anger towards northern blacks and the NAACP for agitating the system and causing more instability for the already more oppressed southern blacks, and mass northern migration and the generational splitting of black families.

As a child, I loved the Little House books which happened 80 years before I read them. Jackson's books are taking place over 60 years ago, which probably feels like ancient history to today's young readers, just as Little House felt to me. I learned to appreciate the struggles of my ancestors, who were from the area of the Little House books, to survive through storms and fears and problems to where I was . Today's readers can follow Rose Lee Carter and her family, with different struggles and get an insight into the political and civil issues that have shaped our country.

I so emotionally identified with Rosa and her inner struggle between fear and the desire to be brave and do right.

I enjoyed the author's notes in the pages of the book. I grew up in the '60's and '70's in Houston. Being white, I never experienced the racial discrimination that the author and heroine in this book experienced. I did, however, experience discrimination because we were \"poor folks.\" Our houses weren't always in the best condition nor were our hand me down clothes, much like Rosa's in this book. We had \"what's it\" for supper once a week. My dad was a butcher and brought home unlabeled, dinted cans from the store where he worked. Once a week, my mom would open 4 or 5 cans of what's it for supper. We raised chickens, rabbits, and a garden. Dad hunted and fished. My mom was a great cook and really good at stretching a meal with fried cornmeal mush and honey for breakfast or water biscuits with water gravy. This book reminded me a lot of where I came from. For a long time my dad was a bigot. Then he met a very fine black young man who wanted to be a butcher. My dad trained him. When Spence was finally trained and secured a job with the same store where my dad was the market manager, he went home to Louisiana to retrieve his wife and kids and bring them to Houston. On his way home, he stopped to help a white woman broken down with a flat tire on Interstate 10. While changing her flat, he was struck and killed. That tragedy was a life changer for my dad. He really cared about Spence. That freed us to develop friendships with other races. My best friend became Cornelia Jones. She and I both played the violin in orchestra and competed for 1st chair every week. Usually it was either Cornelia or myself who won that honor. Cornelia went on to do great things with her life, she attended Julliard and became an phenomenal opera singer, while I chose a life of domesticity. I have four wonderful grandchildren, one full black and three biracial. It is remarkable the strides we as a nation have made in my lifetime. This book is a must read. I think it should be required reading in school. It really helps me, a white person, understand the struggles of the Afro-American communities. We are better, but we aren't there yet. Thank you Linda Jackson for writing this book, I hope you have several more inspiring books inside that marvelous head of yours.

A good way to learn a little history while reading an excellent novel that drew me into her world and fears. Rosa does make a difference in people's lives despite those fears.There was no sex or swearing. There were some racial slurs used by both sides (white against black and black against white). Overall, I'd highly recommend this excellent story."}, {"userName": "Czechgirl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829141-czechgirl", "userReview": "Loved, loved this book! I read the first book, Midnight Without a Moon, in this series. I felt Rose was strong, but I love how Jackson made her an even stronger person in this book. I absolutely loved Midnight Without a Moon, but I had a few fellow teachers express their concerns about reading it aloud to their students due to the graphic detail of the killing of Emmitt Till and the pregnancy of Rose's cousin. This book provides a window into the hate African-Americans endured during the Jim Crow Law years without the detailing of a killing. It would be a safer book for teachers to read aloud to their students without a parent becoming upset. This book is not any less of a book than MWaM, but those considering read alouds to students, this is the better choice."}, {"userName": "Amber Webb", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66026760-amber-webb", "userReview": "A Sky Full of Stars by Linda Jackson was one of those books I couldn't put down and didn't want to finish at the same time. Jackson gives such depth to her characters and setting that you feel as though you are in Mississippi in the 1950's living through these stories in the shoes of Rosa, Hallelujah and their families. Thanks to Jackson I learned about events that I never knew occurred and felt and saw this time period through different eyes. I truly admire and appreciate Jackson's writing style and can't wait to see what else she brings to the literature world in the future. Her books will be ones that I always recommend to friends and family."}, {"userName": "Leigh Anne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19135939-leigh-anne", "userReview": "Rose Carter is one of those characters who you know is going to go on and do amazing things with her life. I loved Rose in Midnight Without a Moon, and I am so glad that Linda Jackson continued with Rose's story in A Sky Full of Stars.

I think A Sky Full of Stars is a stronger novel than the first book, but I still think it had some issues.Namely, Ma Pearl. What the hell is wrong with Ma Pearl?! I said this in my review of the first book, but I don't understand why Jackson decided to write Ma Pearl the way she did. She is a very harsh character and I keep waiting to discover why she is so mean, but Jackson gives us absolutely no justification. As far as I'm concerned Ma Pearl has no redeeming qualities and I think that's unfair to her character. She literally has no empathy. She doesn't seem like a psychopath to me, so I really don't know why she's so unyielding. Sure, she makes a great antagonist, but she's also not the main villain of the story (hello white people) and I think showing us a little bit more of her humanity would make such a better character.But let's talk about plot, because I thought the plot of this story was stronger than the first book. Midnight Without a Moon takes place in Mississippi in 1955 and focuses on the murder of Emmett Till. Rose is shocked when the white men who murdered Emmett walk free of all charges and is desperate to see change. A Sky Full of Stars focuses on the murders of several other black men in the state for doing things like trying to register to vote, demanding to be paid a fair wage, and for simply making a mistake when pumping a white man's gas. So basically black people are being shot for daring to exist.I found the plot structure a bit weak in Midnight Without a Moon, but it is much better defined in A Sky Full of Stars. Rose is disgusted that white people can kill black people without suffering any consequence and decides she wants to do something about it. Everyone has different ideas about the most effective ways to create change and Rose has to figure out where she fits in and how far she's willing to go to try and ensure a better future for her family. She struggles with turning down her Aunt Belle's offer to move to St. Louis and is afraid of what the consequences might be of speaking out against inequality.Similar to the first book, I felt this book had no real climax to the story and it felt like it kind of just ends. I could easily see Jackson writing another book about Rose. Mostly I think she just needs to think more about her characterization. Rose has a great character arc, but the rest of the characters feel 1-dimensional. There's quite a lot of side characters but I feel like barely any of them had depth. The Shorty-Hallelujah conflict had so much potential, but never really came to a head and as such, didn't really feel that meaningful. There was so much potential for Queen's character too, but I don't think her character developed at all in this book.I applaud Jackson for tackling some pretty tough subjects in a middle grade book, but honestly, I think this book can go so much deeper. I feel like Jackson is hesitant to get into the dark nitty-gritty of her characters. The character conflicts all feel very surface level and I think if Jackson went deeper into her characters, their fears and desires, this would truly be a fantastic series. Have your characters make mistakes and take risks - they live in a harsh world and sometimes they are going to make bad choices. How they react and grow from those challenges is what makes them inspiring.Thank you to NetGalley and HMH Books for Young Readers for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Clarissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/336616-clarissa", "userReview": "This book is the sequel to Midnight Without a Moon, but stands on its own. I had not read the first book, but had no problem following this book. This book takes place in rural Mississippi shortly after Emmett Till's murder, and at a time when other black people are being murdered with impunity by the local whites. Black businesses are also attacked by arsonists, and daily life is a struggle for the impoverished black community, who are mostly sharecroppers. The main character Rosa, has passed up the opportunity to move to Saint Louis with other family members, and instead stayed in Mississippi, with her younger brother and abusive grandmother. Her motivations for staying were unclear to me, but varied between she loves the place, she wants to be with her family, things won't ever get better if everyone runs away. Most of her reasons for staying are knocked down by the other characters in the book several times. It ended up seeming to me that she stayed because the author wanted to write about her childhood in Mississippi.The characters felt very real, and the historical period was accurately portrayed, you really care about Rosa and her struggle, and that of the community around her. Rosa visits Mound Bayou a Mississippi city founded by former slaves, and inhabited by an exclusively black community, which I had never heard of. This book is an introduction to an important period in American history. But the book itself felt very bleak to me. Especially in light of the Black Lives Matter movement, and how it feels that black people are still being killed and their murderers continue to go unpunished."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372331-elisabeth", "userReview": "This is a book about faith: faith in yourself, faith in your family, faith in your God. This is a book about Mississippi: Jim Crow Mississippi, early Civil Rights Era Mississippi, my crazy, beautiful, depraved, beloved Mississippi.A Sky Full of Stars does a stellar (sorry, couldn\u2019t help myself) job of capturing how life would be for a girl living in the war zone that was 1955 Mississippi. Rosa questions her bravery and her faith; she struggles with her anger and her day-to-day life. She\u2019s loving, loyal, and a true inspiration. Characters introduced in Midnight Without a Moon were fleshed out\u2014somehow I like Queen now(!) and I really enjoyed Rosa\u2019s budding relationship with her Aunt Ruthie. Shorty was an intriguing addition and surprise new favorite, especially when I found out one of the reasons he\u2019d been skipping school.LWJ revisited some topics from MWAM as well: Dr. TRM Howard, Emmett Till and other Jim Crow Mississippi casualties, classism, and colorism. Yes, the N word is in here and yes, I think it needs to be. Enough said.The beginning could\u2019ve been a little tighter and there was a typo (It\u2019s was\u2026) on page 108 that drove me up the wall (blame my OCD), but I\u2019m going to place these minor flaws at the door of shoddy editing rather than LWJ\u2019s writing because y\u2019all, I love her books. They are about a time and place that people need to know about and LWJ\u2019s stories ring true.

Rosa is living with Ma Pearl and Papa (her grandparents) and a slew of cousins and her Aunt Ruthie. Ruthie has left her alcoholic and abusive husband and moved back in with her kids. Ma Pearl rules the roost with a ruthless and often mean disposition. They are sharecroppers for the Robinson's and life is hard for people of color in the Mississippi Delta region.When things start to heat up after the murder of Emmett Till and the release of those who murdered him, Rosa begins to wonder what her place is in the upcoming battle for civil rights. Encouraged by her friend, Hallelujah, to become an activist, Rosa is torn between protecting her family and standing up for what she knows is the right thing. This is a great book about the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. I think both this one and its prequel would be a good place to start to introduce middle grade students to the fight for civil rights. In this turbulent time in our history where we sometimes seem to be going backward in our fight for everyone to be treated equally, I feel that books like this one are important to expose our young people to so they can develop some knowledge and hopefully some empathy to what being treated equal under the law really means."}, {"userName": "Alina White", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18956484-alina-white", "userReview": "A powerful sequel. Rose doesn't have an easy time living with her decision to stay in Mississippi, with racial tensions rising and casualties mounting. It's difficult to hold onto convictions when they could cost you your business or your life. Rose struggles to reconcile her ideals with her fear for others' safety, especially when some of the people she looks up to start moving up North. Despite all this she manages to support her aunt in a fledgling cake business and takes a trip out of her home town to Mound Bayou.Jackson writes evocatively of a frightening time period that isn't all that far from the present. While I would have wished more good things for Rose, she is stubborn in giving her opportunities to others. I'm hopeful for more sequels where Rose can finally leave her mostly not-very-supportive family and go to college. That's my dream, anyway.ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Shelli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57299914-shelli", "userReview": "While I have very little love in my heart for Ma Pearl, I can appreciate how she has kept the family of Rose Lee Carter together. Rose Lee, our main character, is strong, smart and wants to change the world that she lives in the South. With her best friend Hallelujah, they are a force to be reckoned with. I hope that the third book shows these two characters prevailing in some big way. Set in the 1950's, sometimes I have to remind myself that it is not the 1850's. The author does an excellent job of painting a life of the times while keeping the story centralized. In the first book, we learn about Emmet Till. In the second book, we are introduced to Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, in a very limited sense. However, if you were a curious reader, you would be motivated to learn more about them. Reading Jackson's Author Notes reminds us that as a granddaughter of a sharecropper in 1970's we are not that removed from our story. A great middle-grade historical fiction."}], "description": "After the murder of Emmett Till, thirteen-year-old Rose is struggling with her decision to stay in Mississippi.
