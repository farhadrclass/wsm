His mother is nearly catatonic with grief and it is hoped that returning to her Father's house will help heal her.Kevin quickly makes friend with another boy, Buzz who lives in one of the hollows, and their days are spent hanging in a tree house, tromping through the woods and camping in a cave said to be haunted. Though everything is thought to be wonderful there are deep undercurrents of anger and mistrust running through this community. The mines have been closed and now the man from the family who made a fortune from the mines, is blowing the top off of the mountains to access the coal from the top and a local man, who is also gay, is the main person standing up to him.These things will come together in a horrifying way, a way that will leave Kevin and Buzz no longer children. This is a beautifully written book, the description of the hollows, the mountains are at times beautiful and at times devastating as we see what the mining has done to this beautiful place. What fear, anger and suspicion does to this community and the people within. It is an adventure story, an ecological lesson and a social injustice all combined to make this a wonderful if at times sad story.For everyone who has loved a time and place that has been changed by progress or greed this is the book to read. At the finish of this book I felt nostalgic and angered about how much people are willing to sacrifice for reputation and money.

Luckily, he heads back to Indiana, leaving Kevin to have, if not the greatest, certainly the most unforgettable, summer of his life.He and his new pal, Buzzy, will indulge in mud baths, hang out in tree houses, explore caves, share secrets and go a-hellin' through the woods.

While many are thrilled at the job prospects, others see only the devastation the operation will bring. It's a simmering pot that will come to a boil during that summer and Kevin will be there to witness the whole thing.

The author was juggling a lot and I think he pulled it off well. Our narrator is 14-year-old Kevin, who moves with his mom back to her hometown in Appalachia. His mother is mad with grief after losing her 3-year-old son in a terrible accident. Kevin's grandfather tries to care for them, and Kevin grows fond of him. Kevin also makes friends with a boy named Buzzy, who introduces him to their mountain ways. The boys end up facing some bullies, and Kevin is pushed into a dangerous situation.Meanwhile, the small town is having its own troubles. The coal mining company is pressuring families to sell their land, and threats are made to those who refuse, including Kevin's grandfather. The town boss picks on Paul, a homosexual man who runs the local beauty salon, and it causes even more tension in the community. There are so many elements to this grand novel that I was reminded of numerous other books and movies, including To Kill a Mockingbird, Tell the Wolves I'm Home, Coal Miner's Daughter, On Golden Pond, Harlan County U.S.A.,  and The Most Dangerous Game. I don't think it's a bad thing to think of other works \u2014 Scotton's book is just so rich in events that I couldn't help be reminded of similar stories.Scotton's prose is lovely and he had some beautiful descriptions. I knew I would like this book as soon as I read its opening passage: \nIt was always coal. Coal filled their pantry and put a sense of purpose in their Monday coffee. Coal was Christmas and the long weekend in Nashville when the Opry offered half-price tickets. Coal was new corduroy slacks and the washboard symphony they played to every step. Coal was a twice-a-month haircut. Coal was a store-bought dress and the excuse to wear it. Coal took them in as teenagers, proud, cocksure, and gave them back fully played out. Withered and silent.Coal was the double-wide trailer at twenty and the new truck. Coal was the house with the front porch at twenty-eight and the satellite dish. Coal was the bass boat at thirty-five and the fishing cabin at forty. And then, after they gave their years to the weak light and black sweat, coal killed them.And began again. \nOne small frustration I had with this novel was with Kevin himself. Since he was 14 and was a fish-out-of-water in this small southern town, he could be remarkably dense and na\u00efve. I recognized it as a critical element of the plot that he had to ask lots of questions and would make mistakes, but occasionally it was overdone. But by the end of the book, he has grown up considerably and I liked his story arc.I would recommend this book to those who like literary fiction or sprawling family stories.Favorite Quotes\"It is always strange going to a friend's house for the first time, as if you are invading a secret world they try to keep apart from you.\"\"Men like Bubba Boyd think the earth owes them a living.

Author Christopher Scotton has created a beautifully-written novel which I couldn't help but think of as a modern-day \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". He has combined a coming-of-age tale with stories of tragedy, the power of love over hate, the complexities of the coal mining economy, and a deep reverence for the beauty of nature and a sense of place. The characters in this book are well-developed, and I imagine readers will have their favorites, as I did. The plot may get a wee bit fantastical toward the end, but first-time novelist Scotton is forgiven because the rest of the novel is so strong (note for the author: next time one or two catastrophes are enough -- they don't need to pile on each other).Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5159698-mary", "userReview": "There has been a lot of buzz building around the debut novel of Christopher Scotton titled, The Secret Wisdom of the Earth. The publisher has announced a print run of 100,000 \u2014- unheard of for a first novel \u2014- and many of the early reviews have been gushing. I picked up an ARC a few weeks ago, and trust me -- the hype is justified.The Secret Wisdom of the Earth is one of the most beautifully written novels I\u2019ve read in many years. The prose is breathtaking at times and the imagery transports you to the hills and hollows, the small towns and coal seams of eastern Kentucky in ways few writers can master. The characters are pitch-perfect, genuine, real, and stay with you throughout the next day after reading the book the evening before. Even weeks later I am thinking about them, about their lives...hard to believe they are not still living in Medgar, Kentucky, but only exist in the pages of this captivating story. At the book's conclusion I wanted to plan a roadtrip to witness the beauty of the region, cringe at the horror of flat-topped mountains, glimpse the waterfall at Juke's Hollow, or slowly cruise past the porch at 22 Chishold and see who might be sitting there....The impeccable pacing of the novel propels the story to a suspenseful, shocking conclusion. It's one of those delicious books I have stayed up all night to finish, wanting to know what happens, yet not wanting it to end!Yes, it\u2019s a coming of age novel...but its themes go so much deeper. It\u2019s about love, loss, prejudice and the connective tissue that joins us to each other and to the earth -\u2014 all of it wrapped in a gripping, page-turning story of survival and redemption in the back woods of Kentucky.Christopher Scotton is a huge new talent and this is a novel that will be discussed and dissected for years to come.

I suspect, however, the spell it cast over me is a bit different than the one cast for others, mainly due to my own geography and relationship to mining (not in Kentucky and not coal mining, but in southern Arizona where copper mining \u201cis king\u201d as was quoted recently in our local paper over a mining \u2018victory\u2019 that will scrape away sacred Native American land).This debut is a fabulous coming-of-age story about 14-year-old Kevin, who bears witness to a horrific family tragedy and upon going to Kentucky to live with his grandfather, \u201cPops,\u201d does a great deal of growing up. In many ways, the story reminded me of the popular Stand By Me film (originally a Stephen King novella titled, The Body) in its depiction of a simpler life and boyhood friendships (Kevin falls in with local Hollow kid, Buzzy Fink). But while Kevin is introduced to the slower pace and spiritual connections of the earth, he is also witness to the ravages of coal mining on the environment. And to the brutal ignorance of members of a small town.This book is cocooned in so many layers of moral/ethical/environmental themes, yet it is not in any way preachy. It does what today\u2019s journalism should do: it presents an unbiased, two-sided story illustrating that the world\u2019s appetite for natural resources isn\u2019t cut-and-dry. It\u2019s one of many themes tucked neatly into Kevin\u2019s journey, through the lives of multigenerational mining families and opponents who appear in the story as flawed and realistic characters. Mining presents a fitting backdrop that parallels the personal loss suffered by many of the characters within this book.Scotton has created a novel that entices readers to think \u2013 one that challenges the \u201cit\u2019s ok as long as it\u2019s not in my backyard \u2013 or as along as I can\u2019t see it\u201d mentality toward large-scale mining operations \u2013 all in a way that is not the least bit overbearing. During an extended mountain trip with Pops, Kevin is explaining the wild beauty of the mountains surrounding him: \u201cThe trees were lush and large, with holly, mountain laurel, and dogwood filling in the forest floor.\u201d And then he notes the sight as they come toward the evidence of mountaintop-removal mining: \u201cAs we came over a gentle rise, the trees ended abruptly. What lay before us was a scene of unimaginable devastation.\u201dMidway through this whopping 480-page book, I had already decided it was going to be passed along to my 14-year-old nephew: for its wisdom, for its introduction to the redemptive nature of nature (a concept completely foreign to so many young people today) and for its entertainment value (Pops has some good one-liners). Yet for all of the environmental takeaways I personally experienced, this is just a GOOD story: a book offering lessons of hope and forgiveness, acceptance and tolerance, loyalty and trust.If you are a fan of young adult fiction (while the story is a recollection of an adult Kevin looking back, it reads in his 14-year-old point of view until the very end), and enjoy coming-of-age stories, this is the book for you. Could it have been shorter? Sure. But despite its heft, it is a quick, satisfying read with true substance. I look forward to this author\u2019s future work.

I had been meaning to read it since it was first published and knew the timing was perfect since there would be several long days of cruising at sea. It is just the kind of book that I love: a coming of age story set in the hills of Kentucky, with a wise old grandfather, and plenty of heart-breaking problems and a bit of mystery and danger to keep the plot moving forward steadily. Kevin Gillooly and his mother leave their home in Indiana to spend the summer with Pops in Kentucky to try to recover from the death of Kevin's three-year-old brother in a hideous home accident. Kevin's father blames Kevin for the death, which adds the burden of guilt to the young man's grief. And mom is almost catatonic in her own grief. Will being in her childhood home help her recover and return to life?The story is also about the issues surrounding modern-day strip-mining for coal or 'mountain-top relocation.' Bubba Boyd, the big money guy, wants to buy Pop's old boyhood homestead in Jukes Hollow for storing his sludge. \"Men like Bubba Boyd think the earth owes them a living. They take whatever wealth they can from the mountains and move on.

When Paul, the local hair dresser and the leader of the environmental group against the mountain-top mining, is brutally murdered, Kevin becomes aware that his new best friend Buzzy knows who committed the crime and may be in danger himself. Pops plans a tramp up the mountain to Jukes Hollow and takes the two teens along but trouble follows them and results in a \"Deliverance\" style scenario that requires courage, strength, and ingenuity from all three. It's hard to believe this is Christopher Scotton's first novel--it is that good! The ending could have used some polishing but my rating still falls somewhere between 4.5 and 5 stars.

Hard to put down - the author does a great job with creating atmosphere and helping you to see the beauty of the Appalachian mountains, as well as the horror of what modern coal mining does to those mountains.A 3.5 for me. The story dragged a little at the end and some of the characters were a bit too archetypical for me, but rounding up for a good story well told."}, {"userName": "Phyllis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis", "userReview": "A horrible accident at home sends this fourteen year old boy and his mother to her father's home in a small mining town in Appalachia.

As an author, he is as down to earth as the characters he has crafted in his debut novel. Knowing that the inspiration behind this novel is based on a true life event and that it took Mr. Scotton 15 years to complete the manuscript had me reading the story through a different lens than normal -- one that enhanced the experience. At its simplest, this is a coming of age story, but it is much more complex than that. There are lessons to be gleaned, but the book is not didactic by any means. The setting in the Appalachians is wonderfully detailed in description as are the characters in the book. I read this immediately upon receiving an Advanced Reading Copy and I could not put it down until I was finished. I predict this will be a breakout hit of 2014."}, {"userName": "Morris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32911939-morris", "userReview": "For the first time, I feel like a jerk for giving something three stars as opposed to four, because at its heart \u201cThe Secret Wisdom of the Earth\u201d is a solid four-star novel. There are some plot flaws that made me feel the need to dock a star, and they may not bother others, so please research other reviews along with mine to determine if this novel is right for you.\u201cThe Secret Wisdom of the Earth\u201d is a coming-of-age tale in the slice-of-life tradition. It meanders through the beautiful world of the Kentucky mountains, creating a respect within the reader for the beauty and fragility of nature. Mixed in are the very real issues of coal mining, poverty, and homophobia. All are handled in a realistic and unflinchingly honest way.The main characters of Kevin, Pops, and Buzzy are likable and flawed, making them people whom those from all walks of life can relate. The supporting characters are all given complex stories and personalities that make you want to sit around at the diner and get to know them better.Given all of these positives, you may be wondering why the three-star rating. The problem comes at the end. While some issues were not resolved, and should not have been, there were others that were not addressed at all, leaving the reader with no closure. On the opposite end, there was too much closure in the epilogue, with as many personal details crammed in as possible. It cluttered what would have been such a great book had the ending simply addressed the initial themes as opposed to ignoring them for the minor details.I don\u2019t regret reading \u201cThe Secret Wisdom of the Earth\u201d, but I do have mixed feelings about it. I can neither recommend nor not recommend this novel.This review is based upon a complimentary copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/219670-janet", "userReview": "Scotton's book is a completely engrossing coming-of-age novel that reads like a classic from page one. It's literary fiction with an astoundingly wide breadth in terms of characters, plot, and language. The only thing I'd changed about this book? Its title (and perhaps the cover art, too): I feel like many readers who are meant to have this book will be turned off by the title and design. TRUST ME: read it.

This book was very engrossing and encompassed every thing I love about a good book.I have to admit that the beginning started kind of slow. Written by a male, the writing reflects a bit of the technical aspects of a boy in his youth. I kept reading because I enjoyed the slow build up. I really felt like I got to know the characters and the town of Medger enough to picture myself there. By chapter two I could understand that this book didn\u2019t need the feminine style of writing to draw emotion out of me. The characters have so much depth it is almost written as if it was a memoir. A real person can feel like this, can remember like this. The story builds up to an adventure that changes the lives of the characters, and indeed the whole town, involved.This is an epic coming of age that I easily see becoming a movie. I spent two hours after reading this book crying inconsolably. I don\u2019t think that the book was meant to draw that kind of emotion. I just grew so attached to the characters that I wept even harder knowing the story was actually over. I can\u2019t go back now and feign ignorance of their fate. I want to very badly. These characters have become like my own kin, and I wish I could turn back the clock and move to Medger to be close to them.It is hard to believe this was a debut novel!

I know there has been a lot of buzz about this book so I feel like I am going out on a limb here to say that I did not love this book - I really just sort of liked it - barely. It really pains me that this book was not as great as I expected because it has not only received the aforementioned buzz, it is Parnassus' Books First Edition pick for January and those who know me know how much I love Ann Patchett and I usually love her picks. Nevertheless, I found the plot to be extremely fractured- was it about mountain top mining, were we taking a visit to Mayberry, were we on the raft with Huck Finn, painting the fence with Tom Sawyer, grieving over the loss of a loved one, yada, yada, yada? It just did not gel for me. Yes, the characters were (I can't say well-drawn) easily relatable but only in one-dimension and very stereotypical. The overly long descriptions of each and every rock and hollow require me to say something about how looooong this book is. Could have been at least 100 pages shorter. Oh yes and the ending was horribly cliched and felt like a tack on.I must add the caveat that I read this as and ARC from the publisher so maybe some of these problems were cleared up in editing, but this was just not my fave- by far. You know how you either love Jonathan Franzen or you hate him? My prediction is that this book is going to elicit the same sort of reactions in people. We shall see but this one definitely does not receive my stamp of approval."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18279306-stacy", "userReview": "**I won an uncorrected proof of this novel as part of the Goodreads First Reads giveaway program.**Wow. Wow. Wow. I am absolutely amazed at the caliber of this novel. The writing was absolutely brilliant. The main character and narrator of the story, Kevin, moves to Kentucky for the summer and experiences so much in that short period of time. The characters were all complex and well-thought-out. The story was both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. The words on the pages seemed all too real. I highly recommend this exquisite work of art and hope it becomes an immense success. It really does hold the \"secret wisdom of the Earth\" in its pages. I hope the author continues writing novels like this one.

I picked up  The Secret Wisdom of the Earth  as it was set in a rural community of Appalachia Kentucky. While Rash's Appalachian material always feels real, author Christopher Scotton's felt arbitrary and forced. While some narrative flowed, much of it felt awkward, somewhat like an individual speaking a foreign language. The story itself was engaging and enough happens to keep the reader turning the pages.

There were some creative turns that had me saying, \"Nice.\" This was an endearing coming of age story of two teenage boys trying to navigate life in a rural mining town.
