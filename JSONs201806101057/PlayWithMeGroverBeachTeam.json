Just...\n Let's be honest here, i did not have high expectations for this book. I thought it'll be a 3-4 star read.It was so freaking hilarious! I haven't laughed this much in what seems like a very long time.Meet the main characters!\nLiza Matthews has had a crush on her best friend Tony since kindergarten. She's dying to see him after he went away to soccer camp, but when he finally arrives he has his sight on another girl. And worse, she's a soccer player. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Liza deciding to fight for her boy joins the team.In enter...\n\nRyan stood over me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cDying.\u201d \nThe tryouts end up a total catastrophe, the first match ends up bloody and the morning after the selection party she wakes up in the worst place possible\u2014in the arms of the captain of the soccer team. The hottest guy in school - Ryan Hunter. Which boy will Liza play with? Will Ryan win her heart over?\n\nWhat i thought of Liza?:\n I don't think i have ever adored a main female protagonist so much. She wasn't annoying like all the other female characters and for that i am so grateful. I could extremely easily understand and connect with her because she was very much like myself - sarcastic, didn't let people bring her down, and had the most amazing comebacks ever. They had me laughing out loud. Although i was a little bit angry at her for still having a crush on Tony after what a jerk he was to her, i was like...\n\nWhat i thought of Ryan?:\n\n\nI absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Ryan! He was so sexy, sweet and just swoon worthy. Ladies, you will need a bib because you will drool all over the place. He was also a very interesting character to read about. I only wish we would get more background about him, and more scenes where he's at least half naked wink**.\nLiza's and Hunter's relationship was beautiful at it's worst. It was heart-warming and heart-melting and just 'awww'. I love them together so much! And i simply adored reading the romantic and not so scenes between them - like every time Hunter climbed through Liza's window.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass, you know.\u201d I shoved his shoulder, grinning at him.The roguish gleam in his eyes captured me. \u201cI\u2019ve been told girls go for that.\u201d\n\nOverall\n\nPlay With Me was a fabulous book that i inhaled in one day. Din't want to put it down. A very sweet, short 200 pages novella that i recommend to everyone who loves romance books. A perfect summer read. Although, you might want to re-think if you're the type of reader who hates love triangles and girl having a crush on her best friend.I'm dying to read Hunters POV. So if anyone has a spare copy or something let me know!"}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024056-karla", "userReview": "4.5 Sexy Soccer Player Stars! Someone find me a time machine so I can climb in, go back to high school, and find me a Ryan Hunter!Young love, it can be so cruel, but it can also be so good and incredibly sweet! This was excellent! The cover and the price were what caught my eye, then I read the sample, I immediately one-clicked, because I was hooked! This is an adorable, swoon-worthy story with some really great characters. It's amusing, fun and it doesn't wallow in angst, which made it that much better. Liza's confused and hurt, but an unexpected boy comes into her life, makes her forget and she finds herself falling for him...just as I did. Ryan Hunter where were you when I was back in high school? You were there, you just didn't see me. So, I lived my teenage fantasy through Liza Matthews, and for a while Ryan Hunter was mine too! I love a good YA, was in the mood for one, and this was exactly what I was looking for! This is a read that will appeal to all ages. The writing is very good, the dialogue is witty and cute...and lots of it...and the story is entertaining. For a few hours it took this older reader back to her youth, and I had a blast! Oh my, young love and your first kiss...*sigh*I see there is a version of this story, Ryan Hunter, written from Ryan's point of view. The author did a wonderful job portraying a teenage girl, now I'm curious to see what she does with a boy's. More time with Ryan Hunter...woohoo! Guess what I'll be reading this afternoon?!9/28/13 ~  Play With Me is only $0.99 for Kindle. Worth every penny for this well done YA novella!"}, {"userName": "Lex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5559618-lex", "userReview": "Wow. I love this book. Full review when I wake up later. ;)Morning came... and I still love this novella. I think this is the first book after months that really made me giddy because of the sweetness? Ah! I don't know what to phrase it in English but we do have this word in Tagalog called 'kilig'. \nkilig (KEE-lig) \u2013 To shiver. When used in topics of love and romance, it means to shiver with delight when something romantic or cute...\n That's what I freakin' felt while reading this novella. I'm grinning from ear to ear (Thank God it's night time when I read this), stupidly feeling happy and I've been biting my lower lip while reading to stop myself from smiling. BUT I JUST CAN'T HELP IT. \nA smirk played around one corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my time of numb indifference is over.\u201d His thumb had started drawing small circles on my skin. \u201cSo, unless you\u2019re up for some trouble now, would you mind moving your leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cI strongly suggest you don\u2019t do that. During a game you will have to stop the ball. But you\u2019re not allowed to use your hands. So you use your body to block it. Your shoulders, or head, but mostly your chest.\u201d\u201cAha. There\u2019s only one problem with that.\u201d I cupped my boobs with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got these!\u201dStruck silent, his gaze traveled from my eyes downward and didn\u2019t return. The spark in his eyes almost scared me. Like I was Snow White and he was the\u2026Hunter. In fact, I didn\u2019t want to even imagine what thoughts crossed his mind right then. I sapped my fingers between our faces. \u201cEyes up here.\u201d He obeyed. Reluctantly. The sliver of an impish smile crept to his lips\nIt's a light novella, a bit predictable, BUT I really love it cause it made me really really smile, an honest-to-goodness smile. An innocent smile and laugh, not the smile because I know something would lead to something adult-like. LOL. I've been reading new-adult books a lot now, so this is just a good change of pace."}, {"userName": "Katrina Passick Lumsden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden", "userReview": "If it was Piper Shelly's intent to showcase the shallow nature of teenagers, she's succeeded spectacularly with this book and its sequel. I can't quite figure out how to describe Shelly's writing. I think she has potential. She knows how to pace, at least, and her plots could make for some compelling reads, but her characters and the attention she pays to detail are abysmal. The reader isn't led into the story and shown around so much as thrust into the middle of an OC-style melodrama. And don't read this hoping for any kind of emotional depth because there isn't any. Probably a read teenagers would love since there's a lot of angst and kissing and whatnot, but the emotional connection that most seasoned readers require is glaringly absent."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3515482-rachel", "userReview": "Very cute and sweet!

I'm really glad I accidentally read book two first. I really enjoyed this story from Ryan's pov and the longer story. This is an enjoyable ya romance though and I will continue this series.Lisa is in love with her childhood friend Tony. They do everything together but she's almost seventeen and they have never even kissed. She's surprised when he comes back from soccer camp and everything seems off. Tony's friend Ryan, captain of the soccer team, pressures her to tryout for the new co-ed team and she gives in. When he offers to give her personal training she agrees too. For some reason she can't say no to Ryan Hunter."}, {"userName": "Geri Reads", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11757728-geri-reads", "userReview": "4.5 Very cute, *sigh*, young love stars!!It's been quite a long time since I've read a true-blue YA book like this one. I say, true-blue because this book and others like it (see Julie Prestsater's So I'm a Double Threat as an example) has a more, shall I say, realistic portrayal of high school love and the drama that goes along with it. And personally, I find these books endearing and it takes me back to, well, my own high school days. :)Play With Me tells the story of Liza Matthews, a semi-awkward high school student who's been in love with her best friend, Tony, since kindergarten. Unfortunately for Liza, Tony returned from soccer camp in love, but *gasp*, not with her but with another girl. In order to get close to Tony and steal his attention away from his new love interest, Liza joined the soccer team organized by the boy's soccer team. Determined to fight for her man, Liza accepted Ryan Hunter's proposal to help her with her soccer skills. Ryan Hunter, by the way, is the team captain. Gorgeous, loaded and actually very sweet. And he seems to enjoy Liza's company as much as she's enjoying his. But of course, not everything is quite what it seemed and when secrets started coming out, Liza must choose between Tony and Ryan. No worries though for all of you love-triangle-trope haters like me, this isn't a love triangle per se. Just one heck of a confuse girl who needs a little push in the right direction. Very entertaining, very sweet, very cute novella about the joys and pitfalls of young love. I really enjoyed myself. Ryan Hunter is a wonderful hero and Liza is adorable. A great novella to read in between \"heavier\" themed books. Definitely worth it!"}, {"userName": "Sheryl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6039696-sheryl", "userReview": "Scarily enough, I LOVED this story..... 0_o Lke I REALLY LOVED IT!!!

So when Tony comes back from soccer camp obviously infatuated with a girl that plays in the team, she decides the only way to win him back is to enter the team herself. But once there, she captures the attention of the team's captain, Ryan Hunter, who's a known playboy. And the fun begins:)A book that forces me to put two very nice books I was already reading on hold, leaves me with a huge smile on my face and an incredible itch on my finger that will 99% force me to press the one-click-buy button within the next couple of hours in order to buy the second book (which is essentially the same story from the hero's POV), obviously deserves a place in my keepers shelf.This freebie is certainly one of the best books I read this year and I can't wait to see Ryan's POV (even though two GR friends warned me I might get bored if I read them back to back!). But I can't get enough of Ryan, sorry girls!I only wish this was a bit longer. I needed a couple more meetings between them before the big night. And though I loved the epilogue, those two were so cute together, I needed a bit more of their HEA too.

This story was a quick read and I wanted more but when I found out there is going to be a book from Hunter's POV I just about had a heart attack and when you read this book you see why. There was so much going on in my head when I read this book because the story flowed so smooth that at times I had to say WTF when one of the characters acted up.So the low down is this Liza Matthews has loved her best friend and partner in crime Tony since she was in Kindergarten. She has done every thing with him and they have spent night after night with each other. Yes they are best friends but Liza seriously loves Tony and she is head over heels with him and she decides that this is going to be the summer because she is going to tell him how she feels. Well let's just say that it does not work out that way but what does happen is EPIC because Liza is about to find out what kind of best friend Tony is and what it feels like to have a broken heart only to discover that the person you thought you loved all this time is actually not the person you REALLY love.This is where Tony's best friend and Soccer Captain Hunter Ryan comes in. Lord he is hot sex on a platter and he plays soccer my favorite sport in the whole wide world! See Hunter has a secret and when that secret comes out Liza and Tony's life and Hunter's will change in the blink of an eye. What happens when Liza and Tony and Hunter's worlds collide and the secrets are revealed and the lies are uncovered and hearts are broken and fists start flying? Well you have to read it to find out!"}, {"userName": "Jo \u2605The Book Sloth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13870608-jo-the-book-sloth", "userReview": "This book was like a chocolate snack between two main meals-short,fast and yummy!Liz is about to be 17 and she has never kissed a boy because she is in love with her best friend Tony who has a passion for soccer and is suddenly interested in another soccer girl! Liz is determined that Tony and her are meant to be together and in order to win him over she signs in the tryouts for the soccer team. Team captain Ryan Hunter takes it on him to teach Liz soccer and everything else if she only takes her eyes from Tony.Liz at the beginning of he book seems a little naive and childish with her \"Liz+Tony=LFE\" ideas but she gets over it.Now I know I've said I don't like triangles but this book was fast and without the usual pathetic \"oh, I love them both\", \"oh, I don't want to hurt them\", \"oh, I'm a little slut and have two bfs\", so that at the end I really had no problem with it. Of course the book didn't exactly have a plot to brag about and it wasn't all that original so you may ask why the 4 stars. It was the fact that I had a good time reading it and I believe that this is the goal of such books, not heavy thinking, not emotional turmoil, just something pleasant to read and forget.Btw I loved Ryan(sexy,easy-going,considerate) and absolutely hated Tony(ignorant,idiot,pathetic).

It was free, so I snapped it up and decided to read it immediately because I was looking for something light and fun. It turned out to be exactly what I needed and I really enjoyed reading it!Lisa has spent the summer waiting for Tony to come back and when he does he seems to brush her off a little, wanting to go to the local cafe to discuss the mixed soccer team. Even though Tony invited her to go along, I could see that she was hurt by his actions, and it didn\u2019t stop there as he interacted with Chloe, who is also a soccer player; they are a bit touchy and sweet to one another. So when she is challenged by Ryan to try out for the team she doesn\u2019t hesitate. After her disastrous day on the grass, she somehow makes the team and finally gets to go to one of Ryan\u2019s famous parties.I really liked Lisa! She was willing to step out of her comfort zone to try and get the guy she likes to see her as more than his best friend. She was a little naive at times, not being more careful at parties, but that\u2019s due to lack of experience and being only sixteen. I liked seeing her interact with Ryan, and how she was oblivious to the crush he had on her. Just the simple things like going out of his way to talk to her, inviting her to try out and to his party, and helping her take her mind of things when she needed it most.The whole story was entertaining and light! I loved going back to high school and experiencing those feelings; the crushes, being part of a team and the sadness of feelings not being mutual. I liked seeing the connection between Lisa and Ryan grow; Lisa is unsure of her feelings, but the heated glances from Ryan made me giggle like a school girl! Tony made me a little cranky though; he was a crappy best friend. He withheld information from Lisa and would forget about her. But I was happy Ryan was there to swoop in and save the day!This is the first book I have read by Piper Shelly, and she has found an instant fan in me!

WHY is this over?!This book is soooo good! I wish it wasn't a novella and that I hadn't finish in one freakin' sitting <_<Liza is in love with her best friend from since kindergarten. They've done it all, slept in each other's bed, spend the night over, him sneaking in her bedroom window. The only thing is - they've never kissed. He's simply her best friend. The guy who teases her like any normal couple, plays with her hair and tell her how sexy she is - the guy who'll beat up someone who insults his girl. But alas... they're the best of friends - but Liza is adamant about him being her future husband. After all, they are the M&M couple.! But a few weeks away at soccer camp not only brought her back Tony, but a bimbo she just couldn't stand - a bimbo who won over Tony, who in turn kept it all from Liz because the jerk knew how Liz felt about him. (Ok, he's not really a jerk!) Liz fumed with jealousy and to make sure she can win over Tony, she joins the soccer team, something she is sure was a hidden plague that'll end the world! lmaoBut joining the team, even though she royally sucked (also thanks to the teasing comments from Hunter), she found herself spending more time with Hunter himself, the team captain. Might I add that he's so sweet, funny, sexy, charismatic and just down to earth? Yeah, he's rich too but he's not snobby about it. Ryan Hunter just makes you go ga-ga over him and completely makes you forget about Tony. No joke. He's always there for Liza and as she spends more time with him, the things that usually make her go crazy over Tony, was replaced by Hunter. Not to mention she found herself thinking about him more and more. An undeniable attraction grows, and soon, instead of Tony being her first kiss..Ryan got the honor. SQUEEE!!!!!I fell in love with both Liza and Ryan. Liza wasn't a push over, she was quick witted and funny, plus Ryan just knew what to say and do to make her smile and forget. He is so amazing, omg just makes you turn to mush <3I love how Tony backed down when he realized he lost his chance. The fact that he felt that she'll always be there because she love him made me pissed at him for a moment. Seriously? Comfort isn't always a sure thing Tony! I wanted him to win her for the first 5 pages or so lol, but the moment Hunter was introduced I was lost in his tiger eyes. He is so smooth, so...sexy in all he do. That dude has moves that'll turn you to mush and still beg for the spark to ignite you. I love him and glad the years of silently watching on the side line paid off. You go Hunter!!This book is fun, quick-witted, seriously funny and the characters are likable (except for ms. Bimbo). I'm already fixated on a next read by Piper Shelly.READ THIS BOOK - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! Epilogue rant\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be with you and protect you all evening. No one gets to gnaw on you.\u201d He leaned in and softly bit into my earlobe. \u201cApart from me, that is.\u201dI totally had a squee moment; Ryan is so fucking hot (I seriously tried my hardest not to curse but it needed to be said. HE. IS. AH-FUCKING-MAZING!!!!I love that even though Ryan got the girl, adores her to bits - he still had that moment of insecurity; he knows Liza was hung up over Tony for years - hell everyone knew and the reality of what ifs when it comes to her feelings was still there, even with the happiness it brings. I just love how real this book is!! Gah. Tony is amazing. His and Liza's reunion wasnt that awkward, and although their friendship wouldn't be the same, it's still pretty solid and that's always good. She still has Tony AND snag an amazing guy like Hunter. Fucking lucky girl ;)Sigh... Oh Ryan... Why is my heart still fluttering by simply thinking of your? *Plucks up Ryan Hunter and run away with him*  That dude is officially added to my hubby lists. Tony is a side dish. (Can't let him get away cuz he's freakin' hot and something kinna amazing too <3 *waggles brows*"}, {"userName": "Lyra Gill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5443076-lyra-gill", "userReview": "UPDATEDThis review is also posted HERE.Damn it, I can't stop smiling. It's been four days since I finished reading this story and I still can't stop smiling! I know that Play with Me is rather short, but wow, it sure did hit the mark with only 30,000 words. I finished this novella in one sitting (I did have to pause sometimes to shut my eyes and squeal silently - don't judge!) and I had this huge cheshire cat grin on my face almost all throughout! This book is such an amazing fun read. Read it after you read those heavy Mature YA/ New Adult novels; heck, read it if you want a permanent grin tatooed on your face. Play with Me is the perfect feel-good book! If that's not enough to coax you into giving this one a shot, hey, I don't know what's wrong with you.As I said before, the plotline's a little overused, but that's somehow part of this novella's charm. I knew from the get go that I would be reading a fun, light (sorry, I just can't use these adjectives enough) story, and that was indeed what I got. Despite this book's length, I found out that I was able to know everything that I needed to know about the characters - I love that Shelly was still able to provide a sufficient background to make everything about this novella enjoyable, and I truly enjoyed Play with Me from start to finish. Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised at how tightly edited the book was. I don't remember finding any grammatical errors; every word in the book contributed to the story - Shelly definitely didn't dilly-dally, and I loved that!I adored the characters - I liked Liza from the very first page, and I'm pretty sure a lot of girls who have been largely ignored by their guy friends in a romantic sense would have no problem relating to her. And of course, we have Ryan Hunter. Good god how perfect is that name? As much as I liked Liza, what made this book such an amazing read would have to be this guy. He has such a way with words, and I love how he treated Liza. He never took her for granted, and he was always there to make her smile. The chemistry between these two was off-the-charts - their playful banter had me biting my lip while trying my hardest not to smile. (I still ended up grinning though!)The lemon surprise. Man I've tried making this review as coherent as possible but I think I'm going to give that notion up. This part? Sizzling hot! My breath hitched, my heart started pounding quicker, and I ended up letting out this high-pitched squeal. Just writing about it right now has already caused my heart rate to increase! Also, I loved how Shelly hinted at Hunter's feelings for Liza through some choice words and little but obvious actions and reactions.I did like Tony and Liza's friendship. How can you not like M&M even just a tiny bit? They've been friends since they were in kindergarten and they were so ridiculously comfortable with each other. I'm actually a bit envious of their friendship! However, while it was blatantly obvious that they adored and cherish each other, it was also apparent that Tony took Liza for granted, and I did kind of hate him for that. Though a part of me is satisfied by how this novella ended, I really wish it could have been just a little longer because I would have loved to see how Tony and Liza's friendship mature.If it's still not obvious enough, I simply LOVED this book. I loved it so much that I'm actually seriously considering buying a paperback even though I've never bought one from Amazon and even though I already have an ebook copy. Also, I think that my blind adoration for this book is properly represented by all the 'grin', 'fun', 'perfect' and 'love' in this review. Initially, I rated this novella at 3.5 stars but because I've already reread it (after only four days of finishing it!) and because I can't stop thinking about it, I'm bumping up my rating to a well-deserved 5 stars. Seriously - this is the perfect fun, light read that you will love and make you grin non-stop!

It's that the best friend never gets the girl. Ever. Yeah, thank you so much John Hughes! *crawls into a rabbit hole* *sobs hysterically*Trust me Duckie, I know.WHY DIDN'T SHE CHOOSE DUCKIE? WHY OH WHY? BE STILL, MY BROKEN HEART!Anyway...THE BLURBLiza Matthews has been planning her wedding to best friend Tony Mitchell since forever. And after being apart for 5 whole weeks because he was at soccer camp, Liza can't wait to make up for some quality time they missed out. But wait, why is that Barbie Clone ogling Tony? And as if that is not bad enough, Liza finds out that she's also a soccer player. A soccer player! That means, more time with her instead of Liza. In all the years they have been best friends, never did Liza need to compete for Tony's attention... until now. But she can't let this past. And unfortunately, she only has one solution. She has to be a soccer player.THE CHARACTERSLIZA MATTHEWSTo be honest, I didn't really like her. She was okaaaay, I guess. I liked some of her witty comebacks but she's not a heroine I would go gaga over. I don't hate her though. I can't hate someone who makes me feel like I'm the most athletic person in the world. Mwahaha!But seriously Liza, you've been friends with him for years. If nothing has happened between the two of you by now, nothing will. Get the message:But then he actually does. So what now?Advice? Bring out your DVD copy of The O.C.RYAN HUNTERI'm on TEAM SWEET-GUY forever. They make my knees go weak. And though Ryan's a sweet guy, his feelings for Liza seemed kinda forced. Guess he's just...TONY MITCHELLLike I said, I usually go for the best friend, but in this case, I never sided with Tony.Dear Tony, And you bleeeeew it! Better luck next book dude.You tell 'em again, Summer Roberts!OVERALLPredictable, yes! But I can't help it if I'm a genius and can predict 101% of the scenes. The scenes.There were scenes were I snorted and thought, \"what the hell\"? But then I told myself...And when yourself talk to you in a form of a young Miley Cyrus's GIF, you should listen and take everything in. Seriously, Miley has been through enough. Her experience put her next to Mr Miyagi. Her wisdom is just beyond levels! LOL.I originally gave this a three, but then I hovered my cursor again and I just had to change it to two 'cause it really was just okay.So if you're tired of reading dystopian novels and you want to read something sweet and light, then PLAY WITH ME is the perfect choice for you. It doesn't have a complicated story but it is not one without romantic fluffiness. If anything, it's an okaaaay breather."}, {"userName": "Karla Mae (Reads and Thoughts)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6756923-karla-mae-reads-and-thoughts", "userReview": "I honestly have this secret and weird obsession with short stories/novellas. There's just this sense of easiness with reading them and the story just easily sucked me up into their world. It jumps right into the story and we easily get to know the characters and their backgrounds in not so many words and the story just seems to zoom right in front of your eyes. A good example of this is Play With Me. Sigh. This is one of those times that I want to lengthen the story. It contains everything a story needs but you really just couldn\u2019t help but to want more.Liza is in love with her best friend Tony. When she decides it\u2019s already time to tell him that's also the time he chose to show interest with someone else. She tries her best to gets his attention and with that she finds herself in a much deeper doodoo - she begin spending time with Ryan Hunter - the soccer team captain and a really good friend of Tony -- and she even find herself awake on his bed.Not even on the half of this story it is much obvious how much Ryan has a thing for Liza. Their relationship was pretty sweet and swoony for me and the way it blossom was just too much for me to handle. I wanted to squeal with all my heart. The way they call each other by their last names \u2013 Sigh. I want more of Liza and Ryan and I do hope Tony would find his better half.Play With Me is the first story by Piper Shelly that I've read and this would definitely not my last.

Thank you very much! ^_^ Just AMAZING! MORE! MORE! MORE PLEASE! I enjoyed this a lot. Liza and Tony have been friends for like, forever, and Liza had it in her head that they were bound to be together forever. She was always doing things for him and him alone. She totally believed that eventually, Tony will look her way. Personally, I didn't like Tony's character from the start because hellooo? How could he be so dense? It's either he's ignoring Liza's efforts or he's just plain dumb. Anyway, just when Liza was all set to prove to Tony that she's the perfect girl for him, fate has another plan for her. She gets to meet Ryan, my new ya crush ;p.. and everything changed. She started to hang out with Ryan and finally realized that things are hotter with him than with her best friend.
