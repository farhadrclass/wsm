Her mother swears she been clean since her release from prison, but Tess just can't seem to shake the feeling that her mom may be involved somehow \u2013 a feeling that only intensifies when her mother appears to have skipped town.The one thing I always love about this series is without question is Tess\u2019s vivid personality. I feel like I know her so well, but at the same time, each story reveals yet another facet of her character that I didn\u2019t know about yet. In this case, more is revealed about her past than before, as well as her thoughts and feelings about being a mother, which are both intense and fiercely protective.This story also struck a chord with me because of the realness of the opioid epidemic. It has been an issue in many states for quite some time, but I feel like it\u2019s just recently been talked about on a mass scale. The fight against drugs and addiction is rarely one that isn\u2019t relevant, and that story proves that it truly does cross all boundaries and all walks of life.One thing that Gilbert also does well is make Tess completely aware that there is a good chance that she\u2019ll be in over her head. Instead of blindly walking into a situation, Tess acknowledges that, yes, this may not be ideal, but she\u2019s going to go for it \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve definitely set some wheels in motion. The only question is if I can keep them moving on the right course, or if they\u2019ll wind up crushing me.\u201d I just appreciate that upfront approach that keeps Tess from being a mystery novel caricature but rather a real person with layers and depth.Though this story can be read as a standalone, personally, I recommend starting at the beginning. The reading experience will be that much richer and deeper for it. I can\u2019t wait for Tess\u2019s next adventure. Recommended for fans of both mysteries and stories with a strong female protagonist.I received a complimentary copy of this novel.

What she does not love is the fact that a dead body has turned up behind her mother's dilapidated old trailer, a corpse that exhibits every sign of a drug overdose. Her mother has only been out of prison for three months, how could this have happened?Using every sleuthing skill that God has given her, and borrowing a few others, Tess extends her trip home; determined to look under every rock to uncover who is on a killing spree in Boone County, West Virginia.

With her quirky personality she draws you in trying to solve the mystery right along with her. She takes risks but not blindly.This series is written in first person POV, which I usually don't like but the author has a great way of taking you along in Tess' thoughts and POV that it didn't bother me at all, I actually enjoyed reading Tess' thoughts and follow her thought pattern.This mystery deals with the issue of drugs and abuse, which is quite a serious topic, but handled in such a way that as reader, it still feel \"light\" for the cozy mystery genre, but not too lightly that the seriousness of these issues fall away.It did felt however that there was a mystery with Axel which was never solved...This series is recommended to fans of cozy mysteries."}, {"userName": "Susan Snodgrass", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7103516-susan-snodgrass", "userReview": "'I'm praying, too, but sometimes prayers need feet.'And Tess Spencer is back. In fine form, I might add. Tess Spencer is a housewife from West Virginia, packing a Glock, fearless, indomitable and determined to solve crime. I fell in love with her spirit in the first book in Heather Gilbert's 'A Murder in the Mountains' series and I hope to continue seeing Tess barreling headlong into sleuthing. This time, Tess's mother, Pearletta Vee has been released from prison and it would seem as if her drug dealing past is producing even more problems when a dead body shows up right in her trailer yard. Tess is there visiting and decides she may as well stick around and see if she can solve this latest crime. Pearletta vanishes before her eyes and the evidence against her is mounting, yet Tess seems to think this is a frame up job. Tess Spencer is not only trying to solve this crime, but also taking a wayward teen in hand, dealing with an abusive grandma and trying to set up her own drug buying deals. She just might be in over her head in this one.Heather Gilbert is great at building suspense here and also in her other books in this series. I read this book in less than a day! Fascinating! Written in first POV, the reader gets inside Tess's mind and see the world from her angle and it's a great way to dive into the story. I loved every minute. And...Gilbert never lets the reader in on the secret until the very end...with a very surprising ending, I might add. I never once had a clue who the culprit was. Bravo!

Too often people turn to pills and other forms of drugs as a form of escape.

And her mom is high on the list of suspects. Can Tess clear Pearletta Vee's name or is she headed back to prison. Gilbert keeps the suspense high throughout the book with several twists and turns to the plot and unexpected happenings. I am usually pretty good at guessing whodunit but this story kept me guessing to the end. Even though this is a third book in a series, the storyline and themes of this book are well developed enough to keep the reader's attention and not leave unanswered questions of what may have happened with the characters previously.The characters, a few from the previous two books and some new ones, are likable and Gilbert brings authenticity to them, allowing readers to see their foibles along with their strengths. Several rather gritty subjects, i.e., illegal drug use, fractured family relationships, and child abuse, are tackled in this story. And yet, readers are not left with a sense of hopelessness as the author brings out the positive aspects of rehab centers, reconciliation, and the foster care system.

A Must Read !Early Reader plus I bought the e-book !!!Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase\"Guilt by Association\" is the third book in Heather Day Gilberts\" A Murder In The Mountains\" series and this is the most exciting one of all! In the first two books (\"Miranda Warning\" and \"Trial by Twelve\") we met most of the characters involved in \"Guilt by Association\" which makes it seem like you are family now as you know these people with their individual characteristics and quirks. As usual Tess is using her ability to perceive the details others may have missed and following through on her impulsive actions to find answers to the questions she has as to how a teen whose overdosed on drugs body ended up beside her formerly incarcerated for drug dealing mothers trailer.Heather Day Gilbert writes in such a manner that once you begin the first sentence you do not want to lay the book down until you finish the final sentence.

Tess is so delightfully flawed and realistic, I can't help but feel a little depressed that her stories might be nearing an end. On one hand, she's so sure of herself, she can barge right into the middle of a crime scene and practically take over. On the other, she's insecure enough about her upbringing that she can't convince herself to relax in her mother's trailer. The setting comes to life in this heartbreaking story about drug use and the lives it destroys. I highly recommend this series and can't wait to find out more about a few side characters."}, {"userName": "Janet Sketchley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3730723-janet-sketchley", "userReview": "When Tess Spencer reluctantly goes to help her ex-con mother hunt for a new home and a dead body turns up behind her mother\u2019s trailer, she has no choice but to stay and clear her mother\u2019s name \u2013 even though she\u2019s afraid her mom might be involved.Along with the mystery, this is a novel with layers of heart. It exposes the tragedy of the drugs that really do run rampant in the areas where the novel is set \u2013 and in so many other parts of North America and the world. It touches briefly on child abuse and foster care.And it shows Tess, away from home and missing her husband and young daughter, comparing the mother-in-law who mothers her with her biological mother who\u2019s let her down more times than she can count.Lest that sound like a depressing read, it\u2019s anything but. The mystery is engaging and fast-paced, there are delightfully quirky characters, there are heart-warming moments and hope.Fans of the series will be pleased and/or intrigued to see Axel again, albeit briefly.

Summoned by her ex-convict, former drug dealing mom, Tess hesitantly takes to the mountains to visit her. Her recent release from prison has Tess wary of spending time with her, and shortly after her arrival the body of a teen aged boy is discovered beside her mom's trailer. It appears the boy has died from a drug overdose. Trouble looms!Multiple characters play key roles throughout this multi layered mystery, and drug abuse is big business in the small town of Boone. Tess can't resist a challenge when it comes to solving a crime, and makes herself \"at home\" in her mom's trailer, intent on discovering whatever information becomes available regarding the teen's death. Her mom disappears, raising concern that her mom may have been involved.Written with depth and detail the author sets up multiple possibilities regarding who might be behind the drug deals occurring in and around Boone. Any one of a number of people could be responsible for mysterious deaths due to bad drugs or drug overdoses. Tess leaves no stone unturned.I found myself holding my breath and reading as fast as I could to discover what was around the next corner! I had absolutely no clue who was wreaking all the havoc within the drug community. Everyone was a suspect, but the answer to my questions was not what I expected.

Tess is a complex character, and in Guilt by Association the reader sees the influences that make Tess who she is. Never one to shy away from a dangerous situation, Tess finds herself in more than a few in this novel. Her mama-bear instincts kick in as well. I loved the sub-plot introduced in which she intervenes in a child\u2019s abusive home life. Tess\u2019 investigation progresses slowly (not a bad thing) with lots of suspects and plot twists. I was surprised by whodunit, and the uncovering of the murderer is filled with suspense and danger \u2014 wonderful page-turning action. Gilbert handles the subject matter of the drug epidemic in an honest and thoughtful manner, and she sheds light on the heartbreak that accompanies the snare of drugs.

While the mystery is the driving force, I love the characters just as much as the suspense. Tess is an awesome character and the rest of her family and friends are a fun, colorful bunch that I wish I could meet. Not only does Heather Day Gilbert do an excellent job developing pre-existing favorites, but she also adds in new characters that are just as interesting.

Even when it seems it is too late.I really like Tess, more with each novel. We learn more of the details of her earlier years and see the beautiful woman of God she is becoming. Nikki Jo would be any girl\u2019s dream mother-in-law, especially after growing up with Pearletta for a mom. Yet Pearletta Vee is different this time, and the past notwithstanding, Tess feels she must do what she can to help her. The characters are so realistic that I wanted to jump through the pages of the book to help Tess \u2013 or stop her from doing one or two things she planned to. Tess\u2019 heart is in the right place, whether it be aching to hold her daughter, helping a young boy who is being abused, or helping Pearletta Vee.There are plot twists that heighten suspense and chills in equal measure; it was hard for this reader to figure out who the bad guy/ gal might be. To find out I was way off base more than once was a mixed relief. I was stunned to find out how street drugs are cut these days; recovery is deep in the heart of our family and I applaud the author for tackling this tough subject. Thank you, Heather Day Gilbert, for showing your readers about the current potentially lethal drug, and demonstrating needs of children effected by their parents\u2019 choices. I highly recommend this outstanding new novel!From a grateful heart: I received a copy of this book from the author, and here is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Beth Heydn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52916313-beth-heydn", "userReview": "Great series!

She works along side homicide detective Zeke Tucker. She has worked with him before in previous murders. Tess's mom has just gotten out of prison and now is seeking Tess's help in getting settled back into society. Pearletta Vee (Tess mom ) served time for abusing drugs and dealing them . So needless to say Tess's childhood wasn't very pleasant. Pearletta asked Tess to come home to Boone and help her find a new house. Tess finally agrees to return home and help her mom find a new house. While Tess is there a local drug addict named Mason is found murdered right in front of Pearletta's mobile home. Mason also works at a local drug rehab center. As soon as the body is discovered Pearletta takes off, leaving Tess to straighten all the mess. There is also a girl named Ruby . How does she fit into all of this ? Why would Tess's mom take off? Is she guilt or simply running scared? Who is Mason and why would someone kill him? Does his job have anything to do with his murder? Mrs. Gilbert has done it again. She has tackled another challenging subject and make it a very interesting read. She isn't afraid to write about subjects that may be hard to write about. Guilt by Association is a suspenseful , page turning book with lots of surprises along the way. It dealt with the crises of drug addiction and how it affects everyone around the addict. It also deals with foster moms . This is the third book in this series . I really enjoyed this book. The author makes subjects that I don't always like to read about interesting. I haven't read the first tow books but I had no trouble following this one. I am looking forward to reading more books from this author .

The author really kept me wondering who did it \u2013 and I had no clue! Tess Spencer is a remarkably likable young woman \u2013 married with a toddler \u2013 who somehow finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery! And not any murder mystery, but one that involves her Mom as well as drug abuse. Tess dealt with a difficult childhood and is still working through the issues and memories of it. At one point she thinks, \u201cSome Cinderella stories are even scarier than the original, because it\u2019s your own flesh and bone who\u2019ve turned against you, not some crazy stepmother.\u201d So, can she forgive her Mom and help her?This is the third book in the Murder in the Mountains series by Heather Day Gilbert. I would recommend reading the previous two first as they do piggy back on each other, but the book is still fabulous as a stand alone title too. I enjoyed this book immensely and recommend it!

The writing itself is realistic and strong, painting the picture of a colorful cast of characters dealing with their own raw emotions and stories. All the characters are unique and memorable, and the plot will leave you thinking you know, only to turn on you some more. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, or is looking to get into the genre.Although this is the 3rd book in the series, it can stand alone (I have not read the prior two books.)I give this book 3.5 stars, and if I'd read the rest of the series beforehand, I'd probably give it a solid 4 stars.*I won this book in a contest the author ran in a Facebook Group.

Tess Spencer is again the main character. She always manages to find herself in the middle of some kind of mystery, usually a murder, and starts investigating to help clear herself or her loved ones. Tess is a delightful character--realistic, down-to-earth, and quirky. You can't help but love her! And the close-calls she keeps getting into. This time she's trying to clear her mom's name. This leads her to live at the trailer park and meet new people. Some kind, some a bit frightening, and even a sweet, innocent little boy who just needs someone to love him.
