It was raw, gory, and downright hypnotizing in a way that I'd never experienced with a YA novel. It ushered me out of that obligatory paranormal romance phase that every middle schooler seems to go through and pulled me into the world of dystopian sci-fi. Jeyn Roberts is one hell of a storyteller, and her characters stuck with me through the years, their strength and bravery serving as inspiration as I waded through the muddy waters of high school.So...what the fuck happened?I waited aeons for this novel. I don't fault Jeyn for that \u2013 I know she had complications with her publishers and I understand that was a major setback, not to mention incredibly disheartening \u2013 but I do fault her for self-publishing a novel that reads like a first or second draft. Truthfully, I'm not sure whether or not this is a good book. The story is definitely there, but many of the characters are lacking their previous emotional depth and the dialogue is messy and unrealistic.And then there were the glaring inconsistencies, which were downright painful at times.Exhibit A:(The last lines of one of Clementine's chapters)\"The baseball bat in her hands seemed like a stupid weapon. Why hadn't she been able to keep hold of her gun? Even if she couldn't shoot, it would at least look more menacing. [...] Clementine took a deep breath and pushed open the door.\"(The first lines of Clementine's next chapter, supposedly picking up exactly where the previous one left off)\"The doors were bolted, but she wasn't going to let that stop her. Standing back, she fired the gun, effectively breaking the lock.\"Uhhh?Not to mention Martin, whose name suddenly became Marvin about halfway through the book, and then continued to alternate between the two for the remainder of the novel. How do you not notice that? Did anyone even bother to edit this?The glaring spelling errors, grammatical fuck-ups, and uncomfortably structured sentences were constantly pulling me out of the story, which was a damn shame because the main plot requires your full, undivided attention. Not because it's overly complex or anything like that, but because it would have been awesome if I'd actually been able to lose myself in it.WARNING: By about page 20, you will be so sick of reading the words \"new world order\" and \"deranged mother nature\" that you will want to hurl the book at a wall whenever they cross the page.Now, onto the characters. If you're looking to avoid spoilers, cease your scrolling now, because the rest of this review is basically just one big spoiler.Michael \u2013 I get that the reader should always be kept on their toes and that the main characters should never be safe and blah blah blah but he literally died within the first half of the book. Like...what? He got as many chapters as Colin. Colin. He doesn't deserve this. Colin \u2013 Speaking of Colin, fuck Colin. Clementine \u2013 Her character arc was actually quite believable and definitely one of the more interesting subplots of the novel. I cried at the end when her inner monologue began with Dear Michael. Raj - He didn't need to die? But at the same time, I feel like the book was improved by his heroic death? Despite the fact that I was in love with him? Unsure how I feel about this. Tears have been shed in his memory.Jordan - Two words: untapped potential. What the fuck happened to his brother? Are you telling me he followed the guy down from Alaska in the hopes that he could find a way to cure him only to immediately stop caring about him as soon as he encounters other teenagers? This brother is mentioned like twice and then completely forgotten about. Also, why does this kid constantly seem to be saving everyone else's ass? Deus ex machina much? Don't get me wrong, I did like him, but I have so many questions.Daniel \u2013 It's obvious that he's Jeyn's favourite character to write, and he's definitely my favourite character to read, but so much of his dialogue was just...off. I adore him, but his signature gallows humour came across as awkward and unnecesary at times.Mason \u2013 Pretty much the only consistent character in the whole book. His romance with Aries seemed a little forced at times (terribly timed make-out sesh, anyone?), and it just didn't really go anywhere. His moral ambiguity is always endearing though, and despite a few weird chunks of dialogue, I still love him.Aries \u2013 Aries was, arguably, the most disappointing part of this novel. In Dark Inside and Rage Within, she stands out as an intelligent, determined, and incredibly brave leader. In Fury Rising, she's whiny, makes incredibly stupid decisions, and is full of angst (the boring romantic kind, not even the good moral kind). One of my all time favourite female characters was presented in this novel as an irrational and lovesick teenage girl and I'm kinda pissed about it. I mean, I get that two hot, mysterious, and slightly murderous guys are into you and that's great sister but...chill. Ironically enough, the chemistry between Daniel and Mason (the two other points of this saucy apocalyptic love triangle) is like 45x stronger than their chemistry with her. Ugh ugh ugh.To conclude, I'm disappointed as hell. I know that with a little polishing up, this could have been an incredible conclusion to a fantastic series, but the author just didn't seem to give a damn about the final product. The quality is downright embarrassing and while it hurts me to say that, it's the unfortunate truth. You shouldn't have to make edits in your head while reading a published novel. Jeyn is an incredible writer, but this one was a miss for me. If you're a fan of the series, by all means give this novel a shot. But take heed my friend, lest you grow as annoyed as I did at the innumerable missing quotation marks and the weird, clunky dialogue.GAME OVER"}, {"userName": "Filippa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55832707-filippa", "userReview": "It's been so long since the last book came out that I've had time to go to university and get a literature degree.

I think it may have been even better the second time around. I had always wished for a third book in this series and I was thrilled to find out that one finally existed.And it left me very happy, to revisit Aries, Clementine, Michael, Mason, Daniel, Jack, Joy and the others that followed in this group of survivors.The only one I wasn't happy to read about was Colin. An ass from book one, some things don't change. That's all I've got to say about that.We come back to this group with Mason still at the Plaza of Nations, along with a lot of other prisoners, held by the Baggers, Leon being the leader of the pack. He won't leave and rejoin the others, even though they took off his ankle bracelet. The threat of killing Casey, the little girl that adopted him as her father after hers was killed was enough to keep him in place.What he doesn't know, is that Aries and the others found out where the existing children are being kept and they plan to rescue them, and then bring Mason back as well. But not only are the Baggers a threat, but there is a new breed in town, the Ferals. They're worse than the Baggers; they have no conscious and no thought process. They only know how to kill, tearing their victims apart by hand, and they don't care if their victims are Baggers or human, they have only one mission and they travel in packs of 100's.Can the Baggers and Aries gang all work together to free Vancouver of the Ferals, or will everyone perish once the Ferals make it to the Plaza of Nations and surrounding area?Loved this book. Some lived, some died, (of course it was bound to happen that we would lose some characters that we loved) but all in all, this was a very enjoyable story to read.

Even after reading this one, though, I would still consider book one to be my favourite.While I did still find this book to be really engaging and I cared about more characters than just the main ones, while I was reading this, I felt like all I was doing was waiting for the real end to come.I'll be honest. I liked Aries, Mason and Daniel as separate characters, but I was really off the love triangle by the end of this final book. I liked seeing the survival of the characters, but I was kind of disappointed in how many of the characters seemed unable to organise themselves. I would have liked to see a bit more of the attitude in the base, rather than just being told that all of the adults didn't really trust Aries and the other teenagers to know what they were doing.I did feel that the characters had become complacent. I would have liked to see more details about how the plans were made, rather than just the aftermath and what seemed like characters making really poor decisions they shouldn't have, given the world they were in at that time. I couldn't believe one character risked an entire mission to feed a dog. I actually assumed they were lying about it at first.I was with Clementine towards the end of the book. I couldn't believe so much had been crammed into a day, two at the most. The appearance of the ferals was really creepy... and that was saying something. I wasn't sure which was the worst threat: the mob of psychos, or the Baggers still able to think, feel, reason.I was kind of disappointed there wasn't more of a resolution. While this book was the final one in the trilogy, I felt there was still a lot of the story to be told and not enough answers. For instance, why was Aries able to bring back a Bagger's conscience, however temporarily? And what was the whole deal with Daniel? I did enjoy seeing the friendship growing gradually between Daniel and Mason, though.I would definitely be interested in reading more books by this author in the future; and also any more books set in the Dark Inside universe."}, {"userName": "Mona Lisa (ForestGreenReader)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43295264-mona-lisa-forestgreenreader", "userReview": "I don't like series/trilogies that have endings that feel incomplete, rushed, or leave me with more questions than answers.There were inconsistency and tons of grammatical errors.1.

After following his brother for so long and hoping there was a cure for him- he just forgets about him?2. We've seen Clementine hoping and vying to meet her brother again throughout the whole trilogy; constantly talking to him in her head and going back and forth wondering if he was dead or not. And they finally meet two pages before the last page of the book? And all we get is them running together and hugging. I need more! Her looking for her brother is one of the main things that kept her going, we can't get more than that?3. The ending with Mason. After all they've been through, he's still moping around about how he still feels incomplete and how he believes he can't just be happy with Aries. (Feels like such an unsatisfying non-ending).4. The love triangle between Daniel, Aries, and Mason is so weird. Daniel is assumed to be dead, so Aries kind of settles for Mason. But! By the end of the book, there isn't really a romantic relationship between Aries and Mason. So all the jealousy and fighting, was for... nothing. Daniel and Mason have more chemistry together, than Mason and Aries does. Those are a few of the things that made me feel incomplete by the end of this book. I wish there could be more. I want to see if the baggers find a new leader, will the ferals continue to pillage and destroy (and where else could they go), what about the other communities spread out through the country, Joy's baby, is Daniel really dead, and soo much more.

There were definitely some suspenseful moments and lots of emotions, and no one was safe. The story flowed nicely and the characters were back doing what they did best. I really liked the introduction of the Ferals and almost wish they'd been more involved in the story somehow. I would have loved to know a little more about them! I'm totally going to miss Daniel and Mason's interactions, Aries's strength, and Clementine and Michael's romance. There was a ton of action and some pretty wild treachery near the end, and the characters had to make some choices that I'm sure will haunt them. Well, will haunt the ones who survived, anyway. I think I was a little surprised at how everything ended, but it was by no means a bad ending. All the plot holes tied up nicely and I didn't do too much nitpicking.

It has been a privilege to spend 5 years with this series.The book offers character building and world building that is rarely seen in YA. The book shines brightest in it's slowest moments, when readers are left with descriptions of scenery or descriptions of emotions. Or simple interactions between characters. The action sequences are perfectly balanced and not too rushed, as often happens with series finales.The ending was heartfelt, raw, and pure and does not disappoint. As the overall root problem in the series does not have a plausible solution, the solution offered is a satisfying way to deal with the issue and does not close too many interpretive or imaginative doors.I could not recommend this book and this series more highly. 5 stars.Just a few details to note edit-wise. The book does come with noticeable editing and grammar errors. While I feel they do not detract from the book at all (and they are kind of expected to some extent since the book was released independently), but I figured I'd list them here:1. The most obvious one is grammatical and spelling mistakes throughout: letters being left off words, extra letters added to words, ex: \"word\" instead of \"world\", \"and\" instead of \"an\", and the most jarring I noticed being the use of \"causalities\" throughout when the proper word seemed to be \"casualties.\" The latter is the only one that significantly detracts from the reading of the book, as well as a few areas where entire words were accidentally omitted, affecting the overall readbility of the sentence.2. The spelling of character \"Larisa\" changes from one s in book 2 to two 'S'es \"Larissa,\" in book 3.3. The character Martin switches names throughout from Martin to MarvinNumbers 4 and 5 contain content spoilers *SPOILER ALERT*4. As Raj, Daniel, Mason, and Jordan flee the Mall, their car rolls and Daniel instructs Jordan to drop his gun. He does so, and it flies out the window while the car rolls several more times. However, right after Jordan exits the crashed vehicle, he aims his gun and starts shooting at the Baggers, as if he had kept a hold of it the entire time. There is no indication of him moving back up the street to retrieve the gun from when it had flown out several feet back.5. Larissa seemingly disappears during the final Plaza attack just to magically appear safely on the yacht at the end. She is not in the first group that boards the vessel (that being just Karen and the children), and when Clem and Aries go back to the Casino, Aries tells Clem to try and find Joy, Jack, and Larissa. Jack is found outside and is instructed to go to the boat and send any others he finds there as well. Joy is later found inside the prisoner area of the casino as Aries frees a large group of people, and there is no indication made that Larissa is in the large group freed. However, several minutes later when Mason, Clem, and Aries board the Yacht, Larissa is magically there, safe and sound. Although it can be assumed she was found by Jack outside or even freed with Joy and the rest of the large group, it is nonetheless jarring to be worrying about her as the characters are searching the compound, being devastated when the characters finally leave and she hasn't been found, just to follow them back to the yacht and see her there as if she'd been there all along and we'd always known about her whereabouts. She just jumps up and demands the keys and starts the yacht and drives away and the whole thing is kind of unexpected.However, none of these issues is anywhere major enough to lessen my love for the book and the enjoyment I felt while reading it."}], "description": "The third and final novel in the Dark Inside series.It\u2019s been nine months since the earthquakes destroyed most of the world and the Baggers awakened.
