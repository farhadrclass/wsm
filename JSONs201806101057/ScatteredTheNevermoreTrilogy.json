I might have rated it a little higher except it felt like it should have been a chapter in one of the other books in this series instead of a separate short story. It felt a little forced for the reason of introducing a character to use later in the series.Because of how short this was the main characters didn't feel very developed. You got just enough to barely get to know them.It wasn't a bad story, it did fit into the world and the characters were integrated into the final book tying everything together. I just think it should have been a little longer to not feel kind of like an afterthought."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10603686-amber", "userReview": "I'm sorry, 2nd negative review in two days.

I am a technology junkie and haven't picked up an actual book since I got my Kindle two years ago. This has allowed me to find and read a lot of authors I would have never before known, and for that I am very pleased. More power to the Indie do it yourself writers that are out there. Shannon Mayer has a good premise for this series, and she titles the book well as a zombie-ish apocalypse type book. I like anything zombie and love when people have a different take on it, and the story wasn't completely bad. However, the spelling, grammar, and overall writing was atrocious. I know, I know, sometimes that is what you get with Indie, but come on, a high school kid could have done a better job proofing this book, the whole series for that matter.I gave this two stars mostly because of the grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. Based on the story it would have gotten three stars. It was exactly what I expected going into it, a quick read to pass the time with a nice twist on zombies taking over the world. If you can get past all of that and want a zombie series with a love and romance back story then give it a read."}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5500393-katrina", "userReview": "I know this is a short story and I liked how it filled in another side of the story from the main books, but it was way too short and ended so abruptly that I didn't realize it was over until I turned the page since it was only a small % of the content in the kindle version (there were several chapters from TWO of her other books in the back ofthis Kindle version)! Would have like better if it had taken this side of the story all the way up to meeting the other characters in the row boat..."}, {"userName": "Starla", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2800197-starla", "userReview": "Siblings Annie and Dustin are very likable characters, but they were left in something of a predicament. This \"short story\" read more like an introduction to characters in the Nevermore trilogy that didn't make it into the final edit. I am hoping that the pair show up in the later books of the trilogy so that we can find out what happens to them. (Rated only three stars for leaving the story unfinished.)"}, {"userName": "Imani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17187251-imani", "userReview": "Really short and sweet.
