The three categories that I propose are the Theban plays (namely the ones that deal with Oedipus and the fallout from that rather sticky episode), the war plays (which I will get to shortly) and Electra. Yes, I know, Electra is only one play, but as far as I am concerned, it simply does not fall into either of the other two categories, so I have put it into a category of its own.\t\tAnyway, the Philoctetes is one of the war plays (simply because it is not Electra, and does not involve Oedipus or any of the mess that arose from it). Each of the war plays (and remember that Sophocles wrote much more than what we currently have) seem to deal with a different impact of war. As I have indicated previously, if you were Greek, male, and young, it was highly likely that you were either at war, or if you were still alive, have been at war, so in many cases these plays are much more relevant to them, than they are to us who sit on our couches watching The Hurt Locker and going, 'Wow! That was an awesome movie!'. \tHey, I'm not knocking The Hurt Locker, it is an awesome movie, but let's just say that Sophocles' war plays are pretty much an ancient version of The Hurt Locker. In fact, each of the plays seems to deal with a different aspect of war and its effect upon the soldier (or his family). Ajax deals with the betrayal of command as well post-traumatic stress disorder; The Woman of Trachis deals with the family that is left behind while the male is off to war; and Philoctetes deals with those who are disabled, left behind, and forgotten. The thing about these three plays is that they are just as relevant today as they were back then when we are dealing with people that have been personally affected by war, whether it is the soldier that has been screwed over by Donald Rumsfeld, the war wife who has to put up with the fact that the two years that her husband was supposed to spend in Iraq has been stretched out to eight, and the solder whose legs have been blown off by a road-side bomb and then thrown into some veteran's hospital and pretty much forgotten.\tAs I have previously mentioned, this play is about the plight of those who have been disabled in war and have been forgotten. Okay, Philoctetes was not actually disabled in a war, he was bitten by a snake on the way over to Troy, but he was forgotten. As we are told, the Greeks were so putrefied by the ulcer that developed on his ankle that they dumped him on an island and snuck off in the middle of the night. This is something that many disabled people, especially those who have become disabled during there life, have to face day in and day out. People love people who are perfect and shy away from those who are not. Hey, even I find it difficult to relate to disabled, and my favourite person in the world is mentally disabled.\tThis is more so when we consider people going into political positions. Take Franklin Delano Roosevelt for instance. He suffered from polio and could not walk, however he had to hide this fact from the American people because of the prejudice he would have faced when running for president. In fact I am told that he would be wheeled onto the stage out of sight of the audience, and would hold himself up on the podium for the entire time he was speaking so that people would not think he was disabled. Seriously, that takes a lot of strength, particularly since his legs were not able to support his weight.\tNow, ancient warfare was very up close and personal, and as I mentioned, pretty much every male would have to go to war. The big difference is medical science. If you suffered a nasty, disabling wound back then you were more than likely to be left to die because there was pretty much nothing anybody could do. It is different these days as we are able to stabilise these fatal wounds so that those who suffer them are able to live, however it is unlikely they will live a fruitful life. Vietnam was notorious for attacks that disabled, as opposed to killed, soldiers, and then they would return home to have to eek out a meagre existence.\tOne thing about Philoctetes is that we are given a glimpse into the mind of the man who has been disabled and forgotten, and the anguish and the pain that he goes through being rejected. What is worse is that when they realise that he is the only one who can save them, they come running back to him as if all were forgiven. Have you ever felt like you have been used, and the pain that you feel when people who mock and ridicule you suddenly come running back asking you for your help? Well, that is the position that Philoctetes is in.\tMany have criticised the play for the Deus Ex Machina that appears at the end, but one can almost see the Christian allegory that is within it. Remember, Jesus says that we should love our enemies and bless those who curse us. Well, this seems to be what Heracles is saying. In this play the forgotten and despised one becomes the saviour of the Greeks, in the same way that it was foretold that the despised and rejected suffering servant would be the harbinger of salvation.\tLook, in the end this play is not going to make the disabled soldier's life any easier, nor is it going to magically cure him. However what it is going to do is to help him, and us, understand the pain that one feels when one is rejected because of their disability. This is not something new, and we can be assured that in the audience when the play was first performed there were many people in the same situation as Philoctetes. This play does not offer a solution, but it does offer comfort."}, {"userName": "Kut\u015f\u0131n Sancakl\u0131", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27236756-kut-n-sancakl", "userReview": "Sofokles bu oyununda, inkar edilen ahlak\u0131 sonda inad\u0131na yeniden do\u011frultarak - daha prologda Odysseus'un ak\u0131ll\u0131ca \u00f6r\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f hilesi i\u00e7in sophisma s\u00f6zc\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn\u00fc kullan\u0131r - sofistlerle hesapla\u015f\u0131r..

The Greeks had marooned Philoktetes early on because \u201chis foot / diseased and eaten away with running ulcers\u201d offended them with its malodorous decay, which is of course the dumbest reason ever to shipwreck a guy who was injured in the Trojan War. As it turned out, both P and his heraclean bow were required at Troy (prophecy of Helenus, yo), so Odysseus\u2019 object is to re-kidnap P for the war effort. When O and son of Achilles, Neoptolemus, arrive, P is still as yet injured, however many years later, as evident in the \u201coozing matter from a sore\u201d that they find. Chorus notes that P has a \u201cmaggot-ridden foot,\u201d which is suggestive of gangrene; how is P not dead? Surely some sort of miracle.O wants N to become a tool of deception, whereas N prefers \u201ceven to fail with honor / than win by cheating.\u201d O\u2019s position (for which Dante placed him in the Malebolge) is that \u201ceverywhere among the race of men / it is the tongue that wins and not the deed.\u201d But, P \u201cwill not be persuaded; force will fail\u201d (because heraclean bow). Hence, deception. P \u201cwould rather listen to my worst enemy, / the snake that bit me\u201d than O. But he listens to N\u2019s deceptions regarding returning home, and gives up his arms; N immediately repents: \u201cshame shall be ours if we boast and our lies still leave victory unwon,\u201d which is a return to the Homeric moral theory that forefronts honor/shame over odyssean pragmatics (i.e., lying\u2014my pet theory about the Odyssey is that it\u2019s just Odysseus lying the entire time, or, to be charitable, rehearsing fictive narratives as recompense to his benefactors). N\u2019s thesis is more Aristotelian physis, laden with the gustatory: \u201cAll is disgust when one leaves his own nature / and does things that misfit it.\u201d N is overcome, triggering the anagnorisis: \u201cI will not hide anything. You must sail to Troy / to the Achaeans, join the army of the Atridae.\u201d This revelation is not meant as an altruistic act: \u201cFirst save you from this torture, then with you / go and lay waste the land of Troy.\u201d (On the long dead issue of the Trojan War, I remain a committed Trojan--so this kind of talk is genuinely heartbreaking to me.) N justifies it as \u201ca great necessity compels it,\u201d which we should recognize as emblematic of an agambenian SoE: Philoktetes is subject to several proscriptions, both of which appear to be outside of law: arbitrary deportation and capricious repatriation.When N had first met P in this text, P states Friendliest of tongues, / That I should hear it spoken once again / by such a man in such a place! My boy, / who are you? Who has sent you here? What brought you? / What impulse? What friendliest of winds? Right before they had met, the chorus told N that \u201cwe are strangers, and this land is strange.\u201d After the anagnorisis, P reverts to the standard Greek opinion as to xenos: \u201cThen I am lost. I am betrayed. Why, stranger, / have you done this to me? Give me back my bow.\u201d N is not unmindful, recognizing the dilemma: \u201cWhat shall I do? I would I had never left / Scyrus, so hateful is what I face now.\u201d N accordingly confronts O, seeking to \u201cundo the wrong.\u201d O replies, significantly, \u201cA strange thing to say!\u201d and notes that the deception of P is a matter of democratic consensus: \u201cThe whole assembly / of the Greeks.\u201d There follows the peripeteia: N: You are a clever man, Odysseus, but this is not a clever saying.O: In your own case / neither the words nor the acts are clever.N: Still if they are just, they are better than clever. O then runs off to take it up with the \u201cwhole assembly,\u201d which sets the stage for a catastrophe wherein everyone dies. Except, of course, we all know that P must get to Troy, N must kill Priam, and O must return home to savagely slaughter his wife\u2019s suitors. Resolution therefore comes through one of the classic moments of deus ex machina, wherein Heracles himself is wheeled down to the stage and enjoins P to go to Troy. It\u2019s deeply unsatisfying aesthetically, perhaps, but it is pure Hegelianism, the confrontation of right against right, between which equal rights only force decides. It is the impasse that makes tragedy.Basic classical literacy requires this one, kids."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4452312-steven", "userReview": "\"The sacred doesn't diewhen men do.

Odysseus sends the neophyte Neoptolemos, son of Achilles, to trick Philoktetes into giving him his bow. Initially thinking it shameful and beneath him to deceive a man in such a base way, he is finally persuaded by Odysseus take part in the ploy. He wins poor wretched Philoktetes' confidence, who then hands him his bow, after which the scheme is quickly disclosed. Feeling pity for Philoktetes, and deeming the act wrong once more, Neoptolemos returns the bow to Philoktetes in defiance of Odysseus. Still, the Greeks\u2014as revealed through prophecy\u2014need Herakles' bow to settle the war at least. It takes the spirit of Herakles to persuade the agonized and agonizing Philoktetes to leave his desolate island and pitiful cave of suffering and return, cum bow, to Troy\u2014to have his rotting foot finally be healed, and to help the Greeks gain their victory.

Segundo o que pesquisei, foram apenas sete os textos que \"sobreviveram\" de entre as mais de 125 obras do autor. Esta foi a quarta que li, e foi a quarta que adorei.No entanto, momentos ap\u00f3s termin\u00e1-la, senti que esta trag\u00e9dia n\u00e3o era bem como as anteriores, mas n\u00e3o consegui identificar de imediato por que motivo isso tinha acontecido. Na altura, lembro-me de pensar que a hist\u00f3ria parecia incompleta. Apesar de ter um princ\u00edpio e um fim bem definidos, era como se se tratasse de uma sub-hist\u00f3ria, dentro de uma narrativa maior, como se fosse um cap\u00edtulo de um livro, ou um dos livros de uma trilogia, t\u00e3o frequentes na \u00e9poca. A minha pesquisa levou-me a concluir que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada que indicie que esta obra seja parte de qualquer outra, pelo que foi necess\u00e1rio reflectir melhor sobre o que tinha lido, e sobre o porqu\u00ea desta sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de \"diferen\u00e7a\" em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que j\u00e1 tinha lido do autor.Foi s\u00f3 ap\u00f3s alguma reflex\u00e3o que chego \u00e0s seguintes hip\u00f3teses explicativas sobre esta \"diferen\u00e7a\" por mim sentida: Esta trag\u00e9dia n\u00e3o cont\u00e9m os \"ingredientes\" usuais das trag\u00e9dias de S\u00f3focles anteriormente lidas. \u00c9 uma narrativa de natureza mais subtil, sem os acontecimentos \"fortes\" e \"tr\u00e1gicos\", que \"abalam\" o leitor. O texto termina, pelo uso do artif\u00edcio Deus Ex Machina, ou seja, pela interven\u00e7\u00e3o de um Deus, neste caso o semideus H\u00e9racles, que ir\u00e1 ditar a conclus\u00e3o da hist\u00f3ria. Apesar de ser de enorme interesse liter\u00e1rio a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o deste artif\u00edcio nos dramas, n\u00e3o posso dizer que me agrade muito quando as hist\u00f3rias terminam desta forma. E neste caso espec\u00edfico, n\u00e3o me parece que fosse for\u00e7osamente necess\u00e1ria esta interven\u00e7\u00e3o divina no final.N\u00e3o sei se estas minhas duas constata\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o suficientes para identificar a \"diferen\u00e7a\" nesta trag\u00e9dia, mas devo dizer que ser diferente n\u00e3o foi neste caso algo mau. Esta hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 realmente diferente, mais subtil, menos completa, com um final n\u00e3o surpreendente, mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser formid\u00e1vel, e bel\u00edssimamente bem contada. Acho sempre extraordin\u00e1rio quando este autores promovem a reflex\u00e3o sobre temas t\u00e3o complexos com uma aparente parcim\u00f3nia de escrita e de enredos.Basicamente, est\u00e1 um homem abandonado numa ilha, doente (Filoctetes), que \u00e9 possuidor de uma arma dos deuses (um arco, de H\u00e9racles), que Ulisses necessita para conseguir tomar Tr\u00f3ia. Para tal faz-se acompanhar de Neopt\u00f3lemo, filho de Aquiles, para conseguir ganhar a sua simpatia e confian\u00e7a. Mas para melhor falar deste enredo, gostaria de o fazer a partir dos seus tr\u00eas personagens principais.Ulisses \u00e9 um deles. Um personagem meu \"conhecido\" da Odisseia, apresenta-se aqui de uma forma um pouco diferente da sua t\u00edpica imagem de \"her\u00f3i\". Ele que foi um dos respons\u00e1veis pelo abandono de Filoctetes naquela ilha, por j\u00e1 n\u00e3o poderem suportar os lamentos de dor do doente, nem o cheiro nauseabundo da sua ferida, volta agora para tentar convenc\u00ea-lo a entregar-lhe o arco de H\u00e9racles. Para tal, tenta convencer Neopt\u00f3lemo a ajud\u00e1-lo, uma vez que este \u00e9 filho de um amigo de Filoctetes (Aquiles). Mas este \"servi\u00e7o\" que Ulisses pede a Neopt\u00f3lemo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 de natureza nobre, antes pelo contr\u00e1rio. Ulisses deseja que ele engane Filoctetes, por forma a que este entregue o seu arco invenc\u00edvel. \u00c9 pois, um Ulisses ardiloso que nos surge neste trag\u00e9dia, convencido (e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 quem o demova desta convic\u00e7\u00e3o) de que os meios justificam os fins. Este \u00e9 o primeiro motivo para reflex\u00e3o que S\u00f3focles nos concede no seu texto.Filoctetes, o homem abandonado naquela ilha, vive em grande dor e agonia. Sofre um mal no seu p\u00e9, por antigo perj\u00fario cometido ao revelar o local onde repousavam as cinzas de H\u00e9racles. A dor do abandono pelos companheiros concorre com a dor f\u00edsica do mal incur\u00e1vel e quase insuport\u00e1vel. Jurou-se inimigo mortal daqueles que o haviam enganado, e por nada entregaria o seu arco \u00e0queles que o tra\u00edram. O relato do sofrimento deste homem \u00e9 um dos pontos altos desta trag\u00e9dia, e mais um motivo para reflex\u00e3o.Neopt\u00f3lemo encarna a quest\u00e3o central deste enredo. Dividido entre duas posi\u00e7\u00f5es irredut\u00edveis, a de Ulisses e a de Filoctetes, n\u00e3o tem uma tarefa f\u00e1cil. Entre enganar algu\u00e9m que mereceu a amizade de seu pai, e retirar a esse homem j\u00e1 em grande sofrimento o seu \u00fanico bem ( o arco ) , a fim de que Tr\u00f3ia seja finalmente tomada, ou recusar-se a prestar esse \"servi\u00e7o\" a Ulisses, e tornar-se ele pr\u00f3prio um traidor. Com pouca margem de manobra, este jovem v\u00ea-se assim perante este grave dilema, e seja qual for a sua decis\u00e3o, acarretar\u00e1 para si pr\u00f3prio graves consequ\u00eancias, as quais ter\u00e1 que enfrentar. Se os outros pontos de reflex\u00e3o n\u00e3o tivessem tocado o leitor, aqui sem d\u00favida quem l\u00ea \u00e9 obrigado a reflectir sobre este dilema que aflige um dos seus principais personagens.Resumindo, apesar de um pouco diferente do que j\u00e1 havia lido do autor, \u00e9 uma trag\u00e9dia excelente, e mais uma vez recomendo este livro, \u00e0 imagem do que aconteceu com as suas outras obras.Para o post completo, ver:http://linkedbooks.blogspot.pt/2014/1..."}, {"userName": "Erica Zahn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25498281-erica-zahn", "userReview": "My review will be brief, as I am more than ready to move on after reading this for the thousandth time (I wanted to finish the collection I was re-reading and wouldn\u2019t have felt complete without doing so) and have studied the text in the past and taken an exam on it, so I would like to feel I can move on from it. I will say that it is not a great play to study \u2013 there are a few themes and moral dilemmas to discuss, but the characters are not particularly complex and the threads of the play (beyond a few foreshadowing mentions of Heracles and references to the Trojan War itself) do not run particularly deep. Having re-read most of Sophocles\u2019 other surviving plays now (and read them all at least once), I would consider this the worst of his work. The play is not terrible, but not at his usual standard in my view.It is interesting to see Neoptolemus and Odysseus portrayed so differently from the norm \u2013 Neoptolemus is a na\u00efve but morally upstanding newcomer to the war (the meaning of his name, \u2018New to the War\u2019; usually he is portrayed as a vicious brute with his father\u2019s worst qualities, and the one who slits King Priam\u2019s throat as he prays for mercy at the Trojan altars) and Odysseus is a sly and corrupt manipulator (rather than a cunning but yet conscientious man respected by Athena and the other gods, though the portrayal here is in keeping with 5th century suspiciousness concerning sophistry in oratory and Alcibiades-esque manipulation tactics).Philoctetes is a sympathetic character (perhaps \u2018tragic\u2019 with a small \u2018t\u2019) but remains rather annoying and stubborn despite the fact that his situation could not be much worse, and we see him reject reconciliation with the army and a cure for his diseased foot for the most part out of spite, though if he would cooperate he would eventually be able to gain recognition as well as returning home as he wished. Being generous we might call him sympathetic but unreasonable, like Ajax, but we should remember that there was no easy way out for Ajax, no way to gain recognition and respect when he had been denied it so damningly, while Philoctetes rejects the solution when it is right in front of him. He could have also used the opportunity to prove himself and challenge his enemies in the army after his wound was healed. However, aside from a few bit parts (the merchant and Heracles at the end) and the chorus who are not much involved and flit from side to side in the conflict, this is essentially what we get \u2013 it is the only tragedy with no female characters, and the characters we get are fine, but not particularly impressive in comparison with Antigone, Oedipus, or Ajax, for instance.We do get a source of excitement not usually found in tragedy by including some action on stage: the cries of Philoctetes from the pain of his infection providing one part of this, and the fight over the bow as it passes from character to character (and is used to threaten certain characters with aim at them) being the other part. Since most tragedies centre around death (which could not be shown on stage, as the stage was sacred to Dionysus), it is unusual to see action delivered visually rather than through the regular messenger's speech, so this is an aspect that provides interest for this particular play and makes it unique. However, the strength of Sophocles is of course usually in the language, and these aspects seem to take the focus away from this, especially while the play lacks any really stand-out speeches from a poetic point of view (though I enjoyed Philoctetes\u2019 \u2018no one wicked ever dies\u2019 lament, as it seems true to me): perhaps we should regard the play as \u2018intriguingly experimental\u2019, if we are being generous when comparing it with Sophocles\u2019 previous works.The deus ex machina is certainly strange and, for one studying the text, creates a lot of consistency problems with discussions regarding the play as a whole \u2013 the tone, mood, and underlying significances are completely different from the rest of the play. Although not unheard of in tragedy in general, ending a play like this is unusual for Sophocles \u2013 the issues dealt with here are decidedly less complex and difficult than those in the Electra, and in the end they are mostly the result of Philoctetes\u2019 own stubbornness in the face of his possible salvation, and yet for whatever reason this is the play in which Sophocles has a god solve everyone\u2019s problems, when in Electra we are left at a loose end of sorts and must make up our own minds (or fail to make a judgement at all). The play is not awful, but it is decidedly less compelling than any of Sophocles\u2019 other work, and so is only really worth reading if you intend to make your way through all his surviving tragedies: the characters and story are entertaining enough, and there is some excitement in the form of actual action (fighting over the bow) happening on stage, but it lacks the potent language and emotional heights that are the usual trademarks and strengths of Sophocles."}, {"userName": "Francisco H.

El siglo V a.c. se conoce como el \"Siglo de oro de Pericles\" por el gran desarrollo que Atenas, como polis organizada democr\u00e1ticamente, consigui\u00f3. El teatro tuvo un rol fundamental para lograr esta evoluci\u00f3n de oikos a polis, ya que la democracia ateniense utilizaba como una herramienta para conseguir la paideia, los di\u00e1logos, las situaciones, los mensajes y los valores que se transmit\u00edan al p\u00fablico a trav\u00e9s de la representaci\u00f3n teatral. Los espectadores conoc\u00edan las historias m\u00edticas porque formaban parte de su cultura, de sus costumbres, por lo que lo importante de estas representaciones tr\u00e1gicas no era la historia en s\u00ed, sino el matiz que cada tr\u00e1gico brindaba al mito, para adecuarlo a las necesidades hist\u00f3ricas concretas de una ciudad que basaba su existencia y subsistencia en las decisiones que se tomaban en la deliberaci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos que compon\u00edan el gobierno democr\u00e1tico. Hay que recordar que no exist\u00eda la educaci\u00f3n masiva, por lo que la \u00fanica forma para educarse que ten\u00edan los ciudadanos atenienses (los que si o si en alg\u00fan momento de su vida deber\u00edan participar del gobierno) era el teatro. Filoctetes se circunscribe en este escenario. En esta tragedia se da la lucha entre lo que es mejor para la polis (representado por la posici\u00f3n de Odiseo que buscaba hacer retornar a Troya a Filoctetes porque se hab\u00eda profetizado que sin \u00e9l y las armas de Heracles no se podr\u00eda obtener la victoria) y la las posiciones individualistas que solo buscan la conveniencia personal (representado por la posici\u00f3n de Neoptolomeo quien se compadece de Filoctetes y comienza a sentir un verdadero sentimiento de amistad que lo lleva a desistir de su enga\u00f1o, aunque eso significaba la ca\u00edda del colectivo aqueo).

The moment when the men who had betrayed his trust turn around to leave Philoctetes, and his reaction is a simple, penetrating \"Friends!\", is absolutely heartrending.

The play concerns Odysseus and Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, travel to Lemnos to recover the bow of Heracles from Philoctetes without which they cannot win the Trojan war. Philoctetes has been marooned on Lemnos because he was bitten by a snake and his cries of pain and the smell of the festering wound were intolerable to his fellow Greeks. In particular, it was Odysseus who tricked Philoctetes into being marooned and he has led a ten year long miserable existence as a result. Quite reasonably Philoctetes hates the Greeks and Odysseus in particular. Odysseus at the beginning of the play talks Neoptolemus into tricking Philoctetes into giving him the bow. After an attack of conscience, Neoptolemus gives back the bow and agrees to save Philoctetes, even though it will mean war with his fellow Greeks. At the very end of the play, the divine and dead Heracles intercedes to convince Philoctetes to return to Troy with the bow.A few things stand out about the play. First and foremost, it is not a Greek Tragedy in the conventional sense, for one because it has a happy ending. It is also entirely unusual in that the action centres around Neoptolemus, who does something wrong, but then redeems himself and everything turns out all right. That is not a very Greek storyline, although in our Christian world it is a familiar one. Stories of redemption are just not very Greek and what we have here is something strikingly modern. In addition, Philoctetes is a remarkably well drawn character. In absolute agony, he is often torn between his desire to escape his exile and his hatred of Odysseus and this makes him prone to sudden and very realistic shifts of purpose. The language is also remarkable as is the scene setting which is exceptional. One can smell the sea salt, feel the wind and hear the cries of the sea birds on every page. Given all of this I'm not sure why Philoctetes did not grab me more. Partially, it is that the intervention of the divine Heracles is a full fledged Deus Ex Machina moment and an entirely unnecessary one at that, because the action is on the edge of resolving itself and could have been done psychologically. But there is just something about the play which is not as compelling as Sophocles' other works, even though I cannot identify what it is. Having said all that, it is still an excellent play and one that stands out from regular Greek drama."}, {"userName": "Syahira Sharif", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4247818-syahira-sharif", "userReview": "The version I read was translated by David Greene. \"Philoctetes\" was set during the Trojan war and before the fall of Troy. Philoctetes was a famed war hero who was exiled after suffering from a putrefied wound that rendered him outcast among his brothers at arm and he kept his grudge especially at Odysseus who betrayed him by leaving him behind. Upon which he begrudged Odysseus so much that he refused to help him when Odysseus was sent back to retrieve Philoctetes's magical bow and arrow which was prophesied to be instrumental in winning the Trojan war.Its not my favourite piece from Sophocles. Odysseus was portrayed negatively which was understandable considering his actions against Philoctetes (which was rather common Spartan tradition to leave the wounded behind and they're brutal warriors themselves). But Philoctetes was a common war figure for tragedy and you don't really expect happily ever afters from these lots. There was a lot of monologues and self-deprecation and self-conflicts faced by the characters. The story unravelled itself around the tragic figure and the brutal moralities the drama raise surrounding the bitter and still enraged warrior. Unfortunately I'm not emotionally-invested myself with Philoctetes's angst on whose fault it was that made him who he was and the subsequent arguments that question everything rather philosophically which common from a piece by Sophocles. But considering a lot of stories about Philoctetes didn't survive, it was understandable that it felt fragmented and incomplete as a whole."}, {"userName": "\u262fEmily ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074840-emily", "userReview": "A sick and damaged man, Philoctetes, is abandoned on an island for ten years with only a bow, which he used to hunt for food.

We learn from Dio Chrysostom that Aeschylus and Euripides, who each staged versions, did not make their islands uninhabited; and so we might wonder at Sophocles' insistence about this detail. It was in any case clear to Adam Smith why Sophocles was so: for the play is not about the wound of Philoctetes' foot (some scholars think that Sophoclean tragedy is to be distinguished by a peculiar focus on the pain caused by the physical - a singularly ridiculous notion), but the \"solitude, which affects us and diffuses over that charming tragedy, that romantic wildness, which is so agreeable to the imagination.\" We feel, by means of imagination, the spiritual death brought about by total isolation from public life. To the Greeks of democratic Athens, to be cut off from the polis, to approximate to the life of Henry David Thoreau, was a peculiarly distressing prospect - to live was to engage in bellum; and as Mao accurately noted that politics is simply war without bloodshed, war being politics with, so it was that, if one were a Greek male, and alive, one was either fighting with words or with swords; to do otherwise was to be less than human: hence Philoctetes refers to the \"bora\", fodder for animals, offered to him by peregrinating sailors. By living apart from civilization, one risked the loss of one's humanity. At the same time, the noble humanity of Neoptolemus, at first obscured by that symbol of the sophistic city, Odysseus, is only able to really shine here, at the edge, as it were, of reality, where Neoptolemus disobeys his superior, by handing Heracles' bow back, in virtue of his conscience, to Philoctetes - possibly the most brilliantly crafted depiction of that unaccountable human impulse toward the good ever to reach the stage."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26495259-leslie", "userReview": "La tragedia de Filoctetes me ha gustado mucho m\u00e1s que la de Ayax, que a diferencia de esa, \u00e9sta no es tan tragica, me refiero a que la de Ayax comienza con tragedia y termina con una: la muerte de Ayax, primo de Aquiles; sin embargo en Filoctetes la tragedia termia en algo bueno para Fil.Esta la cuestion de que por una parte estoy confundida del posible antagonismo de Odiseo (Ulises) ya que en la de Ayax el actua como una persona noble, que es capaz de perdonar a sus enemigos y de respetar a quien quiso causarle un mal; y en Filoctetes pareciera como si se estuviese dejando llevar por el ego\u00edsmo y el poder ya que de alguna manera utiliza al hijo de Aquiles, Neoptolomeo, para convencer a Filoctetes de que vuelva a Troya con ellos para que le ayude a derrotar a esa cuidad. Eso lo hace en base a un or\u00e1culo que le dice que necesitan del arco de Heracles para ponerle fin y ganar la batalla de Troya. Odiseo le propone a Neoptolomeo que enga\u00f1e a Filoctetes para que o les de el arco o los acompa\u00f1e de regreso y aunque el hijo de Aquiles no esta de acuerdo al principio cede, pero cuando Fil le da su arco y se entera que ha sido enga\u00f1ado y traicionado por aquel al quien hab\u00eda confiado sufre y el hijo de Aquiles al ver el mal y el da\u00f1o que le ha causado a Filoctetes enga\u00f1andolo, decide desobedecer a lo que Odiseo le hab\u00eda mandado y le regresa el arco a Fil a pesar de las advertencias que Odiseo le hace para que no ejecute tal acto.Pero a pesar de que aFil no queria ir a Troya aparece Heracles y le dice que es su deber ir a Troya porque despu\u00e9s de eso le esparan recompensas para \u00e9l y para Neoptolomeo y ambos terminan navegando hacia Troya.~~~~~~A mi en lo personal simepre me ha gustadovla mitolog\u00eda griega y todo lo que tenga que ver con ella, y ahora me vi envuelta en estas tragedias que para mi sorpresa me han estado gustando sin muy pero muy f\u00e1ciles de leer ya que son por as\u00ed decirlo di\u00e1logos en general.la historia en general es muy buena, si tiene opotunidad leanlas.

Though it is somewhat flawed, this is still a damn good play.Philoctetes follows Neoptolemos who is assigned by Ulysses to steal Philoctetes' legendary bow that formerly belonged to Hercules and will ensure Ulysses' victory in the war against Troy. Ulysses tells Neoptolemos to lie to Philoctetes in order to obtain this powerful weapon, but as Neoptolemos learns more about the story behind why Philoctetes is on the island and more about his history with Ulysses, the lines between \"right\" and \"wrong\" suddenly become blurred, as Neoptolemos must choose between his honor to the Greeks or his honor as an honest man.The play touches on the concept of honor and its importance in conflicts, and each of the three main characters are brilliantly written. For such a small cast and a small island as the setting of the story, there's a lot of weight behind the events that unfold (as is common with Sophocles' work) that elevates the story to a wonderfully-written drama.My only complaints come from Ulysses not being as well-written as Philoctetes and Neoptolemos are. He seems like a shallow dick with little else to him during the play. And the big Deus Ex Machina moment where Hercules comes down from heaven to guide the characters to the proper ending seemed a little forced and unnecessary. But beyond that, this is still a great play by Sophocles, and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Marcos Junior", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5284569-marcos-junior", "userReview": "A trag\u00e9dia retrata o dilema de Filocteto. Abandonado por 10 anos em uma ilha deserta, por causa de um ferimento no calcanhar que emana um cheiro horr\u00edvel e n\u00e3o pode ser curado, recebe a visita de quem o abandonou, Odisseu, que precisa dele para tomar Tr\u00f3ia. Partir com Odisseu significa a gl\u00f3ria, mas implica tamb\u00e9m no triunfo do homem que passou uma d\u00e9cada odiando. Vale triunfar ao mesmo tempo que seu grande rival? Odisseu, sabendo que Filocteto negaria, tenta engan\u00e1-lo atrav\u00e9s do filho de Aquiles, Neopt\u00f3lemo, que de in\u00edcio tem sucesso. Arrependido, o jovem devolve o arco de H\u00e9rcules a Filocteto. Odisseu representa a id\u00e9ia que o fim justifica os meios. Para conquistar a vit\u00f3ria, a moral deve ser colocada temporariamente de lado, para retom\u00e1-la quando for conveniente. \u00c9 justamente o que Neopt\u00f3lemo termina por rejeitar: \u00e9 melhor a derrota do que a injusti\u00e7a.
