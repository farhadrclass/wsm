Someone who has different taste from mine might just love this novel. Unfortunately I did not. I didn't find the writing particularly good, the story was not very interesting, the characters lacked development and overall I thought this novel was rather tedious. There are revelations at the end of the novel that give the end some interest. But after reading over two hundred pages of uninspired dialog, intrigue that wasn't very intriguing and emotions and behavior that don't seem to match the character's experiences the interesting revelations came much too late to turn my opinion around.Bartholomew Fortuno is the thin man in PT Barnum's American Museum. His closest friends are Matina the fat lady and Jonathan Alley the Giant Boy of Hungary. Late one night Bartholomew, or \"Barthy\" as Matina calls him, sees a woman enter the museum with Mr. Barnum. This woman piques Barthy's curiosity and he decides to see if he can discover the woman's identity. Eventually rumors surface that the woman is a new performer. When Mr. Barnum asks Bartholomew to report to him on the woman's interactions Barthy's obsession grows.This obsession is one of the disappointing aspects of this novel. At no time was this obsession explained with any sense of realism or insight. There was frequent telling but not much if any showing of Bartholomew's emotions and I never had any real sense of his devotion.The object of Bartholomew's obsession, Iell Adams, finds herself in a complicated situation and pulls Fortuno in with her. Their relationship is also unsatisfying and sometimes seems just plain weird. Iell has a directness that borders on rude and almost from their first meeting she begins to psychoanalyze Fortuno. With Iell's push for him to recount his childhood he begins to remember things that give him insight into his own behavior. This is the interesting part of the story. But it is the smallest part of the story and the remainder feels like a lot of fluff and filler. Unfortunately the relationships and emotions aren't fleshed out enough to give the story any emotional resonance. The relationship that was most realistic was the one between Bartholomew and Matina and portions of that were well done, but it lacked any consistency of realism. As with other parts of this novel it felt contrived.I'm sorry but I didn't find this a very enjoyable read. It has a fair amount of dialog and the reading is quick and easy but it was not at all satisfying to me."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51289-katie", "userReview": "This book started out well. It has a very interesting premise - the thinnest man in the world becomes embroiled in intrigue while working at P.T. Barnum's American Museum in NY. Unfortunately, the book can't hold up under Bryson's weak writing skills. To her credit, she has done an enormous amount of research but, like many new writers, she feels like she has to blatantly wave it in front of us to show she has done it. The same goes for the story: she is continually stating things that we, the intelligent readers, are capable of extracting from the story without being told directly to our faces. This is a common mistake for new writers, who don't have enough confidence in their writing or faith in their readers to know that they don't have to deliberately point things out to us to make sure that we noticed them. The worst offense is immediately following the main character's \"epiphany\" near the end. We're all capable of spotting it a mile away, but the author still feels like she needs to dedicate two long paragraphs to having the character tell us what his epiphany just was.I think that, with time and some more confidence in her storytelling ability, Bryson will improve as an author. Especially if she selects another interesting setting like this one."}, {"userName": "R.G.

Barnum's American Museum. The details of Reconstruction-era Manhattan are richly, if heavy-handedly, conveyed, and the combination of invented and historical characters (such as Barnum himself and the photographer Matthew Brady) makes for a very vividly told story.One obstacle to my enjoyment of this novel, though, was the effete, overly mannered narration of its title character, Barholomew Fortuno, \"The World's Thinnest Man\"--imagine Twelfth Night as told by Andrew Aguecheek, or Star Wars narrated by C3P0. With such a rich cast of characters, the novel moves at a surprisingly dreary pace, narrated as it is by its weakest character (who inexplicably succumbs to the temptation of making blatant clarifications of Bryson's cleverly turned plot points, in case the reader failed to pick up on the subtleties without such assistance). Ultimately, it was a relief to come to the novel's end both because of the unpleasant narration, and because the novel ends on a surprisingly fitting and truly lovely image. Bryson's tiresome Fortuno, at least, goes out in class."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2151607-audrey", "userReview": "Let me just start off by saying \"Go Ellen Bryson!\" With \"the Transformation of Bartholomew Fortuno\" she has created an easily readable, easily enjoyable story that touches on the one thing from which, at some point in time, all humans have suffered: the feeling of being an outcast. And she has done it well. This book, though it be a first novel, makes it obvious that, when it comes to writing Bryson knows her stuff. I had almost forgotten how pleasant it can be to read a genuinely well-written book. This book has been compared to \"Water for Elephants,\" and the circus feel and pseudo-autobiographical point of view paired with the unique yet plain writing style make this view, in my opinion, right on. Though I would stay that Bryson takes it a notch up stylistically. Her prose is so fluid and vivid that I am still wondering what parts of the story were true and which not.Bryson's book is told from the point of view of Bartholomew Fortuno who, at 6 feet tall, 67 pounds, is the self/Barnum-appointed skinniest man in the world. He lives in Barnum's museum in Manhanttan along with Barnum's other \"curiosities.\" He, unlike his best friend, Matina, the token fat woman, believes that his body is a gift. He knows that he is a freak, an outcast, but he loves his body despite this, and he believes that it is his job to teach others with his gift. By showing all of himself, he believes that people will take a deeper look into themselves.When the bearded lady comes along, though, his entire world is turned upside down. Through conversations with her and about her, he begins to see the world in a slightly different way and to question his beliefs about himself and his body. Does he have a choice? And if he does have a choice, can his body actually be a god-given gift?Through her use of such an extreme as the \"freak\" circus, Bryson has really captured what it means to be an outcast. Through Fortuno, his friends, and his transformation, we see the world from all of the different possible points of view of \"outcast.\" We see that it is possible to accept and love ourselves no matter what our situation. As all people have at some point in time felt different, it will be hard not to find something or someone to relate to in Bryon's medley of curiosities. Through the questions asked and the transformation of Bartholomew Fortuno, we see just how possible it is to feel stuck without even realizing it. We also see just how possible it is to unstick ourselves.As you can tell, I loved this book, and I will definitely be looking forward to Ellen Bryson's next work! My biggest problem with this book, though, was that the end just seemed to easy. It seemed like there was all this build-up and then she just sort-of took the easy way out. I also found Forutno's ridiculous obsession with the bearded lady to be at times frustrating, especially in regard to how it caused him to act (or not act) with Matina. It was an integral part of the book, but I thought that it could have been better explained.This book was a joy to read. It was incredibly simply written and yet, at the end of each chapter, I stopped to think about what I had read. It wasn't necessary, but I feel like I got so much more out of it this way. This book has been billed as a love story, and maybe that's what the author meant it to be, but I didn't see it that way. I almost feel it is a degradation of the book's worth to call it such. It, as the title says, is a book of growth, development, TRANSFORMATION. It is a story of beauty and love and uniqueness, but I fear that if you go in expecting a love story, you will be disappointed. And this book is so great that I really wouldn't want that.Thanks, Ellen Bryson, for such a new, refreshing read! Now, go out and read this book!"}, {"userName": "Blodeuedd Finland", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1962503-blodeuedd-finland", "userReview": "I have mentioned that I like books that are a little strange, out of the ordinary. Here there is no magic or things like that. But the characters in this book, it is those that are out of the ordinary.Bartholomew (let's just call him Bart cos I will never be able to spell that) lives in New York and is apart of P.T Barnum's museum. He sits in a room or he is on stage showing how freakishly thin he is. People come to marvel at him and be disgusted. He has his friends among fellow \"freaks\" but one day he is awakened and nothing will be the same.I was not sure if I liked Bart at first, he is such a proud man. He is something special, and he wants to teach people about how things are. He also looks down upon fellow freaks. He is the highest up, natural born curiosities of nature. Then there are the exotic ones, and lowest are the gaffs. People who fake their freakish nature, like the woman who gave birth to dead babyrats. But underneath it all he is human, and he does struggle with things and that is what I learn after reading a while.His friends at the place is the fat lady Matina, with whom he has a special bond and they are good friends. Emma, the giant, the rubberman, Alley the strong man, and others that come and go. Like the new act, a woman in a veil and Bart becomes fascinated by her. Who is she? What is her relationship with Bartum? The more he wants to know the deeper he falls. There are many powers of will at this museum. Who the veiled lady is, that you have to find out for yourself.What was it then that caught my interest? I do feel that it was Bryson's language, it just flowed, what else can I say, she is a great author and because of how she wrote this book I would love to read more by her. She wove a fantastic story, that in reality was just plain truth. But it felt like so much more. The freaks made this story, normal humans that in some cases were made into something else, or just were different. It was a story of friendship, love and most importantly finding yourself. Because in the end Bart is a lost soul.That people actually paid to see these persons is rather horrifying, after reading for some time I forgot about that and was just swept away by the story. But now when thinking about it, then I am again struck by it. And some of these not normal people, were just that, perfectly normal with a little make-up on.A fascinating tale about a \"freakshow\" at the time of Lincoln's assassination, New York in a different era. The perfect setting to this story. This is the author's first novel, and she had done well.

Barnum's Museum hold two opposing perspectives on their uniqueness: either that they are gifted or that they are monstrous.\"Man needs a bit of mystery to remind him that the world still holds miraculous things. Unclassifiable wonders. And if scientists simply shove us somewhere in the grander scheme of things, the magic disappears.\"\"I do not believe we educate our audiences. I believe we frighten them and in doing so, make them feel better about the dullness of their own lives.

The gargoyles at the edge of the world?\"Bryson manages to not only humanize the \"curiosities\" - but shows us the beauty of their strange physicalities. The story of Bartholomew Fortuno and his unique friends at the museum is a thought-provoking one: Is aberration a monstrosity or something to be celebrated because of it's uniqueness? And what is it about \"freaks\" that fascinate us? What can they show us about our own natures?Bartholomew sees his skeletal thinness as a gift, a sign that he is superior to the \"normal\" people who come to see his show. He is equally proud of his fellow performers and considers them to be part of an elite crowd. Yet once the mysterious new performer, Iell Adams, arrives, Bartholomew's world and self-perception are shaken. Long suppressed instincts suddenly assert themselves, sometimes resulting in disaster. Like a mesmerizing stage show, there are smoke and mirrors to the story so that I was kept guessing about the truths to Iell Adams and Bartholomew. But unlike a stage show that doesn't quite match its suspenseful buildup, I am pleased to note that the climax in this story, once it does come, was shocking and impressive.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)An engaging literary hybrid -- partly a historical melodrama, partly a Victorian thriller with lightly steampunkish touches -- Ellen Bryson's debut novel The Transformation of Bartholomew Fortuno takes place within the real world of P.T. Barnum's American Museum, the bizarre space in lower Manhattan in the 1850s and '60s where the infamous showman first made a name for himself, long before the formation of his later traveling circus. And indeed, this is probably the best-known thing about this novel, that it's a mystery set among the sideshow freaks that used to permanently live on the premises, weaving together fictional characters (like our titular thin man and the bearded beauty with whom he becomes obsessed) with such real people as Tom Thumb and Barnum himself, and getting all the details of the space correct down to a scholarly level. As such, then, Bryson essentially turns in a morality tale couched in deep symbolism, but with enough quirky elements to keep any fan of Victoriana happy -- by the time we're done, we've covered everything from opium addiction to mysterious Chinatown herbalists, Abraham Lincoln's funeral, and more hansom cab rides than you can shake a brass-capped walking stick at -- delivering by the end what is ultimately a mainstream story but with a lot of genre flourishes, a combination that I myself really enjoyed but that is absolutely not going to be everyone's cup of tea.

Nobody knows who she is or where she comes from, but Barnum is going to great lengths to hide her presence until it is time for her debut. When it comes, it shakes up many of the lives within the Museum, for the new woman is Iell, a beautiful bearded lady. No stranger to curiosities of nature (Bartholomew is the World's Thinnest Man) he takes instantly to the exotic allure of Iell, who turns his world upside down. When the Museum begins to suffer small acts of vandalism, everyone is a suspect. Bartholomew must rely on his instincts to sort through the secrets and temptations, and will end up learning about himself along the way.Those who know me will tell you that few literary topics please me more than circus stories, so it will certainly not be surprising to them that I was completely absorbed in Bartholomew's story. My favorite part of this book was how utterly atmospheric is was. Bryson captured nineteenth century New York City and circus life beautifully. I loved the glimpse into the social life and living style of Barnum's circus sideshow acts. Bartholomew is sometimes philosophical, sometimes naive man, and it was frustrating for me to be stuck with only what he knew. I wanted to get inside the heads of other characters! The mystery of Iell and added trouble of Mrs. Barnum kept me turning pages late into the night.

The blurb on the back cover from Cathy Day (author of The Circus in Winter --- an incredible book) didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, I found it a bit of a chore to get through, which is surprising given the premise. The book is thin on plot (no pun intended I swear), which would be fine if it made up for it in character development. However, aside from their special \"gifts,\" these \"human curiosities\" were not very interesting as characters. The suspense was weak and repetitive; Bartholomew visits Iell, argues with Matina, and gets in trouble with the Barnums --- rinse and repeat. The last 1/4 of the book definitely picked up but by then I was just as excited to be done with the book as I was to learn the secret of the \"big reveal.\" Ironically, this book suffers from the very plight that the characters take such pride in avoiding -- it's just average."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060045-jen", "userReview": "This caught my eye as the blurb said that fans of Water for Elephants would enjoy it.

The story is of Bartholomew Fortuno, billed as the world's thinnest man; a skeleton man. He lives a sheltered life under the illusion that he is able to enlighten the masses about the truths of the world when they come to see him 'perform'. Then a new curiosity joins the museum, and Bartholomew finds himself obsessed by discovering more about the mysterious Iell. Iell is an interesting character, and there is a true surprise at the end about her, but I think that Bartholomew's obsession with her isn't developed in a very interesting manner.

I haven\u2019t read many historic novels as of yet so it was exciting to find a book set in the past that I had no problem with reading. It\u2019s 1865 in New York right around the time President Lincoln was assassinated. The story takes place in P.T. Barnum\u2019s American Museum that housed some of the world\u2019s most famous oddities and curiosities. Bartholomew Fortuno is the world\u2019s thinnest man and has had a very successful career sharing his gift with the patrons that frequent the museum. But after a mysterious new act arrives Bartholomew\u2019s entire outlook on life changes and he begins to question everything he\u2019s believed in for so long.I enjoyed the unique characters in the novel. I appreciated the way that Bryson not only portrayed them as oddities but included the beauty of their differences as well. Bartholomew was an interesting main character. Seeing him develop and his attitude change was over the course of the novel was definitely a journey. In the beginning, Bartholomew considers his extreme thinness as a gift. He considers all of his fellow curiosities to possess their own gifts as well. These gifts set them apart from the normal crowd; above them even. I think my favorite character was Matina. Her honesty and beauty shined every time she was in a scene and I suppose me being a little on the bigger side myself I admired her courage and her sense of self. The atmosphere of the novel was well written and definitely believable. I didn\u2019t feel bogged down by any unnecessary historical facts either which I suppose is what worries me when it concerns books that are written in a past time. The writing was smooth from beginning to an end with a pretty good finish to sum up the story. The ending wasn\u2019t as dramatic as the plot led me to believe but it didn\u2019t disappoint me all that much. The only issue I had with the novel was the synopsis. I was expecting more of a love story in the novel, that\u2019s basically what the back of the book is promising. However, it\u2019s more a story of obsessions, which isn\u2019t a bad thing just not necessarily what I thought I was getting into. Not only is Bartholomew obsessed with Iell, but his entire \u201cgift\u201d of being thin is based on an obsession as well. I found his obsession with Iell a little confusing. I understand how one can feel totally attracted to something or simply compelled to be around it without really understanding why they feel that way. However, I just couldn\u2019t really connect with Bartholomew\u2019s obsession. Either it wasn\u2019t really explained or developed enough for my brain to get a grip on it. I did appreciate Ellen Bryson\u2019s way of capturing his obsessions though. Obsession is so closely related to addiction and I think Bryson depicted Bartholomew\u2019s actions very well. His obsessions were definitely borderline addictions.I think many readers who enjoy the time period or subject matter will definitely like this book.

Barnum). It was here on the fourth floor that his Curiosities lived: the fat lady, the giantess, the strong man, the conehead, the rubberman and Bartholomew Fortuno, the World's Skinniest Man. Late one night Barthy sees Barnum leading a woman totally covered in wraps into the building. Mystery surrounds this woman, she is to be a new show but Barnum is slow to let out what her \"talent\" is and the others all gossip and slowly find things out until it is finally revealed. Barnum himself is totally infatuated with this woman, bringing Mrs. Barnum, the senior partner, onto the scene causing problems for everyone. But Bartholomew has also become enamoured of her and become her friend and likewise she has befriended him. This is ultimately a story of love, how deep love can run, and can it survive extreme divisions.I was hooked on this book from the beginning. I have a (what some may call macabre) interest in the old circus side-shows (freak shows, if you will) and this book is set in my favourite time period so there really was no doubt I was going to like it. The story is not based on any actual real historical incident but the background historical details are real. Barnum ran The American Museum for many years before he went into the circus business in his 60s. The story is very compelling and is more about the side-show performers than it is about Barnum. The narrative is told from Bartholomew's point of view; he has a unique sense of his strangeness and is quite proud of it but he becomes challenged as to whether he is truly one of the Curiosities, who is that way by nature as he claims to be, or a Gaff (a fake) who has chosen to be the way he is. This becomes a big theme in the book as does a love triangle that develops, well in reality two love triangles consisting of the same two people with different thirds.The book is certainly well-written, attention grabbing and page-turning. I read the book withing 24 hours. There are two big reveals, obviously the secret of the new performers oddity as I've mentioned and another which isn't revealed until the end of the book. My problem was that I guessed the first as soon as the character was introduced and the second shortly afterwards so my race to the finish was not to find out what the reveal was but simply to see how the characters would react. It was fun getting there and I did enjoy the book but I can't say the ending pleased me much. I would have liked it to have gone a little further with two specific, separate characters before ending.

It\u2019s a real period piece, traditional and romantic, with a large cast of old-fashioned, rather courtly characters. Of course, they are a bunch of circus freaks, but really that\u2019s just a minor detail. You see, the story is about identity and how we define ourselves. How much of what we are is chosen by us, however unwittingly, and how much is truly intrinsic and inescapable. This is a fictionalized account of the lives of the show people who lived in P.T. Barnum\u2019s New York City museum in the months leading up to the real-life fire that destroyed the building in 1865. It is also a love story of sorts, between Bartholomew Fink, the human skeleton, and the bearded lady, Iell Adams. But mostly it\u2019s about Fink\u2019s journey of self discovery. I was impressed by author Ellen Bryson\u2019s ability to create such a palpable sense of place. The museum itself, a safe haven for these outcasts of society, is so vividly depicted - the elaborate floor plan, the dusty velvet curtains, the oily sizzle of the breakfast bacon, the hazy glow of the oil lamps, the play of the sunlight in the arboretum- all in stark contrast to the rank, over-crowded streets of mid-nineteenth century New York just outside the walls. A world which represents nothing more than danger and derision. I also loved the humanity of her characters. She gives them all enough face time so that we get to know them as quirky individuals, each with his/her own motives and unique view on their insular little world. For Bartholomew\u2019s part, he sees their profession split into two distinct groups - gaffs, or folks who pretend to be freaks, and true \"prodigies,\" those who, by their very nature, are different than average people. He believes that he is simply not able to eat and so his skeletal 63 pound frame makes him a prodigy whose calling is to show the audience fundamental truths about themselves and their humanity. But, reading his story, you get the nagging feeling that these lofty ideas are a bit misguided and, worse yet, maybe there\u2019s a whole lot he\u2019s missing out on. The author provides repeated scenes of Fink sitting down to meals with the others, eating only a handful of steamed string beans. By the end of the book, I felt like I was starving right along with him. And that\u2019s the magic Bryson works here. She makes you long to see her protagonist break free from his self-imposed prison, like the exotic caged birds he lovingly attends as keeper of Barnum\u2019s arboretum. This book was completely enjoyable.

The author proceeds in the manner of, \u201c...and then,\u201d \u201c...and then,\u201d and so on. What little character development there is seems to be tossed in as an afterthought to justify the use of \u201cTransformation\u201d in the title. There\u2019s talent here.

I started The Transformation of Batholomew Fortuno last week, read about thirty pages and felt fairly underwhelmed. I hoped it would get better, the synopsis is unique and creative. But thirty more pages left me wallowing, completely unhooked.Bartholomew Fortuno narrates our story which takes place in 1865, just after Lincoln's assasination. Bartholomew is the world's thinnest man and one of the most special exhibits at P.T. Barnum's American Museum, a place full of scientific and human oddities. Barthy is quite a formal person and his narrative is as dull as formal people tend to be. Even surrounded by a woman-giant, a man as bendy as rubber, and a dominating and dictatorial boss, Bartholomew stays as rigid as his pencil thin skeleton. I read his emotions and thoughts, but I didn't feel them. He was weak and afraid of the outside world, but instead of feeling that sensation, it was as though my eyes passed over the words he was giving me and none of them made it through my corneas into my brain.I never skip forward in a book, I usually finish whatever I pick up to read, especially if it's an advance copy. But I skipped forward for the first time with The Transformation of Bartholomew Fortuno. I skipped about a hundred pages, read a little; skipped some more, read a little; and then read the last few pages. And now that it's done I honestly feel like I didn't miss anything in the pages I didn't read. I hate saying it, and I would never want to offend the author, but it's true. I was bored. I couldn't even give this book one or two stars for not liking it, I just had nothing emotionally invested for me to finish reading."}, {"userName": "Ursula", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991494-ursula", "userReview": "I was excited when this book arrived through LibraryThing's Early Reviewer program because the information with it compared it to Geek Love and Water for Elephants. I loved both of those books.At first, I was going along with the buildup - Bartholomew Fortuno is the world's skinniest man, and he considers his thinness to be his \"gift.\" He works at Barnum's American Museum, has a platonic love affair with Matina, the fat lady, and varying levels of conflict with some of the other performers and staff. It was a little bit slow going, but I was going to give it a chance. Bartholomew sees a veiled woman arrive at the museum late one night and is sure she's a new performer, but there is an unusual amount of mystery surrounding her instead of the usual bluster from Barnum. It turns out she is Iell, a bearded lady. Right about the time this is revealed, the story went off the rails for me. Bartholomew is fascinated with her and risks much to first get information about her and then try to help her. Meanwhile, there's entirely too much intrigue between too many characters back at the museum. It seems that everyone is starting, spreading, or trying to find out rumors about everyone else. It's exhausting, especially because we're just along for the ride with Bartholomew, and he seems completely unable to get any answers.There are a couple of \"surprises\" near the end, but I thought they were pretty well telegraphed beforehand. It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing that they weren't real twists, if there had been more of interest that went before.I did enjoy the overall atmosphere of the book - New York in the mid-1800s and a glimpse into Barnum's American Museum. But overall I found it slow-moving and unsatisfying.My copy is an ARC."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922992-melissa", "userReview": "This book had me interested in what was going on right up to the end of the book. The main character and narrator, Bartholomew Fortuno believes that his extreme thinness as a gift, one that elevates him above the masses of \"normal\" people. His sense of who he is and how he has become so thin is a sense of pride for Bartholomew and it is reinforced by the reactions of the audience. When he meets another fellow performer, a new act in Barnum's museum, he finds his world changing. He starts to question things he never thought he'd ever question. So certain as he was to his world and the world around him. As he starts to venture outside his comfort zone, his perceptions start to change. As his perceptions change, his world starts to transform. Instead of gifts he sees the world is really of our own making. He also sees that the world changes no matter how hard we try to make our own world stagnant.The mysteries of the self of each of the players in this book have you guessing as to who is hiding what and who is loyal to whom all set in a place that is at once open to the \"normal\" as it is closed. The climax of the book is not without it's surprises and it is quite shocking. The book in itself is a show and one that is well done and deserves it's own applause. The transformation is not of just one character, but of many. I recommend this book and give it 4 stars. This is one show you are invited to really know the characters."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3546862-nikki", "userReview": "I picked this up because I was told this was a lot like 'Water for Elephants', a book I really enjoyed. The only similarity between the two though, is that they both center around people who are 'freaks' or who are involved with them. While 'Water for Elephants' was engrossing and the characters were so well developed that you really identified with them, 'Bartholomew Fortuno' is endlessly tedious and features a cast of sadly underdeveloped personalities. Absolutely nothing happens, at all. This is not necessarily a problem when the characters are strong and they propel the story along, but the protagonists of this book are utterly unrealistic and one-dimensional. The sad part is, this could have been a great novel. It's set in 19th century New York in a museum of freaks and performances - you could create such an interesting story in that world. What makes it even sadder is that it's obvious Bryson spent a great amount of time researching this novel: the book is full of references to events, both big and very small, that actually happened back then. This book would've received one star from me if it weren't for this. So much potential gone to waste. No matter how great the setting and amount of detail is, if you don't have a proper plot and/or captivating characters, your novel will fall flat."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270041-keith", "userReview": "The setting for this fictional account is based on historical fact. P.T. Barnum, America\u2019s most famous showman, self-promoter and hoaxer did indeed own and run a spectacular museum of macabre exhibits and performances by what he called: \u201ca cast of freaks and oddities\u201d. Bartholomew Fortuno as \u201cthe world\u2019s skinniest man\u201d is part of Barnum\u2019s theatrical events and this story of his experient relationship with the other members of the company such as Matina, the Fat Lady, Ricardo the Rubber Man and several others is rather interesting in the beginning---perhaps as the original show may have been--- but it gets old quickly. The book begins rather slowly and then slows down. Eventually, after a new act is introduced and Fortuno becomes besotted with unrequited love, the tempo increases slightly but it never truly gets off the ground. I\u2019ll give it high marks for creating a sense and atmosphere of New York City of the 1860\u2019s but the story of these unhappy people never really seemed to get underway or move me."}, {"userName": "Brenda Ayala", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9873129-brenda-ayala", "userReview": "I loved the accuracy (at least as far as I could tell) of this book. Real events from the time period were melded seamlessly into the plot without feeling overly contrived. They were relevant and progressed the story. The characters were a bit difficult to relate to, if only because they're so different from myself. Fortuno's descent into obsession was chronicled well and I mourned his lost friendship with Matina.The twist that came at the end regarding the Bearded Lady (I've forgotten her name now, forgive me) wasn't something I was expecting, although in hindsight I feel like I probably should have. This isn't the kind of book that will appeal to everyone, and yet it's such a wonderful story filled with characters that are off the beaten path. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with a desire to see the lesser-known characters of a circus environment.

All the characters, and not just the Bartholomew of the title, have their own path to their next step in life, and even the minor characters are sketched with a delicate touch of chiaroscuro: their 'freak' character is subtly matched with untold but shown traits, making them fully rounded.The research and setting of the books are fascinating, especially if like me you're a devoted and avid reader/researcher/writer of curious: old vaudeville; the development of reality shows (what's the 'freak show' if not today's Reality TV programs and docudramas?); the treatment 'freaks' received from their audiences and managers.There's a certain detached, melancholic feel to this book (for me) - in tune with the main character's story and discovery of self.

After a slow start, I fell in love with all of the characters which are based on the freaks and geeks of the circus and somewhat on fact. Bartholomew, who is billed as the thinnest man on earth has his world come apart when he meets the bearded lady. This turns out to be a love triangle in some sense. The story is really one of acceptance of yourself and others. This is one moments that just shocked me, but it made the story really make sense and come alive. I also should have seen it coming.Bryson does a super job of interweaving the fact with her fiction. She places handwritten notes, playbills and other documents within the pages. I really enjoy off-kilter stories and this one just really hit me right. I look forward to another one by this author.

With an author educated in English at Columbia and Creative Writing at John Hopkins I expected lyrical, eloquent prose,and interesting, accurate history. Unfortunately, most of this book fell flat.

It was extremely burdened by description that was irrelevant to the story itself. I had to skim through most of it to wean through what felt like writing class exercises to even get to the actual dialogue or interaction between characters. The story itself is a fabulously interesting topic that could have had genuine emotional resonance had it focused more on the characters and less on describing a time and place that felt unreal. I felt out of time reading it because it's the 21st century and I know the facts about these 'human curiosities.' Not for one moment did I experience what it would have been like for them to have been freaks in the 1860s. Had she chosen a dramatic approach instead of the melodramatic it might've worked. As she wrote it, from Bartholomew's perspective of being different as being a gift, didn't fit. It's 2018 and people still get murdered for looking, saying, or doing the wrong thing. I think all of the characters would've shown more caution in both their beliefs and actions- even to each other. I wanted more. I wanted to have been transformed and I wasn't. I wanted an actual mystery for all of the spying, betraying, and deals-making behavior that took up way too many pages and gave absolutely no pay-off.

I did not find that any of these characters particularly likable and had no better opinion of the society folks who paid to see them or Barnum himself who profited from them.
