I am sure nobody would mind about that.However, if perfection isn\u2019t in the equation, I think that a wise approach is constructing a solid first part, not necessarily extraordinary, but with great potential to become better and introducing interesting new characters. Then, having a second part involving a bigger scope action and since we would have an expected third part, so why not a victory for the bad guys? So far, it was a format quite similar to the original movie trilogy of Star Wars (while I do think that the first film was truly extraordinary, where yes, the scope in the second film was bigger and more intense, both movies the same as epic and iconic). Then the fearful third part comes.Moviegoers can tell you how hard is having good third movies in a trilogy (why? I don\u2019t know, maybe some voodoo curse, or something!) but it\u2019s almost inevitable after two good movies, having a failure in the third movie. Even sometimes, if we are so kind with those third movies, we can rescue some elements, we can appreciate some effort, but the unmerciful general opini\u00f3n decrees that the third movie wasn\u2019t near as good as the previous ones.You know? I like the third movie of Star Wars. Close friends know that my complain is about the use of the Ewoks. And it\u2019s not the Ewoks per se, since I find them as an interesting alien species and even they had a whole better 80\u2019s animated series in comparison with the boring and poor produced Droids. My objection falls in making a comedy-like battle of primitive almost-naked care bears against profesional trained armored-suited soldiers.In any case, we could have an eternal discussion if Return of the Jedi is as good as its two previous installments.The same kind of arguments, I\u2019m sure, since I have no doubt there must be many readers who consider that all three books in the Thrawn Trilogy deserved a full 5-stars rating. Where I have no problems with that, since it\u2019s the right of each reader to give the ratings that they feel that it reflects as their own personal reading experience with the books.In my own personal case, it was like an increasing reading experience. Heir to the Empire was a 3-stars\u2019 experience (still on the good side of a positive reading), then Dark Force Rising was a 4-stars\u2019 experience, and now, in this book, The Last Command, I am truly glad of finding it as a truly 5-stars\u2019 experience, that seeing the trilogy as a whole long story, I found that it\u2019s the ideal way to present a story, since indeed the climax, the final part should be the strongest and most solid section of the entire narrative.\nA LEADER IS AS GOOD AS HIS/HER OFFICERS\nGrand Admiral Thrawn was a formidable strategist and a born leader.However, a leader is as good as his/her officers. I still am kinda hesitant about his appreciation of how the Emperor may use the Force to coordinate fleets formations but it\u2019s clear that Thrawn has a vision, a clear vision of how to deploy an effective plan to give back the Empire its former glory.Sadly, he can\u2019t be everywhere, and he needed to trust in the decisions of his/her officers and associates where even they may have \u201cgood intentions\u201d to help the cause (sometimes they may be just plain crazy), but the final result can be disastrous. And even Earth\u2019s Roman Emperors\u2019 history can give useful tips of how crutial is who you choose as your own personal security (of course, it\u2019s possible that since Earth is in another galaxy, far far away from them, the Empire wasn\u2019t aware of certain history\u2019s valuable lessons) but still since Thrawn is shown as some formidable strategist and a military leader seeing two steps ahead of his fellow comrades and enemies, it\u2019s kinda odd that he may be susceptible to such dangerous situations.\nATTACK OF THE CLOONEYS\nThe idea of having evil crazy clones is really cool. However, their choices of names is kinda odd.I mean, without making any spoiler (don\u2019t worry), there are clones there, okay? But their names is basically the same name of their original counterparts but just adding an extra vowel (a,e,i,o or u) in their names, and while there are some vowels where when you have a distinct sound (Geez! I feel like doing a Sesame Street segment!) there are some vowels that even having two of them, the sound would be pretty much the same. Sure, in a prose novel like this one, you can easily differentiate them from your comfy position as reader......but how the heck the characters can tell any difference in the names?!!!It\u2019s not like Jango Fett\u2019s clones just decided to name themselves \u201cJaango\u201d as an unanimous call. No, they chose to name themselves like Cody, Rex and so on. Even Jango\u2019s unaltered clone is named Bobba. Totally different names.Even weirder, I think that there is some intention of deception in the crazy evil clones here, in the sense that they may want to be perceive as the \u201coriginals\u201d and not clones, so why bother even to choose names that they are virtually the same that hearing them, it will be heard without any sound difference?Street Fighter may show easy wisdom in the case of Ryu, where his evil clone is named... Evil Ryu!!! See? Easy! Anyone will be able to say... \u201cAaah! Sure! You\u2019re Evil Ryu!\u201d (Of course, besides the clear name, you have a cool dark aura, but still\u2026) it\u2019s not like Evil Ryu appears and he says... \u201cI\u2019m Ryuu!\u201d and people would just hear the name as \u201cRyu\u201d without knowing that there is a dang extra vowel \u201cu\u201d in the name! Geez!!!\nNEVER WILL BE THE SAME ANYMORE\nAny good book in a series should create an everlasting impact, in the sense of the introduction of new characters, the forge of new interactions between characters, crutial change in the status situation of the characters, etc... in that way, the story can be felt as something relevant in its existence in the developing of the series.And certainly, the Thrawn Trilogy had all that!So, putting aside some inconsistencies due the theatrical films made several years after the publication of this book trilogy, no one can deny the importance of it, with the introduction of key characters that they become crutial in the development of the Expanded Universe in Star Wars during 25 years since then."}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "Strictly speaking, the poster of the original Star Wars movie does not have too much in common with the last book of the trilogy except for the settings and main heroes, but my child self really loved it when I saw it first. I was waiting for a chance to use it and this looks like a good place as any, so there you have it:The New Republic is besieged on all sides thanks to the genius machinations by Thrawn - behind the scenes and open battles. Torn by internal struggles, the Republic is poorly equipped to handle the deadly threat. The main heroes desperately try to save the situation while being pursued by even more powerful forces than Thrawn and his resurrected Empire. The decisive battles and final confrontations are coming. The main villains still remain the best written characters in the trilogy. They are interesting, devious, powerful, and smart. Unfortunately the latter definition cannot be applied to the good guys all the time - especially Luke Skywalker. The Delta Force revelation was very clever and unexpected. Despite my lower rating the book is on the same quality level as the first two. Once I accepted that the main surviving heroes from the movies do not feel like themselves in the books it was a smooth sailing. Actually by the end of the book Han Solo finally regained his sense of humor - even if for a brief moment. The reasons for the lower rating are not significant, but taken together they were enough. First of all I kept saying it is a fun mindless entertainment. Well, by the middle of the last book the novelty wore off. I would not say the mindless entertainment overstayed its welcome, but it came very close. The ending was a little letdown and cliche. It felt a little overdrawn with big bad guy giving an obligatory Evil Villain Speech. Other overused tropes that I will not discuss also show up.The final rating for the book is 3.5 stars. The whole trilogy rates the same despite slightly higher grades I gave to the first two books. I said it before and I say it again, \"Mindless, but very entertaining\". A must read for any serious Star Wars fan."}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This was a fun conclusion to the Thrawn Trilogy. It was of a similar quality to the previous two books in the series and satisfactorily wrapped up the main ongoing plot arcs. The ending produced a few shocks which was quite entertaining. I was happy with the way things concluded regarding the Dark Jedi Jorus C'baoth, but felt like things with Thrawn were a bit rushed. On the plus side Thrawn was back to his best in this book. He was a step ahead of his enemies most of the time. Thrawn, Karrde, and Mara Jade continue to be more entertaining than the characters from the original movies. I'll read more from the now defunct Star Wars EU just to read more about them. Rating 3 stars.Audio Note: Mark Thompson did a fantastic job with this full series. The sound effects also helped to give the audio book a real Star Wars feel."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob", "userReview": "Same review for all three: I grew up on Lucas' film trilogy; it took on a certain mythological quality. Say what you will about Lucas: I won't apologize for this enjoyment. When the first horn blasts of that John Williams score strike, I wear that nerdy shame with all of its lightsaber-wielding pride.And Zahn pulls off a follow-up trilogy just well enough to pass. We get some closure on the whole Han/Leia thing, we see how well the fledgling Republic fares, watch Luke struggle through his on-going mentor-less apprenticeship. It moves along at a fair-enough pace, pays respect to the \"classic\" characters while introducing some well-executed new ones, and honors canon well enough that it won't raise the hackles of the rabid fan.High literature, it is not. A decent enough lightweight read for an unashamed Star Wars fan, it is."}, {"userName": "TS Chan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan", "userReview": "Really enjoyable and fitting closure to the Thrawn trilogy, and Mara Jade's dilemma. The audiobook performance really elevated the story-telling, which was otherwise fairly predictable. Luke and Leia both come across as being too nice and bland sometimes, which thankfully was tempered by more interesting characters like Han, Chewie, Lando, Talon Karrde and his smugglers, even the Noghri, and of course, Thrawn - one of the most impressive antagonists I've read to date. What I liked most from these books is the expansion of the Star Wars galaxy from the beloved movies while maintaining the nostalgia with the characters that made it special."}, {"userName": "David - proud Gleeman in Branwen's adventuring party", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10923016-david---proud-gleeman-in-branwen-s-adventuring-party", "userReview": "Rather then ending the Thrawn Trilogy with a whimper, Timothy Zahn saves the best for The Last Command!With Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine gone, the New Republic was supposed to usher in a golden age of peace. Instead, the galaxy finds itself being torn apart by the ravages of war again. Led by the brilliantly tactical mind of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the dreaded Imperial Empire has risen again, armed with a fleet of seemingly-indestructible starships that are being piloted by a limitless army of clones. Pulling the strings of the Empire's vast clone army is Dark Jedi C'Baoth, who is too far gone in his delusions to realize that he himself is also merely a puppet of Thrawn's. In a last ditch effort to end the war and defeat the Empire, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo lead a covert mission with the one person who knows enough about Thrawn's stolen technology to destroy it...Jedi warrior Mara Jade, who once served as the Emperor's most trusted assassin. But even if Luke manages to save the galaxy, he may never get to see the results of his work, since Mara Jade has vowed to fulfill the Emperor's last command and kill Luke Skywalker...Like many people my age, I grew up loving Star Wars, but in more recent years, it became harder and harder to remember why. Let's face it, the prequels were, at best, disappointing, and when Lucas re-released the original Star Wars trilogy, it seem like without that childhood sense of wonder, the flaws of the original trilogy were far more glaring. Sure, the action was great and the one-liners were amusing, but when you really look at the original movies, the characters were mostly cliched, the overall story was pretty standard, and much of the dialogue that didn't make us laugh induced groaning instead. In fact, what better evidence is there that the much of the appeal of the original Star Wars trilogy was cosmetic than the fact that Boba Fett became such a fan-favorite character...despite the fact that he didn't really do much more than wear a cool-looking suit of armor...\"Let the stormtroopers do all the work...I'm just going to stand around and look shiny!\"But Timothy Zahn's brilliant Thrawn Trilogy has reminded me why Star Wars still has a special place in my heart...it's FUN!!! Yes, even with its flaws, if the stories are done right, the good far outweighs the bad and the audience is taken on a roller-coaster of a thrill ride. But with the Thrawn Trilogy, Zahn has managed to up the ante a bit by giving us a story that's not only fun, but intelligent as well. And no character embodies the more cerebral nature of Zahn's Star Wars stories than lead villain Grand Admiral Thrawn himself. While Darth Vader was more inclined to simply choke the life out of someone who displeased him, Thrawn's tactics are far more methodical. I knew I was in for a different kind of Star Wars adventure right from Chapter 1, when Thrawn uses a strategically-placed cloaked ship to give the illusion that his own starfighter can somehow manage to shoot through his prey's shields, causing them to surrender because they believe he possesses a super-weapon that doesn't actually exist! All throughout the book, Thrawn machinates complex schemes that are fascinating to watch as they unfold...my favorite being the most creative usage of asteroids that I have ever seen!Not that the bar was set that high...before this book, the most creative usage of asteroids in art was a game where you did nothing but shoot at rocks over and over...if I had to chose between playing this game for two hours or watching that movie where Bruce Willis and a bunch of oil-drillers get shot into space...well, I'd still pick this game, but it would be harder to chose than it should be! But Thrawn is just one of many things that works about this novel. In addition to Thrawn's master plan, multiple sub-plots introduced in the first two books are realized in a superb fashion. Princess Leia's pregnancy, smuggler Talon Karrde's efforts to rally his fellow rogues against the Empire, Thrawn's mysterious informant within the Republic, and of course, Mara's mission to kill Luke...Zahn was juggling a lot in the trilogy's final episode. Fortunately, rather than collapse under its own weight, the book weaves all the various plot-threads together, leading each to a more-than-satisfying conclusion. In addition, the minor problems I had with the last two books were resolved this time around. While the previous two books dragged at times, this one was paced beautifully, so much so that I never once found my interest waning. Classic characters like Han and Leia were handled better and no longer felt outshone by Zahn's original characters like Mara and Karrde. Even dark Jedi C'Baoth, who I found more annoying in the past, came across as a far more intimidating adversary this time around. Yes, if there was any flaw this time around, it was that the ending came a little too abruptly, but it was hard to get too upset about that, considering it was so artistically done!Above is another example of something artistically done! Forget that overrated Mona Lisa drawing...as far as I'm concerned, THIS is true artwork!!!Exciting, intelligent, and most of all, FUN!!! \"The Last Command\" is the best book in an amazing 3-novel series. To anyone who ever enjoyed the Star Wars universe, this trilogy is a must read. And if, like myself, you ever found yourself wondering why you ever liked Star Wars so much in the first place, this trilogy will make you realize that your original love of Star Wars wasn't just the result of some Jedi mind-trick..."}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19157324-jack", "userReview": "\u201cThe Thrawn Trilogy\u201d is the most common answer to the question \u201cWhich Star Wars books should I start with?\u201d After finishing this last book in the trilogy, I can understand why. Grand Admiral Thrawn is an outstanding and compelling nemesis. Overall it is a solid trilogy, with a good mix of action, political machinations, and Force spiritualism mumbo-jumbo. Even a casual Star Wars fan will enjoy these books.The main issue for me was that the Thrawn character was so interesting, it highlighted the flatness of many of the other characters. As is often the case in fiction (and, at times, real life), the more interesting characters were the villains (Thrawn, Pellaeon) and the conflicted characters (Karrde, Jade). However, all of the characters with the New Republic (Luke et al.) were a bit boring, except for Wedge Antilles, because Red Two/Rogue Leader is never boring. Or perhaps my annoyance with Han and Leia just spilled over and infected the entire New Republic cast of characters.

I say that this might not be fair because in reality, they aren't that bad; the plot is certainly interesting enough to hold your attention, especially if you're a Star Wars fan. However, there are several aspects of these books that just irked me the entire way through, and ultimately prevent the series from getting any more than a \"read it if you've got nothing else better to read\" recommendation from me.The first and biggest problem with the Thrawn Trilogy is the portrayal of the central characters from the original Star Wars films. Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, C-3PO; even Chewie and R2-D2 all fall extremely flat when compared to their movie counterparts. Han and Leia get the shortest end of the stick, possessing very little of the wit and charm (and absolutely NONE of the romantic chemistry) that made their characters shine on screen. All the pair ever seem to do in these novels is worry about things; Leia about the success or failure of her political endeavours, and Han about the well-being of Leia. Luke comes off as the most faithfully portrayed; essentially remaining at the same level of mild stoicism and virtuosity as he was at in Return of the Jedi (which wasn't very interesting to begin with). C-3PO and R2-D2 are basically just parodies of themselves, and worse, barely contribute a thing to the story despite at least one of them being present at nearly every major event (See: The Prequel Trilogy). Chewbacca and Lando are boring cardboard cut outs. This is all made worse by the fact that returning characters seem to feel the need to constantly remember (and very often quote) parts from the original films, and reflect on how similar or dissimilar that particular event was compared to their current situation. It's as though you as the reader are constantly being turned towards and winked at every few chapters, in case you forgot you were reading a Star Wars book.Another big problem is the new characters. While thankfully the books are all but saved by the presence of interesting newcomers Talon Karde and Mara Jade (despite their being fairly transparent Mary-Sues), virtually every single other new character is flat and boring. Grand Admiral Thrawn (the titular villain of the series) would have been an interesting new character if we'd ever been given a look at him through his own mind, and not through the eyes of his bland and annoying first officer. Thrawn is essentially omniscient; whenever there is any kind of trickery afoot he automatically knows that something is up (and often exactly what the trickery is, who is orchestrating it, and why) even when he would have absolutely no reason to suspect anything normally. Again, this would be interesting if we were ever given a look at his supposedly ingenious thought process, but every time it happens, it seems to do so only because the plot needs it to. This is very, very lazy writing. Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth is intriguing as a concept, but is mostly left on the sidelines of the story from the beginning of the first book until very late in the third book, and is given little to do in between. The other new characters such as Senator Garm Bel Iblis, Winter, Niles Ferrier, Councilor Fey'lya and Ghent are all one-note characters with a single defining characteristic each.Finally, author Timothy Zahn's writing style simply isn't very good. Particularly when characters are conversing with one another, there seems to be only a few different types of responses (which often sound awkward and hard to envision) that characters are able to give one another, such as: \"grunted\", \"retorted\", \"countered\", and \"conceded\". Zahn also uses the word \"sardonic\" incorrectly on a few occasions, and by the end of the third book it was really getting on my nerves how often characters tended to \"mentally cross their fingers\", or admit defeat in an argument by simply saying \"Point.\"Over all, I may have made this book seem awful, but it really isn't. As I said, the plot is interesting enough to hold your attention (even though the pay-offs to established mysteries usually somewhat underwhelming), and its cool to see some of the concepts from the movies expanded upon in greater detail than in the films (such as the logistics of using The Force, or how space battles and hyper-drive technology actually work in the Star Wars universe). Though you may find yourself, as I did, skimming over more than a few redundant character conversations or internal debates. For my part, however, I'll definitely try to avoid Star Wars EU books which prominently feature characters from the films as their protagonists, as the discrepancy between screen and page portrayals was the biggest obstacle for me.Hope this review was helpful!"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "Usually it is the other way around : I like the first book of a series better than the last one, probably because it is all new and full of promise, worlds and people waiting to be discovered. With the Thrawn trilogy I already knew what I was dealing with before I even started, and it took me until the third and final book to get caught up in the adventure. I've grumbled in the first two reviews about the poor writing, the lack of originality and the often contrived logic of the conflict, but I confess I read this last one in only a couple of days, feverishly turning the pages to follow up on the action. I guess a part of me will remain a teenager thirsting for over the top lightsaber duels and miles long battleships drifting majestically over starry landscapes, no matter how much I advance in years. The familiarity with the characters and the hardware helps the story along, with some set pieces readily identifiable as they are recycled material (the throne room confrontation, the garbage chute escape or messing around with the electronics in a circular pit).I must admit that the different threads of the plot have come together rather well in this final book, despite the forceful bringing together of several independently operating teams in the same location for the big finale. Master Jedi C'Baoth somehow steals the rug from under Grand Admiral Thrawn as the big threat to the Galaxy. As the series parallels in general the original movies, the Empire holds the upper hand until almost to the final page, but I would say the outcome was never in doubt, as the good guys always get out of jail in the nick of time and live to fight another day. The closure of the Thrawn plotline in particular was a disappointment, not only predictable, but also cutting down on a big action scene right when things were starting to get interesting. But ... it is sort of open ended and leaves the reader still wondering : What comes next? I'm curious in particular about the twin kids of Leia and Han Solo and how they will learn the Jedi trade. Such is the power of attraction this Star Wars universe exercises on our imagination, not unlike the popular Harry Potter, Pirates of the Carribean or Twilight francises. It's probably not only the fight between good and evil (I've read some comic books from Dark Horse where the line of demarcation is more blurred and the characters more nuanced than the ones Zahn worked with), as the pure adrenalin rush of a fast paced adventure. I know the food analogy has been overused in characterizing books, but if the Thrawn books are popcorn instead of chateaubriand, sometimes popcorn is exactly what I feel like eating.I am interested in continuing with the Star Wars fanfiction, but I think I prefer the comic book format as better suited to the intense visual elements of the stories."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

I didn\u2019t care all that much about the lost ships, or clones, or the struggling Empire. But I was invested in Leia and her relationship with the Noghri from the beginning, it just seemed like a very Leia-y thing to happen.

And it will take the collaboration of long-time enemies to win.NOTE: Spoilers from the previous two novels may appear.I Liked:Another tough section to write as I want to include everything from the previous two novels!In this third book, Zahn steps up the threat of Thrawn by allowing him to capture the Katana fleet and be successful in his takeover of worlds. Too often, a villain is \"dangerous\" or \"evil\" because the author writes it. But the villain never does anything that really threatens the heroes and makes the reader wonder who will come out on top. This is certainly not so with The Last Command. I was a bit worried earlier on in the trilogy, when Thrawn's expertise was lauded and yet he seemed to fail at every venue. While this was notable in making Thrawn fallible, it was also possibly hurting his reputation and believability as a true villain. I shouldn't have worried. Zahn followed up with a nice little win for Thrawn, and now the stakes are truly high and our heroes do have something real to worry over.I've talked endlessly about the characters, Luke, Leia, and Han, so I won't really add anything, other than they are, as always, fabulous. I also love how Zahn gets the credit for creating the Solo twins, who would make such an impression in the New Jedi Order and the Legacy of the Force series. But I also love the path that Mara's story is taking. In many ways, the Thrawn trilogy is her trilogy. She grows, from a nomadic smuggler, running from her past, to a Rebel embracing her future. Mara realizes the Empire is dead and will never return, that the Emperor may not have always told the truth, and perhaps she doesn't want to kill Luke after all. Her growth in this trilogy is truly amazing. And while she does tread the Mary Sue line, well, I can handle it.I really like how Zahn brought in the clones and references to the Clone Wars. While much of our knowledge of the Clone Wars has changed with the prequels, I like seeing how his ideas still fit or can be worked into the \"new\" universe. It's also interesting to think about how the Force behaves around clones. I hope someone gets a chance to talk about that.Also, I applaud Zahn for his nice, crisp conclusion. Not too long and preachy, hopeful, yet tinged with solemnity. The universe has been saved...but the New Republic still has a long way to go.I Didn't Like:I really have to be nit-picky yet again in order to come up with anything for this section.While I like the clones, Zahn doesn't give them much of a personality (apparently, a plague of being bred in an ysalamiri environment) nor does he give much indication of what happens to them afterwards.The concept of the ysalamiri even seems to have changed since Heir. In Heir, Luke never senses the dark void the ysalamiri create, allowing himself to be captured. Here, Luke and Mara can sense that Mount Tantiss is shrouded in darkness, meaning they wouldn't be able to use the Force.Petty, but I was a little perturbed that the Solo-Skywalker clan can jail-break Mara and receive no repercussions. Just another thing that makes me wonder if the New Republic is going to be quickly corrupted.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.Leia gives birth to her twins and breast-feeds them.Several characters die. Luke, Han, Lando, Chewie, and Mara are sent to Wayland to destroy the cloning facility.Overall:Some things age well with time, others don't. I've read a few older Star Wars novels that just haven't quite stood the test of time. I can happily state that the Thrawn Trilogy isn't one of them.As a review of both the last book and the series as a whole, the Thrawn Trilogy is in short brilliant. There is no doubt at all that this is Star Wars. Lightsaber battles, Jedis, Imperials, smugglers, new worlds, new aliens, new technologies, new characters, Han, Luke, Leia, the Force...all are here and are masterfully written. The minute you begin reading, you are enveloped in the world and are startled when you realize you are reading Star Wars and not watching the movies! I cannot give these novels enough praise. If you are a Star Wars fan, these need to be the first novels you read."}, {"userName": "Alex Ristea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1669785-alex-ristea", "userReview": "[his death hit me the hardest of anyone in the trilogy?

While he's an opportunist and a bit of a scoundrel, he does have a sense of right and wrong. He's definitely a useful ally. And I thought his taste for the finer things, his pet vornskrs, and his penchant for puns were cute. Admiral Thrawn is probably the best villain of the entire Star Wars cycle. He's absolutely brilliant, usually one or two steps ahead of his prey and enemies. Several times I was totally at a loss trying to figure out how Han and Luke and company would ever survive the game. He's also urbane; and I liked how he collected the artwork of different species because of what it told him about their cultures. And then there's Mara Jade. She's scary at times, but her inner conflict blunts her purpose. It might not be completely logical or realistic for someone who spent years as the Emperor's Hand, his private assassin, to change sides; but I like that she has good in her, and without the Emperor jerking her around, she chooses to change. These books are some of the most entertaining in the Star Wars Extended Universe."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "One of my favorite things about this series is how the books work together to tell one story (acting as initial conflict, rising tension, and climax, respectively), and yet each book has its own separate arc as well. As they go, the books escalate in tension and in the scale of the final climax of those arcs. In book one, it\u2019s as small as a fight between Luke and Mara in the jungles of a small planet, trying to escape, and a single unit of Stormtroopers trying to apprehend them. In book two, it\u2019s a fight between two Star Destroyers, two squadrons of X-Wings, and several ships of the Katana fleet. And here, everyone piles up in several places for several huge conflicts, and the arcs for all of the characters emotionally all have pretty nice closers as well.Spoilers for books two and three ahead.Finally, Thrawn\u2019s seemingly all-seeing strategy begins to fail, thanks to some wild cards, including the interference of Leia with the Noghri, and the increasingly erratic Joruus C\u2019baoth, who insists that he, not Thrawn, will rule the new Empire. C\u2019baoth absconds to Wayland to set a trap for Luke and the other fledgling Jedi, including Mara Jade. Pretty much all the story threads come to a head here, including the clones and the ysalamiri, and it\u2019s also where Mara\u2019s emotional arc climaxes, as she finally defeats the specter of the dead Emperor in her head, and becomes her own person once again.Leia, having recently given birth, is now protected at all times by a group of extremely dedicated Noghri bodyguards. With Mara Jade\u2019s help, they manage to track down the major leak of information slipping out to Thrawn, and despite Mara\u2019s insistence that she\u2019s going to kill Leia\u2019s brother, the two manage to bond somewhat. At least, as much as Mara is capable at this point.As for Thrawn, he eventually fails due to a combination of sheer determination on the part of his enemies, sabotage by his former ally C\u2019baoth, and his own lies previously told to the Noghri, which involved essentially enslaving that entire race and poisoning their planet. His final scene (for now) is a good one, full of earned justice, even if it is slightly sad to see him go, because he\u2019s such an entertaining villain.What really makes this book (and thus the series) isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s good sci-fi, full of space battles and fantastical science (clones, lightsabers, lightspeed, aliens, etc.), or even great strategy and side-switching and cons and other clever trickery, or epic tales of good and evil and love and friendship, but that all that stuff is supported in full by smart, emotionally affecting stories for the characters that are the ones doing all these deeds, and acting out all this action. Zahn takes our favorite characters and actually does interesting things with them, exploring and deepening our understanding of them, all while he\u2019s making us feel like kids again playing with a new toy.I\u2019m really glad I re-read this series, and I\u2019m really excited to revisit the sequel duology in a couple of months. I rmember it being even better than this series, so we\u2019ll see![4.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: A pretty good end to a pretty good series.Audio book: Once again another excellent job by Marc Thompson making this one a must listen in my opinion.\nFull Review\nIn the third and final book of the series, Mr. Zahn does a pretty good job wrapping things up. My only main gripe was that for a series called The Thrawn Trilogy, the ending with regards to Admiral Thrawn felt a lot more rushed compared to some of the other story lines.That said, I was happy with the ending. Parts of the ending I didn't see coming, but probably should have. I thought he wrapped up Mara's story particularly well. I was a bit disappointed this book didn't have the same scale of space battles as the last two though. It did have the requisite lightsabre duel that was two books in the making.This book seemed to focus a lot more on Talon Karrde, who is probably my favorite new character of the series. A lot of the parts I found slow in the last book are paying dividends here and important to the resolution of some of the threads.In general, I have a lot of the same feelings about this book as I did with the last two. Admiral Thrawn still feels a little too smart to be believable at times, though not nearly as bad as the last book. The writing could be a little better. However, this is a series to read more for the fun of being back in the Star Wars universe and not something that is read for the high quality prose.Overall this was a pretty fun series that makes me want to check out some other star wars books in the future. I'll just need to filter through them to hit up the best ones, because their are far too many of them for me to want to read them all."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "Good, but not as good as I'd hoped. It concludes the series in a satisfying manner. Still, as I said before, this is fan fiction at its best.Interestingly, this book was obviously/apparently written before George Lucas worked out the exact identity of the Clone War clones. That said, either Zahn was extremely lucky or guided by the Force because the few references he makes to stormtroopers and the old clones are ambiguous enough that local fans will give him a bye (and critics won't care).I was wrong about the identity of \"Delta Source\", but that's because I'm not whatever you call a Star Wars Trekkie. (Just offended both universes with one phrase.) I thought it was Winter. Having plants it was okay, and properly foreshadowed, but not as much fun as the betrayal by a close friend would have been.The cover art stinks. Can't believe Tom Jung let his name associated with such trash, especially since we know he can do much better. As evidenced by the cover of Heir to the Empire.Glad to see Mara Jade will have future appearances.

I enjoy Star Wars, I grew up with it... but as a person who enjoys a very human-centric story, where decisions are made based on character, and not for the sake of progressing the story... it's hard for me to give these books a very high rating.The story is so cookie cutter, and predictable it really is just for pure amusement.Admittedly, the books are entertaining, but you know what you're getting here. Even the Star Wars movies, all follow a very railroad predictable path. This isn't a bad thing... but if you're looking for something with more depth look else where. The main bad guy of the series \"Thrawn\" is probably the cheesiest, generic, stereotypical bad guy. I mean come on...how many Imperial bad guy officers have their nose up in the air, arrogant, and full of themselves. Thrawn's character is so one dimensional, it's staggering and often cringe worthy. There's no dynamisism, no inner turmoil, no nothing to make me believe that Thrawn is a character that I should care about. That's the problem with creating a villain that you try to make a \"mastermind genius\" you get a character that is an arrogant prick and you don't care about him.Another problem with a story like Star Wars, when it comes to the extended universe...you know very well that the characters are going to make it, and save the day, with nary a scratch. Follows the very simple formula of hero's being beat up, then scrambling, a bit of inner drama, and then out smart the bad guy. After reading books that have very complex plots such as game of thrones, I've been sort of spoiled by the writing there. (granted game of thrones often takes it TOO far...)The Thrawn series is at it's heart a light hearted and I GUESS fun read...I realize that the star wars franchise is not trying to be as deep and complex as other stories. My main problem is that characters are given these unrealistic boons to their intelligence which just lets the author give them near unlimited foresight and knowledge. How often in this series has Thrawn had a talk with Captain Pellion and played the role of annoyed master? \"Haha! it's all part of my master plan! Can't you see how it will play out? No? Okay, let me mockingly explain my devious and bullet proof plan!\"Now for the plus...hot diggity this is a well produced series! From start to finish, the voices are really...really good. My complaint is that the author makes characters like the smugglers, and Avs and Thrawn, way to 'mysterious' and trying too hard to be cool and aloof.... If it's one thing that gets under my skin, is characters are are overly aloof and cool with no reason. Besides this annoyance... the voices of Han, Leia, Luke, and Lando, and all of our favorite on screen heroes are all wonderfully...masterfully recreated..Anyway this doesn't change the fact that the book is sill dripping with an adolescent \"I'm a cool, dark and brooding character\" syndrome for many of it's characters. This type of writing gets old and fast...and it's used to ad naseum in the Star Wars Universe. There's no inner doubt, real military planning, strategic and realistic advantages.If you want just a continuation of more Star Wars antics with not a ton of depth, these books are fine, and I have no problem with them on that front. Great summer reads for fun and action. But I can't score this book very high on actual literary content.."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam", "userReview": "The Thrawn Trilogy (which I'll review as one unit) is, I can now agree, one of the few indispensable, and actually really worth reading productions of the EU. Zahn gets it all right, and does everything I personally want to see in the EU. First of all, he pulls off all the important plot and characterization goals he tries to achieve: all of his characters have extremely bad-ass abilities and strengths, but they are not defined by their powers. Thrawn and C'baoth in particular come to mind. Thrawn is almost infallible tactically, his will is indomitable, he is a great leader, etc, and yet this is only part of what we remember about him. He has his own very interesting personality. C'baoth demonstrates force strength beyond most anything that had appeared in the EU before the trilogy. However, he is defined not by this excessive and cool strength but by his insanity, which makes him another fascinating character.The plot was very impressively woven as well. There's a lot of stuff going on, and it all manages to tie together in a convincing and satisfying way. All the characters are constantly trying to outsmart each other and figure out what each has in mind, and the way each character is able to do this is also very convincing. Aside from these major, crucial points, Zahn also fulfills a lot of the lack I personally see in other EU material. He understands, first of all, that Stormtroopers are shock troops, as opposed to the standard Army grunts, that they are legitimately very good, and that they are extremely loyal. He also includes a very satisfying amount of random continuity, especially including a lot of stuff from the Imperial Sourcebook (near to my heart as the only West End Games sourcebook I had as a child), like the Chariot LAV, Ubiqtorate, Star Galleons, spacetroopers, etc. Perhaps most importantly, Zahn created a vast new set of interesting canon material himself. Since he was writing the first major EU production, he had a lot of freedom to do this without stepping on the toes of anything previously created, but he could still have created some pretty atrocious shit (as so many other authors did after him). Instead, everything he imagined makes sense, is effective in its context, and much of it has even been put to good use since then (though much of it has also been severely abused).With the Thrawn Trilogy, Zahn set the real EU novels off to an auspicious start. Unfortunately, only a few other novelists have managed to reach the bar he set here. Read them: you will love them."}, {"userName": "Mark Oppenlander", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2138167-mark-oppenlander", "userReview": "The Thrawn trilogy is complete. This book continues with the style and pace of the first two installments, and brings the story to a relatively satisfying conclusion (with one caveat, which I'll touch on in a moment.) Zahn comes up with several very interesting last-minute plot twists too - twists that don't feel cheap, but which you realize had been foreshadowed nicely in the earlier books.It occurs to me that some of you who follow my reviews might find it hard to fathom how I could give four stars to something like this, a book that might seem to be a relatively lightweight piece of populist fiction. After all, four stars is the same rating I gave to the excellent businsess book \"Small Giants\" or the awward-winning \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" To that, I would answer that although I give these books the same ratings, I am not necessarily saying that the books are comparable.Any book must be taken in context of what is is trying to accomplish. The Thrawn series was asked to continue the narrative of the original Star Wars movie trilogy, to create a rousing space adventure on par with something that has become iconic in pop culture. In short, Zahn was asked to write some high quality pulp fiction and satisfy millions of fans worldwide. So this series and this book are entertainment and adventure, not philosophy or high art. And as such, the series succeeds quite admirably. I am frankly impressed with what Zahn was able to accomplish given the high expectations that must have been on him.My one quibble with this particular book was that the climax feels a bit rushed and there is very little denouement. Given a three-book series that spans nearly 1400 pages, the final confrontations and revelations could have been lingered on a bit longer. It felt a little as if an editor had asked Zahn to keep the book under a certain word limit, which is too bad. Zahn had earned his curtain call; I wish he'd been allowed to take it.Still, I recommend this book not just to Star Wars fans, but to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi actioner . . . just for the fun of it."}, {"userName": "Skut L", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5998862-skut-l", "userReview": "I am being lazy and am writing this review for all three books in the trilogy. It is also a very short review.In my obviously biased opinion:1. Zahn has created the most compelling Star Wars 'villain' since the original Darth Vader in Grand Admiral Thrawn. This includes every other Vader clone, Mary Sue-type troperific Big Bad, and most of all Boba Fett and any evil character from the unfortunate lesser six films.The man studies a culture's artwork and through this insight figures out how to beat them in battle. Or, he does it as a ruse to confound enemy spies about his true military and tactical genius. Clever bastard.2. The Expanded Universe could have stopped with these novels and we might all be better for it. Though I suppose the X-wing series can be given a pass.3. The trilogy possesses the epic scope of the first three films while still delving into unknown areas in the SW Universe, and set the bar extraordinarily high for every EU author since. Even Zahn's other novels in the series just cannot compare.4. The Noghri are one of the most interesting alien species in the entire SW Universe and are criminally underused. Their story is reminiscent of dozens of cultures throughout Earth's bloody history; a people deceived into enslaving themselves to those who caused a catastrophic diaspora in their past. The Empire did not merely subjugate these people, they systemically and secretly poisoned the environment to ensure their loyalty for the promise of renewal through technology. In the SW films the Empire was always presented as so powerful as to not need such tactics. I think Zahn presented a much more realistic kind of tyranny.As a kid I devoured this trilogy at least once a year all through middle and high school. It's just pure entertainment and Zahn, much like Lucas before he turned shill, clearly studies at the Joseph Campbell school of heroic sagas."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2497528-alan", "userReview": "I know I'll probably get slammed for this, but I don't quite get all the hype for this trilogy. It is a good three book set, but outstanding-no. Whereas Zahn had nicely avoided second book middle holder with this set, the climax of the Thrawn trilogy fell flat.Which is a shame. Zahn at the worst is a competent story teller, from what I've read of his work before this I would call him average at best when it comes to characterization, and he created an interesting character in Thrawn. Where the last 1/4-1/3 of The Last Command fails is with an insane clone of Jedi Master taking center stage as the Big Bad and that reduces much of the scope of the larger conflict New Republic/Empire clash introduced in the first book.I'm sorry to see the Star Wars EU deleted by the franchise's new owners, and yes I know Disney has said the EU still exists, but really they are going to carve their own path. This set allows one to see how Lucasfilm's editors were taking a long view with some characters, i.e. Mara Jade an Kaarde, and I've read articles that credit those editors with doing a lot of hard work to keep matters consistent in the EU history (yes I am aware of the Karen Traviss controversy).Overall this remains a good starting point if you want to delve into the EU.
