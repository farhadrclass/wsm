This was a typical storyline: boss needs a fake date for a family wedding and figures the newbie employee is the most likely to fill the position. I never really connected with the characters. There was nothing new, or really particularly interesting, in this one."}, {"userName": "FicCentral", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18789728-ficcentral", "userReview": "When Samantha's boss, the cold and intimidating Mr. Putnam, summons her to his office, she's not sure what to think. When she's asked to accompany him on a business trip, she's thrilled that her hard work has been noticed and excited for the chance she'll have to pitch her new idea for the company. But when she finds out she's his date for his sister's wedding\u2026 Well, it's going to be one hell of a weekend.The Verdict: The plot's pretty standard, but there's always room for a different spin or a fresh new take, so I thought I'd give this one a shot. Unfortunately, this one is simply too short to really get off the ground, and in the end, I simply wasn't convinced.Samantha's smart, a hard worker, and easy on the eyes, and that's what Blake is looking for when it comes to a date for his sister's wedding. His faithful assistant suggested enlisting one of the women from the office for the role, and Blake figures it's better than whatever high society candidate his mother would inevitably set him up with. However, he doesn't reveal the real purpose of the trip until after Samantha has been conscripted for the part, but when he does, he makes it clear that they will actually be working between wedding weekend events. Later, when he finds that they're expected to sleep in the same room, he's concerned that doing so could equal a sexual harassment lawsuit, which pretty much shreds his credibility as a successful businessman, given that requiring an employee to even pretend to be a date is grounds for exactly that.Much of the story was completely underdeveloped, and there were several pieces that it seemed should have been important but were little more than side notes. First, Blake apparently had a previous relationship that went horribly wrong, and I'm guessing that should have been part of the reason he wasn't much of a dater. However, after a mention, it wasn't touched on again, nor was anything explained, so I'm not sure why it was even brought up. Samantha had a recent relationship gone wrong as well, having recommended her boyfriend for a job at Putnam only for him to dump her for someone else. But while the synopsis implies that it's something keeping her from easily trusting and dating again, she's more than willing to throw herself into another relationship after a single day. And because apparently every romance must have a jerk for the hero to punch, there's the groom's brother, a flirty mess of a man who makes a scene in front of the whole family. But he's completely unnecessary to the story, and those paragraphs focusing on him would have been better used to add something to the ridiculously fast romance brewing between Blake and Samantha. And that brings me to the real issue I had with the book\u2026The whole relationship is tied up with a big red bow without any real development or depth. One day Sam's being told she's going to be Blake's date. The next they're faking it for the family and sleeping separately. And the next they're sneaking off together and planning out how they can both date and work together. Were this a full-length novel, or perhaps if more time had been spent on character development than wardrobe, I think I could have been convinced. Instead, it seemed like I was reading more of a story outline, with all the intense emotions and dramatic moments not yet written. I've read novellas before that had me fully invested in the characters before I knew what hit me, but Weekend with the Tycoon just wasn't able to pull that off.***FicCentral received this book from Wordsmith Publicity for free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Nancy Stopper", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13748570-nancy-stopper", "userReview": "Weekend With the Tycoon provides an interesting look at a billionaire romance. We meet, but don't really get to know Blake until quite a few chapters in, so the opinion we form of him out of the gate is based on solely on what we learn of him through Samantha's eyes. It's an interesting way to get to know the hero because from her perspective, he's overbearing, dominating, and boorish. He basically calls her into his office, commands her to a weekend meeting, and sends her to a boutique to pick out a bunch of designer outfits. No wonder she perceives him the way she does. But, in true romance fashion, all is not what as it seems. Samantha takes a positive look at the situation - as an opportunity to discuss an exciting idea she has with the boss.When we finally meet Blake, it's as he's dealing with Samantha's paralyzing fear of heights and he reaffirms Samantha's perspective of him. He is overbearing and boorish. We find out she's is posing as his girlfriend for the weekend with his family. So add deceiving to his list of characteristics.But, as Samantha and Blake arrive at the island, we start to see a different side of Blake. I believe he's formed this opinion of his family and spending a lot of time away from them, it has festered into a deep dislike for them. His family is delightful. His mother is very welcoming, if not a bit sly in putting Blake and Samantha together in the same bedroom. His father is welcoming and acknowledging of Blake's difference of opinion in how they run their business. His brothers are fun and his sister is delightful. Just a little bit of time around his family brings out the softer side of Blake. We see him smiling more, acting on his attraction to Samantha and demonstrating a more sensitive, loving side that you wouldn't necessarily have expected based on how we first met Blake. Blake's transition during this book was probably my favorite part of the book.In true romance fashion, the hero and heroine get their happily-ever-after and I love the transition we see in Blake as he falls in love with Samantha."}, {"userName": "Pyper Diangelo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5556707-pyper-diangelo", "userReview": "Way to come out of the gate for a new series, Blake is my Alpha Billionaire book boyfriend for life! A little wedding for his sister & his world is twisted. Business man to the core, simple plan of action. No mess strings & put stars in a girls eyes, bring your employee what could go wrong! HA Everything went right in my eyes. This story is fantastic, a sweet ride from beginning to end. I love how they were both dead set on no attachments and BAM ends with them being very attached. It always happens that way. The harder you fight it the harder you fall and both of them went down hard. Who can resist a little get away with a new wardrobe to boot?The family dynamic is great, I love the little insight but I feel it cost us a little to get to know them that we were missing out on Blake. It might be my book crush talking but I honestly did want a little more get to know with him. If I am being honest in the end my only nitpick would be the ending, I like mine tied up in a bow it leaves it a little open. But I feel like it doesn't take away from the story it'self some might actually enjoy it that way. I just happen to be one of those people who like to come back to a couple and check up on them. I would love to see a book a couple years from now and see how they are fairing.

They will be staying at his parent's home. Sure, he is hot. Sure, she can play the role. But, she wants him to listen to her sales pitch for a new product at Blake Genetics. So, she plays along with him. Life gets a bit confusing for them both as they start to feel their attraction to each other.

I read it in about 2 hours and it left me wanting more. I was a little disappointed that we never got to follow Sam through the presentation and her return back to work on Monday, but I liked it so much that I really can't complain. Also, I want to hear more about Jane and what happened between Blake and Max back in college. Another thing that surprised me was that we never got deeper into Sam's father's suicide. It was briefly mentioned for a paragraph and then nothing. Still I love what the author did in so few pages.I enjoy books where I can identify with the main character and I would love to meet Sam. I generally get disappointed with books where the lead woman is educated, but never gets a chance to show it and despite her education she is terrible at communicating. However that's the norm so I've gotten used to it and I'm glad that wasnt the case here. Before they get to Indigo Island, Sam is a bit irritating, but if I'm being honest I'd be walking on eggshells to if the CEO at my company was being cryptic and I had the opportunity to present in front of a big client.I think the author should dive deeper into this book with a couple novellas that go into the topics I mentioned above and others. quick 20-50 page short stories about Sam dealing with her break up and what Blake was like in college. All I know is that I'm excited for the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Barbara Kav\u010di\u010d", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60750380-barbara-kav-i", "userReview": "Sam is smart... or so we are told over and over again.

What is his deal with James? etc.). Everything is set quite nicely, but it lacks any kind of depth. You could set the same story anywhere, anytime and the genetics is just thrown there for word count and has no connection besides sounding \"oh so important\".My rating is: Oh come on!
