This last offering in the Prescription for Trouble Series and it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The story is set on the familiar Southwestern Medical Center campus in Texas as in prior books.Sara Miles has a young teenage patient who will die if she doesn\u2019t receive a new experimental drug. This drug is the only one that has been effective against a certain strain of bacteria. The only problem is her ex-husband is the doctor in charge of the experimental drug study and she must contact him to get the drug. They didn\u2019t divorce on the friendliest terms after the death of their infant son. But Sara puts the interest of her patient first, as all doctors should, and makes the call. Her patient is admitted to the study, receives the drug and soon afterward is improving and eventually sent home. However, about a month later, the same teenager presents with paralysis. Soon it is discovered some of the other patients who had received the experimental drug also are beginning to present with a variety of serious health problems. Could these various ailments be related to this one experimental drug?Sara and another infectious disease doctor, who works for her ex-husband, begin to try and find out what is going on with their patients. Soon two other doctors and a lawyer who practices medicine also join the search. At every turn, they meet a roadblock and are unable to find out any information. According to Sara\u2019s ex-husband, Dr. Ingersoll, there are no adverse effects and his drug is 100% effective in curing this particular bacteria strain. The company sponsoring the drug also refuses to give out any information as the drug hasn\u2019t met FDA approval and is experimental. Is there more going on at the drug company than they are willing to admit? Sara and her group\u2019s questions arouse someone\u2019s anger and attempts are made on some members of the group\u2019s lives. How far will the group go before their fear causes them to stop searching? Can they find out what causes the drug to react so within certain peoples\u2019 systems? Is Dr. Ingersoll involved in the cover-up?As with all his stories, Richard Mabry draws his readers in from the get-go and never lets them go. The pages will turn quickly as readers speed toward the conclusion. There were some surprises and twists in the plot that kept me on my toes. This is a well-written, interesting and exciting series that I highly recommend. I\u2019m looking forward to Richard\u2019s next book due to be released in the fall of 2013. Don\u2019t miss out on exciting afternoon of reading these intriguing and suspenseful stories!My rating is 4 stars.Note: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book.

The main story idea was good. One doctor who has developed an antiobiotic against a deadly virus and two additional doctors trying to identify what is causing the long term side effects in their patients once they have been given the experimental drug during study trials. That part of the book made for an interesting read and would warrant three out of five stars from me. I liked the suspense of not knowing who was 'behind the scenes' putting everything in motion and also trying to figure out how the doctors were going to connect all the dots.Notice the lack of names there? It's because sadly, there were so many characters that none of them made enough impact for me to remember.All the 'side stories' that were introduced throughout the book were enough to make me want to throw it across the room. There were numerous parts of the story that were disjointed and made no sense with the overall plot. Crying babies, talking dead people. Really? I can honestly say that I never did understand what Dr. Ramsey's role was in the story. His character seemed like an afterthought that Mabry used to try and tie some of the fragmented information together. The overall character development was flat and none of them overly likeable. I never felt a connection with them or between them, though the author tried hard to make it work. The only details that were in abundance were the medical terms used in relation to the patients. Were I someone who knew that medical terminology, I might have enjoyed the story better, but as it were they seemed highly overused. I found myself skimming over those sections when I get tired of looking them up.The middle of the book was slow and at some point, maybe two-thirds of the way in, I lost interest. Needless to say, I forged my way through anyway hoping for some grand finale. Without spoiling it, I will just say that it was a mediocre conclusion at best and ended with little explanation for some of the incidences that happened early in the story. Perhaps it might be a story better understood the second time through, but I did not care enough for it to want to read it again.***As a side note, it ticks me off when authors write scenes in their books that involve what they call 'automatic' guns. Unless a person (or character, for that matter) is of a military background, a spy or an international drug smuggler, to whom access to an automatic weapon is probable; the average person (in this case, Dr. Ingersoll) would not/could not possess the said 'automatic pistol' NOR would he be capable of shooting a single round with it, had it actually been an automatic. Correctly identified, the gun used is semi-automatic.Regardless of their personal beliefs, if authors are going to incoporate the use of handguns into their stories they should at least do their homework."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/575523-kristin", "userReview": "I read one other book by Richard Mabry, the first in the series, though I've not read any of the others. The main character here, Sarah, has a fairly lengthy backstory, and from reading my review from the other book Code Blue, it sounds like Mabry's books in the series are all standalones, but it feels like there could be enough material there to be at least a subplot in an earlier book. Likewise, there is an older doctor, Jack, who plays a minor role here but feels like the kind of character who could have starred in his own book earlier in the series.In 'Lethal Remedy', the medical world is fighting the newest superbug, Staph Luciferus, and Sarah's ex-husband is an infection control doctor who is working closely with Jandra Pharmaceuticals to speed the development of the only antibiotic which is shown to be effective against it. Meanwhile, Sarah is a clinic doctor at the same hospital and sees the devastating effects the infection has on her patients until she enrolls them in the trial for the drug, Jandramycin. The drug has shown to be 100% effective, which holds true for Sarah's patients, as well as those of her colleague, Rip, who holds a fellowship in infection prevention and works closely with her ex, until some of the patients return to the hospital with signs of serious new health crises. Sarah and Rip compare notes and find that the common link among them is treatment with Jandramycin, but when they try to confront her ex with these potential side effects, he shuts them out, knowing that the success of this drug is his key to a life of luxury, even if it mean compromising his standards.While the Jandramycin plot is well-developed, I felt there were others left hanging. For example, the older doctor, Jack, who I mentioned above, pricks himself with a needle that is in a trash can pointy side up, which feels like an intentional act, especially when it turns out to be infected with S. Luciferus, but Mabry never elaborates on how it got there. There is also a scene at the boardroom meeting of a rival pharmaceutical company that wants to acquire Jandra, and a voice comes from somewhere talking about sabotage, but I couldn't figure out where they fit into the picture, as the rival company is hardly mentioned again.This book was an enjoyable quick read, but didn't have the whodunit feel of other medical thrillers I've read, as the good guys stayed good, and the bad guys stayed bad, and it was just a matter of sorting things out to come to the conclusion. I rated the other book of his 'Code Blue' very highly, so I'll probably read the other books in this series because I did enjoy this one even though I found some flaws and rated the first one higher."}, {"userName": "ALEXA", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4988733-alexa", "userReview": "Review posted on Alexa Loves BooksIf I walked into a bookstore, I would never have gravitated towards the section where you'd find this book. And that would have been unfortunate because I really and truly enjoyed reading this novel.Medicine, for the most part, has never been something I've found an interest in (unlike most of my best friends, who are nurses or doctors in the making). It says something about this book that I was interested in the story line, despite the fact it revolved around just that very topic. There are various medical terms and jargon sprinkled throughout the book, but I never for a moment felt lost because they were always defined or explained in layman's terms that I could understand. I believe that this is because the author, Richard Mabry, is actually a medical practitioner himself and thus had a very knowledgeable grasp of the subject matter and how to impart it to people outside of the field of medicine.The suspense of the novel - from figuring out what the \"lethal remedy\" was doing to its test subjects to the succeeding corporate intrigue that followed - definitely had me hooked. There are times when I enjoy a good mystery/suspense story and this one was quite well written. I couldn't figure out for sure who the culprit was or what the solution would end up being, but the author manages to bring us to a tidy conclusion in the end.I feel quite affectionate towards the characters, especially Sara Miles, Rip Pearson and John Ramsey. These three embody the qualities and attitudes that I believe real doctors ought to have - a sincere compassion and concern for their patients, logical and clear thinking and a strong sense of what's right and what's wrong being some of the more stellar examples we see in the story.Despite the fact that there were some outrageously out of the blue occurrences in the book (though I guess they tied in well enough with the whole threat aspect of the novel), I thought that Lethal Remedy was quite enjoyable for my first foray into this particular sort of book. Richard Mabry does a wonderful job bringing to life his characters and a story that will intrigue and command the reader's attention -- and he's convinced me to start trying more novels of this kind, starting with the rest of his Prescription for Trouble series."}, {"userName": "Ibjoy1953 Hannabass", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5101390-ibjoy1953-hannabass", "userReview": "Lethal Remedy by Dr. Richard L. MabryOk, so this new drug can cure a deadly staph infection, one even worse than MRSA, and it is perfectly safe, no side effects, just all good stuff? That should throw a red flag right there! Yet Jandra Pharmaceutical was using Dr. Ingersol to convince Doctors and patients that this experimental drug is the wonder drug of all times. But someone somewhere is not telling all, and Dr. Rip Pearson is determined to find some answers. As I was reading the book I had to wonder if things like this happen today. The way people are always trying to get ahead and make the big money, you have to wonder. Is it all about the patient or all about the money?Being a huge fan of Dr. Mabry\u2019s books, I was anxious to read this forth book in the Prescription for Trouble Series. Though Lethal Remedy was a lighter read than the other three books, I was still glued to the pages until the last word! Again, he created a cast of characters that were unique and played their part so well to make the book a fast-paced, easy read enjoyable thriller. Throughout the book was the big question of whodoneit. And Dr. Ingersol\u2019s character was very well written but he was a jerk! It sure wouldn\u2019t do for him to be my Doctor! And the way it all ended was interesting, and good old doc Ingersol wasn\u2019t as great as he wanted people to believe he was. But you need to read the book to find out all about that! And I can\u2019t leave out the way the author writes the faith of his characters into the story, not so it jumps out of the book at you, but so we can see Christ in the lives of the characters. I appreciate the way God is using Dr Mabry to spread the gospel to a group of people that may not hear it otherwise.I\u2019m glad Abingdon Press and Dr Mabry decided to add a fourth book to this series. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Lethal Remedy and highly recommend it to anyone who likes medical fiction, thrillers, mystery and just a good book to read!I rec\u2019d this book from the publisher Harvest House through F.I.R.S.T.

This is a medical murder mystery (M3) thriller. Just about the time you *think* you know who the murderer is -- another person looks like he might be the bad guy. BTW -- I'm giving nothing away by saying \"bad guy\". You'll know that fact within a few pages of the beginning of the book. And frankly -- it won't help you solve who did it.I did something different while I read this book. Since it was in the Kindle edition (downloaded free from Amazon), every time I had a thought about *who* did it -- I'd make a note. BOY! Did I end up with a bunch of notes. Not every one of them had to do with the murderer. I also highlight good phrases or sentences. For example, this one after the lead female character Sara has a run-in with a \"self-important, self-centered, pompous\" character (who, I'm sure you will grow to dislike along with Sara. She mentally quips, \"Who says Lamaze training can't be useful except in labor?\"The writer tells us in the \"Acknowledgments\" that he hopes to witness for God through his writing. He does that but not with a weighty hand but by just doing the typical things that a Christian does. For example: offering a silent prayer. I really liked how Dr. Mabry shows that a Christian prays easily. That prayer isn't always audible not is it forced but, in fact, is an automatic situation. I really can't write any more names in this review for fear of giving the conclusion away. This is TOO good of book to have that happen. This series consists of standalone books. This is the second in this series I have read. And I'm actually reading another one at this moment. If I'm wrong about that, please add a comment to this review correcting my perception.I gave this book 5 stars even though some typos were found in the book. Within the last few days, I've read several books on publishing in Kindle. There are MULTIPLE, very easy ways to generate an error in the Kindle edition that did not exist in the one uploaded to Amazon.

Told in an almost scene-by-scene cut and action method, the reader is compelled by ramping tension to follow Drs. Sara Stiles, Rip Pearson, Mark Wilcox, John Ramsey, and Lillian Goodman as they unravel the devastating treatment of a deadly fictional staph infection with an experimental drug that leaves patients with damaging side effects, or death. This was my first Dr. Mabry book, and I suspect that Dr. John Ramsey was the main thread in the earlier books, although he wasn\u2019t introduced until well into the story, and then felt like an accompanying character. Mabry also set up a love triangle between Drs. Stiles, Rip and Wilcox that was rife with red herrings, doubts, and heroics that did leave me guessing on occasion, even as I wondered if there was going to be any culmination to the drama. A loose end left me hanging and made me despise the main bad guy worse than Mabry wanted me to, and some too tidy tie-ups in Europe and at home wasn\u2019t what I expected. As an ensemble who-dun-it, I found Lethal Remedy to be a fast-paced thriller. Those who love all the medical tech jargon and the excitement of the rich and famous lifestyle will be satisfied by Mabry\u2019s natural and common use of scientific terminology."}, {"userName": "Tamara Tilley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383724-tamara-tilley", "userReview": "LETHAL REMEDY was a bit of a disappointment. I say \u201ca bit\u201d because there were still parts that I enjoyed, but unfortunately it still left me wanting. While I really enjoyed books one and two in the Prescription for Trouble series, the last two were not as well rounded. Now\u2013 I am reviewing this book from a female perspective, and the parts of the book I felt were lacking were the relational influence between characters, but I also am a suspense reader and I felt the tie-up in this novel was rushed and lackluster.Dr. Sarah Miles is struggling on many fronts. The collapse of her marriage, the loss of a child, and now, one of her patients is under attack by a deadly disease that only her ex-husband\u2019s research can help her with. But the more Sarah researches this new wonder drug, the more she realizes it\u2019s a potential killer and someone is willing to silence her before she can make her findings known. As she teams up with fellow physicians, personal attractions arise, but that is where they are left. The first third of this book was difficult to get into. In fact, when I read the forward and realized book four was an add-on, I felt that answered a lot of questions. It just didn\u2019t have the impact as books one and two. Multiple characters were introduced, but none of them, other than Sarah were really fleshed out. Mabry tugged on heartstrings here and there, but that only left me wanting more. But, that is something I\u2019ve come to realize with male authors. Sometimes they lack on the emotional front. The conclusion was a bit anticlimactic and rushed. In fact, I read the wrap-up without even realizing it. All that to say, I haven\u2019t given up on Richard Mabry, I would still probably buy his future books, hoping they have the intensity of his first two installments."}, {"userName": "Julie Witt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5261523-julie-witt", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book free of charge from NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion.I love medical mysteries, so when I saw this book listed on NetGalley I knew I had to read it. I wasn't aware at that time that this was the fourth book in a series (Prescription for Trouble) but luckily it can be read as a stand alone as well. From Goodreads: \"What happens when the race to stop a lethal bacteria becomes a race to stop a killer?\"That sentence alone was enough to interest me in this book! Intriguing, no? I am very happy to say that Dr. Richard Mabry did not disappoint! This is a very fast paced medical mystery, with characters who you can relate to and care about. The author keeps you guessing until the end, trying to figure out who is involved and who isn't in this globe spanning conspiracy. The subject matter was very interesting as you hear all the time about drug companies putting so much money into developing new drugs in the cut throat industry of pharmaceutical research. One of the reasons I really enjoyed reading this thriller is because you can actually imagine this scenario occurring in real life, and that is definitely scary!! The book moved along at a quick pace and there was good character growth, especially in the female MC, Dr. Sara Miles, who learns to trust again after a bitter divorce and the loss of a child, and Dr. John Ramsey, who finally starts to move on after the death of his wife. There were a few side plots that I think the book could have done without as they didn't really add anything to the story, but nothing that detracted from my ability to enjoy the book.

While I have only read one other in the series (book 3, Diagnosis Death), I was looking forward to more by this author who is, obviously, very knowledgeable in this area.There were a lot of characters in this book. Moreso then in his previous book. The first few chapters I was a bit confused as I tried to remember all the different characters and, as the story progressed, what their motives were. Sarah Miles and Rip Pearson were two characters I really got to like but, as a result of all the added characters, I didn\u2019t get to know them as well as I had liked. The whole suspenseful plot surrounding the wonder-drug, Jandramycin, was really good and kept me reading. I think the \u2018mysterious person\u2019 behind the plot to take down Jandra was almost kept too mysterious. At the end, when all was revealed, I was surprised\u2014but not in the way I usually am surprised when the bad guy is discovered.

I actually really love Sara and Rip, I found them to be a fantastic team, and their characters were written very well. I also enjoyed reading the relationship that was just starting to bloom between John and Lillian. It seemed very sweet and innocent, and yet coming forth in just the nick of time to save John from the brink of massive depression. I knew right away that I didn't like Jack Ingersoll, and ofcourse I didn't like his associates. They were all sharks out for themselves only and not worried about what happens to the people they chose as victims.I had no idea that this was book #4 in the Prescription for Trouble series until I was reviewing other reviews of this book, AFTER I had finished it. So now that I know this is book #4, and it was so well written that I assumed it was a standalone novel, I am definitely going to be reading books 1-3 in the series, because Mabry has me hooked! Thanks to Abingdon Press & netGalley for allowing me the opportunity to read and review this book for free!"}, {"userName": "Audrey Grant", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026798-audrey-grant", "userReview": "I fell in love with Dr. Mabry's books with the very first one I read! It had all the things I love in a good mystery book! With the added bonus of of the medical and science twists and turns. I was thrilled to find out there were more than the first one and began watching for them and reading them as soon as I could find them. I read the first three on e-book, Kindle and loved them.I have been waiting and watching for #4 to come out and was THRILLED to receive it from Abingdon Press to read and post my review! Book #4 Lethal Remedy, is my favorite in the series so far. That is hard to do. Often the story starts repeating it's self when you have a basic \"theme\". But Dr. Mabry has managed to continue to come up with new and interesting characters, backgrounds, medical information, thought processes...I keep wanting more!I love how even the Dr's. are such normal people. Often people in the medical profession are not portrayed that way in books. But with my far too frequent contact with the medical community in the last 17 yrs. of health issues. I have come to realize that they are just as human and emotional as we are they just try to poker face it for their patients.I am giving this book 5 stars! It is a great story line. Kept me guessing until almost the end on the who. And did a great job of keeping me captivated!http://cabinfeverreading.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Rubysbooks", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285680-rubysbooks", "userReview": "Originally published on my  blog.I was very excited when I heard there was another book in the Prescription for Trouble series coming out. Granted, I didn't manage to read the first two books yet, but I was still excited.I have to say I liked this book better than the third book, Diagnosis Death. I think it was probably because it was a bit different than what I read before. The idea that there's a magic drug that can cure a lethal virus was brilliant. I was expecting the secondary effects, what I didn't expect was the way the characters out what the drug did and how it did that. I liked that. I also liked how Mr. Mabry explained certain medical terms and made them understandable for someone with little or no medical training.I also liked the characters. Sara was a very strong woman, one who has been through a lot of pain, but managed to live through it. She's also dedicated to her work and trying all she can to save her patients. Rip was an interesting character. He's a very good friend and a good doctor. He's the kind of guy you can depend on.There are other characters in this book that I loved, but I'll let you judge them as you see fit.I can't wait for other books from this author. I'm going to read the other books in the series very soon."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "Great fast read! Keeps your attention right to the end...including the epilogue!There is a new staph, deadlier than MRSA attacking the world, and Dr Sara Miles has a young teenage girl who has it. She knows the only way to get the drug that will give the girl her life back, is to go to her former husband Dr Jack Ingersol. Dr Ingersol appears to be selling his soul to the devil in the name of the drug company Jandra Pharmaceutical. What a tangled web comes to light thoughout this book. You won't be able to put this book down, there are shootings, car crashes, explosions, and more. The company will stop at nothing to get the FDA approval.When Dr John Ramsey decides to return to work after the death of his beloved wife, he gets stuck by a needle, and he gets the horrible deadly staph infection. His friends rally around him and the great minds and the power of prayer, set about to find a alternate drug to counter act the side effects of the wonder drug.I highly recommend this Christian mystery, you won't regret it!I received this book from the Publisher Abingdon Press, and was not required to give a positive review."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252799-anne", "userReview": "Dr. Mabry did not disappoint this fan of medical intrigue!A new drug that can cure a killer virus? With NO side effects? At least that's what the drug company wants us to believe. But, then folks get sick. There's a part of me that thinks this stuff might actually happen, it seems so real. Does Dr. Mabry know something we don't? :)We get a good look at drug companies and the pressure that comes along with creating the drugs and getting them on the market. Kind of scary! Makes all sorts of questions come to mind but the most obvious is - Who can we trust? Ultimately...there's only One!This is the 4th book in his Prescription for Trouble series. You can read this one without having read the others but I highly recommend reading all of them, especially if you enjoy a good medical mystery along with intriguing characters and a little romance to sweeten the deal.Special thanks to Julie Dowd (Abingdon Press) for sending me a review copy.

Jack is in charge of a major study of an antibiotic that seems 100% effective against the super-infection, Staph luciferus. A teenager, who becomes a part of the study, develop an autoimmune disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome. After study and thought, Sara, Jon, and others realize that many taking Jandramycin develop autoimmune disorders. Further study reveals that those with allergies seem to be the ones who develop the disorders. Jandra Pharms and Jack refuse to acknowledge the possibility. Not bad. Some odd developments \ufffd the digital recorder of the baby crying left in Sara's attic perhaps is there to show Jack's evil bent but it's never resolved. Jack's sudden disappearance at the end is abrupt. Rip Pearson's involvement in the dash to find the truth seems out of place with his fellowship with Jack. Carter Resnick seems to be the one snitching to another pharm company about Jandramycin but Jack ends up with the $4 million. Suspend judgement and enjoy the story.

It is set in a major medical center in Texas and pits the good general practice doctors against the evil pharmaceutical industry. It also pits a sympathetic heroine against her ex-husband. As with the other books, I am not qualified to judge the correctness of the medical/scientific information, but am able to say that with respect to the legal elements, things move more quickly that would be expected. It is Christian fiction, and in this case it means a couple of the characters reading scripture or discussing that God is in control. Unless random comments about God or scripture quotes bother you, the religious content of the book shouldn't be the reason you don't like it.Grade: B+I'd like to thank the publishers for making a review copy available via NetGalley.
