It was always there hanging about, an ache that made life hard to live, a longing for something that I couldn't being to identify . . . At eight years of age I was already world-weary . . . \" Divided into two wartime eras - World War II and Vietnam - and further distinguishable by tone, narrative, and thematic nuances - Tatlock explores the many faces of prejudice, friendship, family, and agape love; with a touch of romance thrown in for good measure. The first half of the book was absolutely wonderful. Strong, captivating storytelling. Augusta \"Augie\" Schuler (as an adolescent) reeled me in hook, line, and sinker. Her dysfunctional family situation was sometimes comical, and other times heartbreaking. The way she longed for (but didn't get) her mother's attention and affection - a touch, a hug, some little scrap of praise or a 'how was your day?' - tugged on my heartstrings something fierce. I've been there, and there's nothing more dejecting. Then too, there's Uncle Finn, whose house Augie's family resides in. And let me just say, he's a real piece of work; a regular Archie Bunker - on steroids!  \"Funny what a child dreams of in the secret corners of her heart. Or maybe its not so much a matter of dreaming as it is of listening to the preternatural longing for what we were created to have. I was listening to that faint but very real longing to be loved by my own flesh and blood.\" One day in the park while a Salvation Army band is playing, Augie comes upon little Sunny Yamagata. In no short order a remarkable friendship blossoms. Though they are different physically and culturally, and their family circumstances are polar opposites, they are perfectly suited to each other, kindred spirits in the things that matter most.  \"A person's race and life experiences contribute to what a person is, but I think there's something beyond what we are, and that is who we are. I've come to believe that the essence of a person, who that person is would be the same no matter what kind of body that person happened to be born into. Because we're more than the physical, you know. We're spiritual too. We have a spirit or a soul, or whatever you want to call it . . . It's beyond looks . . . Like air, I guess. You can't see it, but it's where the life is.\" Oh, if only Tatlock had stayed the course in tone, voice, characters, and nuances this would have been a most treasured story for me. Instead she jumped ship mid-book and dog-paddled off in an entirely different direction. The bare bones of the first story were present and acted as a thread (albeit a thin one) that held both halves together. However, the previous intensity and pulsating magnetism of the story sort of fell apart and lost momentum. Somewhat like a hurricane when it passes from the warm tropics to the cold Atlantic. The story did pick back up with a late burst of energy in the final chapters.  \"What I'm trying to say is, civil rights isn't about Negroes, it's about everyone. See, injustice is a funny thing. It doesn't limit itself to the Negro or the Oriental or the Jew . . . It likes to spread itself around, you know? [I]f you're the one throwing it out, it's going to find a way to come back on you. Even if you don't throw it out, it's going to come back on you. Live long enough, you're going to get rained on. It's as simple as that.\" Still though, the latter half just didn't do it for me. Too insouciant and out of sorts with the first half. The problem, at least to my estimation, is that civil rights injustices and voter registration violations in Mississippi during the mid-sixties is too big and important of a topic to be merely a side story; a backdrop to a serendipitous romance. So fairy-tale-ish and predictably fabricated, it deflated my overall enjoyment and appraisal of the novel. Immensely! Frankly - now this is just my perception, worth a plug nickle at best so take it with a grain of salt - this novel reads like two incomplete stories, or rather two story ideas that should have been written as two novels. Had they been presented as separate works, both might have been great. The first certainly was headed toward a four or five star rating. As it is though, I must rate accordingly....

It felt like two books, almost like it could have been a series, but it was a two part book. The first half of the book took place with the two main characters as children living in southern California leading up to and during WWII. Sunny is a second generation Japanese American who has an incredibly loving and supportive family who feel they are as American as anyone else. Augie comes from a broken family and quickly comes to love Sunny's family when they quickly become best friends. World War II erupts and Sunny's family is forced to leave their lives behind to live in Japanese internment camps. Augie is devastated as she had become so much a part of Sunny's family, she even thinks of herself as Japanese at heart.Augie and Sunny's family lose contact and Auguie thinks they have abandoned her and is devastated by what she sees as betrayal.Fast forward twenty something years and Sunny, now Helen, finds Augie and invites her to her home to write a magazine article about anti-civil rights Mississippi. Augie is shocked to learn that the invitation to Mississippi is from her childhood best friend; there is a weird twist there I won't spoil.Augie is there to write a story about a school that prepares African Americans to register to vote. She meets a really great guy...blah blah blah, he turns out to be something completely different than she thought...blah, blah, blah...the KKK are everywhere, they are bad, horrible people. I do not mean to demean what happened there, it's disgusting, but the story dragged on too much for me to read every fine detail.The second part started out good, but then I just lost interest. It could have been shortened substantially. I skimmed over many pages just trying to get to the end quickly.Great basis for a story, just not as interesting as I think it could have been. And have I mentioned how much I HATE reading accents?

In fact, Sunny's family become Augie's surrogate family and before too long she is essentially living there and becoming more and more enamored of the Japanese culture.But remember, this is just prior to World War 2 and Pearl Harbor.Sunny's family and everyone other citizen of Japanese descent, no matter how long it's been, is rounded up and shipped off to interment camps in the desert. Augie is left with only the option to go back to live full time with her drunken mother and her hateful uncle. Not only has the Yamagata family lost everything but so has Augie, everything that was in any way important to her.Fast forward 20 years and Augie is now a writer going down to Mississippi to do a story on civil rights, voter registration and discrimination.These causes and issues wind their way through this book without let up. It's a sobering reminder that we are not that much advanced then we were in the 40's or the 50's or the 60's. Augie's experiences in the South bring her full circle...back to her family, back to her roots.All The Way Home made me think, made me angry, made me sad and made me wish that humans were much smarter and tolerant than they really are."}, {"userName": "Cassandra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2611188-cassandra", "userReview": "What a great book. I found this one browsing through the historical fiction section at my library. I'd never heard of the book nor the author, but I'm glad I picked this one up.I was intrigued by the idea of a white American girl being adopted into the home of Japanese Americans right before WWII. The little girl fell in love with the family and with the Japanese culture. I'm studying the Japanese language and a bit of the culture and I can understand the fascination. The novel tugged at my heartstrings all the way through, dealing with issues of prejudice and racism. It was timely reading this book only days after watching the movie \"My Name is Khan.\" In the past week, I've seen or read stories about Muslims, Hindus, Japanese, and African Americans all being treated unfairly because of the color of their skin or facial features. As a white woman, I've never had to deal with those types of issues and my heart hurt seeing the undeserved hate people have to deal with on a daily basis, even now.I was a bit worried about the second half of this novel, wondering if the author could pull off a seamless transition from WWII to the civil rights movement. The plot was well done and believable. Also, though this book is Christian fiction, I didn't feel preached at. The \"conversion scene\" didn't really exist but the issues of faith were delicately weaved through the story. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Ellis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21616928-cheryl-ellis", "userReview": "Love MattersThis story begins with Augie, a young girl who lives in a very dysfunctional home in the 1930\u2019s.

It pulled me in slowly, and didn't let me go.Ever read a book that does something so well that it makes other books seem to fall short in comparison? That what this book did for me with character and history. I love historical fiction, but I realized after reading this that so many of the books of that genre I've read just seem to grab characters with modern viewpoints and thrust them back in history...or, on the opposite extreme, take historical stereotypes and build a character around that. This book did neither. The characters in her book were fleshed out and real...so real that I felt like they could be someone I knew. And yet they inhabited their time period so naturally and believably. One thing you should know about this book: the first half and second half, though both well written, are nothing alike. The first half, seen through a child's eyes, draws you in slowly to the character's world. It's a gentle climb that grows in emotion. It has a \"to kill a mockingbird\" feel in some way, only with California as a backdrop (having grown up there this brought up vivid memories for me, even though this was a generation before my time). The drama slowly becomes intense--but the intensity is mostly internal: there's not a lot of cliffhangers.The second half of the book, on the other hand, is full of them. It reads like a mystery suspense adventure. Same characters, and excellent writting, but a different mood. I loved both sides of this book...but just be prepared for two totally different reads in one volume."}, {"userName": "Jeni Enjaian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4680796-jeni-enjaian", "userReview": "Tatlock's wordsmith ability increases tremendously with each book she writes.I really enjoyed this story though I would have enjoyed it more had she spent more time developing the first half of the story, the part describing Augie and Sunny's childhood friendship. That likely would have required a second book since this book is already quite long. I wouldn't have been adverse to that though I understand why Tatlock chose to structure the book as she did.Once again I am amazed at how capably Tatlock makes her narrator's voice appropriate to the age of the character. Young Augie and Sunny behave as nine-thirteen year old girls would and should have acted in that time period.I also appreciated how Tatlock chose to end the story. (Mild spoiler alert) More specifically, I love that she had Augie return to see her Uncle Finn.While this book is not quite good enough for five stars, I did thoroughly enjoy it and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.*Update*While others did not like the \"split narrative\" aspect of the book, I appreciated it. Unlike other of Tatlock's books, the narrative didn't suffer any confusion in narration. She also limited the number of characters in comparison to other works.I absolutely loved the implicit comparison between the bigotry Sunny and the Yamagata's experienced to the racism of the Civil Rights Era south. That comparison draws unmistakable parallels and highlights the ugliness of bigotry in any form.This book survived round two of the \"purge.\""}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884392-amanda", "userReview": "An incredibly powerful story!

She is a master at portraying the heart of her characters and they all feel familiar even though it may be uncomfortable to acknowledge the ugly underbelly of humanity. All the Way Home begins with two lonely eight year old girls meeting in the park. They appear as a study of contrasts. Augie is Irish American with fair skin that freckled and curly red hair. Sunny is Japanese American with clear skin and straight black hair. Their lives were changed forever that day in 1938 when Sunny invited Augie to go home with her to play. Augie was enchanted by Sunny's life. Her parents were polite and welcoming and she thought Sunny was the luckiest girl in the world. Sunny had her own room and it was filled with books. Augie lived in an overcrowded house with too many loud people and her mother who escaped into alcohol when her father's car was hit by a train.Augie loved being at the Yamagatas and they loved Augie like she was their own daughter. They were the first people to tell Augie she was special. Augie spent all the time she could at their house. Augie felt like she was finally home with the right family who loved her unconditionally. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, the scene was set for the Civilian Exclusion Order in 1942. All the Japanese were rounded up and sent to internment camps. They lost their homes and businesses. They could take only what they could carry. Augie begged them to take her with them. They tried to explain it was not possible. The Yamagatas promised to write but Augie never received a letter. Sunny's heart was broken and eventually hardened. She kept herself safe from that type of closeness. She couldn't risk that kind of hurt again. She was lonely but she was safe.This is a sweeping saga that takes us into the civil rights movement in Mississippi. Each section of this book takes the reader deeper into the story of Sunny and Augie. The characters are richly portrayed and the plot flows easily from the beginning to the conclusion. I loved every part of this book and highly recommend the author and this book."}, {"userName": "Karen Wingate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51582064-karen-wingate", "userReview": "Ann Tatlock is one of my favorite authors. This book came across my path at just the right time too. I had just finished reading \"The Secret Life of Bees\" and was so disappointed in the 1960's Civil Rights Era book. I may have even said in my review that I wished for a similar book that had more hope hope and less vulgarity. All The Way Home is that book. Set in 1965, it tells the story of a white woman who befriends a Japanese family before the attack on Pearl Harbor and loses contact with the family she calls her own. Later, Augie becomes swept up in the Civil Rights movement of 1965 and struggles with the questions of prejudice and hate. I only give it a 4 star rating because while the first third of the book - the part about Augie as a child was riveting and interesting, the section immediately following bogged down a bit as the author set the stage for the next plot point and some of the ways plot points are resolved were a little too easy.
