Things I learnt from this book:- Queen Victoria was THIRSTY. Like...T.H.I.R.S.T.Y. Homegirl reeeeeeeeally wanted the D. Her main concern when told that she should stop having children was basically \"But I can still get laid, right??\"- When Albert died, Queen Victoria had marble replicas of his hands made and kept them by her bed. Read into that what you will. - Queen Victoria was totally in favour of progression in society, unless it involved women. And yet she was the most powerful woman in the world. - Some academics think that Prince Albert was gay because he was nervous around women and had lots of close male friends. Excuse me, y'all? HE HAD NINE CHILDREN WITH HIS SUPER THIRSTY WIFE. THE WORD \"BISEXUAL\" EXISTS, PLEASE AND THANK YOU. - Queen Victoria's kids went through her diaries and photos after she died and got rid of all the good stuff (including photos of her smiling????) because they thought it wasn't sufficiently regal. Rude. - Albert was...kind of a power-hungry asshat at times. - You will probably learn far more than you wanted to about the impact that having nine children had on Queen Victoria in later life. Although to be honest, learning ANYTHING about Queen Victoria's lady parts probably would have been more than I want to know... So yeah. On the whole, this was FASCINATING and incredibly readable. Just don't try and read it in bed because it's heavy and you'll probably drop it on your face like I did and it hurts."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "As Canada prepares to celebrate its 150th birthday, I felt it high time to look back and explore the life and times of our first monarch, Queen Victoria. Much of the country was either shaped or influenced by this British monarch, whose reign was only recently surpassed by Queen Elizabeth II. Julia Baird offers a thorough and thought-provoking biography of Victoria, exploring and dispelling many of the key events and stories that history have attributed to this 19th century wonder. Baird's presentation sheds Victoria in three distinct lights that the reader will notice throughout the narrative: Victoria the woman, the politician, and the monarch. Striving to provide a clear understanding of Victoria and the influence she had over much of the world, Baird provides the reader with a stellar piece that opens the door to further exploration.While her enduring reign over Britain and the British Empire may have made Victoria seem super-human, she proved to have common concerns, like many of her subjects. Born in 1819, Victoria arrived amidst an ascendency crisis in Britain. Fifth in the line of succession after the recent death of her grandfather, George III, Victoria was vilified by some of her uncles, all aged and without legitimate heirs to the Throne. Baird attributes this to George III's Royal Marriages Act, which required the monarch to approve of all unions before they could be officially accepted by Parliament. A few deaths and no heirs to take their place left Victoria in a position to rule at a young age. Victoria ascended to the Throne at nineteen, without a husband or significant love interest. Enter Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who boldly presented himself to his cousin and determined to convince her that they should wed. Hesitant at first, Victoria soon acquiesced and they married, beginning what some have called the strongest romantic relationship of any English monarch. Victoria soon began a period of almost constant pregnancy, giving birth to nine children in total while still running the country (and Empire). Interestingly enough, while she held much power Victoria willingly handed the reins of power to Albert, as women of the time might have done, without a second thought. Baird amply illustrates the long and devoted marriage that Victoria and Albert shared, growing stronger with each passing year, during which time Albert was able to make many of the household (and monarchical) decisions without Victoria's protest. Equally shocking, as Baird presents it, Victoria remained a devoted mother as well, tending to the nine children and her subjects as effectively as possible. To bestow so much onto the shoulders of one woman is, in my opinion, more than can be expected, but Victoria did it all masterfully. When Albert fell ill and eventually died in 1861, Victoria was beside herself with grief. Baird supports what many have said that Victoria continued to reign, but never passed out of her period of mourning. Much speculation arose as John Brown soon appeared on the scene, Victoria's manservant, which Baird addresses as being rumoured to be her lover for the years before his death. (The reader can make their own decision after reading Baird's curious discovery surrounding Victoria's requirements during her preparation for burial.) Surely the friend and support that Victoria needed in her time of despair, Brown, too, succumbed earlier than one might have expected, dealing Victoria another blow. As a mother with grown children, Victoria sought to ensure her daughters married well and history proves that this was surely the case. With her son 'Bertie' (the future Edward VII) in the wings, Victoria offered as much affection to her family as possible, while remaining in a state of grief for the loss of Albert all those years before. Even when the Crown bore heavily upon her, Victoria emerged as a woman of power and significance throughout her life. At her death in 1901, Victoria had lived a life full of remarkable joy and dreadful sorrows, the weight of the latter at times self-imposed. Interestingly enough, while Victoria did little at the time to bolster the role of female emancipation or women in a position of authority, the world looked to her after her death and lauded much praise and ceremonial titles that had otherworldly connotations. While a remarkable queen, Victoria's qualities as as a woman cannot be forgotten. While surely not a member of either of Britain's Houses of Parliament, Queen Victoria played a significant role in the political machinations throughout her reign. Soon after she ascended to the Throne, Victoria forged a strong friendship with her first prime minister, Lord Melbourne. Baird presents him as a father figure that Victoria lacked in her formative years, though some may also speculate a strong affinity or 'crush' on Victoria's part.Needless to say, Victoria did not hide her sentiments and tried all she could to keep him and the Whigs in power. From this point forward, Baird presents Victoria as having a strong and lasting influence over her prime ministers and their cabinet choices, as well as messages she presented in the numerous Openings of Parliament. Victoria's strong-headedness becomes apparent as she clashed greatly with William Gladstone, Prime Minister on four occasions. Baird illustrates the dynamic between these two and how they could not find common ground on much. These were formative years for England and the British Empire, a time in which Victoria sought to have her voice heard. Issues of Irish famine, steep grain tariffs, Irish Home Rule, and imperial expansions into Africa fill the narrative, areas in which Victoria offered her own opinions, though she was happy to help shape solutions through her actions as a part of the political machine throughout the time all ten of her British prime ministers led governments. In exploring Victoria's hands-on approach, Baird discusses something that is taken for granted in Canada, the role of a constitutional monarch in the larger process. Baird refers to writings by Walter Bagehot, who sought to explain the loose English Constitution and the place in which the monarch rests. Advice differs from influence and acceptance from determination, though much of the process was steeped in precedent and not firm law. Victoria played a much more active and quasi-partisan role than might have been expected (or allowed?) today, on either side of the Atlantic, though it was surely interesting to see her interpret and play such a transparent role in her choice of engagement at the top of the parliamentary process. Victoria may never have faced the ever-growing electorate at the ballot box, but her political influence could surely be felt throughout her time on the Throne.Until recently, Victoria held the record for the longest-serving monarch in English history, surpassed by the current Elizabeth II. During that long period on the Throne, Victoria saw not only the Empire transform, but also her own family, as well as herself. From the early years as a young queen, Victoria was more apt to get in the middle of things, playing the role of innocent monarch, ignorant of her larger ceremonial role. However, as mentioned above, Victoria soon became a monarch that sought to steer England in a specific direction, at least to the best of her ability without facing a parliamentary election. The Empire grew significantly during her time, turning her from English monarch to that of numerous countries all over the world. For as regal as she was, Baird presents Victoria as a monarch who took her own family life to heart and did not espouse the stoic nature to which many are accustomed with today's queen. Victoria's decades-long mourning for Albert and reclusiveness for a significant period may, for some, lessen the impact of her reign. However, using her Jubilee celebrations as any measurement for her support, Victoria was loved by many and adored by her subjects. Longevity cannot be the sole factor in the praise she received for her Golden Jubilee, nor the deference paid to her around the world and especially throughout Europe. Truth be told, she had her bloodline running through many of the significant monarchies of Europe, but even still, she was not one to hold back her opinions when it suited her. The British Empire expanded and many could feel the Victorian impact, a legacy that has long outlived her reign. Victoria kept the Empire together, which was surely no small feat, and left England ready to face the 20th century by the time she died. Influential without being dictatorial, Victoria's influence as a monarch lasted throughout her long life.Baird has taught us much in this biography, though many questions remain. Through her powerful narrative abilities, Baird takes the reader on a winding journey through the life of Victoria and the creation of a firm Empire, which continues in the form of the British Commonwealth. Born at a time when the English Throne was still seen as as despotic seat, Victoria sought to soften the blow in her own way. Baird effectively argues numerous points of contention in the book, which may leave some readers somewhat distraught, though the supporting arguments are strong and prove convincing. While I might show some bias, I would have liked to have seen a little more on some of the monumental aspects of the Empire's growth, particularly the formal addition of Canada as a country in 1867 or Australia's lobby and eventual inclusion in 1901. True, Victoria remained in mourning during the Canadian build-up, which might limits Baird's ability to track down sentiments and strengthen the narrative, but as the largest Dominion in the Empire, one might have expected it receive some place in this biography. On the flip side, Victoria's waning years occurred as Australia set to formally distinguish itself as an independent country, leaving little Victorian influence. Tackling such a large project may have been daunting, though Bard synthesises Victoria powerfully, getting detailed when needed but not drowning in the minutiae that was surely tempting over such a long reign. The reader can sail through the biography with ease, seeing Victoria as an influential (and influenced) woman whose love for family trumped all else. Any who are curious about this wonderful woman ought to give Baird a chance to offer formal introductions in this stellar piece of writing.Kudos, Madam Baird for such a powerful biography. I did learn a great deal about Canada's first queen. I can only hope to find more of your work and marvel at the detail you add to the narrative.Like/hate the review?

Victoria Regina Imperatrix was the petite queen whose feet did not reach the bottom of the throne on the day of her coronation. Her daughters saw her beautiful smile, her husband enjoyed her strong libido and to her dismay she found herself in a cumbersome pregnant body for eight out of nine years running. Prince Albert was the man of the relationship and Victoria deferred in the marriage, but she was always the Queen. In a time when revolution threatened monarchies in Europe, to her country she was both the symbol of the British aristocracy and an English mother, entrusted with her nation's safety and wellbeing. Victoria's history is fairly well-known, especially that of her courtship and marriage to Albert. Julia Baird had access to previously inaccessible documents which further enriched the biography, adding insight and balance to former accounts. Their youngest daughter Beatrice between 1933-1943 had taken upon herself to whitewash her mother Queen Victoria's diaries, rewriting them, and burning the originals \"in one of the greatest acts of historical censorship of the century\". As a result, we know about \"The Queen\" but her interior self has been poorly represented. Baird has filled in that picture, giving context and softening the more familiar grim biographical portrait which has represented Victoria. I appreciated her life, it's hardships, her joys and felt great compassion for the working mother, wife and widow that the author has brought to life. The global style of this biography is very satisfying. Baird's writing brings us closest to Victoria and then as her timeline is followed, so too is that of Britain, the Commonwealth and the fully expanded Empire. She was actively knowledgeable about Parliament, hard-working and opinionated and at times meddlesome when politicians would have preferred to ignore her mature good advice. Though she insisted that everyone who met with her must always walk away backwards and never show their backside to her, she was surprisingly free of racial prejudice. Interestingly, the prim attitudes toward sex which characterized the Victorian Age were Prince Albert's, not Victoria's! There is such a broad range of information in this biography: history, anecdotes, interesting trivia, fashion, a theory of the psychology about extended bereavement and killer diseases prevalent in the previous century, now almost unheard of today. Family grudges had a part in starting World War I; British empire building can be linked to the beginning of crises in the Middle East. Considering the years and years of intermarriage between royalty from different countries, Julia Baird's retelling of the facts sometimes seemed like the zany family history of misbehaving European monarchs, with actions that resonated eerily today. Prince Albert's mother met a fate so much like Princess Diana's, it gave me shivers. ***I admit that I skimmed through the most detailed passages set in government; the political infighting between Gladstone and Victoria became tiresome. I felt that the nitty gritty of his life and other politicians, in finite detail, bogged the book down in the middle. A large general audience might enjoy this biography if this section was pared down to a more basic focus, keeping its good anecdotes (eg., the ones about Disraeli). I could then confidently recommend Victoria: The Queen to fans of Downton Abbey because the majority of the biography otherwise is as fluid as good historical fiction.Victoria: The Queen is a bibliophile's pleasure. Part history, part personal story, the book transports the reader into Victoria's life to imagine the scenes, the trials and tribulations and splendour of her great life.

Victoria: The Queen was definitely the opposite. Baird wrote an engaging, well researched and well rounded account of the woman who shaped an era. It's a shame that Victoria's journals and letters were censored so heavily, but I think Baird did an excellent job of uncovering the truth where she could, and making (clearly noted) educated speculation based on the information she had. I highly recommend this and will be keeping an eye out for Baird's writing in the future!"}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "This book covers Victoria's entire life from childhood to death, revealing both personal details about her personality, her life and her family as well as her influence on British and international politics and history. There is a large amount of British history detailed. One might not guess this from the book's title.I particularly appreciate the simplicity and clarity by which, with just a minimum of detail, international and national controversies are summarized. Then, knowing the background situation, interesting details relate Victoria\u2019s, her husband\u2019s or perhaps a dignitary\u2019s response to the situation. Secondly, the book brings to vivid life the deep bond that grew between Victoria and Albert. Together, historical events as well as personal family events unfold chronologically. The book concludes with a sweeping summary of the changes which took place during the Victorian era \u2013 industrialization, unionization, new technologies, rapid increase in the size of the British Empire, feminism and better social rights. After the death of her father, when Victoria was less than a year old, Victoria\u2019s mother, the Duchess of Kent, aligned herself with Sir John Conroy, an ambitious comptroller and most probably her lover. Their domineering control led to Victoria\u2019s isolation and a desire to be master of her own fate. This early conflict with her mother clearly shaped Victoria into a strong-willed queen, determined to hold on to the power that was rightly hers. It also left her a person in search of love and companionship. Even when surrounded by many, she felt alone. She became close to her trusted governess, and later advisor, Louise Lehzen. At eighteen years of age Victoria became queen. Her dependence and close friendship with Prime Minister Melbourne is discussed. In 1840, she married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, this having long been planned by her close friend, father-figure and maternal uncle, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. It was he who later became in 1830 the first Belgian king. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Childbirth was of course physically and psychologically wearing and immensely time-consuming in the life of an active queen. But, she had a strong libido and did love her children too. Despite her strong bond with Albert, disagreements naturally arose and Victoria bluntly voiced what she thought. Their relationship is a marvel to observe. The love between Victoria and Albert was deep, but not friction free. Victoria became pregnant after only three months of marriage. During her childbearing years, Albert, the Prince Consort, stood in for many of her duties, but this was exactly what he desired. This was his life goal and what he had envisioned. He loved his role as \u201cking\u201d. Victoria and Albert pushed their desks together and worked side by side together as a team with both Prime Ministers Peel and Palmerston. After Albert\u2019s untimely death in 1861, Victoria became immensely depressed. Slowly, after intense bereavement, she regained her sense of self. In the 1870s and 1880s she worked alongside Prime Ministers Disraeli, Gladstone and Salisbury. Both Victoria and Albert were born the same year, in 1819. Victoria lived forty years after his death! At Victoria\u2019s death, her children and grandchildren were established in the courts of Germany, Russia, Spain, Norway, Greece, Romania and Portugal. Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany was her grandson. It is known today that she and her daughters carried the hemophilia gene into the royalty of many a European nation. Reigning for sixty-three years, seven months and two days she was the longest reigning British Monarch, only later surpassed by her great-great-granddaughter Elizabeth II. In 1901, the year of Victoria\u2019s death, the British empire encompassed a quarter of the entire world and 400 million people. The industrial age was well established, women\u2019s rights were being recognized, child labor restricted, the work day had fallen from twelve to eight hours and unionization was in progress. Victoria\u2019s relationships with both John Brown and Hafiz Mohammed Abdul Karim are discussed and more importantly what these relationships reveal about Victoria herself. Was Victoria a prude? No, absolutely not. She was the opposite of ever being a racist and even if she did not support the suffragette movement, her actions showed what a woman could in fact do in the man dominated world of the 19th century. The book is also praiseworthy in that it draws a clear picture of where Europe stood before the First World War. The Crimean War, the coalition of German states, Germany\u2019s occupation of Alsace and Lorraine, distrust of Russian expansionism, the Berlin Congress of 1878 regulating among other thing Bulgaria\u2019s independence and borders and Turkey\u2019s position as the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d are all detailed. Small, interesting trivia about Victoria are revealed. Her friendships with the poet Tennyson and Florence Nightingale and how she fought against cruelty to animals are but three examples. That the book at the end shifts away from Victoria, the person, to the societal changes transforming her era is on one hand an appropriate conclusion, but it also makes the focus of the book unwieldly. The audiobook is narrated by Clare Frankel. It is very well done. Pauses and an altered intonation make it easy to identify quotes, of which there are many. Most of the book is read clearly and at a speed that allows one time to absorb the dense information packed into the lines. However, near the end, the tempo becomes much faster than it had been before. This portion is almost impossible to follow. I chose to decrease the speed to 75%. At the lower speed, the lines are lethargically slow, which is in turn also annoying but better than listening to a jumble of words! Since the normal tempo does return after about a quarter of an hour, I did not lower my four star rating.This book is equal parts history and biography. It is clear, engaging and well researched, revealing facts which previously had been removed by Victoria\u2019s daughter Beatrice. In this volume, both Victoria\u2019s attributes and weaknesses are presented. I really enjoyed the reading experience, and so therefore I must give it four stars. ***************** If this book interests you, I believe these will too: We Two: Victoria and Albert: Rulers, Partners, Rivals 4*(Unfortunately, this book concludes with the death of Albert!)George, Nicholas and Wilhelm: Three Royal Cousins and the Road to World War I 4*Charlotte And Leopold: The True Story Of The Original People's Princess 3*"}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "It\u2019s not often I\u2019m able to read a nonfiction book in one sitting, much less a historical biography, but that\u2019s just what happened with Julia Baird\u2019s new biography of Queen Victoria. Baird writes beautifully, crafting a careful narrative around Britain\u2019s second-longest reigning monarch. Her research is thorough, and she really provides the reader with a sense of what Victoria the woman and Victoria the queen were like. But most of all, this book is compulsively readable.

We are treated to Victoria's own life chronologically, from an infant fifth in line to the throne to a passionate teenager thrust into rule, from the swooning love and contentment of her marriage to Albert, to her consuming grief and seclusion after his death, from the Widow of Windsor to her reemergence in politics and foreign policy. Above all, Julia Baird is able to refute the popular notion (one that Victoria herself propagated) that Albert was the true power behind the throne, as even when pregnant and caring for young children, Victoria's strength and fiery personality are ever present and assertive in terms of dealing with foreign policy and thinking of how best to care for her subjects. She also is able to draw a strong hypothesis as to the nature of the relationship between John Brown and the Queen, one that has always elicited interest and controversy even from contemporary Victorian sources. And she does what she can to set the record straight so to speak from the heavily censored version of Victoria's diaries that her daughter Beatrice edited after her mother's death, to present a true, well-rounded portrait of a powerful, feisty woman and ruler, showcasing her strengths and flaws of character to equal effect.Besides being an exhaustive portrait of Victoria herself, Julia Baird also does a wonderful job giving very strong portraits of major figures in British and European history as well, notably Prince Albert, Gladstone and Disraeli and their political battles, and Kaiser Wilhelm II, Victoria's grandson (who comes off distinctly poorly). Baird is also very well able to situate some of the European political crises of the Victorian era, and show the connecting threads from Victoria's family and personal and political decision making to various critical events in the 20th century like World War I, and even some that still reverberate today, like conflicts in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. I do wish there was a bit more discussion about the Empire that greatly expanded under her reign, and given a bit more insight into the positive and even more so negative impacts of the British colonial policy and how they did or did not affect Victoria: those parts are definitely minimized, which perhaps speaks to the ministers leaving the Queen in a bit of ignorance about atrocities and famine and hunger in the name of the Empire.The Victorian era of England and Britain is very well captured, and we absorb the fast changing social, industrial, and economic conditions as Victoria, Albert, and the government's reforms and laws are implemented. One really got a well rounded sense of what it meant to be living in the transforming Victorian Britain, from the early days of Victoria's reign to the end at the dawn of the 20th century, and how progress and change in fashion, medicine, and cultural mores occurred. I particularly liked the connective tissue between Victoria- who perpetuated the idea that women should be subservient to their husbands and even she was lesser than Albert though her rule, importance, and assertiveness were undiminished and unchallenged in his lifetime - and the women's suffrage movement, something that she herself was ambivalent about and yet her longevity and dominance and strength came to be embraced and the symbol of Victoria adopted in some ways by early suffragettes. I highly recommend this read for people interested in Queen Victoria and the Victorian era in British politics and British life, and also for most readers of biographies who'd like to see the long life of a dynamic and powerful, emotional and courageous Queen."}, {"userName": "Steven Z.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z", "userReview": "The current airing of PBS\u2019 Masterpiece Theater of VICTORIA and its popularity has created great interest in the British monarch who ruled her kingdom and the world\u2019s largest empire between her accession to the throne in 1837 and her death in 1901. The program is written by Daisy Goodwin who has recently published her novel VICTORIA a fictional account of the early years of Victoria\u2019s reign. For a full and intimate biography Julia Baird has filled that void with VICTORIA: THE QUEEN which is an in depth study of the queen focusing on what it was like to be a female monarch in a world dominated by men. Baird takes a somewhat feminist approach to her subject and based on years of research and mastery of primary and secondary material, the reader will learn what it was like for the teenage girl to suddenly assume the throne in 1837, her views on Parliament, Prime Ministers, attitudes toward the poor, foreign policy ranging from the Crimean War to the Boer War, but also the effect of her reign on society and women in particular. The approach Baird takes is informative, well thought out, provides impeccable analysis, but at times she takes her intimate approach a bit too far. I understand the importance of Victoria\u2019s multiple pregnancies that produced nine children, but I do not need to know the details of her menstrual cycle and her reproductive anatomy. Details about her life with Prince Alfred are fascinating, but at times, here too, she goes overboard. However, despite some flaws the book is beautifully written and an important contribution to the historiography of the Queen.During her reign Victoria steered her people through the social and economic changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution, and oversaw her kingdom as the European balance of power was radically altered through nationalism and imperialism. The Queen\u2019s reign was the longest in British history until it was recently surpassed in 2015 by Queen Elizabeth II. Baird points to the many myths associated with Victoria relating to her marriage to Prince Albert, her use of power as queen, her treatment of her subjects, and her personality traits. Baird accurately concludes that \u201cVictoria is the women under whose auspices the modern world was made.\u201d Further, Baird does an exceptional job analyzing her subject in the context of mid to late 19th century socio-economic change and her impact on European society and the larger world especially for the role of women. In a sense Baird has created an ode to the development of the women\u2019s movement with Victoria\u2019s situation seen as a primary motivator behind it. Baird correctly argues that Victoria fought for her independence, prestige, and respect for her reign from the time she was a teenager, and did so mostly on her own. For the author, she \u201cworked until her eyes wore out, that she advised, and argued with, ten prime ministers, populated the royal courts of Europe, and kept the British monarchy stable during the political upheavals that shook Europe in the nineteenth century.\u201dBaird gives Victoria a great deal of credit but then she backtracks as she discusses the queen\u2019s relationship with Lord Melbourne, who she leaned on for support in dealing with her mother, John Conroy, certain members of her family, Parliament, and policy decisions. Baird describes a young woman infatuated with an older man, who thankfully does not seem to take advantage of his positon. According to Baird, Victoria will eventually concede powers to Prince Albert in most major social, political, and foreign policy areas. Granted, Victoria was pregnant a great deal of the time during her marriage to Albert, and suffered from postpartum depression and other ills that made her involvement in decision making less of an issue, but Baird herself points out the differences in approach between Victoria and Albert. The Prince was more of an intellectual than his spouse and was greatly interested in the problems of the poor and working classes. Albert was a cultured and well educated person who did not want to crush public dissent like Victoria and it appeared he wanted to bring about reform in order to lessen that dissent. According to Baird, \u201cthe role of the monarchy under Albert\u2019s leadership, then, was a forceful influence, which urged the government to exercise restraint in foreign policy and democratization, to erode the authority of the aristocracy and exert influence through a web of royal connections that spanned Europe in a network of carefully planned and delicate backdoor diplomacy.\u201d Victoria on the other hand was not as empathetic toward her subjects. A case in point is her approach to the Irish famine where she started out criticizing tyrannical landlords, but once a few landlords that she knew were murdered, her sympathy for Irish tenant farmers waned. Baird argues that it was a stretch to blame Victoria for the famine, but there was a great deal she could have done to mitigate their effects. It is clear that from the time of her marriage to Prince Albert in 1839 until his death in 1861 England may have gone through an Albertine Age as Baird suggests, and it took until the Prince died for Victoria to seize the reigns and create the Victorian Age.For Victoria until Albert\u2019s passing life was a balancing act; how to be a good mother, wife, and reign over her kingdom. Baird does her best to show the Queen as a loving and doting mother, but then in the next sentence she will point out that she was rarely involved in certain aspects of her children\u2019s care. Victoria possessed a quiet stubbornness that forced many who opposed her wishes to underestimate her, particularly when she ruled by herself. Lord Melbourne did school her well on how to be an effective Queen, and she learned from Albert certain sensibilities that a monarch needed to possess. Baird does an effective job dealing with Victoria\u2019s views and impact on events. Her role in the Crimean War debate is discussed in full, her fears of revolution in 1848 and why the social upheaval throughout Europe did not cross the English Channel, her distaste for the Russians in the Eastern crisis that led to war and the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, and her opposition to Home Rule for the Irish. Further, Baird\u2019s discussion and analysis of Victoria relationship with her Prime Ministers is top drawer particularly her negative relationship with Lord Palmerston when he was Foreign and Prime Minister, and her up and down relationships with certain Prime Ministers, particularly William Gladstone, Lord Derby and Lord Russell. Her relationship with Lord Salisbury was excellent but nothing compared to her relationship with Benjamin Disraeli as he was the only Prime Minister to realize that the lonely queen wanted to be \u201cfettered, flattered, and adored.\u201d As Victoria aged she moved on from her Whiggish liberalism under the influence of Melbourne to outright conservativism due to her close relationship with the Tory, Disraeli. The last twenty years of her reign Victoria, who never acted as an impartial monarch, became greatly involved in politics, especially when the man she loathed, William Gladstone had defeated Disraeli in parliamentary elections in 1881.It can be argued that 1861 was a watershed year for Europe and the world because of its impact on the United States and across Europe. It witnessed the outbreak of the Civil War in the United States, the supposed emancipation of serfs in Russia, and the death of Prince Albert. Her husband\u2019s death became the greatest test for Victoria\u2019s reign. She seemed to succumb to an extreme depression and many wondered if mental illness would overtake her as it did George III. Her depression would last for a number of years where she had doubts about how to proceed with policies and felt extremely alone. During that time a number of major events in Europe would draw the attention of the British Foreign Office. The Polish Revolt against Russia and the controversy over Schleswig-Holstein would lead to the Danish War between Denmark and Prussia. English influence in this 1863 crisis was marked and if Albert had been alive he might have influenced events more than his mourning widow. By the late 1860s it appeared that Victoria was emerging from her depressive state, and as she overcame her loss she would go on to be a strong monarch in her own right making a deep impact on her kingdom as well as Europe.The key individual in Victoria\u2019s emergence from her widowed state was John Brown, a Scottish Highlander who had been Albert\u2019s outdoor attendant at Balmoral who became her most intimate friend. Her children despised him and nicknamed him the \u201cQueen\u2019s Stallion.\u201d There are many rumors and myths about their relationship that Baird addresses, whether they were lovers and what impact he may have had on policies, as one writer referred to him as \u201cRasputin with a kilt.\u201d No matter what the truth may be, one thing is certain is that the Queen came to rely on him and he helped fill the void created by Albert\u2019s death. In fact, Victoria would spend eighteen years in his company, almost as long as she spent with her beloved Albert.Baird spends a great deal of time discussing royal genealogy and its impact on Victoria\u2019s life and policy decisions. Using the marriage of her children for diplomatic need had been a tradition of European and English monarchies for centuries, but in her case the result can be considered quite disastrous as her lineage connects her to Wilhelm II of Germany, and Nicholas II of Russia who both bear a great deal of the blame for the outbreak of World War I and the carnage that followed. Her children were placed throughout Europe as a means of extending English influence, but in reality that goal was rarely met. There is no doubt that no one person dominated her kingdom the way Victoria had, particularly from the 1870s onward as she applied the political lessons learned over the decades, especially working in the shadows to achieve her goals while her subjects thought she was romping in Scotland as any monarch would do. Baird creates an absorbing picture of a fascinating life. Despite a few flaws Baird should be commended for producing the most comprehensive analysis of Victoria and her importance in history, and it should remain the most important secondary source on Victoria\u2019s life for years to come."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "\"Victoria's story is one of unmatched prestige and immense privilege, of defiance and crumbling, of meddling and mettle, of devotion and overwhelming grief and then, finally, a powerful resilience that defined the tiny woman at the heart of an empire.

It reflects on Victoria's entire life, highlighting the tumultuous events and debates that preceded her ascension to the throne, her disastrous first year as monarch, the famous marriage to Prince Albert, and the long period of widowhood during which she had to redefine herself in the wake of immeasurable loss. Julia Baird states in her introduction that \"We forget, now, how long Victoria ruled alone ... the great volume of Victoria's grief meant that a myth sprang up almost immediately, which many still believe today: that she stopped ruling when Albert died, and that she had abdicated almost all her authority and power to her clever husband when he was alive.\" She sets out in this biography to debunk that myth, bringing new emphasis to the years Victoria ruled without a husband at her side.Baird's mission in re-framing preconceptions about Queen Victoria is ambitious and has worth both as an historical and feminist project. However, her thesis is hardly original. Victoria's reign has been considered and reconsidered by many historians since her death. The argument that she was inhibited by Albert while they were married and that his early death set her free to reclaim the power he'd confiscated during her many pregnancies has been tossed around frequently. For a recent example, we can look to Gillian Gill's 2009 publication, We Two: Victoria & Albert: Rulers, Partners, Rivals. She, too, poses a challenge to the \"Widow of Windsor\" mythology. Baird brings very little new material to the table in Victoria, The Queen.Something that continuously bothered me while reading Baird's work was the chaotic organization within each chapter. There were many \"Squirrel!!\" moments peppered throughout that distracted from the points the chapters were meant to make. She got bogged down in peripheral detail, losing her train of thought regularly. The sub-sections of each chapter were only loosely connected rhetorically, and she crammed anecdotal asides in the midst of sentences. She also makes a habit of including \"cinematic\"-like scenes in which she presents Victoria as a character in a novel, describing thoughts, emotions, and judgments that are completely unexplained. If these details came from journals, letters, or some other documentation, Baird should have shared the information. Without it, these little vignettes are just a cute little distraction that make it seem like Baird really wanted to write a novel rather than a biography. All in all, I found Baird to be a very frustrating author, though her voice is very clear and even occasionally elegant. Frustrations aside, Baird's biography of Victoria is informative of a life that was long, saw much, and influenced the course of British, European, and world history. It would be a good read for anyone who is casually curious about Victoria's life."}, {"userName": "Barbara (The Bibliophage)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage", "userReview": "Julia Baird undertook an enormous task in researching and writing this extensive and highly detailed biography of England's second-longest ruling monarch. Queen Victoria's long reign was just eclipsed last year by her great-great-granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II. Baird masterfully mixes stories of Queen Victoria's family life, relationships, political ambitions, failures, and triumphs. We learn the details of how Britain's system of government works, as the author explains how the Queen negotiated with and bullied 19 Prime Ministers during her reign. But Victoria wasn't just a ruler, she was a woman, a wife, and mother of nine. This aspect of her life is covered in detail as well. Imagine having to get comfortable with a new husband who had his own desire for power while also learning to rule a country. The 19th century was ripe with prejudice against women, and Victoria barreled through most of it with strength, diplomatic negotiation, and humor. Victoria and Albert's relationship, including their power struggles, was interesting within the context of the times. I found it both depressing and captivating to see how they balanced their public and private lives, with Victoria taking the back seat to Albert in so many things. In terms of writing style, isn't at all dry. Parts of it are even fascinating, although my personal lack of interest made descriptions of military campaigns seem interminable. This is the first biography of Queen Victoria I've read, and I'm quite sure I've received a comprehensive perspective.

I learned a lot that I didn't know - especially what an awful person Albert was - but I still felt like I came away a bit lacking in a real understanding of the person Victoria. How did she go from fierce and self-sufficient 18 year old to someone completely manipulated by her husband into feelings of helplessness and incompetence? What did she really believe in, beyond supporting Prime Ministers who she got along well with? What power did she actually have over this period? I felt a few things could have been better fleshed out, although the royal family's gutting of her diaries and letters no doubt make a lot of this hard for even the most thorough researcher.

Baird places Victoria in the context of her times, highlighting the social issues and changing attitudes toward women over the course of the 19th century. As a female Head of State, Victoria inspired other women interested in achieving a greater role in public life, even though she was personally opposed to women's suffrage and women joining a number of the professions. This focus on Victoria's influence as a woman in power makes this biography stand out from many others about the Queen. The contradictions within Victoria's character and relationships are also well illustrated here.There are a few points where I disagree with Baird's analysis. Like A.N. Wilson, she argues that Victoria had romantic feelings toward Lord Melbourne while I agree with Kate Williams that she viewed him more as a father figure and \"favorite tutor.\" It's also disappointing to see some of the speculation about Princess Louise from Lucinda Hawksley's recent bio of the Princess repeated as though they are facts.Overall, I enjoyed Baird's biography of Queen Victoria, which demonstrates that more than a century after the Queen's death, there are still fresh perspectives and interpretations of her long life."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018Few would have bet Victoria would become queen of the British Isles.\u2019Sub-titled an intimate biography of the woman who ruled an empire, this book seeks to portray the person of Victoria behind the myth that has arisen since her death. Myth? Many of Queen Victoria\u2019s papers were destroyed or censored after her death, to preserve a particular image of her. In preparing this biography, Ms Baird has had access to previously unpublished papers. In a general note, at the end of the book Ms Baird states: \u2018All passages that discuss what Victoria was thinking, feeling or wearing are based directly on journal entries, letters and other contemporary evidence referenced below.\u2019 A lot has been written about Queen Victoria. Born in 1819, she was fifth in the line to the throne and was never expected to become queen. When Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, she was aged just eighteen. She lived through a period of great change and by the time of her death in 1901, aged eighty-one, the world had changed significantly. This was the era of great technological change, of disastrous wars, and colonial expansion. It was also the era of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, and Florence Nightingale.But what of the woman herself? Victoria was aged twenty when she fell in love with her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They had nine children. In Ms Baird\u2019s words:\u2018The marriage between Victoria and Albert is one of the greatest romances of modern history. It was genuine, devoted and fruitful. Together, they ushered in an era when the monarchy would shift from direct power to indirect influence, and from being the fruit of the aristocracy to becoming the symbol of the middle class.\u2019Victoria was no cipher: when dealing with her ministers, she was outspoken and asserted her opinions. She also survived eight assassination attempts. After Albert died, aged only forty-two, she had a close relationship with her servant John Brown. A passionate woman who needed intimacy and closeness. The image I\u2019d previously formed was quite different. I kept reading, interested to find out more about this woman who was still Queen when two of my grandparents were born towards the end of the nineteenth century. I was fascinated, too, that the adjective \u2018Victorian\u2019 had come to mean stuffy, prudish or hypocritical when Victoria herself seemed more broad-minded.\u2018What is more startling today is to discover what a robust and interventionist ruler Victoria was.\u2019This is one of the most accessible and interesting biographies I have read recently. There are pages and pages of notes for those interested in sources, but the notes themselves do not interrupt the flow of the book. The picture of Victoria that emerges is of a complicated woman, a successful and strong woman who negotiated her path in an overwhelmingly patriarchal society. I was interested in how closely she worked with her prime ministers, especially Disraeli, and how she disliked Gladstone.I\u2019d recommend this book to anyone interested in the life and reign of Queen Victoria.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"userName": "Judy Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley", "userReview": "I received a print ARC of this book through the Amazon Vine Voices program.I received an e-ARC of this book through NetGalley and Random House Publishing.I have read many biographies of the life of Queen Victoria. What sets this one apart from all the others for me is the sense of intimacy Julia Baird has created between the subject and the reader. Some biographers seem to set out to only reveal the best sides of Victoria, some go in the opposite direction and focus on the negative aspects of her personality. And there are certainly negative traits aplenty if you want to portray this woman from a single viewpoint. Thankfully Julia Baird has been fair, not making any effort to sway the reader in one direction or another. Probably the best compliment I can give Ms. Baird is that I don't know if she has any bias either for or against Queen Victoria after reading this very detailed book.This book goes into much depth regarding the day by day, year by year life of Victoria while being weighted most heavily toward the time she was married to Albert. He was the driving force behind all the changes which took place in her realm while they were married and this book does a wonderful job of showing that Victoria understood that she was not the intellectual equal of Albert, but she was the Queen and she would never waver from that fact. He could suggest, she would listen, but the decisions always came from the Queen. If you enjoy finding out what the truth was behind some of the rumors surrounding Victoria, Albert, their children, John Brown and Abdul Karim there is evidence and documentation here to allow you to make up your own mind. Ms. Baird spent many years of research on this work and the list of those people and institutions she mentions in her Acknowledgements section is impressive. Inside this book you will find information to help you enjoy the book; a family tree, maps, a list of characters, copious Notes, a bibliography and an index. This author was given a great deal of access to archived information regarding Victoria, some of it newly released. All of it gives us insight into this very private woman who occupied such a public stage.The reign of Victoria, the Queen saw incredible changes worldwide.

I am forever bitter at her children for allowing and for performing such a wholesale hack job on her papers.

Victoria was a contradiction in so many ways and an absolute monarch in others, a queen who thought rights for women was ridiculous, a mother of nine who mothered according to the standoff-ish Victorian norms of her generation, devoted to her husband before and after his death, yet probably had lovers later in her life, although her children destroyed all her private papers that might allude to such a thing. One quibble: the author describes \"Britain at peace\" while Britain was actively expanding her empire...which isn't exactly a peaceful process. The details about colonialism really made my blood boil, not because Baird handled it poorly (outside of the quibble mentioned above), but because colonialism is such a bastard move for a powerful country to employ, to just, assume the geography and humanity of another place and then try and bend it to your will!?

I love reading about royal families because they're quirky and sometimes downright crazy, but I find myself most intrigued by the British royal family, and Queen Victoria is one of my favorite queens to read about.I've read a handful of small biographies about her life but each time, I learn something about her that I didn't know before and this was no exception. I haven't read all biographies about her but I can say that this one was the most all-encompassing, and that was a challenge. Baird wrote a biography about the whole of Victoria's reign, including bits about her childhood as well. While that's a feat in itself, as Victoria's reign was only recently broken by her great-great-granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, writing such an expansive life about this monarch is also a feat as well.One of my only complaint about this book is that if very often jumped around, which is only mildly understandable as there were certain events from previous years that affected Victoria's viewpoint of a certain subject. The amount of censorship of her diaries and letters is one thing I didn't realize happened so violently.Trying to understand the relationship between Victoria and Albert can also be very trying, despite the queen's many, many letters and diary entries. One thing is obvious though--she loved him very much and, I believe, he loved her equally in return, though he also appeared to adhere to many of the hypocritical ideals of the time (though I did cheer that he stayed with Victoria through many of her childbirths). Their love for one another is infamous and one can see how heavily they leaned on one another. I also think their love was due to the fact that Victoria grew up without a father and Albert without a mother (though he actually remembered her). But I also believe that they pushed many ideas onto each other until they believed it to be a reality.It wasn't as if she tossed the reins to Albert. He actively sought things to do--politics, reforms, ideas, etc. He wanted to be involved. He had an incredibly sharp mind and it would have gone to waste had it not done anything. Of course, that doesn't mean I agree with the fact that he and Victoria both did not support the suffrage moment, or that he tried to influence the government on his own. He did it because he saw it as something for the good of the people and the good of Victoria.What I liked about this biography than I do above others is that mention of John Brown and Abdul Karim. Many biographies mostly ignore these two people in her life but these two men did to Victoria what she had always wanted: they preened, flattered, and charmed her--all to the abhorrence of her family.Overall, this is an expansive biography and if you do not mind a bit of backtracking in relation to many events, you'll enjoy this well-researched biography of Queen Victoria."}, {"userName": "Biblio Files (takingadayoff)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff", "userReview": "As long as this book was, at about 500 pages of text and another hundred or so of notes, bibliography, and index, I was sorry to come to the end.

It sounds completely conventional and yet I enjoyed every page.Julia Baird, a historian, had access to some previously unexamined documents of Victoria and those around her, so there may be some new information, but this is the first bio of Victoria I have read, so it's all new to me. There was some buzz that some proof was revealed that Victoria and John Brown had had a sexual relationship, but there was no more than what amounts to hearsay or circumstantial evidence. More interesting to me was how engaged she was with her children, both as children and as adults. I've recently read biographies about her son Bertie (King Edward VII) and her daughter Louise, both of which made the case that Victoria was a critical and distant mother. She was certainly critical, but Baird provides overwhelming evidence that she loved her children deeply and enjoyed spending time with them and with her grandchildren. It was also fascinating to learn how involved she was with matters of state, sometimes to the point of overreaching her constitutional duties. She stayed on top of events and worked to keep Britain on the right side of all the conflicts that were popping up in the Empire and in Europe.

Going into this, I knew virtually nothing about British royalty. I have never gotten a single Jeopardy question right in this category. But this book, and Victoria's life, were extremely compelling. At the risk of grotesquely simplifying her story, what stood out to me is that she was a woman who had nine children despite hating pregnancy, fearing childbirth, and disliking newborns, and she experienced lifelong physical damage and pain as a result (It wasn't discovered until her death that her uterus was literally falling out of her body, probably for decades. #momlife). She suffered from horrendous postpartum depression each time, for which she was rewarded with her husband, who she adored, grabbing a bit more of her power and making her feel a bit more insecure about her worth and abilities. She lost her husband, three children, several grandchildren, and almost every one of her closest friends as she aged, and was almost certainly suffering from severe, untreated depression from the moment her husband died more than thirty years before her own death. I find royalty to be immensely ridiculous and realize that Victoria oversaw some horrific atrocities across her massive Empire. But, I can't help by sympathize with her in many ways.

Judging by the author's comments about how censured Victoria's diaries were after her death, it's astonishing that she managed to give such a full account of the monarch's life. I really felt for Victoria when she lost Albert and when she started losing everyone close to her. I admired her youthful energy and even grew attached to her stubborness, temper and love for life. I think a young Victoria wouldn't have disapproved of Bertie - as a mother, she might have felt her eldest son was falling short of what a king should be like, but Victoria as a teen was a fun-loving free and sexual spirit and that was refreshing to read about. I'm very curious to read about Bertie and his reign, even more than I was before and this biography also gave me a new appreciation for Albert's work, he was an incredible man on so many levels, extremely intelligent and driven with an insatiable curiosity and appetite for knowledge.

But I came away from Baird's book pleasantly surprised! There are new new tidbits - I won't spoil - and Baird takes what I would call a feminist point of view on much of Victoria's life. She's proved beyond doubt (at least to me) that the Queen was a strong-willed, politically bent, unconstitutional monarch to her dying day, constantly trying to grab (back) power. Baird also argues that male historians (and the queen's descendants) have redacted some of Victoria's life, including her maternal instincts. The first half of this book is the strongest, likely due to what plagues all Victorian scholars - most of the details of Victoria's life in mourning has been discounted or disappeared. But Baird makes the most of her material, and injects a few new discoveries.If you've read everything there is to read on Victoria and are hungering for more, add this to your reading list. And if you are dying to start reading about the amusing queen, this is a terrific place to start."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna", "userReview": "A fascinating deeply researched look at a remarkably complex and powerful woman and very informative about the people, wars and political movements of Great Britain and the world during her reign.Popsugar challenge 2017: a book with a title that's a character's name"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5874018-diana", "userReview": "Book received from NetGalleyThis was a wonderful book about a very well-known, Queen of Britain. Victoria was a unique monarch who had quite a bit of tragedy in her life. Since she was so well-known it is difficult to find a biography with any new information on her. This one did have a bit, which is the main reason I gave it 4 stars. It is a wonderful read and I would have liked it even without the new material. It's very well written and researched, with a few items that could be considered speculation. I do not believe we will ever definitively know the true status of her manservant John Brown. I especially enjoyed it due to the fact I was able to tour her rooms in Kensington Palace, so I had a reference when they were discussing her life there."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091674-linda", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent biography of an extraordinary woman. I've read other books about Victoria, but enjoyed this the most, probably because I've now visited many of the places that are mentioned, including beautiful and very intimate Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The new PBS \"Victoria\" series seems to have peaked the interest of many, and while I watched the series myself, I urge others to read this heavily researched bio to learn the real story behind the wife, mother, and monarch."}], "description": "When Victoria was born, in 1819, the world was a very different place. Revolution would threaten many of Europe\u2019s monarchies in the coming decades. In Britain, a generation of royals had indulged their whims at the public\u2019s expense, and republican sentiment was growing. The Industrial Revolution was transforming the landscape, and the British Empire was commanding ever larger tracts of the globe. In a world where women were often powerless, during a century roiling with change, Victoria went on to rule the most powerful country on earth with a decisive hand.Fifth in line to the throne at the time of her birth, Victoria was an ordinary woman thrust into an extraordinary role. As a girl, she defied her mother\u2019s meddling and an adviser\u2019s bullying, forging an iron will of her own. As a teenage queen, she eagerly grasped the crown and relished the freedom it brought her. At twenty, she fell passionately in love with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, eventually giving birth to nine children. She loved sex and delighted in power. She was outspoken with her ministers, overstepping conventional boundaries and asserting her opinions. After the death of her adored Albert, she began a controversial, intimate relationship with her servant John Brown. She survived eight assassination attempts over the course of her lifetime. And as science, technology, and democracy were dramatically reshaping the world, Victoria was a symbol of steadfastness and security\u2014queen of a quarter of the world\u2019s population at the height of the British Empire\u2019s reach.Drawing on sources that include fresh revelations about Victoria\u2019s relationship with John Brown, Julia Baird brings vividly to life the fascinating story of a woman who struggled with so many of the things we do today: balancing work and family, raising children, navigating marital strife, losing parents, combating anxiety and self-doubt, finding an identity, searching for meaning.", "title": "Victoria: The Queen: An Intimate Biography of the Woman Who Ruled an Empire", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria?rto=x_gr_w_carousel_bp", "average": 4.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512083875l/36693639.jpg", "reviews": 600, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/136881.Julia_Baird", "name": "Julia Baird"}], "type": ["Biography", "History", "Nonfiction", "Historical", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30073556-victoria-the-queen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24423800-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24212581-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34474495-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/907408.Imagine_This", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1549064.Media_Tarts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1028682.John_Lennon_My_Brother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11800206-in-his-own-youth-in-my-own-words"]}
