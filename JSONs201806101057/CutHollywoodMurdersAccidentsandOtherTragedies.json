Now we don't have to pretendThat it's a Hollywood ending It's quite ironic because there were no happy endings here. It's like something out of a George RR Martin novel. Seriously. Pretty boys. Pretty girls. Hopeful beginnings. Tragic endings. Welcome to Hollywood.\nJames Dean. Natalie Wood. Sal Mineo. Sharon Tate. Marilyn Monroe. Selena. River Phoenix. Honestly there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said in my previous reviews. Here are a few poor souls you might not have heard about.Black Dahlia aka Elizabeth Short. Ok, you've probably heard of her. Hollywood's most famous murder. An aspiring actress meets gruesome end. Decades later the case is still unsolved. Just don't look at the crime scene photos. That shit will haunt you forever. Rebecca Schaeffer. A young actress who was stalked, shot and killed by her stalker in 1989.Dominique Dunne. A young actress, daughter of Dominick Dunne, who was strangled by her ex-boyfriend. Her co-star David Packer was at her house rehearsing a scene, heard her screaming outside, but did nothing to help her. What a hero. But wait, there's more. Her killer served less than three years.Lana Clarkson. An actress who was shot and killed in the mansion of famed producer Phil Spector. Spector said her death was an accidental suicide. In the words of Cher Horowitz : as if.Dorothy Stratten. A young model and actress, killed by her estranged husband. Dorothy left her douchey husband for Peter Bogdanovich. Don't judge her. He was a hustler who used her as a meal ticket. He, being a douche, couldn't handle the rejection. He shot and killed her before killing himself.Virginia Rappe. A silent film actress. Hollywood's first scandal. She died from a ruptured bladder and secondary peritonitis. The cause is still a mystery. Virginia attended a party hosted by Roscoe Arbuckle, a famous silent film actor. Arbuckle was accused of locking Virginia in a room and raping her. He supposedly crushed her with his weight. He was trialed but eventually acquitted. His career never recovered from the scandal. He is believed by many to have been innocent.Jayne Mansfield. An actress and Playboy Playmate. I don't know which was more shocking, her rollercoaster life or her untimely demise. Let me just make one thing clear here. Jayne Mansfield was not decapitated. I wish people would stop saying that. This is simply not true. Here's an interesting tidbit- her daughter is none other than Mariska Hargitay, the famed actress from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. John Belushi. Why are so many comedians unhappy? Seriously, it's truly puzzling. John Belushi was a man of great comedic talent and a very bad drug habit. It all came to an end in Bungalow 3 at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. Well, at least we'll always have The Blues Brothers. But there is one individual who I feel the most sorry for and that's Phil Hartman. He seemed like such a sweetheart. As many of you know, his wife Brynn Hartman shot and killed him while he slept and then killed herself. Brynn had a big drug problem, which obviously caused this tragedy. \nIt's just like Gloria Swanson said, 'You see, this is my life! It always will be! There's nothing else! Just us, the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark!\u2026 All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.'Some names were omitted, others I have never heard of. Cut!: Hollywood Murders, Accidents, and Other Tragedies is somewhat exaggerated, as is always the case with celebrities. I'm giving this a higher rating just because I love the pictures. Just give me pictures and I'm happy. I have to end this with a Tumblr post. Totally inappropriate but funny as hell."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205814-misha", "userReview": "I just cut my finger on this book. It's bleeding profusely. How ironic is that?Interesting, if shallow, look at infamous Hollywood deaths. A couple of noteworthy examples are missing, such as Peg Entwistle, the failed Welsh starlet who notoriously committed suicide by jumping from the Hollywood sign, which at the time read \"Hollywoodland.\" Folklore has it the \"land\" was dropped from the sign after the suicide because it was considered bad luck to have 13 letters. I believe the truth is more mundane -- it just sort of broke down over time.Another missing chapter is Gwili Andre, a Danish actress who died by self-immolation. She surrounded herself with a pile of her own publicity photos and set them on fire.Ah, Hollywood."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1480548-kay", "userReview": "Lots of celebrities = lots of information, but the formulaic entries (1 or 2 photos, some biographical background, some career highlights, circumstances of death) don't make for an engrossing cover-to-cover read."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2302425-sue", "userReview": "While overall I thought this book did a good job of giving a detailed--if brief--biography of each Hollywood celebrity who died for reasons other than simple old age, there was one glaring error that drove me a bit nuts. The first time I saw it, I passed it off as just a mistake, but when it appeared TWICE, it was clear that the author was wrong.It had to do with Heather O'Rourke, the little blonde girl who played Carol Anne in the film \"Poltergeist.\" Her information was correct--as far as I know--but the picture that accompanied her bio was wrong. She wasn't in the picture at all, but the boy who played her brother, Oliver Robins, was. In a later chapter, which listed films that seemed to experience \"curses\" or deaths while in production, again, used the same photo and credited O'Rourke. Seriously, Robins didn't look remotely like O'Rourke! http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732319/me..."}, {"userName": "Jdetrick", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24591645-jdetrick", "userReview": "I'm not sure why I bought this book, and most of my problems with it don't really have to do with the writing involved, but the concept of the book itself. First of all, reading an entire book about death becomes depressing. Second of all, so many of these deaths are so similar (or the stories behind them seem so similar) that it becomes somewhat monotonous. Finally, there's not enough space for the interesting stories to really get the treatment they deserve."}, {"userName": "jess", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21608-jess", "userReview": "who knew that 91 out of the 220 people involved with the 1956 film the conqueror developed cancer? i wish i could have written this book. it's all about the deaths of movie stars. it would have been mediocre if it just presented the facts. thankfully, the authors chose to include rumors and myths sparked by celebrity deaths, as well as a passage about why we as a culture as obsessed with them. best of all, the writing has a certain cinematic presence about it."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/569516-angie", "userReview": "Very thorough book going through the lives and deaths of movie stars of old and recent.

It might also have been the most jinxed. Among its stars, James Dean was soon killed in a car crash, Sal Mineo died several years later, murdered by an unknown assailant, and the beautiful Natalie Wood died mysteriously when she fell from a docked pleasure boat and drowned. This heavily illustrated book recounts these and many other tragic events that have haunted the Hollywood movie community from its early-twentieth-century beginnings to the present day. Here are accounts of the sudden, premature deaths of stars like Rudolph Valentino, Montgomery Clift, and Peter Sellers. Here too are stories about celebrities who died young because of alcohol or drug-related problemsJohn Belushi and Elvis Presley among many othersand of the tragic 1998 murder of comedian Phil Hartman. Car wrecks, plane crashes, and other deadly accidents sent Jayne Mansfield, Grace Kelly, and Carole Lombard, to untimely deaths, and accidents occurring during film production have taken several lives, perhaps the most dramatic being the helicopter crash that killed Vic Morrow in 1983. The tragic stories of many Hollywood personalities are told in \"Cut!, \"the definitive volume on the fleeting lives of movie celebrities, some of whom became more famous in death than they had been in life.
