I'm a fantasy girl, but this was done well enough to keep my attention from waving. Reilly and the others all have their own personalities, some a little too extreme to possibly be real (though such people are out there). And it's in Ireland! *thumbs up*The setting of the story made me feel like I had a large insight on Ireland. The plot and suspense was great. The characters and their own lives outside the cases were just as good. I loved it all.I recommend this to those who are intrigued, but I should warn you that the crime scenes are TABOO like the title suggests and rather gruesome in the question of morality and sensibility. Otherwise, it's amazing."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237864-susan", "userReview": "Had never Read any Casey Hill Books...

This mystery kept me intrigued throughout the book, and the main character, Reilly, was extremely likable. I figured out the mystery halfway through the book, but it didn't matter, I still needed to know the details. I will read more books in this series."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805671-laura", "userReview": "A bit predictable, but still a fun mystery. It's not nearly as gruesome as Kathy Riechs books, or anywhere as technical, so it would be an easier read in that way. However the language was terrible. There was a ton of swearing, and liberal use of the \"f\" word. It might be a good idea to wait for the PureMedia filter app before reading this one."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846253-leslie", "userReview": "Reilly Steel is a Californian, Quantico trained CSI who has transplanted to Ireland to stay close to her father.

CSI Reilly Steel is smart but troubled: The author's abrupt switch to her nightmares was at times distracting, and there were so many extraneous characters that it seemed that there were loose ends.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. To me, it's kind of the water you rinse your mouth with between wine tastings. It was a good \"cleansing of the palate\" between books.
