Synge, in his relatively short life helped revolutionize Irish Threater, was a poet, prose writer, musician,playwright and collector of folklore. He spent part of his summers for 5 years on the Aran Islands collecting and documenting stories and customs and traditions of the Islanders and the end product ( this little book) is a remarkable and important collection of information and folklore. This is not a story but rather a series of journal accounts as the author says in his introduction \" In the pages that follow I have given a direct account of my life on the Islands and of what I met with amoung them, Inventing nothing , and changing nothing this is essential\" There is so much that I found intriguing and insightful in this account, the way of life and the hardship of the Islanders, the bleak and harsh and yet stunning landscape, the tradition, stories, food, clothing and the religion and beliefs are so interesting and I came away with a better understanding of their life and struggles at this time.While everything has changed on the Islands with modernization , nothing has changed like, landscape, remoteness, beauty, quiet and those rugged and stunning stone walls and ruins. I loved the fact that after stepping foot on the island you can hire a bike and within 5 minutes be utterly by yourself and step back in time. I loved this book and can't stop thinking about it, I would recommend it to those who have an interest in folklore and history of Ireland. It's not for everyone but I can see many enjoying this and at 208 pages is not very taxing."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Delightful. I highly recommend this audiobook narrated by Donal Donnelly if you want immersion into the most Irish of Ireland, the Aran Islands. The three islands (Inis M\u00f3r, Inis Me\u00e1in and Inis \u00d3irr) are located in Galway Bay. This is a book relating the author's experiences, a famed playwright, who visited the island several times 1898-1901 on the suggestion of Yeats. These visits are the bedrock for his plays. The narrator's brogue is fantastic and further enhances ones experience. Listen to it, don't read it. You get fables, depiction of the food, clothing, occupations and the islanders' simple \"manner of being\". You learn about kelp burning, thatching, rope making, farming, fishing, the festivals and the fairies. What makes this book is HOW it is written - the language used, the brogue, and the simple, straight-forward speech of the islanders. The stories are simple and many you will recognize (Three Billy Goats Gruff and The Goose that Lays Golden Eggs and more), although clothed in the islands' mantle. There is subtle humor. You will feel as though you are yourself sitting in front of a hearth hearing the stories, engulfed by fog and tangy salt smells. A delightful reading experience.I never felt the author looked down on these islanders, as some other readers have noted."}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124093-gloria", "userReview": "It must be the 80% Irish in me rising to the top, for I've never had a book make me homesick for a place I've never been..."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1079443-andrea", "userReview": "A lovely book that is incredibly evocative of a way of life that has long since passed away through its stories and reflections of the fishermen and women who lived on the Aran islands. Synge went there to learn Irish and return to his gaelic roots. He seems to have been one of a long parade of anthropologists, artists and writers in fact, a reflection of the huge upsurge of a certain kind of nationalism at the time. There is a lyrical beauty in many of his descriptions, and an honest attempt to enter into and understand the daily lives of the islanders with a great deal of respect, though he spends a lot fo time lying around in the sunshine, while also pondering the unbridgeable distance between them. As a man he cannot seem to enter the women's world really at all, but his wanderings with the old men and his recountings of their tales and poems are quite wonderful. I loved his description of how islanders told time...or failed to tell it when the wind was in the right direction (an excerpt of which is to be found in E.P. Thompson which I had forgotten). His description of the evictions was particularly poignant, even when the pigs the landowner was having rounded up as rent bowled over three policemen. It was something I couldn't quite forgive him for, the absence of any kind of political economy in his understanding, the fact that the villagers were so poor because they lived on land that barely provided subsistence -- their ingenious ways of extracting every last possible use from it are incredible -- yet still was land owned by someone else, for which they had to pay rent in coin. Who was it? How did some one person come to own an island on which these people had lived for generations? And Synge with his privilege just sat and watched it being taken away. Women keening after losing everything. There isn't even an attempt to come to terms with it. He just soaks in the local colour and moves on, though the letters he exchanges with the island residents (most of whom of a certain age seem to move to America) are lovely and show some human connection was made."}, {"userName": "Laurel Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1719730-laurel-hicks", "userReview": "A delightful account of Synge's stay on the islands as he endeavored to learn Gaelic and the ways of the people.

And so he did. That there is a patronising tone to his recollection is perhaps understandable given the rigid social stratification in the British Isles at the time: as a member of the Anglo-Irish \"Protestant Ascendancy\", it was remarkable that Synge was so willing to follow Yeats advise in the first place. But despite Synge's sometimes condescending tone, one gets a sense of a genuine affection for his subjects; there had to be something that kept drawing him back to the islands year after year between 1896 and 1903. Neither anthropology nor travelogue, The Aran Islands is a peculiar, personal portrait of a place and time. His experiences on the islands, the people he met, the stories he heard, provided a framework for his more widely recognised literary efforts: the plays, In the Shadow of the Glen (1903), Riders to the Sea (1904) and perhaps his masterpiece, The Playboy of the Western World (1907)."}, {"userName": "Mira", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/769637-mira", "userReview": "Synge wrote this in pieces, but I think it works that way...very beautiful snapshots of the everyday and the sublime. Which is what life must constantly be like on these islands. Not sure if it is still the same there, there was a storm when I was supposed to go, so maybe I wont ever find out!He goes back a few times, never mentions his own appearance or disruption/lack of to the people's lives, and observes things the way a ghost might...very strange! But I have read he was a strangely closed man...so that might be why he loved this place so much and the fact that not much besides the weirdness of the fairies shock the Aran folk...and even then they are both matter of fact and humorous about their beliefs. Good book about a way of life that is so much more basic than ours today, but somehow more emotionally sophisticated.The descriptions of normal people on the islands and how they behave when \"away\" with the little folk are chilling."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105081-andrew", "userReview": "Synge's travelogue of the Aran Islands is a mostly a curiosity. Drawn from multiple visits, the scenes and stories recounted are fascinating, patronizing, and boring by turns. Synge's prose is always clear an precise, but the book is weighted down by his often condescending attitude toward his subjects so typical of the author's day and age. Here we have Noble Savages of the Irish sort, a view we can't help but feel uncomfortable with. But if you're willing to cut through this cultural screen, the places and the people Synge encounters are truly remarkable. Most firmly etched into my mind are scenes of an island funeral, full of bluster and pain, culminating in the mother of the deceased beating on the coffin before it was lowered into the grave, the skull of her own dead mother in her other hand, and a great keening rising from all the women of the island. A strange and amazingly human moment."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian", "userReview": "I first read The Aran Islands when I spent the first semester of my senior year of university in Ireland. I went over in August but the Irish term doesn't begin until September, so for the first month we were there, University College Cork organized a special program for the foreign students. The literature students all read the same books and took the same classes, and in the midst of reading The Aran Islands, we packed up for a trip. After lunch at Ballymaloe and a visit to Coole Park, we stopped in Galway and took a ferry over to Inis Me\u00e1in where we would spend four days. We had class in D\u00fan Chonch\u00fair, sitting on the terraces inside as our professor lectured as we discussed the book, and then spent hours wandering around the low stone walls and paths of the island. Finding Leaba Dhiarmada agus Ghr\u00e1inne, the bed of Diarmuid and Gr\u00e1inne as they fled across Ireland, suddenly after talking to a friend who had been looking for hours and never found it. Visiting the knitwear shop and buying a sweater made from the wool of the sheep we had seen wandering in the island's fields. Staying in a bed and breakfast and listening to the owners speak English to us and Irish to each other. And standing next to Cathaoir Synge, \"Synge's Chair,\" hundreds of feet above the sea, and watching the sun sink down into the ocean in the West. I could well understand what it was that Synge saw in the island and why he wrote so approvingly about it. When I opened the book, a business card fell out for the gentleman at the Bank of Ireland who got me my bank account. Now when I read The Aran Islands, though, I can't help me feel how condescending it seems. Synge views the people of Inis Me\u00e1in as living a pure pastoral life, unspoiled by modernity, with a kind of innate arcadian nobility. Not even the other Aran Islands get as much praise as Inis Me\u00e1in does. But I can't help but notice that the lives of the islanders sound terrible, full of death and grinding poverty. There's one incident where some police from the mainland come over in the service of absentee landlords to perform evictions, and while Synge watches and writes in his notebook about it, the police turn old women out of their homes and the villages laugh as the police try to round up pigs. I couldn't help but imagine Synge, a man who had studied in France and been to Germany, sitting and writing impassively while the people of Inis Me\u00e1in suffered after having been dispossessed of the island that they had lived for generations on.He keeps delivering backhanded insults even while he's trying to complement the people. After one description of a man who knew both Irish and English and took issue with a translation of Moore's Irish Melodies, and was able to quote both the Irish original and the English translation in order to explain his argument, Synge writes:In spite of his singular intelligence and minute observation, his reasoning was medieval.in reference to the man's belief that Irish wouldn't die out on the Aran Islands because of its use in daily industry. Well, the man was right. I've been to Inis Me\u00e1in and passed groups of teenagers speaking Irish amongst themselves, so shows what Synge knows about his reasoning. Later, Synge writes:Although these people are kindly towards each other and to their children, they have no feeling for the sufferings of animals, and little sympathy for pain when the person who feels it is not in danger. I have sometimes seen a girl writhing and howling with toothache while her mother sat at the other side of the fireplace pointing at her and laughing at her as if amused by the sight.Ah, humanity unspoiled by European civilization. It's not that I think Synge is lying here, it's that I think he wants the people of Inis Me\u00e1in to exist as some kind of museum monument to what was. The ancient practices of rural Ireland, still alive on the shores of Atlantic, no matter the cost in men lost at sea, women turned out of their homes, and endless stories about people that Synge doesn't even deign to give a name to in his writings. I'm glad I read this while I was on Inis Me\u00e1in and have those memories to carry me through this reading. I think I would have found it pretty dire otherwise."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7811970-dan", "userReview": "This book is a very dark glimpse into a dying world that once existed through all of human civilization. Fairies and giants and ghost ships are as much a part of these people's real world as is God and the police who come onto the islands to kick people out of their homes.I do wonder, however, what Synge's intention was to portray these people as being so simple. He does admire their skill with the boats but he spends so much time with old men who tell tales that have no point that it's easy to think the whole island lives and thinks as these old men do. Yet the young men, Michael in particular, leaves the islands to find work elsewhere because he knows there is no future on those grey, wet rocks. And the other danger is that we get pulled into a nostalgic portrait of the islands that never really existed outside of the imaginations of these old men.Still, there are moments that are quite beautiful and telling as to how things really are on the Aran Islands. First is the priest, whom we never meet but are always told about braving the rough sees day after day and risking his life as he tends to his flock. Though we never meet this man, I couldn't get the image out of my head of a man dressed in priest's black, standing upright on a small boat tumbling upon the waves in a fierce gale. I would love to have heard his story. The other telling moment was for the funeral of the young man. This was a beautiful and very sad scene where they bury him in the same spot where his grandmother had been buried and they find her skull among the black planks on her coffin. This image, coupled with the young man having lost his head at sea, is a wonderfully confusing image where the nostalgic sensibility of the old is placed on the dead body of the young that can't carry it to any future other than the grave.Perhaps this is why all the stories end with absolutely no point because life is, to them, pointless. Life is hard, the women wear out in childbirth before they're even 20, the men drink and fight and die at sea for a pittance of a catch, or the lucky ones move to America and never come back, their story unfinished."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Hughes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/950284-jennifer-hughes", "userReview": "I have enjoyed listening to this book on cd and the wonderful lilt and cadence of the man reading it, but it seems that there is a visual element to the book that I've missed, since many stories seem to be small snippets and I can't see the visual breaks between when one story ends and another begins.What I have enjoyed most about this book is the way it captures a picture, a moment in time, of the Aran Islands at the end of the 19th century. Some of the stories are fascinating to me and some are boring, but overall, the effect of capturing the moment is wonderful. It reminds me of the way the Little House books so perfectly capture the time and customs and flavor of frontier American life, as lived by the author. Synge is a product of his times, of course, and comes to the subject with what seem to me kind of bizarre biases--just because someone lives on a remote island off the coast of your country it doesn't make them \"savages\"--yet I would argue that his perceptions, although certainly flawed at times, are valid expressions through his perspective.As I listen to this book, I picture the abandoned island in the delightful movie \"The Secret of Roan Inish.\" It's lovely and magical in my mind. I like having that mental image I can bring up as I imagine the people and the stories of long ago. I have the same kinds of feelings as I consider these islands, abandoned and the people and culture erased, as I've had when I have visited real ghost towns--kind of filled with poignancy.I'm glad that Synge took the time to write of his experiences on the Aran Islands to preserve that now-obsolete way of life for us to catch a glimpse of today."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1175951-matt", "userReview": "If you go to the Aran Islands today, you find that a few thousand people live there, mostly tending B&Bs or tourist shops.

(\"The complete absence of shyness or self-consciousness in most of these people gives them a particular charm, and when this young and beautiful woman leaned across my knees to look nearer at some photograph that pleased her, I felt more than ever the strange simplicity of the island life.\" ) He's an anachronism writing about greater anachronisms.But it's a good read. I found two general benefits. First, you do get a sense of what life was like there in the late 19th century \u2013 the fishing, the poverty, the migration.

M. Synge writes in his anthropological-sociological commentary on the Aran Islands off the western coast of Ireland. \u201cThey have the same emotions that I have, and the animals have, yet I cannot talk to them when there is much to say. [\u2026] There is hardly an hour with them that I do not feel the shock of some inconceivable idea, and then again the shock of some vague emotion that is familiar to them and to me. On some days I feel this island as a perfect home and resting place; on other days I feel that I am a waif among the people.\u201dThis is a beautiful selection\u2014perhaps the most literary from the entire book\u2014and speaks volumes about Synge\u2019s complicated relationship to Irishmen and women so far removed from the upper-class Protestant lifestyle with which the famed playwright was familiar in his hometown of Dublin. When amidst the Aran islanders, he is both outsider and insider, no doubt an interloper in this near-medieval culture, yet at the same time more conversant with the islanders than perhaps any other Irish writer before or since his series of visits, which inspired his most famous plays. Perhaps most importantly, Synge takes seriously the notion that he could learn much from the people of Inishmore, Inishmaan, and Inisheer, whom he views as not unlike the erudite artists of Dublin, or London, or Paris, where Synge spent most of his early career. \u201cThe continual passing in this island between the misery of last night and the splendour of today, seems to create an affinity between the moods of these people and the moods of varying rapture and dismay that are frequent in artists,\u201d he writes, as if he sees so much of himself in his flannelled companions. \u201cYet it is only in the intonation of a few sentences or some old fragment of a melody that I catch the real spirit of the island, for in general the men sit together and talk with endless iteration of the tides and fish.\u201d In these latter sorts of conversations, Synge is quite literally at sea. Despite the simplicity of the Aran islanders and their tendency to talk at length about \u201cthe price of kelp in Connemara,\u201d Synge, ostensibly in search of an authentic Irish lifestyle, finds the culture of the islanders far more distinct, and thereby attractive to him, the urbanite, than the stuffy Parisian society from which he hails. For instance, when a number of officials arrive to carry out a series of heartless evictions, Synge expresses clearly his disdain. He writes: \u201cAfter my weeks spent among primitive men this glimpse of the newer types of humanity was not reassuring. Yet these mechanical police, with the commonplace agents and sheriffs, and the rabble they had hired, represented aptly enough the civilization for which the homes of the island were to be desecrated.\u201d Evidently, the civilized, bureaucratic culture of the mainland is not one that Synge admires, and yet it is also a society that the playwright is reluctant to abandon permanently. To be sure, no matter the fluency with which Synge learns to speak Irish, no matter how intimate he becomes with the islanders, who repeatedly invite him into their homes and ask him whether \u201cthere [are] any great wonders in the world at this time,\u201d he is not, and never will be, a son of those desolate, rock-strewn islands at the edge of the western world. \u201cWhen I tried to come home I lost myself among the sandhills, and the night seemed to grow unutterably cold and dejected, as I groped among the slimy masses of seaweed and wet crumbling walls,\u201d Synge writes as he recounts his unfamiliarity with Inishmore in the dark of one bleak night. A pair of islanders, of course, save him from destruction at the unkind hands of nature, which threatens to consume him entirely, as if the wind and the rains and the waves have colluded to obliterate this stranger in a strange land. These fishermen, his friends, however, materialize at the most poignant moment of solitude. \u201cAfter a while I heard a movement in the sand, and two grey shadows appeared beside me. They were two men who were going home from fishing. I spoke to them and knew their voices, and we went home together.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267156-susan", "userReview": "John M. Synge first visited the Aran islands off the west coast of Ireland during the 1890\u2019s to learn Gaelic in a place and culture where it was still spoken. This book crafted from his journals gives a fascinating look at an elemental place and way of life already rapidly changing, but the journals offer only hints of the power, beauty and humor he portrayed in plays like \u201cRiders to the Sea\u201d and \u201cThe Playboy of the Western World.\u201d \u201cNear the middle of the sound the man who was rowing in the bow broke his oar-pin, and the proper management of the canoe became a matter of some difficulty. We had only a three-oared curagh, and if the sea had gone much higher we should have run a good deal of danger. Our progress was so slow that clouds came up with a rise in the wind before we reached the shore, and rain began to fall in large single drops. The black curagh working slowly through this world of grey, and the soft hissing of the rain gave me one of the moods in which we realize with immense distress the short moment we have left us to experience all the wonder and beauty of the world.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sanjeev", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348965-sanjeev", "userReview": "A few of the parts I especially enjoyed...Describing the locals: This impulse to protect the criminal is universal in the west.

To have a first-hand account like this is remarkable. A few summers ago I had the chance to visit one of these islands and the haunting picture in my mind of the hard lives these people lived followed me from shore to shore as I looked at their stony homes and felt the stiff breeze and truly recognized the bleakness of their lives. A great book and one of the last, truly distinct cultures alive in the 20th century before we all dissolved into sitcoms and pop music."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/248358-diana", "userReview": "The old days of 1900, on these islands off the west coast of Ireland, sound wonderful and sad and confusing, all at once. Synge writes in the tradition of the upperclass of his time, with naked condescension toward these traditional people and their folk ways, but at the same time, this well-known Irish author uses language beautifully and shows honest love for them and their rocky islands. I also recommend making the effort to get out there for at least a day, on the ferry from Galway. Ride a pony cart and listen to the Gaelic and English with a unique accent. Before you go, read this book and see the old documentary Men of Aran, too."}], "description": "In 1907 J. M. Synge achieved both notoriety and lasting fame with The Playboy of the Western World. The Aran Islands, published in the same year, records his visits to the islands in 1898-1901, when he was gathering the folklore and anecdotes out of which he forged The Playboy and his other major dramas.Yet this book is much more than a stage in the evolution of Synge the dramatist. As Tim Robinson explains in his introduction, \"If Ireland is intriguing as being an island off the west of Europe, then Aran, as an island off the west of Ireland, is still more so; it is Ireland raised to the power of two.\" Towards the end of the last century Irish nationalists came to identify the area as the country's uncorrupted heart, the repository of its ancient language, culture and spiritual values. It was for these reasons that Yeats suggested Synge visit the islands to record their way of life. The result is a passionate exploration of a triangle of contradictory relationships \u2013 between an island community still embedded in its ancestral ways but solicited by modernism, a physical environment of ascetic loveliness and savagely unpredictable moods, and Synge himself, formed by modern European thought but in love with the primitive.", "title": "The Aran Islands", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/755537.The_Aran_Islands", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348173195l/755537.jpg", "reviews": 57, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4332478.J_M_Synge", "name": "J.M.
