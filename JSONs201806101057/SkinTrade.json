Oh, you've read a lot of zombie books? You know what happens? Hmmm, well...guess again, because Tonia Brown's Skin Trade, shows a new way of living with the undead and it's messed up! Just imagine the already intense horror of living in a world of the undead, now add in that you are attempting to hide that you're actually a girl all while being kidnapped, skinning the flesh of the undead, seducing your captors in order to gain trust and hoping and praying your mentor shows up in time to save you. Pretty crazy stuff, huh? Well that, and so much more, is what we are given when entering the Skin Trade. The character are excellently written with great dialogue that is both witty and thought provoking, at times. Our main character, Sam, is a strong young woman who has been forced to endure much more than any young lady should no matter the time period or the fact that the world has been completely turned upside down with the undead. The dynamic between the various characters was excellently portrayed as characters usually are when under the pen of Tonia Brown and the change in the dynamic is nearly tangible as Sam learns more about those she encounters. Highly detailed and described, the universe of Skin Trade is horrific and brutal. Great lengths are taking to give a vivid and detail description of the landscape and actions of those living in the Badlands. Skin Trade is definitely not a book for the feint of heart. So the verdict is, Tonia Brown's Skin Trade is a \"knock down drag your doggie through the dirt, pour lemon juice on a papercut\" hellava ride.Definitely Doubleshot Reviews approved"}, {"userName": "Jaidis Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4338594-jaidis-shaw", "userReview": "Tonia Brown's writing never ceases to amaze me! Her latest release, Skin Trade, follows the life of Samantha Martin. After being pushed into an unwanted life, Samantha is determined to free herself from her owner's grasp, even if that means masquerading as a boy in the Badlands - a place that is not for the weak. The West has been over run with zombies and their skins quickly became a commodity and so the skin trade was born. The art of trapping and skinning zombies is not only a way to survive (the skins of zombies fetching a nice profit) but the Badlands provide the perfect sanctuary for Samantha to hide. Skin Trade pulled me in from the first page and wouldn't let me go. Samantha is a strong character that I found easy to relate too. She has had a difficult past and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that nobody can control her again. While she has a tough exterior, she still enjoys the feminine pleasures in life like wearing dresses and being treated like a lady. Ms. Brown does a wonderful job at blending the two sides of Samantha, creating a believable character.If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Tonia Brown's writing before, I suggest starting with this one! Skin Trade is engaging, adventurous and refreshing! I strongly encourage Ms. Brown to continue the tale!"}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Skin Trade takes place in the imagined old west where the dead have risen and made much of the country has been left uninhabitable, while the United States remains little more than a sliver of land along the east coast that is zombie-free. Beyond that are the Borderlands, where the government promises new growth and a life for those willing to risk it, though the fear of revenants keeps most people living in squalor out east rather than taking the risk. Beyond the Borderlands are the lands where revenants roam free. That is also where the trappers ply their trade, but it isn\u2019t animals their after.Samantha, a girl who has escaped a wretched life in a brothel down south, has made it to the borderlands where she has disguised herself as a boy so she can go to a workhouse with other boys desperate to find a way to make a living. There she is recruited by a trapper who needs apprentices to learn his trade. Sam realizes that there is great danger in going west, but knows this may be her best chance to put the past behind her and learn a trade that could set her free. But little does she know about all the dark secrets of the skin trade, though she\u2019ll soon find out.Skin Trade is quite an intriguing entry into the zombie pantheon of literature, with the undead see as animals to be slaughtered and skinned for the valuable leather they can offer up. They are dangerous and to be feared, but it is the men who ply this trade who represent the real darkness in this story. Sam is a tough, scrappy young lady who has escaped one horrible life to be potentially thrust right into another, but her adventures are fascinating ones, where she discovers a great deal about herself and her fellow man. Tonia Brown knows how to craft a story, and her fertile imagination does not disappoint, whether it has to do with the undead or steampunk\u2026or both. She is one of the most creative authors out there working her magic on traditional zombie lore, easily intermingling romance, adventure, horror, and intrigue with ease. Skin Trade is no exception. Her characters are vivid, fun, and compelling, her stories always entertaining. Definitely give this one a whirl if you are a fan of zombie lit-it\u2019s a bit different than the traditional apocalyptic tale, and well worth checking out."}, {"userName": "Robert Essig", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6407857-robert-essig", "userReview": "The question is, what would happen in a post apocalyptic world...set in the Wild West? Read Skin Trade by Tonia Brown and find out. You most certainly will not be disappointed.This is more than a horror story set in the west, and certainly more than your average zombie book. In fact, the Great Undead Uprising of 1870 is the perfect backdrop for a tale about a young woman's coming of age through peril, perseverance, and grit. Samantha Martin, our heroine narrator, is one tough cookie!Skin Trade is a well crafted book that will stick with you long after you finish reading it. The characters breathe, they live, and you want to know what happens to them. In a Wild West made only wilder with the onslaught of a zompocalypse, Samantha must be weary and careful with whom she places trust, because she has a secret that is more valuable in the Badlands than the zombie hides harvested in the skin trade, and a past that she desperately wants to get away from."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "I picked this up as a freebie and was AMAZED!Loved the story telling, the edge of your seat narration and general concept.Is it set in the old wild west or in the near future.... hard to tell....We follow young Sam on their journey through hell and high water.... what a character!! a unique take on the zombie genre, does not follow any of your usual expectations.Some gore, some giggles and some true human horror, but in all a great story!really looking forward to reading more from Tonia Brown!"}, {"userName": "Felicia A", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739957-felicia-a", "userReview": "YAYYYYYY!

So with Tonia Brown's horror/western novel, Skin Trade, the bleak and foreboding landscape upon which it is set came as no surprise. That's not to say, however, the book didn't offer a bevy of twists and turns.Centered on a young girl named Samantha Martin, Skin Trade opens up on a workhouse employing young men and boys toiling under a hot sun and grueling taskmaster, bordering the Badlands to the west. The Badlands carry endlessly westward, overrun with the walking dead following some alluded-to cataclysm. Girls are a rare commodity in this backdrop, and as such Samantha disguises herself as a boy to earn her way toiling in the fields and avoiding monstrous advances from the boys and men that surround her. Through her hardships, she is befriended by a boy named Stinky Pete, as the two share in their outcast roles among the other boys. A bit of a Tom and Huck vibe there.Then, Sam and Pete are offered an escape when a man by the name of Boudreaux comes by the fields and recruits them as assistants while he hunts and traps in the Badlands. Dangerous work, but promising in pay. Hopes are quickly dashed though, when Boudreaux's trade and methods and brought to bear, and Sam finds herself in even more danger than what the zombies offer. I mean, how well are things going to end for you when your new job is killing and skinning the undead for their pelts?Skin Trade comes with a discretionary warning to start out, as Tonia warns prospective readers that the nineteenth century was a little less progressive towards those of the female persuasion. Given my surface-level grasp on history, I was expecting this horror novel to offer some downright repellant scenes inflicted upon Sam. However, the story is grim more in its insinuation than anything else. Oh, when the action scenes occur, they are certainly gruesome and gripping, but nothing feels exploitative.Tonia Brown also possesses a keen grasp of her characters, with their mindsets and motivations playing out pitch perfectly. There were moments where I thought Sam might turn into a damsel, especially towards the end when it looked like she'd need to rely on someone else for her own attempts at escape, but if Sam is a princess, she is of the self-saving kind. Heck, it's not like the world she lives in has any real knights coming to her rescue.If you are a fan of weird westerns, you should check this one out. Zombie nuts will have plenty to enjoy, with a really good story that doesn't occupy itself too greatly on shambling hordes as its source of horror. Fainthearted folks may want to steer clear, though I think you'd be missing out. It seems each story Tonia Brown gets a little bit better than the last, so I'll be looking forward to reading more of her work down the line."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1909602-sheri", "userReview": "Skin Trade: A Historical Horror (book 1) Tonia BrownSet is the late 1880's the story takes place after the Great Undead Uprising that destroyed the Western Frontier and Indian nations. The government was able to contain the virus as people all tried to flee to the East. But not everyone headed East.Samantha Martin is doing the opposite, fleeing to the West to escape her horrible life. She disguises herself as Sam a boy in the workhouses in the Badlands. She ends up in the Skin Trades trying to stay alive and keep her gender a secret. Will she be able to stay alive, keep her secret and flee the badlands?An interesting twist on zombie stories, set in the past, during an already difficult Era. The plot is original, with attention to detail, drama, danger, lack of trust, and learning to survive. I got a vivid feel of exactly what was going on, which made the story and edge-of-you seat read.Sam is very likable, she gets to experience the hardships of being a young woman and a young man in this dangerous time. She will be forced to make decisions and not knowing who to trust, just adds to the tension. Overall I found Skin Trade: A Historical Horror and action packed, thrilling read. I recommend to those who love zombies and horror stories."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4301021-laurie", "userReview": "I love zombie books and I love Westerns so when I saw the cover and read the blurb for Skin Trade by Tonia Brown I knew I wanted to read it.

Sam\u2019s sassy wit and intelligence keeps the youngster in trouble, especially after Pete is lost. I loved the alternate history that Tonia created to explain the zombie infestation \u2013 it made sense in an evil, conspiratorial way that I easily bought into.
