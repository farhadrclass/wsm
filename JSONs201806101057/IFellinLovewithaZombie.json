It gives me a shiver down the spine to read about just how close society is to total melt-down. When I was a teen I loved John Wyndam's books, especially Day of the Triffids and other post-apocalyptic books such as Death of Grass by John Christopher. Why am I telling you all this, you may ask? Well, just that this novella by one of my favourite m/m authors fits exactly into that 'recovery and survival in the face of disaster' mould that can be found in books by John Wyndam. Unsurprisingly, I loved this book.I Fell in Love with a Zombie begins with our hero and first person narrator, Jay, coping with the aftermath of a swine flu virus which has wiped out most of the world, including his lover, Mike. Not only that, but some people who have supposedly died of the flu come back to life after a couple of days. These 'zombies' have limited speech and motor skills, but most horrifying of all, for no reason they attack humans with a lightening speed and superhuman strength. Jay battles with grief over Mike and the unknown fate of his family as well as surviving in a world littered with dead bodies and zombies who want to kill him. In desperation, Jay decides to leave the city in search of other humans. On the way he encounters many dangerous situations, not all due to zombies, and finds love in an unexpected place.As I said earlier, I loved this book. It contains many classic elements which can be found in post-apocalyptic survival books and I was delighted every time I came across one of these well loved parts in the story. Firstly, there was the theme of survival with Jay having to do things that he would never have done otherwise. At the beginning of the book Jay recounts the first time he had to kill a zombie who was attacking him. At the end of the account he says:Was this what my life was going to be from now on? It was enough to make me wish I had died with everybody else.It's not only rampaging zombies, Jay also has to cope with other survivors, never knowing who to trust, and yet desperate for some contact to ease his loneliness. In some ways these scenes were the hardest to read as Jay is treated badly by those with whom he hopes to find some companionship. It was heartbreaking. Jay's loneliness is a constant presence throughout the first part of the book as he tries to come to terms with the fact that his life has been overturned in less than a month.Another theme which I enjoyed is that of the journey that the hero has to take to find some semblance of peace. Jay travels from town to town by taking a discarded car and driving it until the petrol runs out. On the way he encounters different situations before finding someone with whom he can settle. Even then life isn't easy for Jay and Dave, and it isn't long before they have to continue their journey. This gave the book a pacey feel as the setting moves from place to place with our heroes. It also meant that there was a lot of action in the book which counterbalanced the slower parts as Jay muses on what has happened to him, and the section where he and Dave meet and begin to fall in love.Given what I've written above you might think that this would be a maudlin and slightly depressing read. Whilst parts of it were undoubtedly sad, as Jay copes with his grief and life alone, Jay is actually quite an optimistic character, with a strong sense of purpose. This injected the story with a bright shaft of hopefulness as Jay moves on from each difficult situation in the hope that the next situation will have a more positive outcome. I liked Jay a great deal, liked his willingness to see the best in others, even when they treated him badly and his pragmatism that life must go on, so make the best of what you have. As narrators go, Jay is incredibly sympathetic and likeable and this went a long way towards my great enjoyment of the book.One word of warning for those of a slightly squeamish nature. There are several gruesome parts in the story, especially those involving Jay and the zombies. Personally, I felt this fit well with the genre of the book and I'm not particularly squeamish and so those bits didn't bother me at all. I liked that the author hadn't chosen to wash over some of the more unpleasant aspects of life within a time of chaos, such as the stench of rotting bodies or the sorrow that whole families lay unburied. I also liked the depiction of the zombies, that they were disgusting and brutal, but also that, for some at least, there was a trace of humanity.Whilst reading this book I experienced a whole wealth of emotion. At some points I felt genuinely frightened, at other points angry. I felt joy and happiness for Jay and Dave, but also sadness for them - even crying at one point. I completed the book feeling overwhelmed, knowing that I'd read something extremely well written, that moved me. If you like sci-fi, horror and stories set in a post apocalyptic future, then this book is an absolute must. I thought it was bloody brilliant."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "WOW.That was the first word that came out from my mouth after I finished this novella. Sean Kennedy is one author that I keep my eyes on (ever since I discovered \"Tigers and Devils\"). When he mentioned about writing a different kind of 'love story' that involved zombie, I have been wondering how it would turned out. And who boy, did he deliver.It was a world after most of world's population was swiped away by Swine Flu. At the same time, without ogical explanation, some of the deads were also being brought to life as zombies. The narrator of this person, Jay, was one of the survivors. In a world that was desolate - where he must fight to survives, including killing brutal zombies if necessary, Jay met the one zombie that he never would have expected. His first love, Dave. But Dave wasn't like the other zombies. He somehow still had a spark of humanity in himself, despite the fact that he was no longer alive. Now Jay was faced with the fact -- was this a second chance for him? Even if it was in the most unacceptable situation?I won't even classify this as a love story. This is more like a futuristic/sci-fi short literature. Like reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\" (which was good but too bleak for my taste). Like watching \"Blindness\". I feel that the theme is actually humanity and survival. While heartbreaking at one parts, brutally honest at the other, it also carries some hope in the end -- as Jay and Dave embraced the uncertainty of the future with a distant promise. It was really, REALLY EXCELLENT story. Hats off to you, Mr. Kennedy"}, {"userName": "ttg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1629211-ttg", "userReview": "Excellent dystopian zombie love story. Kennedy keeps his storytelling tight and his pacing fast in this short novella about pandemic survivor Jay who is moving from haven to haven as he tries to stay ahead of the \"zombies\" that wander the streets. Then one day, he's rescued from a swarm of violent zombies by another zombie, one that he soon recognizes as Dave, a man who was once his lover. But that's not the only surprise for Jay, as he realizes there's more to the zombie epidemic than he ever realized.Very smooth, unburdened writing that had underlying threads of both tension and melancholy--tension for being on the run and melancholy since both Jay and Dave lost loved ones in the pandemic, and realistically, even as they try to survive, those past relationships still ghost their present. But they're both \"living\" in this new reality, and reforming a connection, and that connection is the heart of the story. (Ironic that out of the three people Jay meets in the story, Dave the \"zombie\" exhibits the most compassion.) I also liked Kennedy's twist on zombies, both different from the general zombie lore, and similar. (You get shambling, you get 28 days later speed, and you get Kennedy's spin.)Great read, and overall not *too dark* considering the subject matter, which I liked. My only beef is that I wish it were longer since it would be interesting to see where things go from here. (This is understandably a very HFN story.)"}, {"userName": "Kassa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095317-kassa", "userReview": "I Fell in Love with a Zombie is a funny, witty, clever, and seriously entertaining story. It\u2019s a cross between Shawn of the Dead with the hopeful, somewhat neurotic, but very likable first person narrator and the setting is close to a classic post-apocalyptic movie like 28 Days. The beginning of the story describes the setting and how zombies evolved from a swine flu like virus. The deserted buildings, lack of food, barricading shelters, and sense of extreme loneliness all harkened to the opening scenes of 28 Days for me. It\u2019s creepy, scary, and very believable. From there the narrator in Jay takes on a hopeful, almost wistful, tone as he describes how he came to be alone and his thought process in where to go and what to do. He travels from the city to a small town and happens to meet up with his ex-boyfriend, who is now a zombie. But unlike any zombie Jay has known and he\u2019s not sure what that means. Figuring out not only what Dave is capable of but what Jay feels about it has some truly inspired moments. I literally laughed out loud several times, such as when Jay is mentally grumbling that zombie Dave is walking away. Oh. I was being abandoned again. Did he just want to get the last word in? That was so fucking like Dave.Alongside the entertaining elements is the very real isolation and danger of their predicament. Not only is Jay dealing with finding an ex and some unresolved issues around that, but they\u2019re also dealing with other zombies, paranoid survivalists, and the real question of how to survive. This mixture of lighthearted humor, quick pace, great comic timing, and a realistic, dramatic setting all combine to give a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying story. Additionally there are moments of extreme violence but again, it reminded me of the ultimate in zombie comedy. So the scenes didn\u2019t feel gruesome even as limbs and blood are flying, but more so exaggerated for comic effect. Honestly that worked rather well as I thoroughly enjoyed Jay\u2019s take on his surroundings and fights with zombies. He\u2019s witty with a dry sense of humor that mixes well with the moments of stark fear, loneliness, and sickness at the world around him. He\u2019s instantly likable and fun to follow along with whether he\u2019s figuring out what to do or rationalizing his feelings. I can\u2019t remember when the last time was I had such fun reading a story and hated to see it end. There\u2019s even a mild sex scene thrown in but I\u2019ll leave it up to readers to figure out how a zombie and a human make it work. It\u2019s definitely worth the few dollars and time to read this gem."}, {"userName": "Heller", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4975636-heller", "userReview": "[leave the farm.

I love that he runs the gamut from desperate to survive, to pleased with himself for figuring out how to hotwire a car, to disgusted with himself for his first sexual encounter in ages, to hopeful (eventually.)The atmosphere and setting very zombie-movie-like, so zombie movie fans will definitely enjoy it. One thing the book was able to touch on that the movies don't is the inner turmoil of being a regular person who has to kill someone else to survive.The love interest is a surprise and a delight, and though he has very few lines, he's infused with a funny and disturbing pathos. He could very nearly have stolen the show, but he's handled adeptly so he doesn't.I do hope there's a sequel.

I adore Sean Kennedy\u2019s writing and I love his sense of humor, also present in this very unusual story. The premise of I Fell in Love with a Zombie intrigued me immediately when I read the backblurb. I was curious how zombies could have a place in a romance story. It seemed an impossibility, because I\u2019m one of those soppy romance readers who need a HEA or at least a HFN (Happy For Now) and I just couldn\u2019t see it happening with a zombie. But I guess Sean Kennedy did make it happen. Sort of. The ending can be seen as a HFN. Although I\u2019m not quite convinced yet about their HEA. But I bet, if Mr. Kennedy decides to write a sequel to Jay\u2019s and Dave\u2019s story, he can make me believe in a happily ever after for these guys if he wants to. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to write a romantic love story. I can\u2019t really tell for sure. It\u2019s not very romantic what\u2019s happening in Jay\u2019s and Dave\u2019s life but rather gruesome and horrific. Yet, a love story it is. Or isn\u2019t it? Jay and Dave were lovers a long time ago and Jay considers Dave as the one that got away. And even when Dave can\u2019t talk much, being a zombie and all, his behavior shows he cares for Jay. If we consider this a romance story then at least it isn\u2019t a conventional one, that\u2019s for sure.Does it really matter? Not much, especially when we look at the other qualities of this novella. While reading the first pages - about the beginning of this incredible apocalyptic disease - I Fell in Love with a Zombie reminded me of a novel from Jos\u00e9 Saramago called Blindness. Here we also see a rapid spreading epidemic, which, in Saramago\u2019s case, makes everyone blind. In Sean Kennedy\u2019s novella it\u2019s a swine flu like virus that causes people to die quickly and some of them to return as zombies. Both stories show a fascination with how people will behave when put in extreme situations, when conventional rules of behavior don\u2019t seem to apply any longer. Where Saramago\u2019s novel turns into a more moralistic lesson on human behavior in general, Kennedy\u2019s novella focuses mainly on the feelings and events of one individual who tries to survive and entertain hope for a better future. But both stories make you wonder how you would behave in an extreme situation like this. With a few strokes of his pencil Sean Kennedy paints a very believable and realistic threat to our modern society. And that realistic picture relentlessly invites a \u2018what if\u2019 question.One of the other qualities of this story is the way it\u2019s voiced through Jay in a first person POV. I enjoyed Jay\u2019s narrative voice almost as much as Simon\u2019s from Tigers and Devils. Jay\u2019s view-point on things is witty, toned down and light. It makes all the horror bearable and even comical thanks to the way he describes the violent and gruesome occurrences. His voice makes this story a hopeful story. And I adore how Jay is interpreting Dave\u2019s behavior; sometimes with so much humor I had to laugh out loud.But the choice for this one-sided point of view in first person also means no insight at all in Dave\u2019s thoughts and feelings, aside from Jay\u2019s interpretations in that regard. Somehow Dave\u2019s (absent) point of view seems so incredible intriguing to me. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to have a peek inside the head of a zombie, right? And maybe Dave\u2019s POV would\u2019ve added something that could\u2019ve made me believe easier in their HEA. I guess, to convince me now, only a sequel to I Fell in Love with a Zombie will help... Just so Mr Kennedy knows what I\u2019d like. ;)In short, I really enjoyed I Fell in Love with a Zombie because of the wit and lightness of Jay\u2019s narrative voice and the originality of the story\u2019s setting and vision on society. The message of hope that spoke louder than the horrid events and the unusual communication between the heroes added to my appreciation. However, as a romantic story I found this novella was not completely convincing. I guess I need to know more about how a human and a zombie are going to work out their differences and their communication problems to believe in a happy future for Jay and Dave. It\u00b4s because they are such intriguing characters, that I would happily read a complete novel about them. So, do zombies and romance match? I think they can, actually. Mr. Kennedy has shown me it\u2019s not completely impossible. In fact, he has me wishing for a sequel to Jay\u2019s and Dave\u2019s story that I would buy and devour as soon as it would hit the shelves of the ebook store.Linking:Sean Kennedy\u2019s website | blog | on Twitter| on Facebook | on GoodreadsBuy \nI Fell in Love with a Zombie\n hereOther books by this author:Tigers and Devils - one of my all time favorite m/m romances, check out why hereDash and Dingo: In Search of the Tasmanian Tiger, written with Catt FordWings of Equity (steampunk novel, released last week)For a complete list of Sean Kennedy\u2019s short stories go hereThis review was originally published at my blog."}, {"userName": "Serena Yates", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2798257-serena-yates", "userReview": "I liked this story because it carries a message of hope. Not just hope for humankind after a pandemic destroys society as we know it, but hope for those deemed \"unacceptable\" by the survivors.The main character and narrator of the story, Jay, changes from totally anti-Zombie to a more considered point of view. This is very difficult for him, because the Zombies are not really seen as human by anyone. They become violent at the drop of a hat, and nobody can figure out what causes it. Most people's response is sadly a very human one - kill that which you do not understand.When Jay runs into his ex-lover, Dave, who has turned into a Zombie, something triggers recognition in Dave - and Jay discovers that underneath the apparent lack of brainpower something human may remain.

No one will say, 'oh hey, he's a zombie, I bet he's one of the nice ones', the more realistic reaction would be shoot first apologize later. For that same reason the ending left me feeling sad.

I think I brought this mainly to see how in gods name he\u2019d make a Zombie into a sexorin fest\u2026 without appendages falling off during important, intimate moments. This was a totally cool read and I cannot believe he made a zombie seem sexy. I mean, ewww! The story was nicely paced with loads of great world building and plenty of scope to maybe write more. Zombies, true love and an apocalyptic world.http://sharrow.wordpress.com/2010/07/..."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2665212-penny", "userReview": "I loved this short story. It's about Jay. One of the few survivors of a virus that has spread across the world. Unfortunately not all the victims stayed dead, but turn into Zombies. Yes, even a past lover.So it's a zombie, horror, adventure, love story.It's not your typical m/m romance novel. It's not for the faint of heart, but it is a wonderful touching romantic short story. It just has a zombie in it and a bit of gore thrown in.Sean Kennedy has done it again!!!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Worrall", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5080742-lisa-worrall", "userReview": "I totally loved this story.
