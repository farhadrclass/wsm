I accidentally stumbled across Liars and Losers Like Us when I downloaded the Kindle app on my new iPad and checked what was in my cloud that I had forgotten about. I swear I only meant to read the first chapter, just to get a feel for the book... and then it was two & a half hours later and I was crying 'cause it was over. I don't know what, exactly, it was about this story but I loved it. It was exactly the sort of story I needed at the time. It's simple but sweet. The writing was easily readable and the romance was not only swoon-worthy but completely adorable. It made me melt into a nice, warm puddle of gooey feels. Bree was a realistic, relatable protagonist - and you know that that is my favourite thing to have in a contemporary! She had a great sense of humour (honestly laughed way too many times out loud in this story) and an honest, warm personality. I loved (as terrible as this will sound) that she struggled with anxiety. It made her a more wholesome character and was a natural reaction to the stuff she had to go through. It was well-written, not just a plot tool used for drama like I was scared of.The relationships in this book were also really well-written. Romance can be a bit of a hit-or-miss, but Bree & Sean's gradual relationship was just heart-warmingly adorable. It made me laugh and cry and feel all those good feels that you want to. I loved the friendship played a really important part in this book too, and that Bree had a healthy female best-friendship - too often female friendship become catty and overly dramatized in contemporaries, but this was completely realistic.Also, on a sidenote, this book gets props for diversity. Our MC is Mexican-America so there's an interracial romance, as well as some exploration into mental illness (anxiety) and at least three characters that were gay, lesbian and/or bisexual. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this book if you love simple but sweet contemporary romances with realistic protagonists, a sweet, slow-building romance and both heart-warming and hilarious scenes. It was quick, fun and easy to fly through. I'm impressed that this was only the author's debut and will definitely hold out for more of works.Review copy provided by Sky Pony Press for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sarah Glenn Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25052916-sarah-glenn-marsh", "userReview": "I've had the privilege of reading PROM BITCH as Ami's critique partner, and I can't wait to read it again!

To express all my feels and smother them with praise. I hardly ever do it because #shyness, but this time I came close. So close that I even have the draft and everything. SO VERY CLOSE in fact that I actually DM'ed Ami on Twitter, emoji hearts and all (hey, everything is easier on Twitter!). Because guys, I had to. You cannot just read this book and not let her know how wonderful and fantastic it truly is.I also cannot stop myself from telling you all today or the day you get to read these words about how much you need Liars and Losers Like Us in your life. Because Liars and Losers Like Us is beyond glorious and beautiful and heartbreaking and funny and so many other wonderful things that I just can't find the exact words to do it justice.It rocked. I loved it. It's special. A clear 2016 favorite. I know it's a bit early to say that but when you read a book as amazing as Liars and Losers Like Us, you just know it. And with this book, I felt it. From page one. I felt the characters. I adored Bree, I fell for Sean, I laughed with all the jokes and light banter from all the characters. It's been so many books ago since I've loved characters like the ones found in here.Oh, but that feeling I got as the story moved forward. It felt as if someone was cutting off my air because the tension, the not knowing and ultimately the break of my heart had me pretending I was fine whenever my mom would ask, when I was actually trying to dry away tears.I loved how this book balances light and heavy themes appropriately. I won't talk much about them because I don't want to spoil it more than the blurb already does (don't you run off to read again!) but I will say this: it was brave of the author to write and share with us more about these topics that are so serious and important, that need to be discussed more and make us more aware of how much our actions can affect other people's lives. Even when it's all fun and games.But enough about my thoughts!

And she does so in a way that not only feels realistic but tells the story in a way that you want to read it. There were some pacing things I wasn't a fan of, as I thought part of it dragged a little bit. However, this didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the story. The other thing was that there were some characterizations that left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth when it came to how Bree described other girls (and while it was realistic, it was still a little eh). I liked that I went into this expecting a light-hearted contemporary novel but that Allen-Vath gave us something so much more than that. I think the change was one that everyone needs to read. It is nice to have a light, fluffy contemporary novel, but it is also great to have something that has a bit more to it than that.

Although there are a lot of ups and downs with each character and mainly with Bree (Breeze), you still feel the love the author has for both the characters and her story.Sprinkled with a love story, tragedy (which defines most of the book, even at the beginning when we, as readers, don't even know it yet).

Topics like depression, suicide, popularity and other issues teenagers have to face in a single book. And while all that is going on as well, there\u2019s a massive fuss about prom. I was a little nervous because I wondered how this book was possibly going to cram all of that into its pages, but somehow it managed it, and managed it perfectly.At the beginning of the book, I did struggle quite a lot. The main character isn\u2019t exactly a nice person. Bree can be mean, and really annoying sometimes. But that\u2019s the way it is supposed to be. The point is that just like everyone else, even the popular people can be cruel and hurt and have emotions too. Even though there were times when I didn\u2019t like her (which I struggled with at the beginning) in time I also came to really like her, and she develops into a better person as well. I was worried I was going to be the black sheep here but if you find her character trying, I think it\u2019s worth pushing through this one.But as well as knowing that Bree is mean, there are other mean girls in this novel, and mean guys too. But for every time a character is mean, Allen-Vath also then goes to show us why and we can\u2019t help but feel for these characters over. The truth is, things are tough all over and people are just trying to get by. Maybe we don\u2019t all agree with the means by which they do that. But that\u2019s for you to make up your mind about as you read.Divorce is a big theme in this book because Bree\u2019s parents break up. Although it isn\u2019t the spotlight of the book, it isn\u2019t in the backseat either and I think that the book did a brilliant job of portraying just enough light on the subject for us to understand the situation and what was happening because of it. Another important theme was bullying. Bree falls into the character of a bystander. We can hardly blame her for it because it\u2019s the position that most likely, we would fall into ourselves in such a case. But when the bullying pushes the victim into committing suicide, the tables turn. Bree really feels the backlash from the situation and it gets her thinking and putting a lot of things into perspective. Her outlook on life changes and it\u2019s very deep. It really did speak to me.As well as that, there is a very cute romance to keep readers entertained that was handled perfectly. There wasn\u2019t any insta love or silly drama that could annoy us. There was a lot of drama about prom but something I loved about Bree was that she didn\u2019t care whether she got a crown or not. She didn\u2019t need that to justify herself in the slightest.When a novel handles all the difficult topics perfectly.Cheating is something that happens quite a bit in this novel. Cheating really bothers me and it\u2019s something horrible to do to someone who really cares about you. It broke my heart to read about it, and even made me angry at times \u2013 but the point is that it really does back up the theme of the novel that all comes together in the end.And my is the end the perfect summary to the novel.Reading the author\u2019s note (which is something I recommend you ALL do) lets us know she was a victim of some of the same abuse that the girl who commits suicide went through. It\u2019s a very serious matter and the fact that she is writing about it and spreading awareness on what must be such a personal issue for her really does reach out to me. Which is why I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone.This review and others can be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: http://olivia-savannah.blogspot.nl/20..."}, {"userName": "R\u00ea ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20161526-r", "userReview": "3.5 \"Prom can be a real nightmare\" STARSARC via Edelweiss - Thank you, Sky Pony Press!!* Trigger warning: this book talks about suicide and bullying. *Bree Hughes is the first main character to make my 2016 \"unlikable character\" list. Oh, well, Bree, this is another title to add to your list. ;-)Jokes aside, this book touched a lot of sensitive topics, such as bullying, sexual abuse and suicide, all while following the MC's quest to becoming the next Prom Queen - sort of -- and a better person.And while I can't say I fell in love with her throughout her journey, I can't also deny she did come to be a better version of herself by the end. Bree grew as a person, and character development is something I'm always glad to see.To be honest, I find it hard to summarize the plot because I thought there wasn\u2019t much of it. This is definitely not a plot-driven novel. But here's what I'm taking from this story:Bree is a seventeen-year-old whose parents have recently gotten a divorce and who has a huge crush on Sean, a cute quarterback, which explains why she spends most of her time thinking and daydreaming about him. Other than those two things, Bree is also defined by her friendship with Kallie and their nomination to be part of the Prom Court. Well, you see, there's nothing distinctive about Bree. If you take out the names and replace them by others, Bree could be anyone: divorced parents, crush on cute boy, a best friend and prom queen aspirations -- it describes so many girls, but no one specific, if that makes sense. Truth is, I missed knowing something about her that made Bree her own persona. Maybe a hobby would've sufficed. Anything to make her stand out. Anything \"nice\" that would make me ignore how bitchy she sounded at times.One thing I can say: Bree wasn't someone I'd want to be friends with. First, she could be really whiny. Second, she wasn't the best of friends to her best friend. Third, she sucked at communicating and prolonged confrontation for longer than necessary, because shenever wanted to be the one to first admit she was wrong. And while all of that makes her just another teenager (come on, you were probably like that, too), it doesn't make for a likable MC.For those reasons, I thought the side characters made much better MCs than Bree. While Kallie wasn't anything special either (her attitude toward her BFF and her BF made me roll my ways countless times), Jane and Maisey were distinctive enough to steal the scene. They were both complex and messed up people, which made them \"richer\" characters. Their life stories were intriguing enough that they practically kept the book interesting and the characters moving, even though this was supposed to be all about Bree's life and choices. Even Bree's biggest arc was related to Maisey and Jane's decisions.The romance was pretty cute. For some reason I kept expecting Sean to turn into this asshole that would do something terrible to hurt Bree, but although there was an incident, I can't really say it was entirely his fault. The relationship between Bree and Sean was more of a quiet, but still cute one. I personally didn't feel that fire or passion that takes over every sense, but that's okay. It doesn't always have to be like that. It can be quiet AND beautiful.Hmmm, quiet is a good word to describe this novel. Like I said, there wasn't a crazy plot, the pacing didn't make me turn page after page desperately or anything like that, but the characters (especially Jane and Maisey) kept the story going and I was glad I got to read this."}, {"userName": "Rhea Dsouza", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19034087-rhea-dsouza", "userReview": "Where the synopsis promises drama, heartbreak, grief, and even swoons, Liars And Losers Like Us unfortunately failed to deliver.This book was a huge, huge\u00a0disappointment to me. \u00a0You see, according to the blurb, when Maisey, a student from her school commits suicide, protagonist Bree Hughes tries to deal with the guilt of not having helped Maisey when she could, and deals with her grief alongside her boyfriend Sean Mills. \u00a0But what I got was a flimsy portrayal of Maisey being bullied, her tragic suicide that only felt like a plot device, and a long-ass speech at the senior prom that felt as forced as it was unnecessary.The book which should have been about the impact of a fellow student\u2019s suicidal on a school community was actually a 240 page long discussion on how much more important prom was than anything else on the planet. \u00a0I\u2019ve been a teenager and I\u2019ve been to dances, and thankfully, I know for a fact that teens really aren\u2019t as shallow as this book showed them to be. \u00a0The mention of Maisey\u2019s suicide was used in inside jokes even after\u00a0her death, which seemed like something not even the most immature of teens would do.The other thing that this book was chock full of was high school drama that was petty and confusing and absolutely pathetic. \u00a0It read like a monologue on exactly how not\u00a0to spend your time in high school, and I was very very surprised at the utter ridiculousness of some of their conversations. \u00a0It got to a point where I had to stop, take a little break, skip a few pages ahead and then continue reading.The love interest, Sean, was a one-dimensional, static character, who, in my opinion, featured way too much in this book. \u00a0He was the textbook book boyfriend (plays the guitar, smells good, doesn\u2019t push for sex, loves the girl in a month\u2019s time) and all of his clich\u00e9 attributes made me irritable every time he opened his mouth to speak. \u00a0And sharing classes with Maisey was one thing, this guy didn\u2019t even acknowledge that one of his classmates was dead.Definitely one book you can go without reading this year.I was provided a free review copy by Sky Pony Press through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.

THIS DOES NOT AFFECT MY VIEWS OR OPINIONS ABOUT IT IN ANY WAY. Liars and Losers Like Us is a touching romance novel with a lot of teenage drama.Bree Hudges is a typical 17 year old girl. Prom is coming up at her school, and that means a lot of drama for everyone. When the class nerd, Maisey, who is constantly being teased, steps down from her prom court nomination, she lets Bree take her place. A few days later, Maisey commits suicide. Bree is confused about that, but she also has other things on her mind. Sean Mills, the hot boy in the class, starts going out with her. Will they make it to prom as a couple? Will they win prom court nomination?There is a lot of drama in this book. That may irritate some people, but most teenager's lives are full of drama. It makes it more interesting and realistic.This book starts out kind of slow, with a lot of teenage angst. However, as it progresses, it becomes more action packed and exciting. The ending fits with the book perfectly, and winds up all the loose ends from during the story. The love story has a few love triangles with Bree's best friend.Once I got to about 50% through the book, I couldn't stop reading. I finished it in no time, and had a hard time putting it down.The writing style in this book is similar to that of Meg Cabot and Sarah Dessen. The book deals with sensitive topics such as sex, divorce, and suicide. However, it does it in a lighter way. Liars and Losers Like Us also has a descriptive style that shows the main characters emotion.The characters in this book are pretty cool. Sean sounds like he would be the perfect boyfriend, and he might be on my list of dream book-boyfriends. He is supportive and overall kind. Bree is a moody teenager who doesn't quite know where she belongs. Sometimes these characters, as well as the scenarios, seem stereotypical. Overall, this book shows sensitive topics in a lighter fashion, making it a deeper young adult read that will leave readers engaged."}, {"userName": "Bailee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50826208-bailee", "userReview": "I\u2019ve always found it interesting to see how authors choose to portray things like high school and bullying. It certainly is a common thread within YA novels and I feel like everyone has a different take on the impact of those two entities. First, high school is either an exciting experience filled with new adventures or it is the epicenter of some of the most traumatizing moments. Second, bullying is something that is either at the forefront of the novel, in the subtext, or discussed but never really dealt with. This novel handles both topics in an interesting way, where neither necessarily appears to be the main focus of the novel. Yet, the author masterfully entwines the two subjects with a secret that is far more earth-shattering than I expected. Bree, who is the main character, is not the individual who has to deal with the brunt of the issue of bullying, neither does high school pose as an archenemy that she must defeat. Rather, it is her going against herself as she struggles to accept, deal with, and inevitably confront the issues she finds herself faced with. In fact, she often prefers to run from the problems in her life rather than deal with the reality that surrounds her. Bree frequently avoids issues, which leads to the disintegration of friendships, relationships, and even self-confidence. Yet, by the end, she manages to find her voice \u2014 find her strength and handle the most prominent issue of all: whether or not she is a good person. In many ways, she is a bully by default because she never speaks up, and she is more lucky in high school than those she watches every day. This is a privilege that she never asked for, but will have to confront over the course of the novel. In the end, she becomes the most powerful voice against bullying \u2014 not because she\u2019s been bullied herself but because she finally sees that being silent makes her just as complicit. The next character I want to talk about is Maisey Morgan because even though she isn\u2019t \u201cin\u201d the story for all that long, her personage haunts the narrative so much that it is hard to escape her. In some ways, she becomes this individual who is both perfected by her suicide, and misunderstood because no one ever tried to understand her. The bullying that she faces at school prove to be the tip of the iceberg for her and this just further solidifies her role as the most important character in the novel. Truthfully, if I took into account just Bree\u2019s plot, it would not be an extremely unique novel. I probably would have stopped reading just after I began, mainly because it feels somewhat cookie cutter. Yet, the addition of Maisey takes the novel to another level, something with a moral to really understand. I am glad that this book proved to be more than just another high school love story, and that it took on some darker themes. It is subtle throughout the novel, but by the end, you\u2019ll be wondering why you didn\u2019t think of it first."}, {"userName": "Julia's", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20271963-julia-s", "userReview": "damnnnnn. this book's ending touched on a great subject, but i do wish the author touched on the subject earlier in the book. the romance in this book was once of the greatest, i loved how cute the couple was and how Bree (the main character) didn't focus her entire life onto the boy, like many other contemporary romances. one of my favorite things about this book was how each character was dimensional, and had their own issues."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7263033-emily", "userReview": "[ suicide, sexual abuse, anxiety; the suicide and sexual abuse are NOT depicted on page, but the characters are dealing with the fall out in a nuanced way throughout.

I got a copy from YA Books Central for review.Diversity Rating: 3 \u2013 Closer to RealityRacial-Ethnic: 2 (Bree is Mexican through her father and talks about it openly; a minor character named Brian Wang has a Chinese surname but never sees his identity confirmed otherwise)QUILTBAG: 1 (Brian is gay; a minor character/friend of Bree\u2019s named Sam is a lesbian or bi and I forgot to note which)Disability: 2 (Bree goes to a therapist about her panic attacks; Maisey\u2019s letter to Bree indicates Maisey had her own mental health problems before her death)Intersectionality: 4 (see all the above; does intersectionality very well, especially for the limited presence)In high school, I skipped out on prom both junior and senior year. I don\u2019t regret it. Though I\u2019m all about prom dresses, I\u2019m a wallflower at heart and I knew it wasn\u2019t anything I wanted to do. That doesn\u2019t stop me from reading prom-centric books a la Liars and Losers Like Us, though. For me, it\u2019s something that\u2019s more fun to experience as a viewer than as a participant! Of all the prom-centric books I\u2019ve spent time reading, Liars and Losers Like Us comes across as one I\u2019ll remember for a long time.If you\u2019re a big fan of John Hughes films like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, then Liars and Losers Like Us will work perfectly for you. It features a cast of eclectic personalities, slice-of-life events that tap into the values and lives of modern teenagers, and we even get a homage through Bree\u2019s last name being Hughes! That last point might not have been intentional, but I just made it part of the canon. Hughes\u2019s films could be a bit annoying and overwhelmed by privilege at times, but Allen-Vath avoids that pitfall deftly with conversations like Bree discussing how people treat her once they learn she\u2019s Mexican.Anyway, Bree makes for a fine narrator and her romance with guitar-playing quarterback Sean is as believable as it is incredibly cute\u2013and the two are such compatible dorks that you\u2019ll be grinning at their banter. Even with that, another character steals the spotlight: Maisey. After years of being bullied and being joke-nominated to the prom court, Maisey commits suicide halfway through the book. A letter she leaves behind for Bree leaves the girl reeling.In another book, Maisey would be defined only by Bree\u2019s impressions of her and someone\u2019s philosophizing about how no one will ever understand her now that she\u2019s gone. That\u2019s not how Liars rolls. That her death comes only halfway through and Bree is able to see the aftermath of her death allows for a clear picture of who Maisey was and what led her to her decision. Most appropriately, Maisey has the final word; the novel ends with her letter to Bree. That letter makes it easier to understand what Maisey went through and might just make the reader into a better person.Though Maisey\u2019s death is handled well, it creates mood whiplash when combined with the subplots related to Bree\u2019s romance and her preparation for prom. We\u2019ll go from nearly laughing at characters\u2019 banter to thinking about Maisey, creating a hiccup that can be powerful enough to make readers put the book down for a bit. The pacing is uneven with a mild stumble of a start, a deeply compelling middle, and a sixty-page stretch before the climax that slows things down again. Though the mood whiplash accurate depicts how life can be when someone we vaguely know commits suicide, it doesn\u2019t make for a novel that\u2019s easy to read in one sitting.There are questions left unanswed as well, such as what exactly has gone on in Jane\u2019s life to make her such a horrible person. We get hints toward it, but it isn\u2019t as developed as it could be. Similarly, cracks are visible in Kallie and Bree\u2019s friendship, but they aren\u2019t properly addressed. For instance, Kallie deliberately keeps Bree in the dark about her (Kallie\u2019s) mom\u2019s health, but Bree never pursues it after she finds out about the lie. Casual ableism in the form of \u201ccrazy\u201d being overused as a descriptor may bother some readers as well.(However, it\u2019s worth noting that Ami Allen-Vath is very open about her time spent in psychiatric hospitals as a patient. The ableism is there solely for the sake of capturing teen language. Just worth noting if that\u2019s triggering for you or it\u2019s not something you can handle at certain times.)Liars and Losers Like Us is like a John Hughes film updated for modern audiences and put in book form, but even that isn\u2019t an apt enough description. It\u2019s just good. I connected to it and enjoyed it more than any other prom-related book and it\u2019s just tiny enough to be prime reread material during a reading slump. I\u2019m quite happy to recommend it to readers who want a solid contemporary YA with a classic feel."}, {"userName": "Jacquelyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7822663-jacquelyn", "userReview": "I was given access to an e-ARC of this book from Sky Pony Press on Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Hmm.. I was expecting to like this more than I did. I sort of was expecting a lighter and more happy contemporary but in the end, it really wasn't. There were fluffy parts but this book deals with some really tough topics as well, which in the end I came to appreciate.For this being so short, it felt much longer than it is. It was really drawn out and it felt repetitive. The characters annoyed me and I didn't have any connection or investment in them.The plot wasn't super intriguing so it was hard to read more than 5-10% of this at a time. However, towards the end (maybe the last 10% of this) I was really enjoying it. I loved the ending and how everything wrapped up (well, mostly). I truly appreciated the diversity (race, sexual orientation, and mental illnesses such as anxiety) and how it was dealt with in this book. The ending was shocking and really was emotional. The diversity and ending were my two favorite parts of the book. I was also shocked to read the author's note. I met the author at an event in August of 2015 and she was so wonderful. I was heartbroken to read her story.Overall, a disappointment for me. I was hoping to love it but the characters and plot restrained me from doing so. However, the diversity and ending of this book were great and it lifted my spirits on this book! Despite my rating, I would still recommend picking up a copy when it comes out so you can see for yourself."}, {"userName": "Grace Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51763496-grace-williams", "userReview": "Bree Huges may not make it through senior year without quite a few panic attacks.

I more or less jumped into this the day I received it, but from the very beginning of this book, I had mixed feelings. It started off slow, and then didn't really pick up pace until the end.I honestly had a really hard time rating Liars and Losers Like Us. Again, I feel like the black sheep when it comes to another really hyped up book...and while I wanted to love this, I just had a hard time with it. It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't anything particularly different from other books I've read, either. I did enjoy reading it, and once I started it I did lose myself in the high school prom drama, but it felt a little bit like something was missing.Liars and Losers Like Us was supposed to deal with the suicide of a young girl's classmate - but to me, it seemed like it barely touched on the subject, instead filling the book with prom plans, parties, drinking, and, well...drama. But for the majority of the book, I was pretty disappointed in how all of this was dealt with. I would have loved to see more about Maisey - maybe a memorial or something for her, but it seemed like she was just pushed aside. It seemed...way too upbeat for what I thought it was going to be.Bree is super excited about her upcoming date with her crush, Sean. Feeling a little bummed out because her best friend was nominated to be on the Prom Court and she wasn't, she at least perks up at the thought of spending time with her crush. However, when the school outcast, Maisey, declines her nomination for Prom Court (she was nominated as a joke), Bree is put on the court, and essentially given the chance to win the Prom Queen title. However, when Maisey commits suicide, and leaves behind a note for Bree, it makes her feel horrible for the way she treated Maisey.While we don't learn what Maisey's note says until the end of the book, it's a powerful one, and one that might have made people think twice about the way that they treated Maisey.During the course of the book, Bree essentially fights with Jane, Maisey's number one tormentor, the popular girl, because she treats Bree pretty terribly (and she wants Sean for herself). In the meantime, there is plenty of high school drama, prom drama, drinking, and self-discovery.I had a hard time connecting to any of the characters other than Bree (she suffers from bad anxiety and she tries hard to do the right thing, and regrets when she doesn't stand up for what's right).  Sean seemed like your typical YA boyfriend, and Bree's best friend didn't seem like anything special, either. But Bree's character shines through, and it's easy to like her. I really liked Bree's mom - yes, there is actual parental involvement here, so I was pretty happy about that.

I received a copy from Edelweiss to review, and ended up giving this book 3.5 out of 5 stars.So the characters\u2026Bree was a pretty good main character overall. I wasn't sure about Sean, but he was okay. I'm not sure he's a book boyfriend though. The relationship Bree had with her mom seemed realistic for the most part, except some lack of parental concern. But I liked that it was overall pretty positive. Jane's a character I loved to hate, but I liked that she had sides to her personality that were slowly revealed the more you kept reading.I liked the fact that the main character, Bree, was diverse. That got major pluses in my book. But it took a while to find that out, and it was kind of just thrown in there haphazardly. Overall, I liked the book a lot. I just didn\u2019t love it wholeheartedly, but I\u2019d definitely recommend it if someone wants a (mostly) cute contemporary read.I was surprised by some things that didn't happen in the book, because I had a feeling that something bad besides Maisey\u2019s suicide was going to happen, while reading most of the book. But I did guess why Maisey did what she did. The ending felt a little rushed to me, but it covered the necessities, and didn\u2019t really leave me demanding more. The author's note was amazing, and emotional. I love that more authors are focusing on tough issues, because these things need to be discussed.Final note: Overall, a pretty good book.
