This is very pro Palestinian and understandably so as the author's father was a freedom fighter and she herself is actively involved in an organization to help the children of Gaza. Regardless, this is a very well though out and researched novel.It opens with a family in Beit Daras and this first part is written in stream of consciousness, when the Israeli military invades the village and forces the villagers they have not killed on to Gaza. There is one very violent rape scene, so be warned. People die or are killed on the way, the rest attempt to make new homes, gather their remaining family members close.I loved the strong women in this novel, the wonderfully effective use of magical realism, and the folklore of their culture. It is hard not to sympathize with these people, they just want a better life for their families. It spans to America and back and will see one family member returning home, to a family she does not know. Plus, there is always hope, the book ends on an hopeful note and the characters are beautifully drawn. It is amazing to see people who have lost everything, start again, find love again, laugh through their tears and pain. Because isn't that the way of it, within the fanatical groups in a culture are those who just want to raise their families, just live, maybe just like us.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "3.5 rounded up to 4 stars Many times when we see the news coverage about conflicts in various places in the world, we tend to feel an affinity with one side or another for political , religious or philosophical reasons. What we tend to forget sometimes when thinking about this on those levels is that there are victims on both sides and that these are real human beings bearing the day to day to day , year to year and sometimes a life time of suffering . This is a decidedly pro- Palestinian novel and understandably so as the author is the child of Palestinian refugees . Many who read this may do just that and take a side but I'm not going to because the truth of the matter is that I honestly don't know how I feel and I have been torn for years. Instead I'll just give some of my observations about this book.I liked this book for how the author depicts the importance of the women, the family and of love in this existence. The Barakas family is forced to leave their village of Beit Daras for a refugee camp by Gaza . The strength of the women here is amazing with my favorite being Nazmiyeh and the bee-keeper's widow who was \"related by love.\"There is brutal rape and violence here and suffering and it is heartbreaking and ugly and will get you in the gut . People are displaced from their homes . There is also suffering and abuse of young Nur when she's living in the U.S. There are fantasy elements of this story with a djinni, with special powers , with Khaled , so an appreciation or at the least an acceptance of of magical realism is required here . The story moves across generations and had a time travel like quality to it with Khaled moving across times . \"It wasn't long after that when I went into the quiet blue, that place without time, where I could soak up all the juices of life and let them run through me like a river.\" In addition to that quote there are many other beautifully written passages. \"These were the women of my life , the songs of my soul.\" At times I felt there was just too much going on but perhaps that 's a true reflection of the times and place and the events both as depicted in the past and present day .

I stopped at page 64. Had I been reading a book that spoke of either Palestinians or Muslims in the way this novel speaks of Jews and Israelis, I would likely have stopped a few dozen pages earlier, because I'm so sensitive to bias against them. In this instance, I kept bending over backwards to excuse, diminish, justify statements as being of the characters and not the author's perspective. I ran out of excuses. I appreciate that reasonable people can disagree about whether this novel enhances understanding of the complex history of Israel and Palestine. For me, it is filled with one-sided hate, and I am done with it."}, {"userName": "Thepocobookreader", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40864231-thepocobookreader", "userReview": "As May the 15th marked the day of Nakba (the catastrophe) and the 1948 exodus of Palestinians from their ancestral homeland, now seems a good time to review Susan Abulhawa\u2019s latest novel, The Blue Between Sky and Water. Set in Palestine, it follows the lives of the Baraka family from Beit Daras to Gaza. In the wake of exile, as the family disperse across the world, a beautiful story of kinship and fractured roots unravels through the novel\u2019s main female characters Nazmiyeh and Nur. It is a composite story of resilience and strength in the face of dispossession and humiliation underpinned by the Palestinian quest for freedom. Nazmiyeh, the matriarch at the heart of this novel is in many ways the embodiment of that resistance made flesh. She is strong, defiant, fiercely protective, poised in the face of tragedy and instantly likeable. Abulhawa\u2019s attention to detail is arresting in this inherently strong female book. Through her dazzling characterisation, she writes with a strong sense of autobiography that establishes a relationship with a cultural past that transcends time, boundaries and language and is in many ways reminiscent of Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved. Her language, evocative and moving, exudes an emotional truth that is deeply affecting and will stir even the sternest of hearts.Written from a mixed perspective, Abulhawa\u2019s prose is rich, verbose and powerful, but for me it is the employment of the first person stream of consciousness that is crucial to the ownership and currency of this story. There is an interdependency between Palestine\u2019s past and its brutal present that is having a devastating impact on future generations of Palestinians who have only known conflict and that to \u2018die naturally is a blessing\u2019. Nazmiyeh\u2019s grandson, Khaled\u2019s voice is a ubiquitous reminder of this ongoing violation of life, childhood and the right to live in peace. By chronicling the personal histories and the entrenched sense of dignity, endurance and the humanity of the Palestinian people that is so often overlooked, the depravity of occupation becomes shockingly clear. Abulhawa highlights this deftly, peppering her prose with references to real life witnesses and atrocities. She quotes Chris Hedges, the heroic Dr Madz Gilbert and pays heart breaking homage to Rachel Corrie, the American peace activist whose story is familiar to western audiences and cherished by Palestinians.For me this is historical fiction of the highest order, interspersed with the tale are references to Palestinian fisherman shot at sea and children shot at \u2018for sport\u2019 that will have you guiltily scanning your mind for stories glossed over then forgotten in much of the western world. And yet, perhaps, Abulhawa does not absolve herself from this shameful voyeurism, \u2018westerners came and went all the time on poverty and war tours just to go back and write books\u2019, but what differentiates Abulhawa is her courage. The Blue Between Sky and Water is a brave and inspiring novel of forbearance and hope, reclaiming and preserving the cultural wealth of Palestine. Abulhawa writes with passion and honesty to create a profound retelling of the personal histories of her people in this epic multi-generational tale of loss, love and humanity. This is a must read."}, {"userName": "RoseMary Achey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5338290-rosemary-achey", "userReview": "From the author of  Mornings in JeninMost American's only know of Gaza from what they see on the nightly news.

Nel blu del suo mare, del suo cielo, della sua speranza. Gi\u00e0, perch\u00e9 se questa ha un colore, laggi\u00f9 si tinge proprio di blu: quello profondo e scintillante del Mediterraneo che accarezza le spiagge di una striscia di terra tra le pi\u00f9 densamente popolate al mondo, promettendo crudelmente libert\u00e0 e suscitando strazianti desideri d\u2019altrove e normalit\u00e0. A Gaza, infatti, non si \u00e8 liberi n\u00e9 si vive in condizioni normali: \u00e8 una prigione a cielo aperto, una dimensione d\u2019esilio perenne, un limbo che ogni giorno precipita nell\u2019inferno della sopravvivenza all\u2019occupazione militare israeliana.Ma il blu, quello tra il cielo e il mare che il titolo evoca, \u00e8 anche quel luogo di silenzi dove la vita e la morte si confondono e passato e futuro s\u2019incontrano, cos\u00ec come vi si ritrovano insieme uomini e spiriti. \u00c8 proprio quest\u2019elemento magico dal sapore dolcemente onirico a impreziosire il romanzo che, ancor pi\u00f9 che nel precedente \u201cOgni mattina a Jenin\u201d, ci racconta una storia pressoch\u00e9 al femminile: una storia di donne unite tra loro da indissolubili legami di sangue, terra e disperazione sullo sfondo della Nakba, l\u2019immane e ininterrotta catastrofe che da quasi settant\u2019anni vivono gli arabi della Palestina nel disinteresse del mondo (\u201cfratelli\u201d arabi compresi) e dell\u2019ipocrisia della diplomazia internazionale. E cos\u00ec le vicende delle donne di una famiglia palestinese come tante, dalla matriarca forte come una roccia alla nipotina dall\u2019infanzia stravolta dalla guerra, s\u2019intrecciano a quelle inferte dalla Storia alla loro terra, fino ad avvenimenti non lontani nel tempo come i bombardamenti su Gaza tra la fine del 2008 e l\u2019inizio del 2009 o la liberazione del soldato israeliano Gilad Shalit da parte di Hamas nel 2011.Grandi protagoniste del romanzo, la forza e la fragilit\u00e0 delle donne si alternano tra queste pagine, mentre dalle ormai croniche macerie di Gaza emergono non solo brandelli di vite spezzate e sogni recisi, ma anche tanta voglia di un nuovo inizio e, soprattutto, la speranza che si veste immancabilmente di blu."}, {"userName": "Rachael McDiarmid", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5980370-rachael-mcdiarmid", "userReview": "What an extraordinary book. It sure packs one hell of an emotional punch. Actually I think there is too much emotion running through my body to write a review! To see Gaza, to see the Palestinians, through these characters and the stories that weaved throughout the book, from generation to generation, was indeed something special. This is a book for and about women, strong women, women who know what it means to endure, to love, to live. The men are there, in the background, and part of the stories, but it's a wonderful tale about your roots, your family, and discovering who you are, and what it means to be loved and part of something. I loved the mystical element with Khaled but I understand that wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. I hated the violence, when it happened, and some scenes upset me, but somehow, like the characters, I learnt to endure it. Because the love and friendship that binds everyone together is greater than it. I loved this book."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "This is the other side of the story, so to speak- about refugees forced into the Gaza strip. Nazmiyeh is the matriarch, and we follow generations of the family as they suffer the humiliations and struggles of displacement (exile really). With a daughter sick with cancer and cut from resources (medicine included) she will turn to the beekeepers wife for healing. But it is more than just a story about horrific history, there is no doubt it has shaped and destroyed the family in different ways. There is so much loss and abuse and yet Nazmiyeh holds the family together. There is magical realism as well which really made for an interesting unexpected dynamic to this tale. My heart ached with the beautiful love Nur and her grandfather shared- only to be rent by the horrible situations she ends up in upon losing him. My favorite quote comes from her grandfather, who loved to tell her stories. \"Stories matter. We are composed of our stories. The human heart is made of the words we put in it. If someone ever says mean things to you, don't let those words go into your heart, and be careful not to put mean words into other people's hearts.\"It's hard to sum this novel into a neat package, because there is always something happening and it's not just a story about refugees in the Gaza. It was interesting to read about the women as being fiery and strong, not because I don't believe they are but many people in the western world often believe them to be submissive and retreating. They don't imagine a woman can carry a family or be respected, but mothers are often revered. It is easy to dismiss a people and never imagine their sufferings, this novel certainly sheds light on the conflict. Politics aside, for the family tale alone the novel is wonderfully written. There are many wonderful quotes I highlighted, and the writing is good. There is much horror and pain, but there is love and hope as well. I have always enjoyed reading different perspectives, we really all do carry stories not just of how we are shaped by our family (good or bad) but also by our people collectively, whatever country we call home. We all suffer over those we love and hope to protect, regardless of our ethnic background or religious beliefs, to think otherwise is to dehumanize. The visions make sense at the end,' that place between the sky and water where all is as it once was, and where all will meet again.' I cannot begin to imagine the severed roots, the refugee existence though my own father and grandparents were briefly refugees from Hungary until they made it to America. Hearing about it is one thing, living it is another. History is rife with brutality and there is not a people incapable of committing atrocities, good and bad- the lines blur. The only thing we have to share our experience is often storytelling. Well done."}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3172592-sofia", "userReview": "The truth is there are not enough stars for this book, so I will suffice with 5. The fear I had with this book was, \"would it live up to Susan Abulhawa's previous book, Mornings in Jenin?\" I had really enjoyed that book and been deeply moved. Could Susan really do it again? The Blue Between Sky and Water did not achieve what Mornings in Jenin did, it completely and utterly surpassed it!The entire time I was reading this book, I had a lump in my throat, and was often moved to both tears and laughter. Abulhawa has written with a poignancy that is so characteristic of her writing, yet even more matured and refined since Mornings in Jenin. She gets better with each book! It was not just the storyline but the very prose she utilises which is so striking and deeply emotive.As with her previous book, she has the skill to develop characters in such a way that I was fully invested in each. I loved and hated fiercely throughout this book. The storyline is nothing short of marvellous and courageous in equal measure. Susan brings to the centre stage the plight of Palestinians and more specifically Gaza and holds us all to account with honesty, integrity, passion, wisdom and bravery. This isn't just a work of historical fiction, but an act of defiance and rebellion, a refusal to allow the Palestinian narrative of their history and their homelands to be so easily and irreverently whitewashed.I loved the way Susan weaves real life heroes like Dr Madz Gilbert and Rachel Corrie into the narrative, forever reminding us that though this is a work of fiction, it's more real than we realise. I loved the omnipresent narrative of Khaled, which was so cleverly done, a lesser skilled writer could have made it a very confusing affair, but she wrote with mastery. I loved Hajje Nazmiyeh. What a character! I loved Nur, Alwan, Rhat Shel and the beekeeper's widow, and above all I loved their relationship. This is the story of sisterhood and a schooling on how it should look. I received this book from Bloomsbury Publishers UK having responded to a Facebook post of theirs. I am so glad they chose to send this book to me, it is definitely going down as an all time favourite.

Abulhawa writes with a distinct style, and I'll be interested to see if this is also the case in  Mornings  or if it is peculiar to this novel.This book opens with families leaving their ancient farms for Gaza as their homes are invaded. Those who are sensitive to reading about sexual assault should be aware there is a distressing rape scene, as well as other violence committed. This opening section of the book - say, the first 70 pages or so - I struggled with a little. Not necessarily due to content, though that was difficult to read as it is for any book including such events, but rather I felt the authorial tone was too didactic for my taste. I'm not sure why that bugged me so much, perhaps because I felt a little like I was being lectured to rather than being presented with a story that would engage me and lead me to think for myself. I think many (most?) of us like to be able to form our own conclusions rather than having them forced on us?Where the book gained strength for me was in the contemporary sections set in Gaza. Abulhawa shows us the lives of people living in Gaza: the conditions they live under and the way they try to ensure they have their needs met (the tunnels). In addition, there are glimpses into aid workers assisting in Gaza. Life in the world's largest open air prison is challenging; from air raids, to calorific restrictions, limited medical supplies, and a thousand other privations that comes with living in a war zone. The didacticism I struggled with in the first section resolved in the contemporary sections - perhaps because we followed the lives of characters, rather than of a an event.This book is unabashedly pro-Palestine, but I have no issue with that. The voices of Palestine have been silenced, and this book tries to give a voice again; to show what is happening in Gaza."}, {"userName": "Calzean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26416859-calzean", "userReview": "The Western media and Governments paint Palestinians as the bad guys. But they are people and this book so movingly relates the lives of one Palestinian family from the time of establishing Israel to today. The family came from simple farming and fishing stock and held centuries long customs and beliefs focused on God and the family. There is superstition and the evil eye to be avoided. Forced to live in Gaza they hang on to their dignity and traditions waiting for the day they can live peacefully away from the violence and military power of Israel.One of their family migrates to America and a granddaughter. Nur becomes a powerful comparison between life in Gaza and the Western world which has walked away from family, belief and respect. She is molested by her stepfather, despised by her mother and left to grow up in foster homes. The only person who stays in contact with Nur through these years is a child welfare office, herself a refugee from South Africa.

Have I mentioned how much I love reading historical fiction?The Blue Between Sky and Water is about four generations of powerful Palestinian women in Gaza. The women are strong, resilient, passionate, and they put their family first and they aren\u2019t afraid to make sacrifices to protect their own.A Palestinian family is violently pushed from their ancient farming village of Beit Daras and they try to reconstitute themselves in a refugee camp in Gaza. The men there, those who have escaped prison or the battlefields, worry over making ends meet, they tend their tattered pride, and they join the resistance. The women are left to be breadwinners and protectors. Nazmiyeh is the matriarch and very much the main character in the novel. She is the center of a household of sisters, daughters, granddaughters, whose lives threaten to spin out of control with every personal crisis, military attack, or political landmine.Her brother\u2019s granddaughter Nur is stuck in America; her own daughter\u2019s son, traumatized in an Israeli assault, slips into another kind of exile; her daughter has cancer and no access to medicine. Their neighbour, the Beekeeper\u2019s wife, will extract the marijuana resin to shrink her tumor, but it is also Nazmiyeh\u2019s large heart and zest for life that heals, that will even call Nur back from the broken promise of America and set her on a new path. All Nazmiyeh\u2019s loved ones will return to her, and ultimately journey further, to that place between the sky and water where all is as it once was, and where all will meet again.The Blue Between Sky and Water is a fantastic, divine novel about survival, showcasing powerful women who manage to enlarge and enliven the everyday. When I say \u2018powerful women\u2019, I don\u2019t mean in status. They are not wealthy or important, but they are struggling. They have tragedy in their lives and they are coping. But the women rise above all that to tackle their problems and their issues and they come together to live their lives and take things one step at a time. They are bold and confident and they stand up for themselves. They are the stars of this novel and they are inspiring to the reader.This is a timeless novel, with lyrical prose and insight into the historical woes and turmoil in Gaza. The novel jumps between generations and families and characters, but all of the sections come together to deliver a satisfying conclusion that resembles the importance of family and the importance of being there for one another.I loved the characters in this novel, but I also loved the magic realism that the author wove into the story. We received short bits of it every so often and it was refreshing and uplifting and it helped propel the story forward. This book illustrated a culture that I know very little about, and it presented it in a sensitive and honest setting. A true setting, with events that have really happened in the world and are hard to imagine.Above all else, this book shows us characters who have lost everything, who are suffering and have nothing, but are able to rebuild and begin again, find love and cherish everything that they\u2019ve gained. It\u2019s a beautiful book and I can\u2019t recommend it enough.http://jessjustreads.com"}, {"userName": "Reem", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24901813-reem", "userReview": "\u2022\"It was enough to hear \"this land will rise again\".

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is ongoing, and innocent people are still suffering, and this was the story of those innocents over a period of history.What I struggled with, and why I didn't finish the book, was the number of characters. I struggled to keep up with who was who, and by over 50% through I decided it wasn't for me. I also wasn't very keen on the magical realism. It's not something I like normally, so for it to be in this novel...I think the book well written and think it important that the Palestinian voice be heard, and for that I wish the author well in her work."}, {"userName": "Hermien", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5930747-hermien", "userReview": "I really liked Mornings in Jenin and was looking forward to this book.

This book is heartbreaking and heartwarming all wrapped together in the story of a families love. Be warned there are triggers in here that are very difficult issues (rape, child molestation), but is an engaging read regardless. It is definetly the kind of book that I could easily read again and again and would highly recommend it to others. The book is interesting as you get to see the world from more than one characters point of view and get to experience the world that they live, the culture, the language. A fantastic read.I would like to thank The Reading Room and the publisher for my copy."}, {"userName": "Marcy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1753204-marcy", "userReview": "Once again Susan Abulhawa takes my breath away. This time her story is set in Gaza, and like her previous novel, there are four generations of a family who help to narrate Palestine from before the nakba until the very present. Setting this novel in Gaza is brilliant for so many reasons, not the least of which is the way it enables her to illustrate the limits of freedom and the ongoing nakbas that Palestinians in Gaza endure. The characters are moving and powerful and so full of love, but it's also devastating to follow their lives given what they, especially Nur, Miriam, and Khaled, have to endure. The novel leaves you with a lump in your heart, especially when one reads her epilogue, which lets readers know what happened in Gaza in the time since her novel went to press."}, {"userName": "Tfalcone", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1268843-tfalcone", "userReview": "Threw me into turmoil right away. The author is Palestinian and presents the Palestinian view of what happened during the Israel Palestine conflict. I was influenced by the American press and have a different view that now I am not so sure about. Oh, this is so complicated. Were/Are the Israeli trying to starve the Palestinians out or are they defending their country against weapons? Why is it that every nation struggles with refugees in one way or another in the 21st century? Why is history so subjective. You can feel the anger and frustration in every chapter and wow, what a big emotional impact.

Susan Abulhawa brings a raw humanity and delicate authority to the story of Palestine in this devastatingly beautiful tale.\u201dThe Blue Between Sky and Water is set in Palestine, it follows the lives of the Baraka family from Beit Daras to Gaza over a sixty year period starting May 15, 1948. The prose is rich, verbose, evocative and powerful and the employment of the first person leads to the urgency of the story. But mostly it is the exploration of roots and how they define us.

We are composed of our stories. The human heart is made of the words we put in it. If someone ever says mean things to you, don\u2019t let those words go into your heart, and be careful not to put mean words in other people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\nIn The Blue Between Sky and Water, Susan Abulhawa explores in a masterfully family saga the consequences of the brutal mass evacuation from Palestine across other continents throughout many generations, following at the same time the stories of some brave women who manage, with great sacrifices, to inspire some magic into their cruel present. I must be honest, I went into this book not knowing much about the plot or the synopsis, but I really liked the cover and then I found out it was about the Palestine war with Israel and about the refugees taking shelter in Gaza. Therefore, we follow this particular family from around 1948 until 2010. And I thought the book would historical fiction, but the author chose to add some magical realism elements to her story which I found unnecessary and didn\u2019t like them as much as I wanted to, but the characters of this book saved it entirely. We see a very close-up picture of this family\u2019s struggle with the relocation to Gaza, to adapting to a new place that will never be quite their home, to managing the small amount of rationalization they were receiving and to the fear that they might be bombed or shot at any time. Despite all these struggles and fears, Nazmiyeh and her husband manage to form a family of their own in this new location and to be part of a community. I liked that the author focused more on the women\u2019s destinies in this novel, rather than the men\u2019s because we also caught a glimpse at their restrictive social norms and religious traditions which were fascinating to someone who is from a totally different culture. My favorite part of the book was the storyline focusing on Nur and the lengths it took for her to finally find a place where she felt like she belonged. We see her flourish and showing incredible strength despite not having the happiest childhood and I was really happy to see her evolve and develop throughout the years. The dynamics between these characters were sometimes very juicy and funny, while the other times they were emotional and moving. I loved them so much. Even though I didn\u2019t like the magical elements of the book and the fact that they became quite a big part of the story in the second half of the book, I really liked the pace of the plot and the amazing and complex characters. The book isn\u2019t very political because it focuses more on the destiny of this family, rather than the political climate between Palestine and Israel at the time which makes the reader suffer, but also laugh alongside these characters!"}], "description": "\"\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631... \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062d\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u064b\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629. \u062a\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0636\u0648\u062d\"\". \u00ab\u0625\u0646\u062f\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0648\u0646 \u0635\u0646\u062f\u0627\u064a\u00bb\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0661\u0669\u0664\u0668\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u064a\u062a \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u0643\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0636\u0645 \u0646\u0638\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0645\u062f\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0645\u0644\u0629. \u0648\u062d\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u064f\u0634\u0639\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u062a\u0636\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u063a\u0632\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0639\u0632\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u062a\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0646 \u0635\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0645.\u0648\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0645\u064f\u0636\u064a\u0651 \u0633\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u060c \u062a\u0642\u0639 \u062d\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0645\u062f\u0648\u062d \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0628 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0628. \u0648\u062d\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u063a\u0632\u0629\u060c \u062a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0623\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u0631\u0628\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062a\u062e\u0637\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a -
