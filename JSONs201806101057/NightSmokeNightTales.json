I was expecting just an okay read but ended up enjoying this one quite a bit. Many of the other lead characters from the Night Tales series could be found throughout the book and that always makes a series more fun!Ry is an arson investigator who is investigating a fire at one of the buildings Natalie Fletcher is using to start a new lingerie business. They are instantly drawn to each other but can't stand each other all at the same time. The romance comes on strong and fast but it really works in the story. There was plenty of romance, danger and steamy scenes.

You'd think that something written in the nineties wouldn't ring \"right\" nowadays, sounding a bit backwater at the least, but this series is just timeless.This was yet another winner with a strong, stubborn, determined female lead, and a hunky, yummy arson investigator as leading man.

Urbana, USA (wherever that is, Maybe Atlanta?).Sex: Infrequent, explicit.Hero: Arson investigatorHeroine: CEO of family empireThe two Night Tales stories I\u2019ve read (so far) fit as a sort of transition book between Nora Roberts shorter romances and her lengthy romantic-suspenses. In other words, it\u2019s a shorter version of her very enjoyable longer books.It\u2019s a good mystery/suspense with an enjoyable romance.And a HEA.Without taking forever to get there.There are similarities to the other books in the series, with characters from them appearing and playing important relationship roles - Althea is pregnant, Deborah and Gage have a daughter, Cilla and Boyd have 3 kids and he\u2019s a Captain. And there are similarities to Roberts\u2019 later books (obvious one being Blue Smoke).And there\u2019s some aggressive sex:\u201cSilk and heat and fragrant flesh. Everything she was filled him, taunted him, tormented him. Woman, all woman. Beauty and grace and passion. Temptation and torment and triumph. All of it, all of her, obsessed him.They thrashed over the slick satin spread, groping for more.Here was fire, the bright, dangerous flash of it. It seared through him, burned, scarred, while her hands and mouth raced over him, igniting hundreds of new flames. He didn\u2019t fight it back. For once he wanted to be consumed. With an oath, he tore at the silk and dined greedily on her flesh.His hands were rough and hard. And wonderful. She\u2019d never felt more alive, or more desperate. She craved him, knew that sh had, on some deep level, right from the beginning.\u201d p.154-155But it\u2019s still enjoyable.
