Children of God made no less of an impact on me. It is a must-read for anyone that has read and enjoyed the first in the duology. I would highly suggest reading these in order as the one really does follow immediately on the heels of the other. The Sparrow was a story of a first contact conducted by a Jesuit mission to the planet Rakhat. \"First contact\u2014by definition\u2014takes place in a state of radical ignorance, where nothing is known about the ecology, biology, languages, culture and economy of the Other. On Rakhat, that ignorance proved catastrophic.\" Both stories are termed \u2018science fiction\u2019 but both go deeper than just an exploration of the frontiers of space. They are journeys of faith, morality, and the influence of time on the shaping and perception of events. The author, Mary Doria Russell, does not \u2018preach\u2019 to the reader. Rather, we are given a slate on which to draw our own conclusions; there are many opportunities to question and reflect upon the events in this story and how they relate to humankind in general. This is the type of science fiction I am finding I truly love. The author\u2019s own words offer the best description of the main theme of this novel: \"Children of God is about the aftermath of irreversible tragedy, about the many ways that we struggle to make sense of tragedy. It\u2019s about the stories we tell ourselves, and the ways we justify our decisions, to bring ourselves to some kind of peace. And I guess it\u2019s about the way time reveals significance, strips away self-serving excuses, lays truth bare, and both blunts pain and sharpens insight.\" It is brilliantly written and often very profound. It is not a book that you will breeze through \u2013 you will want to stop and think, gather your thoughts, and wonder how you would react in these circumstances. My emotions seesawed constantly throughout this book!I realize I\u2019m being fairly vague about the plot here. I simply don\u2019t want to spoil anything from the first book by recounting the happenings in this one. I can say that it also a novel about what it means to be oppressed versus an oppressor and how the tables can be turned. We learn further about the species that inhabit Rakhat \u2013 the Runa and Jana\u2019ata. What the effect of introducing a new species (that of homo sapiens) to the planet will have on the balance of power. Much of this will have a familiar ring to it from our own world history. It may bring to mind revolutions, such as that of the French and the Russian, as well as the settling of North America and the displacement of the Native Americans. The question as to whether the ends justify the means will recur in the book and in your own thoughts. Ultimately, it causes one to understand that we are all part of this world (or this universe) and that each serves a purpose, each life has meaning, all are dependent on one another in some way, shape or form. I highly recommend reading both books. Don't let the genre scare you away, or you will be missing out on some truly thought-provoking writing, some extremely nuanced characters, and excellent dialogue.  CredoI cannot find my way: there is no star In all the shrouded heavens anywhere; And there is not a whisper in the air Of any living voice but one so far That I can hear it only as a bar Of lost, imperial music, played when fair And angel fingers wove, and unaware, Dead leaves to garlands where no roses are. No, there is not a glimmer, nor a call, For one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears, The black and awful chaos of the night; For through it all \u2013 above, beyond it all \u2013 I know the far-sent message of the years, I feel the coming glory of the Light.~Edwin Arlington Robinson, 1897"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I am so glad I only waited a month between reading parts one and two of this book. It really is just one book split into two parts and I could not leave Emilio for too long suffering the way he was at the end of part one.Emilio Sandoz is one of those book characters who jumps off the page and out of the book. Whenever he is not front and centre of the story it lacks a certain something. Even the characters in the book notice when he is not in the room. He loses so much and suffers so much that at times I wondered how the author was going to finish him off. I can't say much without spoilers but let's say she still had something up her sleeve and I was perfectly content with the last few pages.Many of the other characters are memorable too. I loved all of the Jesuit priests with their sardonic humour and their less than perfect attitudes always disguising their real love of humanity and their work. Isaac was a wonderful character too, a child and then a man with high functioning autism who is accepted totally into the society he lives in. His reactions to the world around him are explained beautifully, and make sense of his autistic behaviours. I enjoyed the space travel with all its boredom for the travellers and its occasional real dangers. I loved the planet and its unusual dwellers. I was happy to see loose ends being tied up all over the place. In fact I loved it all.A great book following another great book.

Sean Fein, Danny Iron Horse, Joseba Urizarbarrena - they were all completely interchangeable. I couldn't tell you who did what or who had which characteristics. There was an overweight pilot as well, and I'm not sure why he was in the book at all except for the ship to have a pilot. I didn't buy the reasons for sending Emilio back to Rakhat. None of them held up under scrutiny, and nothing happened on Rakhat after his return that absolutely required his presence. It all seemed like a bunch of faux-concern for Emilio's soul just so Russell could write another book.There were far too many scenes from the VaRahkati point of view, and dear lord did they drag on. So much time was spent going over the specifics of their civil war; for some reason Russell decided to place a conversation between Danny Iron Horse and a Runao before they actually arrived on Rakhat so that she could squeeze in an explanation of 20 years' worth of change that had occurred on Rakhat. The Sparrow was about a man's spiritual journey, and that was lost in the sequel's massive focus on the VaRakhati war.Finally, it was just really unnecessary. The Sparrow was emotionally brutal and that's part of what made it so impressive. This sequel neuters that brutality, and while it's nice seeing Emilio having some happy moments, The Sparrow made sense as it was - it told a story in a way that it needed to be told."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210176-patrick", "userReview": "The sequel to The Sparrow. Once again, the author does a tremendous job in both introducing new social, political, and cultural concepts on almost every page for both the human and alien species she writes about, which makes the story very compelling for the reader. As the story progresses the author creates a nearly intractable problem of species genocide that she resolves near the end in a manner that completely surprised me, but which makes a lot of sense once one considers the backgrounds of the human characters she sends forth on this second mission to the discovered planet.Two quick thoughts for any readers out there who have not yet had the pleasure of reading either of these wonderful books...I consider theese to be two parts of one long story, even though it appears that the author didn't plan a sequel when she write The Sparrow. A reader would be best served by reading both, of course, to get the most insight.Secondly - since the books' story consists of the outcome of a manned mission to another planet, one who has not read these books may immediately consider these to simply be science fiction, as I did when my friend Alex suggested that we read The Sparrow. But these books turned out to be so much more that that. There are very few books of fiction that I have read that gave me quite so much insight into the complexity of how we act and interact as human beings, for all the good and bad that comes with that as we try to create our future. These are classic books, and I would hope that they are well read for many years to come."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie", "userReview": "I loved this but then I expected no less since I felt the same about it's predecessor, The Sparrow. This book picks up right where The Sparrow left off. In my opinion neither of these books are easy reads, by that I mean something I could whiz through. Part of it is the time lines taking place, part is the completely foreign names and culture. I only wish I had read this shortly after The Sparrow although the author does remind you of what happened previously. I am going to sum up this book by quoting the author. At the end of my edition there a Q &A with her. The question: \"Is there a moral to this story?\"Her answer: \"Don't be so damned quick to judge! The less we know about someone, the easier we find it to make a snap decision, to condemn or sneer or believe the worst. The closer you get, the more you know about the person or the situation in question, the harder it gets to be sure of your opinion, so remember that, and try to cut people a little slack. Like Emilio says, \"\"Everything we thought we understood-that was what we were most wrong about.\"\" So the moral of the story is to be suspicious of your own certainty. Doubt is good.\"Good words to live by. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading these books, I highly recommend them. Would be great book club reads."}, {"userName": "Carol.

And then in the sequel, she\u2019s essentially drafted into accompanying another team back to the planet where they found the Alien eggs, and almost everyone dies again? No? Well, sorry for spoiling Alien and Aliens.Anyway, Children of God is kind of like that. At the end of \nThe Sparrow\n, Emilio Santos arrives home, sole survivor of the first expedition to Rakhat. He is psychologically and physically maimed thanks to gross cultural misunderstandings\u2014the muscles in his palms have been removed, rendering his fingers almost useless, and he has been subject to rape and molestation at the hands of the Jana'ata nobility who kept them as their plaything. Emilio is hurt and resentful\u2014towards the Church, towards God, and mostly towards himself. After about a year, Emilio is on the road to recovery. He starts working again, meets a love interest, and seems to be reconnecting to the world. But then he gets drafted to return to Rakhat, and it all goes wrong. Again.Mary Doria Russell moved me deeply with The Sparrow. Her approach to first contact and interstellar exploration was a mixture of cultural anthropology and religious faith. The first mission is funded by the Jesuits, and throughout the story, questions of the role of religion, the Church, and God are prominent. With Emilio\u2019s fate we are left to wonder with him why God would permit such a thing to happen. And all the while, the characters asking and precipitating these questions are complicated and three-dimensional, whether they are human or alien, priest or layperson. MDR\u2019s touch is a subtle and deft one.Truth be told, I was somewhat apprehensive about Children of God. Several of my Goodreads friends had commented on my review of The Sparrow advising me to read this book, even as they told me it wasn\u2019t as good. Even if they hadn\u2019t, The Sparrow is that type of standalone jewel that is almost always diminished by a sequel\u2014why re-open old questions only to spoil them with answers?MDR makes several very smart choices, however, that mitigate the damage to The Sparrow\u2019s memory. For instance, she reveals that Sofia Mendes is still alive despite what Emilio and everyone else believed. Living among exile Runa now, Sofia gives birth to an autistic son, Isaac. MDR tells Sofia\u2019s story in parallel with the story of how Emilio goes from recovering dependant of the Church to independent researcher to hostage of relativity. To these two perspectives MDR adds a third, visiting for a time various Runa and Jana'ata characters.This proves to be a brilliant stroke of storytelling. Although I found these sections the most confusing (little bit of name soup going on), they were also very enlightening. I liked hearing Suupari\u2019s side of the story of Emilio\u2019s transition into prostitution, for example, and was glad to hear that Suupari was contrite. It would be blatantly inaccurate to say that MDR humanizes the Jana'ata, but she definitely provides us with the opportunity to empathize with their worldview.Thanks to these choices, Children of God is a good story regardless of how it fulfils the role of sequel. Despite my apprehension, I eventually sunk comfortably into my role as reader and enjoyed the story. There is plenty of tragedy to be had here, especially for Emilio, but it is not as dark or unforgiving as The Sparrow was. Of course, that may or may not be an improvement depending on what one expects from these kind of novels. I admit it\u2019s a little disappointing and makes Children of God feel a little more shallow\u2014but then again, this book, unlike The Sparrow isn\u2019t really about Emilio\u2019s personal struggles any more.The possibility of there being intelligent life, the suspense leading up to confirmation that the signals were actually coming from an alien species, was a huge part of The Sparrow. But as the opening part of Children of God makes clear, knowing that we are not alone hasn\u2019t changed life on Earth all that much. MDR doesn\u2019t spend too much time speculating why this is, leaving us to draw our own conclusions. I suspect the major reason is expense: numerous expeditions set off for Rakhat, but only two made it there intact, and of those two, Emilio is the only human who returned. Space travel is expensive and provides little in the way of return so far. Plus, with a sole survivor in the custody of the Jesuits, there is little in the way of information about Earth\u2019s nearest neighbours. In this respect, the sequel shows us how merely discovering that we are not alone is not necessarily the life-changing event that we might expect it to be.The same cannot be said for humanity\u2019s influence on the Rakhat. Stumbling in where we are not invited, we destabilize the tenuous predator\u2013prey relationship between the Jana'ata and the Runa. By the time Emilio and the second Jesuit expedition arrive, the Jana'ata are almost extinct and the Runa are free. Just by existing and exposing the Runa and the Jana'ata to our peculiar cultures and beliefs, we caused massive change. Is it for the better? Even making that distinction assumes that the way we, as humans, define better is relevant to life on Rakhat. Again, MDR doesn\u2019t necessarily spend too much time on this point, but issues of cultural relativism and ethnocentrism are implicit in the relationship between humans, Jana'ata, and Runa. Recall, too, that this is the result of a handful of human representatives visiting Rakhat, none of them representatives of any government other than the Vatican\u2014and even then, only loosely.Children of God certainly provides interesting food for thought, and I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting Rakhat. We learn more about the Runa and Jana'ata in this book; their cultures are not as confusing or as alien any more. And by far, the best part of the book is Celestine. Precocious child characters usually annoy me, but Celestine captured my heart and wouldn\u2019t let it go. The involuntary separation of Emilio from Gina and Celestine is one of the more brutal acts in this book.It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no contest between this book and its predecessor. The Sparrow stands alone as an amazing work of science fiction, one that demands an examination of faith and empathy and science against the backdrop of contact tragedy. Children of God is more like DLC than a sequel\u2014a little more content, a few extra missions with familiar characters that flesh out the storyline of the original game without taking too many risks themselves. It\u2019s fun while it lasts, but it does not have the same staying power as the original. And that\u2019s the perfectly fine, considering what it\u2019s up against in that comparison."}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra", "userReview": "This is not a stand-alone book. The Sparrow is essential to have read. Without that background story, Children of God would be confusing at times. This was a seamless continuation of The Sparrow and really can be considered one book. The story picks up where The Sparrow left off. Woven throughout this work is the concept of Faith in God, self, others. How one's faith in one's present can influence one's future. Morality is also a prevalent theme. Decisions affect others besides ourselves. This story is a bit confusing in the aspect of time-line. Mary Doria Russell does a good job in showing the relativity of space travel but it sometimes gets confusing in perspective of the story. Does the previous section happen before, during or after the story section we're now reading? It takes a bit of going back, checking dates, etc. This story isn't as perfect as The Sparrow. I had some doubts along the way, which didn't happen in the first. But it's still a brilliant story. I don't want to give any of the story away. This is a difficult review to write because of that.

I strongly recommend that readers read Sparrow first as Children of God is a continuation of that story and will make little sense without the background provided in the Sparrow.The Sparrow tells the story of Earth's first contact with alien races and, with a sociologist's eye, the impact that a meeting between two entirely different cultures have upon each other. A facetious example might be if one culture considered a swift kick in the ass as a polite greeting coming into contact with one that does not. Children of God tells the story of Emilio Sandoz' second trip to Rahkat and focuses more on the impact that the first visit had on that planet's civilization in the years since he first departed the planet.This was a good book but imho it was not as good as the Sparrow. Part of the problem may be that the story skipped around in place and time which can be very confusing when listening to an audiobook. Another part of the problem may be that while the ideas shared in The Sparrow were original and fascinating to consider, the impact of human explorers on indigenous cultures is all too familiar. Bottom line: Mary Doria Russell is still one of the few authors on my if-they-write-it-I-will-buy-it list. I encourage readers to read all of her books, including this one.

Her evident desire to tie up all the loose ends and leave no one unaccounted for is a distinct handicap, as some parts of the book are too obviously there for that purpose only. Just as she did in the first book, Russell takes on the big questions of spirituality, morality, the challenge to faith posed by an apparently capricious God, against a backdrop of extreme psychological upheaval (in Emilio's case) and the cataclysmic social and political changes triggered by the earlier mission to Rakhat.She does a better job than I had anticipated, but the inherent predictability of certain story arcs dooms the sequel to be less exciting than the original. It doesn't help that the crew members on the return trip are considerably less interesting than the original gang. I'll forgive her the hokiness of the plot device used to get Emilio on an outbound vessel for a second time. But a major reason that \"Children of God\" is less compelling than \"The Sparrow\" is that Emilio is really the only character worth caring about, and his ultimate fate, though emotionally satisfying, is entirely predictable (Spoiler: His return visit to Rakhat allows him to realize a certain capacity for forgiveness, which gives him a degree of peace. Which of course gives nothing away - given that she went to the trouble of writing a second book so as not to leave us with the brutal image of Emilio tortured and despairing, there's no other possible outcome for the second book.)Though it doesn't match the brilliance of \"The Sparrow\", it's still well worth reading - Russell is still smart, thought-provoking and well able to tell a good story, skillfully and with finesse."}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "Always and always love a book that brings all the human emotions to the forefront. As we continue the journey to discovery, we are marred, enlightened, ennobled, and most of all touched by the things that make a life human. We are also, as foretold in this novel, made better by the things we do not yet know, the races we have not yet met, and the horrors we might not yet understand.This novel plus the one that came before it, is a thinking person's book. It makes you question, to wonder, to begin to note that it is not only humans who might be among us and if they are, then why could it not be possible for them to be exactly like us and yet so different too? Where and what are the things that raise us up? Is it a belief in a higher power or is it the power within each of us that makes life worthwhile and something always valuable and while not always good and oftentimes evil, might not this spirit in and of itself be divine?Suffice to say that this is a book that has so many facets it would be impossible to cover them all without rewriting the entire book and then some. If you are in need of a book that will have you questioning and perhaps eventually even liking what we are a a people, than this book might head you down a direction that is both philosophical and deeply moving.

I felt immediately reconnected to the characters I had left behind far too long ago. If there were anything I would have had differently, it would have been to have read this book immediately after reading The Sparrow. They are so interconnected that they are almost the same book, seamlessly continued. We find Emilio Sandoz where we left him, on earth and struggling with his relationship to God, his fellow man, the fate of those he has left on Rakhat and how to live a life devoid of the faith he has so long trusted and relied upon. If there is one theme that I believe recurs over and over again in these books, it is the theme of faith. How much of what happens to us is God\u2019s doing, how much has purpose, how much is our failure to listen closely enough and understand God\u2019s voice when he is speaking to us?There is a moment toward the end of the book when one of the priests makes an observance that I believe sums up what we are meant to take away from this story:\u201cThere\u2019s a passage in Deuteronomy--God tells Moses, \u2018No one can see My face, but I will protect you with My hand until I have passed by you, and then I will remove My hand and you will see My back.\u2019 Remember that?Emilio nodded, listening.\u201cWell, I always thought that was a physical metaphor,\u201d John said, \u201cbut, you know--I wonder now if it isn\u2019t really about time? Maybe that was God\u2019s way of telling us that we can never know His intentions, but as time goes on...we\u2019ll understand. We\u2019ll see where He was: we\u2019ll see His back.\u201dI had personally never thought about that passage in that way, so it had a profound impact upon me and I saw it immediately as the core truth, a tenet of faith. And, what can thrill more than to find a core truth in the pages of a book?I will not expound on the story that is here, other than to say it is riveting and perhaps as allegorical as Pilgrim\u2019s Progress without ever seeming to be so. I could relate so much of what happens to events we have seen time and again here on earth. I could feel the anguish and confusion of Sandoz, who has given wholly of himself and feels that God has rejected his offering. It is the feeling that sparked the hatred in Cain to kill Abel, it is the most basic of needs--to have our love returned, it is the thing that makes us human and can make us inhumane. If you have not read The Sparrow, I cannot urge you strongly enough to do so. If you read The Sparrow, you will read Children of God. Who could leave Sandoz without knowing his fate?"}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "[First and foremost, can we just talk real quick about how Sofia didn't die in The Sparrow? Did anyone else get that on their first reading? I didn't. I thought it was pretty well state that Sofia was killed with the others, that Emilio was the only survivor, that there was a blood-bath. So for us to find out in the sequel that, huzzah, Sofia survived, and aren't we all so happy? just felt a bit... forced. Like there needed to be something else to this story, so let's bring back someone that everyone thought was dead. This may just be me, so be it. It just didn't work for me.I didn't mind so much that her son, Isaac, has autism. I thought that was well-written and interesting as far as \"twists\" go, and the fact that Sofia got pregnant under such questionable circumstances anyway made me wonder if her offspring would have a disability or disorder. This is answered in the form of autism. I could have done without someone making some comment about Isaac not being a \"normal\" child - I understand the book was written in the late 90s, but it took place far into the future - one would think there would be more education and acceptance in the future. Imagine characters that don't call children with autism abnormal.As far as Emilio, he continues to be the strongest character as far as I'm concerned. There were these other characters back on Earth with him that I don't think I could differentiate between if you threatened my life, so I found that frustrating... and unnecessary. I'm not sure I could tell you the importance of some of them. Their traits could have been wrapped up into one character instead of two or three, and nothing would have been lost by doing so.A large annoyance actually came in the form of Gina, Emilio's new love interest. So, so unnecessary. I get the point but it's not an effort I felt needed to be made. In addition, Gina has a kid (who is at least lucky enough to have a bad-ass name like Celestina); more tugging at the heart-strings, right? Anytime there's a child involved, there's going to be more emotional baggage for the reader, right?So there's Celestina. And Isaac. And Supaari also had a kid (or whatever they call their offspring). So there are all these kids in this story, and I hate that. That's like Full House bringing in those freaking twin boys because Mary-Kate and Ashley were getting too old to hold their own as the \"cute kids\" on the show. Every long-running show does something stupid like bringing fresh-faced kids on to help with ratings, and it's usually the kiss of death. It's unfortunate, yet it continues to happen - it bugs me just as much when it happens in literature because it's even less necessary since we can't see any of the characters anyway, there's nothing lost by not bringing in cute kids.The need to bring Emilio back to Rakhat... ugh. It was pretty intense in the first book where they were all like \"Yeah, that sucked for you, man, but we need you to suck that up and go back. We're doing it anyway, kthx.\" And here they beat him up and make him go. I understand the author felt there was no other way to reasonably get Emilio to agree (based on the interview at the back of my copy) but it just felt like a cop-out way to get him there. And then they get there, and... what was the purpose again?Lastly, I didn't like the focus on Supaari and perspectives from him, Ha'anala, or any other inhabitant of Rakhat. The most I read from their perspective, the more I felt I was reading from Jar-Jar Binks' perspective. Twitching ears, smacking each other with their tails... nope. Just didn't work for me. I know that's something that would work for many readers, I know it's not atypical for science fiction, but just because these books are less sci-fi than fiction-based-on-mostly-historical-events-on-Earth-but-put-on-another-planet, the characterizations of these inhabitants were irritating for me to read.

I was so happy to see some of the characters from that book in this one. It\u2019s my favorite kind of science fiction: character driven and thought provoking. This one had me sobbing at the end.This is a fascinating study of human and other sentient being psychology and cultural and social anthropology, which is how I saw it what with my predilections, and because my personal philosophy differs from many of these characters and from most people, I did not see it as a story about G-d or religion.

She writes very interesting characters although in this book I felt as though the plot got bogged down at a few points and it took me some time to warm up to many of the new characters. I felt impatient occasionally which did not happen with The Sparrow. I also feel outrage that (unless I missed it?) a certain character did not tell another something that would have been of great solace to him and that also would have also been better for the story, I think.This book could work as a stand alone book but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone who hasn\u2019t read The Sparrow. I don\u2019t think this book is as well crafted as The Sparrow but I can\u2019t conceive of reading The Sparrow without finding how this story continues and what happens with the characters and their descendents. I now think of these two as one book.As a vegan both these two Mary Doria Russell books gave me much \u201cfood for thought\u201d and I think that was even more so with Children of God than it was with The Sparrow.If I wasn\u2019t reading this as a continuation of The Sparrow it would have probably received only 3 and maybe only 2 stars from me."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.0 to 4.5 stars.

The latter was one of the best books I picked up this year but the sequel was disappointing. My friend Brooke thought a sequel was unnecessary and, as far as the storyline in the first installment went, it was unnecessary. The story had a satisfying ending in The Sparrow, but the book was so good, I was sure hoping for more. Other reviewers found CoG to be boring and confusing. There were places, actually many places, that I found this to be true. This was particularly true while I felt mired in the tedium of Rakhat politics and VaRahkati civil war. The first story seemed to magically flow from the author; the second felt like the author was really just working to put out a second installment. Book one focused on the earthlings; book two focused on two less interesting alien cultures.I almost never complain that a book was too long. I love long books. I love long books that have substance throughout. In so many places in CoG I felt I was reading fluff.Now that I've gotten all the bashing off my chest, here's how I feel in the end. The Sparrow was such an extraordinary book that I have to give the author the benefit of the doubt and concede that maybe and just, maybe I might have missed something and might have to read this one again to fully appreciate it. Nah, that's bologna, the book was a disappointment. But I do not regret the time spent reading it and I will read it again at another time and if I have a greater appreciation, I promise I'll come back and be more complementary. Otherwise, 3 stars is the best that I can give this sequel whose predecessor deserved the highest of ratings and praise.As far as the narration went, it was very good.

It begins well enough but loses steam about halfway through.I liked the second revealing look at the events which occurred at the end of The Sparrow, even though the author cheats: it turns out that something you thought happened in the first book didn't really happen. The new characters aren't as well-developed as the original set, and I thought the aliens were more interesting when they were more mysterious.Don't expect a more realistic plot. The crew of this second Jesuit mission is even more ridiculous than the first one, and the alien society seems terribly fragile, such that a few bumbling humans can cause a planet-wide revolution. Emilio Sandoz is at the center of the story again, and at one point I felt that the author's treatment of him was verging on emotional pornography. How many more times was she going to give the man a glimpse of peace and then snatch it away? But I needn't have worried.

Never mind that an entire species has almost been annhilated via a civil war. Never mind that the delicate ecology of a planet has been catastrophically changed. Never mind that all this has resulted from the Jesuits spiritual quest. We're apparently supposed to be happy that Sandoz has found peace???I just found it all flawed, both plotwise and morally.

His body may be healed but his soul is still in turmoil, and the last thing he wants is to return to the place where all other members of the mission met their deaths. But then \u2026.Once again Russell gives us a morality play in a science fiction setting. I marvel at how richly imagined and intricately detailed the world of Rakhat and its inter-dependent species are. We learn what those first explorers \u2013 as well as the Runa and Jana\u2019ata \u2013 misunderstood about these new cultures and how small mistakes led to devastating consequences. Russell shows that the influence of the humans, despite their original intention to merely observe, has drastically changed the natural balance that had existed and even led to civil war. Even more than the first book, Russell plays with time and location, moving back and forth between Earth and Rakhat, between the \u201cpresent\u201d and the future. Time is relative, after all. This is a difficult technique to pull of and Russell does is marvelously well. However \u2026 there is one segment where she takes the characters into the future to have one of the Jana\u2019ata explain what had happened when the humans were still traveling. This automatically lessens some of the suspense because we know the humans live. Was this done to give us hope? To reinforce the message that bad things can happen to good people? I found it jarring and felt I had missed something important until I recognized the jump in time. This novel is also much more philosophical than her first book. The characters have significant conversations about their purpose and beliefs; they consider and are sometimes forced to listen to \u201cthe other side of the story,\u201d changing their (and the reader\u2019s) initial impressions of what has happened and why. And, as is suggested by the title, the story is very spiritual. I am reminded of the closing lines of John Gillespie Magee Jr\u2019s poem High Flight\u201cAnd, while with silent lifting mind I've trodThe high untrespassed sanctity of space,Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.\u201dIt\u2019s a fascinating story, and gave me much to think about, so why not 5 stars? Somehow the novel lacked the impact of Russell\u2019s first work. I think that was because too much time was spent on the civil war and various Runa and Jana\u2019ata characters, and less time was spent with Sandoz and Mendes. THAT was the story I really wanted to know about and I felt a little disappointed in how little of the novel involved them. Additionally, as a sequel I cannot really recommend it to everyone I meet \u2026 you must have read \nThe Sparrow\n first. Anna Fields does a marvelous job performing the audio book. She has good pacing and her ease with pronouncing all those different names and foreign phrases is admirable. Her gift for voices and dialect makes it very easy to differentiate the many characters (mostly male) in the novel. Makes me wonder if Russell had the potential for audio in mind when she created the multi-cultural cast of characters."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike", "userReview": "Children of God is the by-design sequel to The Sparrow.Should you pick up this book before having read The Sparrow, carefully take it out and place it carefully on the table/bookcase/floor and walk away as if it was filled with aging (and unstable) TNT. Locate a copy of The Sparrow and read it. Then and only then should you retrieve this book and commence to read it. You may not like either book, but you will thank me for this.Because this is a true sequel, it dovetails completely with The Sparrow. At least half of this book explains what happens at the end of its predecessor and how that affected the central character. The rest tells new stories and throws a zinger at you from the opening. Like the first novel, the book is split into different timelines and stories, but instead of being a clear before and after, it is all part of the \u201cafter\u201d. Personally, I found the interleaved stories to flow more consistently than they did in The Sparrow, but there were still points at which I was frustrated by it. It settles down more (like the first novel) in the last quarter of the book.I am not going to write too much about the plot or contents of the book. It\u2019s too easy to spoil things for another reader. I think that this book requires more fortitude and grit on the part of the reader because so much of the material is dark. Suffering, misery, abuse, and hatred are expressed and examined at great length. This isn\u2019t gratuitous: they make the characters stronger and the novel depends on the depths of these emotions in order to create the story as we are meant to experience it.As usual, I have forestalled looking at anyone else\u2019s review before composing this, but I have read that the author thinks that many people like this novel better than the first. I can\u2019t say that is true for me. I liked the inventiveness that went into the first one; new languages, a culture and a whole world were created. In this novel we deal more with the frailness of humans and our beliefs as well as how one people overthrow another. Less is made up from the author\u2019s mind, but she delves deeper into our psyche. I think both novels are powerful books well-written and full of ideas, but as they are so very different, there is no better or worse in an objective sense. At a personal level I am more in tune with the discovery of an ET world and the voyage to explore it. So I would say that I liked The Sparrow better on that basis.In any event, read The Sparrow and then read Children of God. Four-and-one-half (4.5) stars .

I liked this one a lot, but not quite on the same level. In the first book, I was addicted to both the characters and the story. With this book I was still addicted to the characters, and I did enjoy the story, but I wasn\u2019t as thoroughly caught up in it. The format is similar to the first one. We have two main time periods set several years apart, each of which continue from where the two main time periods in the first book left off. There\u2019s also a third time period that we see only occasionally, taking place further in the future. In the first book, the mystery of how we got from point A (the earlier time period) to point B (the later time period) was a large part of what held my interest. In this book, the story was more straight-forward despite the different timelines. They were more like separate stories that converged, rather than two ends of the same story as in the first book. There were some surprises, and it held my interest well, but I wasn\u2019t reading it with that same desperate desire to fill in the missing pieces. Some of the new characters introduced in the book were less likeable, although I did love how the author gave some of the characters more shades of gray. I think there were arguably more complex characters in this book, and I liked that. I also liked that we got to know some of the characters on the alien planet better. On the other hand, I missed the banter and fun that appeared more frequently in the first book.I guess this review is more a comparison of the two books than a review of this book on its individual merits, but it\u2019s hard not to compare them and it probably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to read this book without having read the first one. The author does provide the necessary back story, but I think the emotional buildup from the first book goes a long way toward creating the investment and interest necessary for this book. I probably would have rated this lower if I hadn\u2019t read it straight after the first. I\u2019m giving it 4.5 stars on the sites where I can give half stars, but I had a very hard time deciding whether to round up or down on Goodreads.

I really enjoy Russell's writing, so I had high hopes for this one. To be honest, though, it comes off like she was writing fanfiction about her own work. (Spoiler Alert) Like \"Author's Note: This is a fic where Sofia actually didn't die and she lives on Rakhat and Emilio is going to get married then he gets kidnapped and taken back and there's like this huge ass war on Rakhat. Please R and R!\"I really admired Russell's non-linear style in book 1, but here she jumps around so much that it's honestly hard to determine what happened when.The characters themselves don't exactly fit in with the characterization from The Sparrow. Sofia is the most problematic - in The Sparrow, she was a semi-devout Jew, at least devout enough to travel to Israel for a mikveh and she mentions at least once \"the ashes of the six million.\" And she was a survivor of the \"Second Kurdish War.\" In Children of God, she basically authors genocide. No joke. Given her background and apparent concern for the Holocaust, for this character to incite a war with a little 'final solution to the Jana'ata problem' on the side makes no logical sense. Despite Sofia's strong sympathy with the Runao, one would think that a Jewish character who had survived a war wouldn't, let's see now, behave exactly like Hitler. Unless this was some kind of very poorly rendered metaphor/life lesson of which I've missed the point entirely.The idea that a handful of humans could cause such upheaval on Rakhat is rather blatant imperialism. Despite their professed politically correct sensitivity that all on Earth will have reached by the 2016, the characters from the Sparrow and Children of God have no respect for the Rakhati way of doing business (ie Jana'ata eating the Runao. The Runao are basically cool with this until the humans show up). The humans manipulate intelligent beings (capable of transmitting signals to Earth when Earth can't figure out how to transmit signals to them) into doing \"World War II Except With Aliens\" and completely reversing a society that has been established since time immemorial. Yeah. And then...Heeeerrre they come to save the daaaaaayyyyy!!! Another Jesuit mission!! Emilio Sandoz who gets some kind of redemption or something! Reunited and it feels to good to play Simon Wiesenthal to Sofia \"Himmler\" Mendes. When those 'stupid aliens' epicfail and the Jana'ata are nearly extinct, the new crop of Jesuits fixes everything and everyone lives in peace and harmony, the end. And there's some kind of boring subplot with Sofia's autistic son. It doesn't have much to do with the book, aside from letting Russell's camera stay mostly on the humans.Honestly, it's not a terrible book. If you loved The Sparrow, you might like Children of God.

Also, Children of God is an absolutely amazing book in its own right, but it is very different than The Sparrow. If you come to it expecting more of the same, you will be very disappointed. On the other hand, The Sparrow will still knock your socks off after reading Children of God. If you just can't stand spoilers, and have to read things in order, I recommend taking a long break between The Sparrow and Children of God, so that all the characters feel like old friends you forgot you'd lost.)Every time I pick it up again, I walk around saying, \"I forgot how GOOD this book is!\" to anyone who doesn't run away fast enough.

The dialogue alone is worth 7/5 stars.

There is a great deal of heartbreak in Children of God, but it is the kind that makes you feel like a better person afterward, and I have tried to giggle and sob simultaneously so many times it's a miracle I have survived loving this for so long. Children of God continues the Jesuits In Space story of the disastrous first encounter between earthlings and extraterrestrials told in The Sparrow. With a sense of humor that is dry, piercing, and tender, Russell delves deeper into ruin than any other book I've ever read. She deftly takes each character's world apart, wipes them off, and sends them back into the ring.All the protagonists want to kill each other. There are no bad guys. No, that's not true. There's a bad guy. You'll be glad he's there so there's at least SOMEWHERE you can point your pain and rage. He's not really that important, except when he is.
