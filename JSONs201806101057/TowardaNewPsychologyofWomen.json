That's how selfish I am. She explains all with examples and suggests solutions when she can but apparently I can't have enough. I suggest this to all interested in other modes of life, one better than we are already suffering in because it's just too damn destructive, suppressive, inflexible, male dominant, inhumane and unwomanly."}, {"userName": "Sally Duros", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1020875-sally-duros", "userReview": "This is a brilliant and ground-breaking book, with ideas that will always be fresh and true. It inspired me to write the following essay. Women whistle in conflict and cause growthPosted on January 23, 2003By Sally DurosOriginally published Sally\u2019s World, January 10, 2003http://www.sallyduros.com/women-whist...Did you see that TIME Magazine chose three women as their persons of the year? Sharing the honor are Cynthia Cooper of Worldcom, Coleen Rowley of the FBI and Sherron Watkins of Enron.On its cover TIME dubbed them \u201cThe Whitleblowers.\u201d In the photo, the three women look at the camera straight on, stern-faced, arms crossed, silhouettes dramatically lit, their hair framing their faces like haloes. They look annoyed, a bit like moms who\u2019ve caught their 10-year olds throwing firecrackers at each other in the basement.The photo portrait of this triumvirate doesn\u2019t exactly fit the formula of what we think of as \u201cout of the box\u201d thinkers, but that is precisely what they are. To think out of the box is to be truly radical. It\u2019s not simply to zig when you see a sign that says \u201czag,\u201d but to blaze with a light that signals a whole new direction. It\u2019s a risk and it\u2019s a signal of what\u2019s to come.And in stepping out of the box, what did these three expose? Conflict, pure and simple. The conflict between what their organizations said they were doing and what they were REALLY doing.I understand why TIME called them whistleblowers, but the term can be seen as, well, negative. It brings to mind other words like snitch and disgruntled. None of these women went to the press. The press went to them when their internal memos were leaked. None of them had an ax to grind. They all loved their jobs and believed in their organizations. As TIME says in its report, they are more like \u201cthe truest of the true believers.\u201dIf not whistleblowers, then what to call them? These three \u201cPersons of the Year\u201d wriggled just as uncomfortably with being called heroes or role models.Here\u2019s a proposal: Let\u2019s call them a harbinger.And here\u2019s why. Like the first robins of spring, our \u201cPersons of the Year\u201d are a signal of new growth to come in the cultures of our organizations.If you read the TIME reports about what they did and why they did it, you will see that they were motivated by a desire to help their organizations to succeed and grow. If this succeed and grow motivation sounds like a \u201cchick\u201d thing to you, well it has for a long time considered to be so. But since these women are a harbinger, it won\u2019t be a \u201cchick\u201d thing for long.The fact that they stood up could be a sign of an opening in our business organizations of benefit to all of us \u2013 men and women and future generations of employees. If we look beyond the headlines and read the subtext, this story is about how people \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 are driven to connect with each other in mutually enhancing relationships \u2013 inside and outside of organization.It\u2019s an opening that\u2019s been a long time coming and was effectively advanced by Jean Baker Miller in her book, Toward a New Psychology of Women. Penned in 1976 at a time of dramatic change for women, this work is, in my layperson\u2019s opinion, a work of remarkable clarity and brilliance.Baker-Miller recognized that, socially, women through their activities carry human essentials that are not valued. Of these, the most important woman\u2019s life activity is participating in growth fostering relationships \u2013 the process of acting in relationship with another person so that person can develop and grow.This is the everyday stuff of rising children, and it is often described as nurturing or mothering. But these are gender-based words that negate the fact that all people \u2013 men and women alike -want to participate in growth-fostering relationships. Baker-Miller and her colleagues call this mutual psychological development and they say that it is essential to all of life and functioning.So where do our whistleblowers/harbingers fit into this?These three were so driven to foster growth within their organizations that they risked the conflict to make the growth happen.Because women are usually subordinates, they do not actively engage in conflict with their dominants \u2013 their bosses. When the conflict is forced underground, it becomes covert, distorted and saturated with \u201cdestructive force.\u201d But conflict doesn\u2019t have to be that way, and by it\u2019s nature it is not.Conflict is actually good for us. Entered into with integrity, respect, confidence and hope, conflict is the source of all growth. \u201cThe infant would never grow if it interacted with a mirror image of itself,\u201d Baker-Miller writes. \u201cGrowth requires engagement with difference and with people embodying the difference.\u201d28 years ago in her book, Baker-Miller called on women to reclaim conflict.That is exactly what the ladies of the harbinger have done.Their actions show that we have learned at least that much \u2013 that some conflict is necessary if we are to grow. Twenty years ago, these three would have had neither the position nor the means to even ponder a conflict. The fact that they stepped forward is a very good sign.It\u2019s not the end of the road but a beginning. For a long time, many of us have questioned the values of our institutions. We have looked for evolution to a more responsive organization that is more tolerant of authenticity. There\u2019s been a lot of dissatisfaction but few guideposts to the next destination. Many of us have wondered how we have gotten into this mess and how we will get out of it.\u201cOne adopts measures in keeping with his past training\u2013and the very soundness of this training may lead him to adopt the wrong measures. People may be unfitted by being fit in an unfit fitness,\u201d said the noted theorist of rhetoric, Kenneth Burke, who Baker-Miller quotes in her book.That\u2019s good for a giggle and it\u2019s also true. Our three harbingers have pushed back against the \u201cunfit fitness.\u201dWith a little luck, they have cleared a path and planted a tiny seed for a new type of organization, one that is geared toward engendering authenticity and relationships of mutual growth.And one that will allow us to have a good, clean fight when we need to.Toward a New Psychology of WomenJean Baker Miller"}, {"userName": "Chalice", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16349463-chalice", "userReview": "Eye-opening and not what I expected. I may be female, but before reading this book I never identified as feminist because it felt too aggressive and direct to me. But Jean Baker-Miller illustrated concepts and ideas that relate to all types of people. She writes with compassion to both genders. The book is a bit outdated and controversial, but taking into account the time period it was written, it's still extremely applicable in our everyday experiences today. This is an essential book for anyone that wants to become more aware of the things we all see but don't notice. And definitely essential for mental health professionals."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861950-rachel", "userReview": "It's simplistic, problematic, heteronormative, dated--and absolutely necessary.

In today's times it feels jarring to read so many broad generalizations and blanket definitions about who is a woman, while remaining completely silent on race (Sojourner Truth asked 'ain't I a woman?' in 1851) or queerness. However, still powerful is the critical re-framing of freudian psychoanalysis as the psychology of patriarchy and perhaps of oppression itself. Whether or not collaboration and the need for connection with others are \"female\" or \"woman's\" natural skills/strengths, it seems apparent today that these are the strengths of any oppressed group. All in all, I still found it helpful to read such generalizations about women, because they were and are still beliefs throughout the world, even in places that feel that women and men are equal."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/361370-anna", "userReview": "Somewhat outdated in the way that Feminine Mystique is outdated, but sadly not outdated enough. Sigh.\"Because our image of human possibilities is built on what men have done and what men have said is possible, we have not been able to conceive of more than \"man\" as so far defined. We are left believing that while many people [read: many women] have impulses that are generous, kind, and responsive to other human beings, at bottom, they are selfish, self-seeking, and out for themselves... We might say that one of the major issues before us as a human community is the question of how to create a way of life that includes serving others without being subservient... As suggested at the outset, women today have a highly developed basis for this social advance.\" (p. 71)Good stuff. The author articulates some major issues for female and male dissatisfaction with the dominant-passive structure that exists. She suggests that moving beyond it would not only extend the limits of social possibilities by including female strengths and creativity, but would also allow men to become more whole people, as they would incorporate these strengths into their psyches as well."}, {"userName": "Geraldine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7159537-geraldine", "userReview": "Written in 1976 and updated in the 80s this book is still relevant for people wanting to address/change for the better expectations of gender roles individually and at a societal level.She argues for a new co-operative approach.
