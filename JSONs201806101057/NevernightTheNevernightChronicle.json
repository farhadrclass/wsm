It pained, O readers, it pained! Persevere, I thought. Quitting now would be a mark of failure, like a baby bird that flutters its wings for the very first time, stretching them out with the promise, the hope, of flight, only to return, defeated, to its nest.I didn't finish it. Judge away, O readers, judge away, but I could not force myself through. It was a nightmare. I was so freaking bored. And I had to go read the blurb to remind myself what the book was about. Nevernight is so difficult to get through that I got to a point where I was just counting the pages until I could return to Tana French. Ulysses is easier to read than this book.You know what it reminds me of? \nShatter Me\n. A denser version. I once said that Shatter Me was not a novel; it was a collection of similes and metaphors that do not make sense. That is a fantastic description for this book! A collection of similes and metaphors that do not make sense. Clearly this works for a lot of people, but it was not for me.The book is heavy. Lots of descriptions, overuse of similes and metaphors (did I mention that they don't make sense?) until I had no idea what was going on. I read sentences and thought \"Huh?!\" It hurt trying to figure out what Kristoff was saying. There were the ones that I understood but were so eyeroll-worthy that I wished I didn't:\n\"Mia sighed. Took her temper by the earlobe and pulled it to heel.\"\nAnd then there were all the ones that I really just didn't understand:\nThe girl felt the words in her chest. In the deepest, darkest place, where the hope children breathe and adults mourn withered and fell away, floating like ashes on the wind.**If her face were a puzzle, most would put it back in the box, unfinished.**Something had followed her from that place. The place above the music where her father died. Something hungry. A blind, grub consciousness, dreaming of shoulders crowned with translucent wings. And she, who would gift them.\nNo, seriously, what the fuck is happening?And everything is so overwritten and melodramatic. To borrow the quote Anna used: \"She introduced her boot to his partner's groin, kicking him hard enough to cripple his unborn children.\"???????????????? Just say you kicked him in the balls! ^This does not better writing make.I can't do it. I'm going to go bury myself in a place where love blossoms and life finds itself carried away on the wings of wonder.

I sigh. Twisted my head. Arched my back like a mewling kitten towards its mother, hungry, afraid, an innocent newcomer in this cruel, cold world. My head ached. An unbelievable pain like a knife to the head, hilt broken like a katana sword struck by a bullet, in a fight between a samurai and a cowboy. I sat up. The chair let out a squeak, the noise of an newborn mouse. How can I describe the pain. The suffering! The eternal twilight of the endless night. The soul-sucking misery. The mind-numbing boredom worse than any kind of liquid nitrogen reaching 0 Kelvin. O hapless imagery! O destruction of the English language. How I beseech thee, book, to stop thus!Ok, I'm done. I hurt myself writing that.Do you like descriptions? No, I mean, do you really like descriptions? Do you like overwrought metaphors and a criminal use of adjectives? If you do, then dang diddly if this book isn't written just for you!I read my fair share of bodice rippers. Books in which a love scene is dragged out in excrutiating minutiae and flowery language so flowery you could choke on the scent (see what I did there? Har har har). I have rarely read a love scene so overblown and contrived as the --honestly, I don't know what to call it -- thing at the beginning of this book. And that's just the beginning. To sum it up: the writing is atrocious (to me, who knows, you might like it), the plot is convoluted and barely detectable between the clusterfuckery of purple prose.Reader, I abandoned this book."}, {"userName": "Catriona (LittleBookOwl)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365999-catriona-littlebookowl", "userReview": "This is a new favourite.*EDIT*Upon a re-read, definitely a favourite.

I don't feel like I have any consistent self I'm just dragging someone's body through time and space. My heart would actually bleed if I had any fluids left in my body. I haven't cried in so long and I guess there was so much building up, I was just a clogged pore and now it's like someone's run my soul over with a steamroller and all I feel is flat.anyway before I start with this review, I'd like to formally call jay kristoff out on being a brilliant son of a bitch and I'd like to know: did he cry when he killed off my favs or did he smile and laugh then have a cup of fragrant tea with satan?? because this book was the spiritual equivalent of being stabbed 8 times in the fucking jugulars and I swear to god if I feel an emotion one more time I'm going to actually snap!!\n\u201c\u2026 the brighter the light, the deeper the shadows\u201d\nso what is nevernight about?\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a rumor. A whisper. The thought that wakes the bastards of this world sweating in the nevernight. The last thing you will ever be in this world, girl, is someone\u2019s hero.But you will be a girl heroes fear.\u201d\nMia Corvere, THE BISEXUAL ICON, is the heroine of this story (except I'm not really sure there are heroes in this book after all). Her father has been executed for treason under order of the Itreyan Senate while her mother and little brother have been forsaken to a godless prison. After surviving an attempted murder, Mia has vowed vengeance, but in order to do so, she must become the very monster she's hunting. Aka, she must be inducted as a Blade of the Repulbic's most feared cult and finest schools of assassins, The Red Church: think Hogwarts for murderers au where they also teach sex ed and teachers are allowed to poison their students or even hack off their arms as a retaliation for being disarmed in a sparring session. (I\u2019m not saying I wish I could retreat into this book and join it but I\u2019m also not saying i\u2019d decline if propositioned \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af )\n\u201cKillers one, killers all. And each death we bring is a prayer. An offering to Our Lady of Blessed Murder. Death as a mercy. Death as a warning. Death as an end unto itself. All of these, ours to know and gift unto the world. The wolf does not pity the lamb. The storm begs no forgiveness of the drowned.\u201d\nLuckily for her (or unluckily??), Mia Corvere is Darkin. She can control shadows and darkness itself and has a shadow daemon pet that wears the shape of a cat and drinks her fears and keeps her nightmares at bay. He's super witty and I love him and just how lonely do I have to be before some shadow animal would take pity on me and come keep me company?? just think about it, if everybody got a free miniature animal at birth that protected them, like a tiny dragon or elephant or a wolf, the world would be a better place!!Listen, nevernight is brutal. It's blood magic and dark rituals and deaths and sex and your soul will probably need a purifying face mask after this. It's confusing and hellfire beating down your back for every small minuscule turn of events and when the bits and pieces all converge into a fine point, when the target before you is ripe for the picking, you will suddenly ascend to a different galaxy of abyss and darkness BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER SEE IT COMING.\n\u201c\u2026 Those who call the Dark \u2026 well, eventually it calls them back.\u201d\nBut really, nevernight was just so fun to read. This is the kind of book you read and go \u201cHELL YEAH\u201d and keep thinking \u201cHEEELL YEEAH\u201d for a very long time. I read it everywhere, even in the car while it was dark outside and I would try to grab snatches of sentences when I passed by street lights. I just love it so much and it's so unfair because i only have one heart to work with here!!!!!I've seen reviews complain about the writing but honestly this was one of the best written books I've ever read, mainly because it was so unique and actually unlike anything i've ever encountered. Something about it evoques the image of a new york apartment with the exposed brick and a mattress on the floor, an 80s woman in a warm bubbled bath, overlooking the city below her through stately french windows. she has a beverage in her hand and this book in the other and a bereaved man in her metaphorical grasp..... and uuuhhhh, listen my brain is a weird place alright.  THE FOOTNOTES  THOUGH, I\u2019ve never laughed so hard honestly those were such a great addition to the book!!Overall, this book was quite weird and beautiful all at once but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d do it again. I think one time is enough. But since I actively enjoy self destructive behaviour, I would definitely pick it up again for a re-read if I ever get the urge to stab myself straight in the head.... not for like fatal reasons more just for like....symbolic speech.Anyways, oh look it's Mourn Your Favs pm which is a very fragile time, the veil between functioning and despair is very thin and I think it's the perfect time to go looking for a good pile of dirt to decompose in and become one with nature (except bugs) but that's just my irrelevant opinion.\n\u201cListen, girl,\u201d Aelius sniffed. \u201cThe books we love, they love us back. And just as we mark our places in the pages, those pages leave their marks on us. I can see it in you, sure as I see it in me. You\u2019re a daughter of words.

This was my first Jay Kristoff book, one I was looking extremely forward to, but boy do I want to stay away from this author in the future.

I couldn\u2019t wait to dive into it.But the reality is different. First, it\u2019s more perplexing than original and the so-called world-building that we\u2019re introduced to is overshadowed by the horrendous writing style full of figures of style I wanted to smother more than decorticate\u2026 and the heroine.The heroine whom, may I add, is a demon. I think? She\u2019s awful.

I love Mia! \nShe was atop him, knees pinning him down. His hand on her wrist and her stiletto at his throat. An age passed, somewhere between struggling and hissing and biting and begging, and finally the blade sank home, sharp and so astonishingly hard, sinking through is neck and scraping his spine. He drew sucking breath, perhaps to speak (but what could he say?) and she could see it in his eyes--pain, pain, O, Daughters, it hurt. It was inside him--she was inside him--stabbing hard as he tried to cry out, her hand over his mouth to muffle the flood.\nThat being said there will be *NO SPOILERS*This book is so freaking awesome! As wicked as it was, I cried. Yeah, that's what I do. Mia Corvere aka Pale Daughter - Kingmaker- Crow, is nothing but one bad \u2022ssed girl. Who really knows if she would have ever became that way if she didn't watch her father being executed and her mother and little brother dragged away to the prisons. She was only a child of 10, but she found mercy in a man named Mercurio. He took her in and trained her and told her to go to the Red Church by a certain time so she could train as an assassin... that is, if she lived through the trials. You see Mia wanted to take revenge on ALL who where there to break her family apart, to take them from her. And she will seek her revenge. Along the way she meets a boy named Tric and I fell right in love with him. Mia and Tric were allies and a little bit of a love interest. But this book is not about love, this book is about killing for love. Killing for revenge, killing to do what's right and some more killing in between. Mia and Tric do make it to the Red Church and they have to go through many trials. Many that kill some of them. This is no sweet little school. You could be killed at any time by other kids but mostly by your teachers so you have to be on your toes and never let your guard down. Even then there are things that are messed up. Mia is a...... and she can bring shadows to herself and sort of hide herself. She has a shadow kitty she names Mister Kindly she also picks up another shadow creature at some point but I won't discuss all of that with you. I have to say one of the memorable characters in the book for me is a horse Mia named Bastard. Kudos to Bastard for his short while in the book and keeping me entertained by giving Mia hell :-) No, he didn't die! At one point Mia has to go up for a trial and she doesn't do what everyone expects so she is going to go on a little hiatus. But..... all hell breaks loose and Mia shows what she has in her to be one of the toughest assassins in her world. It made my heart soar and proud of who she has become. Not all assassins are evil you know. Well..... I recommend this book to anyone that loves this kind of genre and you better believe it's going to be on my shelf when it comes out. I can't wait to read all of the trilogy. Although, I'm afraid to in some ways. This book is NOT a fairy tale. It is filled with bloody violence, torture, etc and so on.

The protagonist is a sixteen year old girl. Does that automatically make it YA? My editors say \u201cDefinitely not, and who the hell let you out of your cage? Get back to work\u201d.These books are about an assassin. They are, as you may expect, somewhat violent as a result. They also have sex scenes (and now I have to contemplate the fact that my mother is going to read them *shudders*).

Not YA.Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsSometimes you stumble across a book, and, for whatever reason, your expectations are low. Could be the harlequin mask on the cover, could be a previous series by the same author that you were wholly uninterested in, could be a billion different things that are individually insignificant, but cumulatively . . . You turn up you nose. O, gentlefriends . . . Do not do unto yourselves the same disservice I almost did unto mine . . . self . . . o.ONEVERNIGHT by Jay Kristoff is . . . exquisite.I almost didn't read it. Indeed, the release date sneaked up on me, tapped me on the shoulder, and waved hello on Monday afternoon, and I joked to a friend that I should at least update my status on Goodreads and pretend to be reading it . . . Six hours later, it was ten pm, and I was 40% in.The first chapter was baffling. Told from two seemingly different perspectives, it chronicles two very different firsts, but uses almost the exact same words. I was internally shouting, \"WTF is this?!\" but I was curious enough see where it led, and the further I got, the closer the two scenarios spun toward completion, and then it was over, and I saw what he'd done . . . In \nJabberwocky\n, Lewis Carroll turned the English language on its head. He used nonsense words that were decipherable because of his expert manipulation of sentence structure and other, real words, that made the meanings of his imaginary words obvious. For the first time since I really understood and appreciated what Carroll had wrought, I felt the same kind of glee as I read about a girl losing her virginity and a girl taking her first life. One experience held the potential for the creation of a new life, the other bringing an irrevocable end to a life, and yet . . . He used . . . The same words. Riddikulus writing skills aside, the story was also fantastic.What's my #1 complaint about assassins in YA fiction?You: You may have mentioned something about reluctant assassins a time or three.Me: Damn right.You: Not a problem here?Me: *laughs maniacally*\nPeople often shit themselves when they die. Their muscles slack and their souls flutter free and everything else just\u2026slips out. For all their audience\u2019s love of death, the playwrights seldom mention it. When the hero breathes his last in the heroine\u2019s arms, they call no attention to the stain leaking across his tights, or how the stink makes her eyes water as she leans in for her farewell kiss. I mention this by way of warning, O, my gentlefriends, that your narrator shares no such restraint.\nDuly noted, Mr. Narrator, sir.And lest you be scared off by visions of graphic and violent death . . . I won't lie, that is part of this story. But only part:\nShe\u2019s dead herself, now\u2014words both the wicked and the just would give an eyeteeth smile to hear. A republic in ashes behind her. A city of bridges and bones laid at the bottom of the sea by her hand. And yet I\u2019m sure she\u2019d still find a way to kill me if she knew I put these words to paper. Open me up and leave me for the hungry Dark. But I think someone should at least try to separate her from the lies told about her. Through her. By her. Someone who knew her true. A girl some called Pale Daughter. Or Kingmaker. Or Crow. But most often, nothing at all. A killer of killers, whose tally of endings only the goddess and I truly know. And was she famous or infamous for it at the end? All this death? I confess I could never see the difference. But then, I\u2019ve never seen things the way you have. Never truly lived in the world you call your own. Nor did she, really. I think that\u2019s why I loved her.\n*goosebumps*Mia Covere's tale reminded me a bit of Arya Stark's: a girl whose family is destroyed by politics and hands grasping at power, stumbles into a follower of a most murderous god(dess), and becomes his apprentice. But Mia is more than just a girl . . . She's a girl with a shadow dark enough for two.You: WTF does that mean?Me: READ THE BOOK.And how many \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n fans do we have? B/c the coolest part of that movie was the black market space station that was the HEAD OF A CELESTIAL BEING, am I right?Well, Mia grew up in Godsgrave, which just might be where the rest of the body fell . . . Okay, it's probably a different being entirely, but the concept is the same, and it's friggin' awesome:\nTo the north, the Ribs rose hundreds of feet into the ruddy heavens, tiny windows staring out from apartments carved within the ancient bone. Canals ran out from the hollow Spine . . . \nMy only words of caution are that, if you haven't already cottoned on, there is SEX in this YA novel, which isn't as uncommon as it used to be, but isn't yet unremarkable. And I'm not talking fade-to-black acknowledgment of sexual congress, I'm talking burn-your-ears, think-interesting thoughts-about-the-hands-that-penned-them sex scenes.FYI. Kristoff calls Mia an assassin who is to death what a maestro is to a symphony, but I felt the same way about Kristoff's manipulation of words and language. Whether Mia slipped into a room like a knife between the ribs or we met a man whose face was more scar than face, this reader felt like she was being spun and tossed by a master. In NEVERNIGHT, Solis might be the Shahiid of Songs, but it was Jay Kristoff who made me dance to the music of his story in ways I've rarely been moved.

But I tried, O, gentlefriends, trust me, I tried, yet completing the task of reading all 18,695 pages of this wonder-There are only 448 pages...Oh, FUCK OFF, the cat \"who is not a cat\" (why thank you I KNOW you told me one billion times already - go haunt someone else's shadow, watch over another balcony with your not-eyes would you even though I don't even want to know how THAT bloody works)Truth is, O, gentlefriends, I'm taking my life back. The 42% I read were painfully indigestible and I am very sorry if I offend 99% of my friends who love Jay Kristoff's writing but I cannot do this. I CANNOT. 1) The metaphors and similesFirst, I don't like them as a whole. While I do believe that they can add a poetic touch to a novel, if I start highlighting them, it either means that : a) they're overused ; b) they don't make any kind of sense ; c) they make me forget the story to focus on the prose, as if the writer was tapping me on the shoulder in a \"I am so clever, am I not?\" fashion.Some of them made me roll my eyes.\"Mia caught her temper by the collar, gave it a good hard shake. Clearing her throat, she brushed her crooked fringe from her eyes.\"\"Mia sighed. Took her temper by the earlobe and pulled it to heel.\"Others earned a well-deserved WTF?! \"Tric gave another half-hearted stab, but the beast had forgotten its quarry entirely, great eyes rolling as it flipped over and over, dragging its bulk back below the sand, howling like a dog who's just returned home from a hard turn's work to find another hound in his kennel, smoking his cigarillos and in bed with his wife.\"O_o\"They're led by a dozen camels, Tric. A noseless dog could follow this trail of shit in the middle of truedark. If they suddenly start trekking faster than a forty-a-turn smoker with an armload of drunken prostitutes, I think we can find them again.\"????!?!!2) Heavy wordiness and other useless descriptionsThis is a matter of taste, alright? But I can't do this? Not willingly, at least? Look, I graduated in French Literature and hence have had my fair share of wordy books for the sake of being wordy. After five years, I've come to the conclusion that this overwritten and purple writing style does not suit me. Words are meant to carry the story, and not to prove how clever and well-read the author is. Again, in my opinion anyway.\"She introduced her boot to his partner's groin, kicking him hard enough to cripple his unborn children.\"BECAUSE THAT'S A THING. Nope. That's a commonplace. I tend to find commonplaces useless. \"The horizon was crusted like a beggar's lips, scoured by winds laden with voices just beyond hearing. The second sun kissing the horizon was usually the sign for Itreya's brutal winters to begin, but out there, the heat was still blistering.\"Many of you might adore this writing. I do not. Oh, and no, before some gentle soul implies it, it is not because I'm \"used to YA\" or \"unable to 'get it'\". As I said, I can enjoy classics. Just not the ones that make me want to pull my hair out. 3) There are footnotes as a world-buildingCall it as you want, when an author uses LONG footnotes to narrate parts of the world-building, it seems like info-dumping to me. And an annoying one, at that. Honestly? I stopped reading them after two chapters : I had a hard time connecting with the story already, and would have DNFed Nevernight way faster if I had stopped every few pages to read these damn footnotes. More generally, I find it lazy to use footnotes when these legends could have been incorporated into the main story. There's also a character who speaks like a Shakespeare's lad, but at this point, I'm not even counting anymore. As much as I wanted to love Nevernight, whose blurb made it sound so captivating, I cannot stand this writing and it spoiled my read. If you add it to the facts that :1) The world-building is a mash-up between the Roman Empire, the Venice Republic, Harry Potter and The Young Elites (and surely many more) ; 2) The heroine already earned her special nemesis whose only purpose seems to glare and glare and glare again ; 3) I don't care about any of the characters whatsoever (except Tric. I did like Tric) ; 4) I don't appreciate the so-called wit of that fucking cat who is not a cat (I didn't laugh ONCE, alright?) ;5) I am BORED ; ... Well, you'll understand why Nevernight and me will part ways now, at 42%. Mark my words, though : this will be a hit. Oh, well. On my minority shelf it goes.

So please go into this book knowing this, and knowing that this is a very mature book in general.Also, before I get into my review, I want to address the problematic, hurtful, and harmful representation of the M\u0101ori people (the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand) that Jay Kristoff was inspired to base the Dweymeri race in this book from. Jay has stated, \n\u201cthe tatts aren\u2019t based off M\u0101ori designs\u201d\n but it still feels a little bad while you\u2019re reading this story, even if the Dweymeri are not direct representatives of the M\u0101ori. I just think it\u2019s important to bring this discussion up and I want everyone to know about this controversy surrounding the portrayal of this culture. I, also, do not want anyone to think that I\u2019m making excuses for it, because I am definitely not even though I did love this book. Cultural appropriation and reinforcing stereotypes will never be okay and I truly wish this element was not a part of this book, but it is, and I\u2019m not going to not bring it to your attention whether you believe it is or not. Nevernight is a story about a sixteen-year-old girl named Mia Corvere, who is on a mission for vengeance and to right the wrong that has been done to her family in the only way she knows how: killing everyone. Mia find her way into the Red Church, who worship the Goddess of murder, where she is training to become one of the deadliest assassins of all time. Also, Mia has an affinity for the shadows, which not only grants her the only companion she has ever known, but also sends her on a quest to discover more about her powers and who she really is. \n\n\u201cThe brighter the light, the deeper the shadows\u201d\n\nThis story reads like a dark version of Harry Potter, to me. From the boarding school aspect, to the magic, to how they travel through the world, to the professors and their different classes, so much of this book reminds me of the wizarding world.And even though this is a series, there is no real cliffhanger (even though you will be left wanting more), this is a full standing book that has an amazing story and that you could just read on its own. I\u2019m not sure the last time I read a book in a fantasy series that did that. This book is so sex positive, and the opening chapter of this book was so beautifully done. It is one of my favorite first chapters of all time, and I think Jay Kristoff is nothing short of a genius to have been able to write a juxtaposition that well. I mean, Jay\u2019s writing is lyrical and beautiful, too, but it\u2019s so damn smart that I can\u2019t help but be in awe of this story he has crafted.  And Mia\u2019s bisexuality is so beautifully on display. Like, all I want in my reading life is girl assassins loving each other and saving the world, and this book doesn\u2019t disappoint, even though the main \"love\" story is hetero. We need more stories with queer main protagonists that are normalized and just having their adventures and story told without a coming out story or an explanation on why they feel the way they do. Again, Jay Kristoff gets all the kudos and credit. I always pride myself in being able to see the twists coming, and I was completely blindsided by the end reveal of Nevernight! Also, for those of you who have finished, I will go down with that hate to love ship. I. WILL. GO. DOWN. WITH. THAT. SHIP. And finally, if you find yourself loving this series and wanting more, I can\u2019t recommend Mark Lawrence\u2019s Red Sister enough! It\u2019s a very reminiscent story, with perhaps more violence, but with definitely less sex, and both star queer assassin nun-like characters who study at a church. Nevernight was everything that I never knew I wanted, and it is totally just as amazing as some of the most popular and highly acclaimed adult fantasy series out there. This novel meant so very much to me, and I cannot wait to start Godsgrave as soon as humanly possible! Happy reading, everyone! \n\n\u201cThe books we love, they love us back. And just as we mark our places in the pages, those pages leave their marks on us. I can see it in you, sure as I see it in me. You\u2019re a daughter of words.

There are books, and then there are stories, with characters who take up so much space in your heart that you could never forget them, and, my friends, Mia Corvere\u2019s tale is a damn story. \n\u201cThe books we love, they love us back. And just as we mark our places in the pages, those pages leave their marks on us.\u201d\nNevernight is widely regarded by many as having a unique (and sometimes difficult to follow) format, due to the footnotes, but I wanted to go ahead and touch upon this before getting into the meat of my review. If you have DNFed this book due to the footnotes, please pick it back up. They are hilarious and odd, and relay a great deal of back story about the world of Godsgrave, but if you have a hard time keeping yourself involved in the story, skip the footnotes and come back to them later. I say this because so many of my friends and followers have told me the footnotes caused them to DNF the book, and that\u2019s a shame, truly, because this is one of the most enjoyable stories I\u2019ve ever read in my life.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a rumor. A whisper. The thought that wakes the bastards of this world sweating in the nevernight. The last thing you will ever be in this world, girl, is someone\u2019s hero.\u201d\nMia Corvere is such a lovable, yet vicious little narrator: despite her bloodthirst and desperate need for vengeance, there\u2019s something a little bit fragile and very young inside of her that I loved so much. It\u2019s like every other scene with her was simultaneously putting me in awe of how clever and strong she could be, yet making me wish I could protect her from the aches of her brutal, bloody past. She\u2019s been through hell and then some, but she has humor for days, and isn\u2019t afraid to let herself care\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t always feel as though it\u2019s in her own best interest.\n\u201cWalk softly. Learn well. May Our Lady be late when she finds you. And when she does, may she greet you with a kiss.\u201d\nMuch of the true terror of Nevernight, however, comes from the school she attends. Fantasy readers all over the world are familiar with the idea of a protagonist being sent to a boarding school, but Jay\u2019s twist on this is that the \u201cschool\u201d Mia seeks out is no Hogwarts\u2014unless Hogwarts replaced Quidditch and Transfiguration with a lot of murder, torture, poisons, and sex. The Red Church is such an incredible setting. It\u2019s painted beautifully vivid, and it\u2019s full of so many mysteries that, no matter how much I learned about it, I constantly felt that I was barely scratching the surface of what it had to offer. I would say, in fact, that just as Mia is one of my new favorite protagonists, the Red Church is easily one of my favorite settings.\nShe looked the knife over, this way and that.\u201cShould I give it a name?\u201d\u201cYou could, I suppose. But what\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this bit.\u201d She touched the blade\u2019s tip. \u201cThe part you stick them with.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s not all bloodshed, betrayal, and sex\u2014it\u2019s also a lot of humor, a bit of unlikely alliance-forming (and friendship), and a monster-filled library with the most fascinating and lovable caretaker you\u2019ve ever seen. (Honestly, I could have happily spent chapter upon chapter simply watching Mia sift through this library.) The book also constantly breaks the fourth wall by addressing its reader, which is such a fun and unique spin on storytelling that I found myself constantly tabbing pages for no reason other than the phrasing was so distinct and fantastic. Even if I had never read The Illuminae Files, this book would have quite easily been plenty to convince me that Jay Kristoff belongs on my auto-buy list forever.\n\u201cThe wolf does not pity the lamb. The storm begs no forgiveness of the drowned.\u201d\nI could really ramble and gush about this book, and how much I adore Mia, for days on end, but the end result would still be the same: me trying and failing to explain to you all how much I adored this story, how much I desperately want to read everything and anything that Jay ever writes, and how certain I am that each and every one of you needs to pick this book up if you are any sort of fantasy fan at all, because it is truly worth every second of your time.You can find this review and more on my blog, or you can follow me on twitter, bookstagram, or facebook!"}, {"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014021-katerina", "userReview": "Nevernight, gentlefriends, is an O, so bloody piece of Art.It is not for the faint-hearted.

Jay Kristoff is not one to shy away from brutality, nor he sugarcoats the actions and the motives of his characters.

But mind that this is not necessarily a bad thing, gentlefriends. Because the ugly and the raw is infused with rare moments of beauty, and humanity.

I think it's important to let other readers know if I received a book for free, or was sent it for comment, or if it was written by a friend. I hope that I don't let such things affect how I read a book, but in these days of commercial hype, I think it's best to be completely transparent!So, I was sent this book by the editor. I took several weeks to read this book, not because it didn't grab me, but because it somehow was lost in the guest bedroom when I was in midread. Books do have a habit of wandering about my house. This is the tale of a youngster who suffers a devastating and terrifying loss of her family. And born of that loss, gains a dark companion to her days.(Wow. So hard to write this well without a bunch of spoilers!)She decides to seek the skills she will need both for vengeance and in the hopes she can rescue some of those she has lost. To gain those skills, she must first serve a hard apprenticeship, and then attempt to get herself to an almost mythical place and school to continue her training.Okay. That's as close as I'm going to get to spoilers. Asked about this book at a signing, I blurted out that it's like Hogwarts, but with a violence and sex. Not the best blurb I've ever given, yet I do think that it gives a hint to what you will encounter. And I liked, very much, that there is honesty and directness in examining what certain kinds of training would do to a person's mind and morality. Our lead character faces some terribly difficult choices, and she makes them in a way that is believable and wrenching.Office Kat also read this book, and her observation was, \"The author really knows his characters.

Yup, we have an awesome shadow holding the figure of a cat that has no face and is sarcastic 101% of the time. Thank you Jay Kristoff for creating something that\u2019s out of my reach \ud83d\ude42. Before this goes out of hand, I would like to also point out that Mia is not your average protagonist? antagonist? it really depends on every reader\u2019s perspective but that\u2019s absolutely why this book is so bloody interesting. One thing for sure is that you can\u2019t not love her. Getting to read about her early childhood, what made her be this way and how she continues to live is how I imagine riding a rollercoaster that has no ending point, would be. Jittery, exciting, thrilling, sickly, longing for it to stop. And I say that because the beginning was pretty slow in terms of info dump and whatnot but going into chapter 7 and beyond, is where the \u201cstuff\u201d actually starts to happen and boy are they unforgivable in the best of terms, of course. I loved the writing. It can take a little while to get used to but it\u2019s written from a third-person omniscient point of view with footnotes integrated which are, by the way, hilarious like 85% of the time. The setting of Nevernight is also incredible and I personally don\u2019t think it can go wrong when there are gorgeous maps included.

A cold whisper in her ear. 'Never fear. And never, ever forget.\"\n\nThis is honestly the hardest book for me to rate/review. I hated it so much but loved it at the same time. So I'm still sitting on the fence about my rating, I think 2.5 stars is the fairest rating for this book, not great but not terrible. Firstly I must mention the writing, I just don't know how to feel about it, I'm leaning more towards hate. The writing itself is very flowery and descriptive, it's full of terrible metaphors and similes. So I found it extremely overwhelming and annoying, I also grew to hate the useless footnotes despite some of them being hilarious. It distracted me from the story. I understand some people love this lyrical writing style and see the beauty in it, however I'm a simpleton and saw no beauty. It honestly made me at time not want to pick the book back up. Some descriptions were so long and unnecessary, like I mean they didn't even make sense at all. So half the time I was rereading what I just read and thinking \"dafuq is that shite\". Example; \n\"If her face were a puzzle, most would put it back in the box, unfinished.\"\n That quote made me want to put this book back in the box unfinished, but I didn't I forced myself to read on. Why? Well firstly because the main character is AMAZING, secondly there was a lot of badassery going on; \n\"People often shit themselves when they die. Their muscles slack and their souls flutter free and everything else just \u2026 slips out.\"\nSo considering that the cons out weighed the pros, I'm going to say that this book was extremely average for me. I loved some of the quotes and I appreciate the differentness of the novel but there was too many tropes and that writing.. *shudders*.\n\n\"Iron or glass? They'd asked.Mia clenched her jaw. Shook her head.She was neither.She was steel.\"\n\nThe story follows a girl named Mia, her whole family is killed and she swears revenge. Mia is sent to a school where they train killers. But there is more to Mia then meets the eye, she has a special gift she must learn to use before she becomes a killer of killers. If I were to right now look past the writing and rate the story I would give it four stars, despite containing the whole school/competition trope and having a mean girl bully like every book these days, it was interesting, the magic system is definitely unique and I'm happy with the character development. I think I should talk about Mia now (I'm really gonna gush because she's my animal spirit). Mia is incredible, seriously everyone needs to go and read this novel now, if you hate the writing just read it for Mia, she's my perfect bloodstained psycho snowflake. O'gentlefriends, trust me when I say Mia is a badass. \n\u201cCock is just another word for \u2018fool.\u2019 But you call someone a cunt, well \u2026\u201d The girl smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re implying a sense of malice there. An intent. Malevolent and self-aware. Don\u2019t think I name Consul Scaeva a cunt to gift him insult. Cunts have brains, Don Tric. Cunts have teeth. Someone calls you a cunt, you take it as a compliment. As a sign that folk believe you\u2019re not to be lightly fucked with.\u201d A shrug. \u201cI think they call that irony.\u201d\n Unfortuntely when I think of female characters as assassins my first thought goes to Calaena from Throne of Glass, I know what your thinking.. Why do I even consider that loser as a proper assassin? The thing is I don't. but she has stained female assassins for me forever, she's not a badass just a joke, imo. Fortunately in this novel we are given Mia, who thankfully is the complete opposite to Calaena, Mia is a blood thirsty, cigarillo smoking, smart mouthed, sassy as fuck, badass warrior assassin who actually kills people and does her job instead of farting around a castle, eating cake, complaining about period pain and staring in the mirror. Mia is everything Calaena should have been. I love her. \n\n\"At the heart of it, two kinds of people live in this world or any other: those who flee and those who fight. Your kind has many terms for the latter sort. Berserker. Killer instinct. More balls than brains.\"\n\nAnother thing this novel is not YA, the author even said so himself on his blog. This is an adult coming of age story, YES the MC is 16 years old but that doesn't mean this book is a YA! It talks about the nitty gritty of being a female, periods, first time sex & crushes. But that's where the YA stops. This book is warped and I can't recommend you enough to keep your young kids away. There was a part in this story that surprised me at the warpedness of it. Mia imagined stabbing someone and riding them at the same time and was turned on by this thought!!! Incredible scene but definitely O' gentlefriends not for children. It also contained torture, a lot of death, swearing & more death. Okay while we are still kinda on the subject of sex this book contains the most horrendously written sex scene my poor eyes has ever read. It was a disgrace. Worst then SJM sex scenes... In future can this author not call a penis a root?! Wtf.. I've read some pretty questionable sex scenes in my life but the one in this book tops it. I actually felt embarrassed after reading it and I have no idea why. \n\n\"I appear to have misplaced the fucks I give for what you think...\"\n\nPretty much an okay read for me, I think most people would love this book tho. Despite it being boring as hell in the middle and having extremely over used tropes, I found myself satisfied at the conclusion.I nearly forgot to mention HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS COVER IS. I feel blessed by its beauty. I actually love all three covers, like they are probably one of my all time favorite book covers. Ever.\n\n\"You've got the look of a girl who's no stranger to the page.

Did I mention blood?I was a bit wary going into Nevernight. Other reviews I've stumbled upon prior to reading were either very positive or very negative. Once I got a taste of the first few chapters, I started to understand the struggle that some readers were having with Nevernight.Sadly, the beginning of the story went by painfully slow. The writing was VERY dense and verbose, and I constantly found myself zoning out or not understanding a single thing that was happening. Though I have an appreciation for poetic writing, I do prefer and enjoy simple, straightforward prose over flowery language. In other words, Jay Kristoff's writing will either make or break your Nevernight reading experience. Some readers won't be able to move past the dense writing and give a negative review based on the writing alone. Others are able to tread through the book and look past the writing without trouble. Although I did struggle in the beginning, I was slowly but surely able to get through the book. After about a hundred pages or so, the story does indeed pick up once we get to the Red Church. Therefore, I do recommend readers to be patient because once Nevernight picks up, boy does it take off in a run! The writing doesn't necessarily get any better but reading becomes much easier as the book progresses.Once the actual story started going, the twists and turns never stopped coming! I was constantly on my toes anticipating the next blood bath that I knew was headed our way. It took me a little longer to warm up to the characters but once I did, I fell completely in love with everyone, minor character or not. Mia was probably one of the most kick-butt heroines I've ever read about. She was nowhere near the most beautiful, the most perfect, or even the strongest, but she still whooped some butt! I loved her friendship with Tric, Ashlinn, and Charlotta. I even enjoyed Mia's rivalry against Jessamine. Oh and sneaky, little Hush! This book just had so many notable supporting characters that each added their own flair into the mix. This whole group of assassins-to-be would literally be squad goals if they ever decided to stop trying killing one another!There was very little romance in Nevernight much to my disappointment since I am, in fact, a sucker for being a hopeless romantic. At first the romance seemed a little... random. Romantic feelings were evident but barely acknowledged or acted upon until these characters decided to spontaneously go to um... third base on a random nevernight. It was very steamy. Random. But steamy nonetheless! If you were hoping for a book with tons of heartfelt romance, then you probably won't get too much of that in Nevernight. Just steamy sex!Surprisingly, Nevernight reminded me a lot of Harry Potter. The Red Church was practically Hogwarts for assassins in place of witches and wizards. The Shahiids were the professors, the halls were the different classes, and so forth. If that alone doesn't make you want to pick this book up then I don't know what will!

A lot of my GR friends as well as one of my favorite reviewers RAVED about this thing.Like, designed her own Mia Funko Pop and made her own gravebone dagger loved this thing. From what most people were saying, I inferred that this book would be dark. Which I LOVE. Which I WANTED. Was looking forward to gleefully. I expected the blood, guts, gore, and the lack of apology for it all that I expected and didn't get with Throne of Glass (although I liked that one).So, with me expecting a DARK book, I expected a tone that matched.But what I got was this weird, almost campy and satirical humor threaded tone, made worse by perhaps the weirdest thing I have EVER seen in a fiction novel...people who have read this know exactly what I'm talking about, cause seriously...What the fuck with the footnotes, GENTLEFRIENDS?No, I mean seriously...look at this:What fresh hell is this?If the odd tone and the narration style wasn't enough, adding footnotes that not only broke the fourth wall but made me feel like I was oscillating between reading for FUN and reading a textbook for NOT FUN did not help matters any, that's for sure. Add to that the fact that Kristoff did the majority of his world building via these footnotes, which I found to be...well, I'm not exactly sure what I found it to be. Lazy?Boring?I don't feel comfortable saying either of those things, cause even though it was weird, you could tell Kristoff worked his ass off. I just know I didn't love it. I mean, again, LOOK at this: I doubled the size this time.You know, so you can really take it in. Another issue I had in addition to the weird tone of the narration and the sometimes pointless footnotes was the fact that the narration seemed to jump POV in a way I can't explain. The majority of the book felt like it was written in third person limited, from the perspective of Mia for the most part; but then, at the end, the book suddenly jumped to third person omniscient in a way that felt jarring. I know what you are saying: \"Wow Val, you are really trashing this book, but rated it three stars.\"Yep. You're right. I did rate it three stars, good on you. Because, despite all the...shenanigans listed above, I DID like the overall story. Despite wishing it had been built differently, I DID like the world.And some of the events near the end totally threw me for a loop and made me say to myself, \"Wow, Self, that totally threw me for a loop. I wasn't expecting that.\"So at the end of the day, I thought this was a decent read. While his writing style may not really be my cup of tea, the man can definitely spin a story.And, since I already fucking bought book two and I AM curious to see what will happen, I will be reading Godsgrave here shortly...before my desire to do so completely fizzles out."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "Re-Read Time, I might have liked this more the 2nd time through.

I fall hard on the side of COMPLETELY LOVE\u2026the only thing wrong with this book is that the next one isn\u2019t out yet and I found this before the series is done. Well that isn\u2019t the only thing but the biggest thing.The beginning will start out a bit flowery, with a prose that might not work for you. This begins with a girl losing her virginity and a girl going on her first assassination job. The chapter is written in a way that it seems a bit repetitive because it shows how those two things mirror each other. BUT\u2026if you didn\u2019t like the way it started because of the prose I will say hang in there gentlefriend because by chapter 3 or 4 I think you will be hooked on the story and on Mia.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the look of a girl who\u2019s no stranger to the page. I can tell. You\u2019ve got words in your soul.\u201d\u201cWords in my soul?\u201d Mia scoffed. \u201c\u2019Burn After Reading\u2019?\u201d\u201cListen girl,\u201d Aelius sniffed. \u201cThe books we love, they love us back. And just as we mark our places in the pages, those pages leave their marks on us. I can see it in you, sure as I see it in me. You\u2019re a daughter of words. A girl with a story to tell.\u201d\nMia has a story alright and it is a dark, violent and full of danger and it is amazing so far.I read The Lotus wars by Jay Kristoff and I liked it. The first book in that series was really dense and it took me forever to get into and figure out the world overall it had a good payout in the end but it was a bit of work on my side. Nevernight will take a minute to get into but the worldbuilding is much easier to connect with and I didn\u2019t need a lot of pages before I was completely committed to the story.\u0b93 What I loved in this book \u0b93\u2764 -Mia is an assassin to love.\u2764 I remember reading Throne of Glass and thinking the entire time I wish she would quit telling me what a great assassin she is and show me something. Well there is none of that here. We meet Mia on the night of her first kill. You see her in action. And she doesn\u2019t start off the best assassin in the world. No she is just starting. That is her tithe so she can go and learn to be an assassin for the Goddess of the Night.\nShe has a vendetta to settle and a mission to keep her on track. I loved her acerbic wit and her outlook on life. She says some of the best things and I found her absolutely delightful.\n\u201cCock is just another word for 'fool.' But you call someone a cunt, well...\" The girl smiled. \"You're implying a sense of malice there. An intent. Malevolent and self-aware. Don't think I name Consul Scaeva a cunt to gift him insult. Cunts have brains, Don Tric. Cunts have teeth. Someone calls you a cunt, you take it as a compliment. As a sign that folks believe you're not to be lightly fucked with.\u201d \nShe also has a shadow cat companion Mr. Kindly that travels with her and lives in her shadow. A SHADOW CAT who eats her fear!!! Again awesome.\u10e6There is a smidge of Romance \u10e6 not too much mind you but just enough. I really enjoyed the banter and attraction between Mia and Tric. They are both killers so don\u2019t think that it is all hearts and roses because this isn\u2019t that kind of story. But they have something between them that leads to some very steamy moments indeed. But the play between them was my favorite part. In a school full of killers you need a friend even if he is a killer too.\n\"That bastard Solis,\" Tric hissed. \"I wanted to gut him for what he did. Gave it a roll, but he knocked me flat on my arse and kicked me senseless.\"Mia looked over the new bruises on Tric's face, shook her head. \"My brave centurion. Riding in on his charger to save his poor damsel? Hold me, brave sir. I fear I shall swoon.\"\n\u2763The School for Assassins\u2763 I am in love with, not that I could ever go there since I\u2019d be dead on day one but it was really amazing. If Hogwarts was a school for assassins it would be the Red Church. A place no light ever touches with classes and competitions in stealing, poisons, swordplay and seduction. This is not Snape\u2019s potion class though, if you don\u2019t know that answer to what is poisoning you then you are dead. \nThe walls and pathways seem to change or move and the Library might have a guardian or two that doesn\u2019t want you to mess with the books. It\u2019s hard to decide who is more dangerous the students OR the teachers. The magic is dirty and deadly as well as for magic there is always a price.\u2767The world\u2767 was detailed, intricate and presented in a way it was easy to understand. I really enjoyed the lore presented in this book and how it shaped the culture of the city Mia was from. How the play of the sun and moons became a religion and why the goddess Niah was cast out and became the mother of darkness and death. So many details of the world were given to you in the footnotes of the book which worked great. If you are like me then you would want to read through every detail of them to better understand the world and its history. But if that isn\u2019t something that you are really into you could skip it and just keep moving along in the story. I would feel sorry for you though since you would miss out on gems like this\u2026.\n*Scapdogs are a voracious carnivore of the Liisian continent, resembling a fat, hairless canine with piggy eyes and a mouthful of razors. The scabdog is an astonishingly vicious close-quarter combatant, but lacks the endurance to chase game over long distances. They frequently feed on carrion, but have also developed a peculiar method of \u201chunting.\u201dThe creature will maim itself superficially, chewing at its haunches until it bleeds. The scabdog will them make a show of being wounded, limping and bleeding until spotted by a carrion eater, such as a vulture, jackal, or another scabdog. The beast will then collapse, feighning death. This subterfuge can take hours, sometimes even turns.The beasts are consummate actors, even going so far as to remain still while another carnivore takes a cautious bite\u2026..\nI myself like the extra details about gods, politics and animals but it that isn\u2019t your thing then you get to skip it.Since this is the first book of a trilogy the majority of it is spent with Mia as she learns to become even deadlier than she already was and grows into the power the goddess Niah might have given her. I liked traveling with her as she tried to become one of the four students that would be named \u2018Blades\u2019 for the Red Church. There are quite a few obstacles along the way and in a classroom full of assassins the death rate is high.\nThis is not your typical YA assassin story. This is dark and full of violence and death. There is levity and humor in it to lessen the blow of such things but this is definitely a story for adults and not children. This wraps up really well at the end for a first book so if it isn\u2019t your cup o tea you are at a good exit point in case it just wasn\u2019t for you.I\u2019m excited to see what the next book will bring and where Mia will go from here. She could do just about anything and there are so many people left to kill.Book Notes: Rarely do I totally recommend the hardback or paperback version of a book over the ebook or audio but in this case I will. There are footnotes throughout this book and in the ebook format they are at the end of the chapter due to formatting. If you are good at navigating back and forth in an ebook you'll be fine. I am not good at that and the footnotes are fantastic so you don't want to wait to read each until the end of the chapter. In the Hardback they are at the bottom of the page you are reading and are much easier to swap to. The audio for this is good as well but the footnotes are read into the story in their proper places. Once you know what the footnotes look like you can usually pick them out in the audio.So......Hardback > Audio > ebook."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "NOW AVAILABLE! I highly recommend this one. A favorite.My new favorite book. Kristoff owned this. He's a rock star. This was one spectacular, edgy YA fantasy. I haven't been this excited about a series since Pierce Brown's Red Rising trilogy. I'm serious. I loved the dark tone of this book. It made me want to put on my Cure CDs and smoke clove cigarettes and ponder the mysteries of life. Yes, I'm fangirling. Give me a moment. This has actually given me book depression because it ended and now, what will I read? I actually want to go and pre-order the hardcover edition! What is happening to me?

It just must.This isn't released until August 9, 2016, but if you love fantasy, you seriously need to get it as soon as you can. It's worth paying full price for. Don't even wait for it to go on sale. It's that good.I'm not giving anything away except to say it's got everything: action, adventure, excellent world-building, cool creatures and magic, dark vs. light, dark vs. dark, heroism, friendship, sex (not the fade to black kind either), lots of stabby stabby. It's truly epic.Think about all the female assassins you've read about in YA and think about how they would be if they weren't watered down. That's how Mia is. I don't even know if this is YA. She just happens to be a teenager. I know it will be marketed as YA, so I'm going with older teens. It's a lot edgier than most YA I've read. It was just awesome, period. I lurved it.

(Credit: starrypierrot)Quick warning - no matter what Goodreads tries to tell you, this book is NOT YA. It has murder, graphic sex, violence and some generally disturbing content. You've been warned.So, Nevernight is basically about a young girl, Mia, whose family died in an unsuccessful revolution against the senate in this ancient-Rome-inspired fantasy setting. To exact her revenge, Mia becomes an apprentice at the Red Church, which trains master assassins in the name of the goddess of darkness and death. And believe it or not, this is actually the fun and breezy part of the story. The plot eventually devolves into an all-out sex, murder and intrigue orgy, but - I was never bored for a second. Kristoff built in brilliant little twists around every corner to keep his readers guessing. Here's the best part about this book: You never know who to root for. There is not a single morally clean character in the story (unsurprising, I know, given that it takes place in an academy for assassins). Nevernight really made me question my moral compass. Take Mia, our lovely heroine. Her one motivation in life is to kill the people responsible for taking down her father's revolution; if she succeeds in killing these very powerful men, she may just topple the empire and cause a lot of mayhem and death. On her journey through Nevernight, she kills a lot, and I mean A LOT of people. Objectively, she could be the villain of a fantasy story. But you kind of want her to succeed anyway. (Credit: JujuFei)Then there's Tric, who's only in the academy so he can assassinate his own grandfather. And yet, I found myself thinking what a sweet kid he really is. The same goes for Ash, Mercurio, Aalea, and others. Kristoff has a knack for creating evil characters, then making them strangely endearing. It takes a fantastic author to pull that off.

This is the fifth book I've read that Jay Kristoff has either fully written or co-authored, and it is far and away my favorite of all his work. This is his baby and brainchild; the magnum opus of a master craftsman meant to showcase the true depth and breadth of his talent as an author, and his love for this world he has built. Filled to the brim with atmospheric worldbuilding, engaging plotting and memorable characters this book was one of the most memorable and exciting reading experiences I've had all year. Filled with Roman and Venetian influence, this isn't your standard paint-by-numbers medieval fantasy. It is instantly atmospheric and so, so creative. Sometimes in fantasy, there's a tendency by authors to repeat the same information over and over again to really drive home aspects that an author considers important for the reader to know. In Nevernight Kristoff's worldbuilding never languishes over specific detail. Instead, each chapter, scene and word is carefully chosen to reveal more about various aspects of the world to the reader. Similarly, the footnotes that are dispersed throughout the story allow Kristoff to tell anecdotal stories that expand the world even further. It's information that is not necessarily critical to the story and could be skipped if one so chose, but Kristoff manages to keep them light and funny enough to make them worth reading. He has a real knack for shifting his narrative voice to a more jovial tone during these footnotes, elevating them from infodumps to short stories ranging from fallen kings or art or alcoholic beverages that are well worth the effort for the added life they add to the world.The plotting is outstanding, from start to finish. There is constant movement - and it is never boring. Centering the story within a competition and a revenge narrative arc allows for the story to constantly shift between training and Mia's greater search for vengeance for the family that she's lost. Like the worldbuilding, Kristoff avoids revisiting already familiar information or places, instead exploring new events in each chapter. There's so much going on at all times that it is impossible to get bored and if somehow all that action doesn't entertain you - the characters certainly will. Mia Corvere is one of my favorite protagonists in recent memory. She is so dark and driven in her goal of obtaining revenge for the family that she has lost that it would be easy to label her as an antihero, but Kristoff keeps her just noble enough in her actions that she remains the sort of character the reader wants to see succeed. The supporting characters - both the heroic and villainous - are just as well done. They're each distinctive and memorable in their own way, though Tric will forever be my book boyfriend. He's so well developed and his dynamic with Mia was one of my favorites to see unfold. I loved him just as much as I loved Mia.This book truly has it all. Outstanding worldbuilding, plotting and characters, and for the romance fans out there it is surprisingly steamy in parts as well. This is definitely adult fantasy in that there's no avoidance of the topics of violence - or sex between consenting adults. The few erotic sequences that are included are tastefully done and hot as hell. Sometimes sex in fantasy can feel like a bit of an afterthought, or a bit too much like wish fulfillment. It's inclusion here is necessary, as the next obvious step of important character building moments between two characters. Whatever you're looking for as a fan of fantasy novels - whether it be distinct worldbuilding, memorable magic systems or characters, or an engaging plot - this book has it all. This was not only one of my favorite reads so far this year, but one that I will consider a favorite for years to come.

MY POOR BABY. YOU ARENT DEAD, I KNOW YOURE NOT A'IGHT. I've been thinking real hard about this. Who the fuck is the narrator????It's someone that knows the \"real\" Mia, loves her, and cared enough to tell the true story. Oh and it mentions in the prologue thingy that Mia is dead by now. And she destroyed the city and got her revenge and everything. But who the hell is telling the story???? From what I gathered, it can only be two people: Tric or Ash. And since Ash is a fucking (but totally badass, I still love you, k?) traitor.... Wait, what? That has nothing to do with it. Who cares if Ash and her brother were traitors who gave up the location of the Red Church to avenge her father? If she loved Mia, she could tell the story..But doesn't the narration at the beginning sound a bit, I dunno, masculine? And Tric is a male? Really, it's TRIC. The letters stand for something in his language that basically means to go fuck off and drown in the ocean, which, incidentally, is what the priest guy told Tric's mother to do when she took him to be named. See their people have names like \"Earthbringer\" or \"Waterwalker\" or basically a noun+adjective combo. But the priest guy refused to name the poor kid. And Tric's grandfather agreed that the kid should be drowned so his mother ran away from home. All because he was a half-breed and a koffi, a child of rape. Of course, his mother died when he was 10, but she told him about the coming-of-age ritual her people had at 14. He performed the task, which was no easy feat, but his Grandfather refused to accept him. Instead he laughed at him and gave him horrible face tattoos, and later publicly humiliated him by tying him up and allowing people to throw shit at him. This caused major infections and he would've died, if he hadn't been saved by his would-be-tutor who'd teach him about the Red Church and how to get revenge. So Tric meets Mia the day they take their tithe (which is basically a body part of a man, or rather, an assassin. It's usually teeth) to some guy who's supposed to help them out (but doesn't really do much). Tric and Mia eventually find the mountain where the Red Church is located, picking up a Hand (Blade=assassin, Hand=acolytes who failed to become Blades) along the way named Naev, who's actually dying but yay! They saved her life! And they get to the Red Church! Oh god, I'm not selling this at all... It's actually really cool, I swear. I'm just skipping all the details, like the way they fought the sand monster thing (I'm terrible at remembering names and I'm even lazier at looking it up) and OMG I almost forgot!!!!! There's this epic thing at the beginning where you don't wtf is going on (#everyfantasybookever) but it's like two parallel things going on, the first time Mia has sex and the first time Mia willingly killed a man. (He was the assassin for her tithe!!!) And it's just like hOW THE ACTUAL HELL DO YOU ACTUALLY WRITE THAT?!?!!!!!???!!! Cuz I was so confused!!! I thought it was a misprint!!!! But then I reread the parts and it's only slightly different (or course the whole killing thing and losing your virginity thing are kinda different but the events leading up to it and the thoughts leading up to it were freaking identical and it F R E A K E D me out.)Cmon, honest mistake. Don't judge me. Which reminds me how violent and smutty this book is!! \ud83d\udc40Agh, so good, so descriptive and soo REAALLL. Not convinced? There's a scene where Mia imagines stabbing Tric and the blood falling all over her and she gets turned on by this. AND ITS SO GORYYY. (Of course it's due to some magic spell thing that people who want to come up the mountain have to resist) I think maybe I should tell you guys more about the cat now...Or should I say not-cat.... Cuz that's what Mister Kindly is. A not-cat. I FREAKING CANT BELIEVE I THOUGHT MISTER KINDLY WENT AND MURDERED LOTTI. Yeah, the not-cat is sassy and possessive af (aka my favorite characteristics in a cat) but he would never go kill random people just cuz he was jealous or something. IM SORRY MISTER KINDLY. It was obviously Ash who murdered Lotti. And then BLAMED EVERYTHING ON MIA??!!!?!!!! And here I was discussing possible ships for them.Also, before I talk more about my favorite not-cat, WTF LOTTI, why the fuck did you create a freaking fast-action sleep-inducing drug for those traitors huh? (Lmao the only thing I'm not spoiling here are details like the name of the drug and the name of the monster and stuff like that. You know. Details.) Just cuz you and Osrik had a thing going on. And cuz you were freaking amazing at Truths.... Ugh. Truths.Truths is basically glorified chemistry. I hate chem. Meaning I would've been dead on Day 1, when that lady literally poisoned their food. Of course Mia and Lotti knew the antidote and Tric knew better than to eat anything cuz he smelled something funny. That boys nose gets him into so much trouble. It's the reason Ash freaking STABS HIM AND PUSHES HIM OFF AND NOW HE'S SUPPOSEDLY DEAD BUT HE CANT BE  CUZ WHO ELSE IS NARRATING THE STORY IF IT ISNT HIM? IT cANNOT BE SOME RANDOM THIRD CHARACTER/LOVE INTEREST THAT GETS INTRODUCED DURINGTHE THIRD BOOK CUZ I WILL SCREAM. I'll tolerate it if it's either Tric or Ash and no one else.Oh guys, you might be wondering. Why the fuck would the traitor love the girl? Um cuz she SAYS \"you don't belong here\" multiple times, meaning Mia isn't evil to the core (which should've been pretty obvious when she refused to kill that innocent teenager, meaning she automatically forfeited whatever leverage she had by topping in Truth, even though she might've on purpose exaggerated the truth of her discovery on the suitable antidote, thereby indirectly killing a fellow acolyte who was foolish enough to steal her notes and submit them, taking the poison and wrong antidote himself instead of testing on the mice provided, first) I WARNED YOU I'D BE ALL OVER THE PLACE.  But let's back up a second. Lord of the Blades called Mia \"SISTER\". But was it because they were both darkin???? Cuz darkin means to be blessed/chosen by the Maw herself???? Or cuz they're actually related by blood??? Are they demi-gods??? Cuz remember what our narrator says when he's recounting the story behind the religions? Remember Anais, son of Niah?And what became of Anais, you may ask? The rival Aa so rightfully feared? Well that, gentle friend, would be spoiling things. So um HELLOOO???? What do you think that means???????? These darkins are probably related to Anais!!!! Especially since the Trinity, the three sun symbol of Aa, makes them weak and cower with fear. Speaking of fear, did you know the not-cat is the one to suck up all of Mia's fear??? I really need me a Mister Kindly....Also, I'd like to point out that Hush did in fact mention:\"You only have one friend inside these walls. Not Carlotta. Not Tric or Ash. And not me.\" HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE NOT-CAT.  (Ok jk not talking, he was signing in Tongueless) Anyway, the girl wanted to kill three people.Consul\tScaeva. Cardinal Duomo. Justicus Remus.  But only one dies... Guess which one!!! Jk, I'm not gonna tell you. And the Lord of the Blades dies, and all the darkin secrets he kept die but he did anoint Mia with his blood so she did become a full-fledged blade even though she failed her last task (killing an innocent boy). BUT BUT BUT THE PERKS OF HAVING A LIBRARIAN FRIEND (who's dead-ish btw) IS THAT SOMETIMES THEY LEAVE BOOKS FOR YOU ABOUT SUCH DARKIN ABILITIES. And it was this journal thing, right? So they lady darkin in it ate any other darkin she came across? Wtf??? What is UP with that hungry feeling???? Goddess, I spoiled almost everything except the Speaker and the Weaver. Should I keep that to myself? Let's just say they practice old magick, and they're very old themselves. The weaver can mold flesh (she's the one that gave Mia a makeover) and the speaker has an interesting taste in blood... But hey. His Blood Bath lets the acolytes into Godsgrave easily, so no complaining there!! Ok... I'll probably add more as more ideas come. But I think I am done for now.

Let the complaining commence. So.1) The writing is absolute shit. Oops? I think Nevernight is not a book for everyone. You either love the writing or you hate it and that will semi decide if you'll love or hate the book. Obviously I stand on the latter side. I tried for almost a month to like the writing. I thought it'd be something where it'd be weird at first then I'd get used to it? But no. At 1%, the writing was shit. At 40%, the writing was still utter shit and I wasn't willing to force myself to read further because that only resulted in headache after headache. If you loved the writing, I'm so glad you did. I felt Kristoff was trying too hard?? Some paragraphs and phrases were a big what-the-fucking-fuck moment for me. 2) The info dump? What the hell was that? Names thrown in here and there, titles thrown in here and there, concepts thrown in here and there... My brain was crying for a break. Listen, I don't mind being confused while reading, because hey, it's the first book and confusion is inevitable. World-building, blah blah... But when I read 40% which is almost halfway and I still have absolutely no clue how the world works and what the terms mean (at least some of them??), then I get really angry. Guys, I tried to push through this. I really did. Especially when literally all my friends have loved this book. But again, when I approach halfway and the book is still a big huh moment and I hate every single thing about it, then yeah, it's not looking good.OH WELL. *Apparently this book is badass, funny, and painful; obviously I'll read it!Buddy reading with Little Bee, Marami, Vermicelli, Sil, & Elise!"}], "description": "In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father\u2019s failed rebellion with her life.

But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.Now, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic\u2014the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, she\u2019ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Church\u2019s halls, the bloody secrets of Mia\u2019s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.Will she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?", "title": "Nevernight\n      \n          (The Nevernight Chronicle #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114463-nevernight", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500688832l/26114463.jpg", "reviews": 3511, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4735144.Jay_Kristoff", "name": "Jay Kristoff"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Did Not Finish"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114463-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29845906-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27841061-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30969076-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450876-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27779247-nevernight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10852343-stormdancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23264671-godsgrave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15773979-kinslayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17928198-endsinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29456569-lifel1k3"]}
