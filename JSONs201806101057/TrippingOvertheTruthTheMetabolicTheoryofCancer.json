I have read the Emperor of All Maladies, By Muhkerjee, a doctor, which recounts the history of our relationship with cancer. This book takes it a step deeper, exploring the research avenues that were all but choked off when everyone jumped on the genetic mutation bandwagon. It's a \"scientific paradigm\" story: right now, the prevailing wisdom is that cancer is caused by a series of genetic mutations that then send the cells off on a wild spree of proliferation, angiogenesis (making their own blood supply) and eventually metastasis. This book is an attempt to explain to the layperson current scientific attempts to resuscitate an alternate theory, first posited in the early 1900s by Nobel-winning scientist Otto Warburg, that the root cause of cancer isn't in fact genetic mutation, but a faulty energy manufacturing process stemming from damage to the mitochondria. All cancer cells share one thing: damaged mitochondria. Taking this approach to understanding and ultimately treating cancer would involve a massive paradigm shift, and those are notoriously hard to bring about in science. So what causes what? Does the cell's compromised energy system trigger genetic damage? Or does the genetic damage cause the mitochondrial damage? The science is still evolving, and it's a very interesting read, with lots of academic backstabbing, scientists who refuse to let go of a theory they've spent their lives and enormous amounts of money exploring, and most of all, hope that the story is not over yet and that progress can still be made in our understanding of this horrible disease. If you're not versed in biology/chemistry lingo this might be a tough read. I also think the book could stand an extensive editing session. It's self-published, and shows it, which normally makes me abandon a book in frustration, but not this one. THe information is too interesting. Hopefully the errors will be corrected in future kindle versions."}, {"userName": "Rosemary Heller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11645383-rosemary-heller", "userReview": "This is a \"must read\" book for anyone who is fighting cancer, or for anyone who knows someone fighting cancer ( which is just about everyone, these days)It explores the many theories of cancer that have been offered and researched over the years, all of which have proven to be ineffective to fight this disease. It also offers the \"other \" explanation for cancer that was offered 70 years ago, but that was discarded in favor of newer research . This \"other\" explanation, that cancer is a metabolic disease, is beginning to regain favor in light of the fact that costly chemotherapy treatments have proven to be minimal at best. The author make a compelling case for this theory which is a non invasive, no chemical treatment of cancer by starving the cancer of it's main source of fuel which is glucose. The author writes a very readable account of the history of cancer treatment theory over the years, and although somewhat technical it is quite understandable.In addition, he offers real ways to combat cancel cells by diet and other non invasive techniques. I hope that this will be a wave of the future for the treatment of cancer."}, {"userName": "michael j thornton", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37786691-michael-j-thornton", "userReview": "I lost my sonEvan was taken by Ewings Sarcoma.

Seems obvious to me that cancer is best when treated as a metabolic disease (missing/damaged mitochondria), not just a disease of damaged DNA (because it appears that the mitochondria damage comes first).

It has been so elusive. In 1986 John Bailer in a systematic review established that in 1985 a million people were diagnosed with cancer and the maths revealed that all efforts combined since the 'war on cancer' began, saved the lives of only 4%. Today we get regaled with headline news about treatments but basically it is about lengthening survival time (and sometimes this is just a matter of months) rather than curing.Could it be that the billions spent on cancer research is funding too narrow a field? There is a story worth noting here: \"A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, 'this is where the light is'.\"It would seem that cancer research is only looking within a particular understanding or paradigm of cancer; that being SMT (somatic mutation theory). DNA is central to this theory, how information is transferred from one cell to another. Cancer is caused by faulty genetic apparatus.But considering how long it's been since the 'war on cancer' was declared it seems bizarre to retain this single focus and this book by Christofferson clearly articulates why we have reached this position. He also suggests that the answer lies in the metabolic theory - the chemistry of the cells and provides a lot of detailed information as to how alternate views and research is practically side-lined because it doesn't fit with the dominant paradigm. Cancer is a horrendous disease and its treatments remain barbaric. Radiation was discovered over a hundred years ago yet it is still being used to burn cancer and chemotherapy continues to carpet bomb the bodies of cancer patients. There are a lot of alternative therapies/treatments that claim cheap non-toxic cures (including cannabis for medicinal use) - it would be great if the way that cancer research is conducted could become more flexible in its approach."}, {"userName": "BNV Raman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66768229-bnv-raman", "userReview": "A very well detailed book.

And it's sad to say that scientist aren't any closer to a cure than they were in the 1940's. Why? Because there is too much disagreement between how cancer starts (is it genetic or metabolic?). Even when the science is staring scientist in the face - they are too egotistical to see the answer. Plus, there are methods to help people, but can't have that as the method is inexpensive - no one would profit. So we get the same standard of care that may or may not work. It's about as sad a state as the US Government.I will say that I don't have a science background so found a lot of the scientific & technical information over my head, but I got the gist of the overall message.All I can say is - good by sugar, hello fat!"}, {"userName": "Barry Turner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51669523-barry-turner", "userReview": "Low-carbers will love this book. The LC or ketogenic diet has another string to its bow - curing cancer. Well, more specifically it is thought by some to be a major toll in teh fight against a lot of cancers. The theory is built on the work of German genius Oto Warburg who came up with this idea donkeys' years ago. The author believes the cancer research camp has followed the wrong track, thinking that the condition is the result of gene mutations and further compounding that mistake by spending untold billions on trying to find chemical ways to zap the malignant cells.

The theory of cancer as a metabolic - rather than a mutation - disease is compelling. Cancer is a mitochondrial disfunction desease. Very interesting narrative on 3-bromopyruvate (3BPT) as a cheap, non-chemo alternative to curing cancer. Even though the topic is very technical, Travis makes it an easy read. Its sort of shocking to know that this therapy is probably the most promising thing in Cancer today, but the researchers cannot find $6 million to conduct clinical trials, when the medical cancer research establishment is spending billions of dollars trying to find the genetic mutation solution to cancer, and have failed abysmally.

However, after reading the review of this theory by late Nicholas Gonzales, I think the long term prognosis for cancer and ketogenic diet is quite weak. Also it completely ignores the work of Colin Campbell is showing that tumor growth can be turned on and off in the presence of animal protein. Lastly, they appear to be onto something regarding the mitochondria rather than genes/DNA, but never consider the amino acid methionine and its effect in feeding the mitochondria (as opposed to sugar) as is shown in the NORI protocol.

Tripping over the Truth follows the story of cancers proposed metabolic origin from the vaunted halls of the German scientific golden age, to modern laboratories around the world. The reader is taken on a journey through time and science that results in an unlikely connecting of the dots with profound therapeutic implications.Transporting us on a rich narrative of humanities struggle to understand the cellular events that conspire to form malignancy, it reads like a detective novel, full of twists and cover-ups, blind-alleys and striking moments of discovery by men and women with uncommon vision, grit and fortitude. Ultimately we arrive at a conclusion that challenges everything we thought we knew about the disease, suggesting the reason for the failed war against cancer stems from a flawed paradigm that categorizes cancer as an exclusively genetic disease.  For anyone affected by this terrifying disease, and the physicians who struggle to treat it, Tripping Over the Truth provides a fresh and hopeful perspective. It explores the new and exciting non-toxic therapies born from the emerging metabolic theory of cancer. Therapies that may one day prove to be a turning point in the struggle against our ancient enemy. We are shown how the metabolic theory redraws the battle-map, directing researchers to approach cancer treatment from a different angle, framing it more like a gentle rehabilitation rather than all-out combat. In a sharp departure from the current \"targeted\" revolution occurring in cancer pharmaceuticals, the metabolic therapies highlighted have one striking feature that sets them apart -the potential to treat all types of cancer because they exploit the one weakness that is common to every cancer cell: dysfunctional metabolism.", "title": "Tripping Over the Truth: The Metabolic Theory of Cancer", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496164-tripping-over-the-truth", "average": 4.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1472653146l/23496164.jpg", "reviews": 45, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9826471.Travis_Christofferson", "name": "Travis Christofferson"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Health", "Health", "Health", "Medical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496164-tripping-over-the-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23645789-tripping-over-the-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25983015-tripping-over-the-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33985443-tripping-over-the-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32857871-paradigmenwechsel"]}
