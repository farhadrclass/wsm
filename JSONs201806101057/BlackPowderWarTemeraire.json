The second part of the book, the Prussian campaign, dragged considerably. The endless descriptions of troop movements and the crushing weight of poor conditions and lack of food on the troops were given too much attention and slowed down the pace of the book.That being said, there was much about this book I loved. The colorful and prickly Sultan and his court, the addition of dragon eggs to be protected and cared for, a vengeful Celestial bent not on killing Temeraire, but on stripping him of everything in his life he values were compelling story elements and very exciting to read about.Also, Lawrence's evolution of mind was the most interesting aspect of the book. He gradually began to see the plight of dragons in Europe through Temeraire's eyes and is evolving more and more into the world's first human activist for dragon rights. Very interesting and appealing to my idealist sensibilities."}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4184441-sofia", "userReview": "TEMERAIRE IS BACK, BITCHES!

SOOO much intrigue, drama, love and just-ansjalcnasf!!!-Lien and Napoleon Bonaparte are working together. Awesome team up is awesome! -Dear god, the men in this series!

Part of this is likely due to over-exposure, since I am reading them in succession with no breaks, and the other part is that this tale feels a lot like a transition piece (the pause, obligatory plate stomp, and then the windup before the pitch). Which is fine, as the journey to China took so very long in book 2, and to have a repeat journey on the way back in the very next book would have been dreadful to work through. Add in some urgency, questionable sailing conditions, and Laurence & Temeraire's anxiousness to get home, and voila!, instant plot progression.What follows is more of what we've gotten used to with Naomi Novik's writing; deep and thoughtful discussions between man & dragon, interludes with some of the supporting cast, and some battles for good measure. Helpful distractions this time around come in the form of Tharkay, a mixed heritage guide who needs to be elevated to a much more prominent role (his character is conflicted, capable, and thoroughly engaging), some feral dragons met along the way, and a returning antagonist from book 2. What we also get here is a view of the Prussian involvement in the Napoleonic Wars (events changed obviously to suit the inclusion of dragons), but still accurate enough to their reliance on outdated tactics and the stolid assurance on those tactics by the Prussian officers. Needless to say, outdated tactics do not for a victory make... It's accurate enough, in spirit at least, that avid historians shouldn't cry \"foul\". The Prussian Queen makes for a great distraction, albeit one who's there and gone in a flash.And yeah, that's about it. Laurence and Temeraire are engaging as always, the crew have brief moments to shine as per usual, and the danger is always real (supporting characters don't always make it out alive or unscathed). Oh, and then there's the...ahhhh...new addition to the fold, who is MOST welcome (honestly, this should have happened sooner). I can't wait to see how this new addition works into the narrative in the future novels.So yeah, not a bad book by any means, but definitely not up to par. We had to get our crew back to England somehow, I guess, and at least we get some action and adventure along the way (as opposed to many more months at sea again)."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25037254-robyn", "userReview": "A fascinating journey with a rousing finish. (Also amusing how easily one takes England's side; down with the tyrant Napoleon!)"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1027031-angela", "userReview": "Black Powder War has a definite \"middle of a series\" flavor about it--not unlike trying to read one of the Aubrey-Maturins. It reads a lot more like a series of unrelated episodes than one big plot. But as with Patrick O'Brian, if you think about it as one big ongoing story, that makes it less jarring! Plus, there's lots more goodness here with Novik's dragons, interesting glimpses into how more cultures besides Britain treat their dragons, and some new and entertaining characters both human and draconic.I was a trifle surprised that this book came out to be a lot more along the lines of \"two disparate plots smooshed together into one book\" rather than one big plot. You have Plot Number 1, which is Laurence and Temeraire going to Turkey to get the three dragon eggs, and Plot Number 2, which is Laurence and Temeraire having to stop over on the way home to help the Austrians fight off Napoleon. There is no particular overall resolution, either--no great victory achieved in the fighting--and ultimately Laurence and Temeraire head home to Britain because there's not much else they can do. But as I mentioned above, realizing that this episodic, \"middle of a series\" feel is something I've seen before in Patrick O'Brian made it much less jarring.I do feel like we had a bit too much of a rush from Plot 1 to Plot 2, nevertheless. There were plenty of interesting hints dropped about why the Turks were balking on surrendering the eggs, and about the fate of the British ambassador--but none of that ever got played out to my satisfaction, and instead we just went to Laurence deciding that they were just going to steal the eggs and hightail it away as fast as possible. Not that I think that was out of character for him necessarily (and I was at least pleased to see him fretting about whether he was going to get in trouble for that impulsive decision, later), but I really did rather want to know what the heck was up with that. And whether the hints dropped about Laurence's orders to pick up the eggs in the first place were bogus.Writing-wise, the book didn't throw me any of those occasional moments of music in the prose that I saw in His Majesty's Dragon, but that was quite all right. There was plenty for me to like here, and first and foremost, there was a whole new pile of information about the dragons of the world. I particularly liked the revelation of at least one and possibly more dragon languages--including mentioning of sounds in them that human throats cannot produce. Which is absolutely right, and, as Temeraire exulted, is additional evidence that dragons are in fact Sentients. Temeraire in fact expresses the hope that the knowledge that dragons are making their own languages can help convince British society to treat them as equals--and I very much hope that we'll see Temeraire getting to fight that fight.Similarly, I loved the introduction of the feral dragons led by Arkady. They were admittedly a ragtag kind of band, and perhaps not the most sterling example of what dragons on their own might do in establishing their own society. But on the other hand, I expect it could be argued that given humanity's dominance of the planet, dragons don't have much room to establish their own society to any huge detail. We certainly see dragons with a higher standard of living in Throne of Jade--but I think that's almost more because dragons are living alongside humans, and we have no real idea of how much societal development there is because of dragons thinking up things, and how much of it is humanity doing so.Quite a bit of goodness involving the Chinese dragon Lien, too. I really like that she is shaping up as an antagonist in her own right, and that she is going out and seizing her own fate even if it's because she's motivated to turn Laurence and Temeraire's lives into a living hell. This, too, is absolutely right in a setting where the dragons are People. We need to see dragons who can do exactly this kind of thing, rather than relying upon human companions to be in charge of them.Hands down, though, the best of the new dragon characters is Iskierka! I absolutely loved her, I loved that she was a female, I loved that Granby finally got his dragon, and I loved that Temeraire was actually jealous of surrendering him to Iskierka as her captain. Someone on  was giggling over Novik taking the term \"spitfire\" literally with this little hellion, and I have to giggle over that myself. I particularly had to laugh and laugh at the fleeting reference to her accidentally charring her own food--which was done exactly right, just a quick mention and *boom*, move on, just fast enough to leave you a hysterical visual of a baby dragon looking bemused at the ashy mess she's made of her meal. ;) That's a fan art opportunity if I ever saw one!Meanwhile, on the human side of things, I also liked Tharkay as a character and how he eventually shaped up to be almost a parallel to the dragons--not allowed to be considered a true equal of Respectable Society (read: white and British :P ) because of his mixed race, yet too useful to really be cast aside. I didn't blame him in the slightest for being bitter, and I appreciated that Laurence eventually got the clue and reached an accord with him. And I really liked that Tharkay did in fact go back and get the ferals. I was sad to see his eagle get bumped off, though. Sniff.And I liked the glimpses we had of Napoleon as well as the Austrian monarchs, which put a more immediate face upon the ongoing war. I especially liked the exchange that Laurence managed to overhear between Lien and Napoleon (even though it was awfully convenient that he was in the right place at the right time to see that).And I liked that the fighting in the second half of the book did not in fact result in victory--because it makes for good storytelling to see Laurence and Temeraire have to deal with defeat as well as victory, especially Temeraire. All in all, not my favorite of the Novik books so far, but definitely still solid!"}, {"userName": "Manisha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29882975-manisha", "userReview": "I'm a bit late on this review, so I will keep it simple.

Deaths by falling. War. Dragon masturbation. That one's not a trigger warning so much as a heads up because it's freaking weird. Anyway. I stand by pretty much everything I said last time. I think I found the pacing a little slower this time around? I liked the second half but I don't think I *loved* it?? That said, Iskierka is fucking fabulous and I love her. 21/5/2012Plot summary: Temeraire, his captain, William Laurence, and his crew are back on ship, ready to sail back to England from China, when a letter is received ordering them to Istanbul to collect three dragon eggs England has purchased. When the ship catches fire, they decide to travel overland and encounter many dangers. Upon arrival in Istanbul, they are more or less taken prisoner, and refused the eggs. They ultimately escape, and are en route home when they become involved in the Prussian land war against Napoleon. Thoughts: I wasn't a big fan of the first half of this book. It seemed like things were getting very formulaic. You know, some kind of journey, Temeraire eats some livestock, there's a very minor battle in which a crew member you've never heard of is killed. Rinse and repeat. But the second half? I loved. From taking the eggs and escaping from Istanbul to the battles against Napoleon to their final return to Great Britain, I loved it all. Sure, there was more of the \"Temeraire eats some livestock\" stuff, and I'm sure some crew members died. (Given the rate at which crew members die in this series, I'm astonished that ANYONE lived for long enough to become an aviator!) But there was a lot more action, and the plot didn't seem as much like it was plodding along without purpose. I think it was the addition of Iskierka and the ferals towards the end of the book that made me love this as much as I loved the first book. Iskierka is brilliant, with her \"I may be tiny but I can kill them all! What do you mean you won't let me?? YOU DON'T LET ME HAVE ANY FUN, WAAAAAH!!\" attitude to life. And I think it's the personalities of the other dragons that Throne of Jade was missing.I'll definitely be getting hold of Empire of Ivory at the library!"}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "I'm still enjoying this series, but I think the spark, that initial sense of magic and wonderment I first felt when I read His Majesty's Dragon, has faded. I believe the ongoing war against Napoleon and the action-filled aerial dragon battles are meant to be the focus and highlight of these books, and that unique premise certainly sets this series apart from much of the other fantasy offerings out there. But if I'm to be completely honest, while reading this third book, I found myself constantly fighting the urge to skim over the fight scenes. It's not that I don't find them well-written or interesting; but for me the best part has always been the forming and strengthening of the bond between Lawrence and Temeraire. That was what made His Majesty's Dragon a five star read for me, but it was even obvious by the end of that first book in the series that the captain and his dragon would be loyal to the death to each other and inseparable. There's nowhere else for that relationship to go, and so we are left with their debates regarding the treatment and rights of dragons as the only source of tension between them, if that could even count as a conflict. I'm looking forward to see where this thread will take us as I continue with the series, but it still pales in comparison to that fascinating dynamic they had in the first book."}, {"userName": "Scott Sigler", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1782315-scott-sigler", "userReview": "This series is a goddamn delight.

Novik's Temeraire series, however, has taken over my iPhone for running, walking, and my apartment has never been cleaner because I find excuses to \"pick up\" so that I can listen to the audiobooks a little more.

I got thirsty, sand-blown and a bit sunburnt in this read!Once again Novik has done a brilliant job of portraying place and circumstance: actions, relationships, dialog, all seemed very true to their time. \n\"Justice is expensive,\" Tharkay said. \"That is why there is so little of it, and that reserved for those few with enough money and influence to afford it.\"\n The plot took a number of twists and turns with unexpected encounters, treachery, swashbuckling adventure, saucy feral dragons and interesting new characters (like Tharkay!) Novik twisted me in knots with apprehension, waiting to see how this alternate history would treat Our Heroes and the British side in general. (By blood and upbringing I am far more of the British Isles than France, even if I do cook a fine Lapin \u00e0 la moutarde, so the thought of Ol'Boney anywhere near Trafalgar Square makes my heart pound apprehensively and my hand close over the hilt of my (non-existent) sabre; not to mention Anglicizing my spelling!)This was a a much more exciting read for me than the first half of the second book and though I'm no fan of military history I was still engrossed by the tactics of the Prussians and how those battle tactics affected Our Side. Novik did an excellent job with both tactics and presenting the real costs of war, any war. Damn that Bonaparte! \nCapt. Jack Aubrey: Do you want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?Crew: No!Capt.

A dragon egg they encounter is identified to them as being an egg of the \"Akhal-Teke\" breed of dragon; in our world the Akhal Teke is horse breed with an amazingly metallic-looking coat. The Akhal Teke are almost shockingly lovely and the breed is native to, and a national symbol of, the nation of Turkmenistan.

But alas, it will not be quick or easy. Their new assignment takes them on a difficult journey by land from China to Istanbul to retrieve three valuable dragon eggs and bring them home. As they travel via the Old Silk Road they will need a guide. This comes in the form of a new character named Tharkay, a toughened Nepalese/Englishman whose loyalty and motives are somewhat questionable. En route, they have a run-in with bandits and meet some feral dragons that live in the mountains away from humankind. Once in Istanbul, they are not received kindly and find some resistance to their retrieval of the dragon eggs. I found this part of the book to be way too predictable and was happy when they made it out of Istanbul. As they travel from Istanbul to Prussia a delightful and frightful new terror is born in the form of the feisty baby dragon, Iskierka who is going to be a right handful. Oh yes, she will also need her own handler! Once in Prussia, Laurence, Temeraire and company wind up as unwilling participants in Napoleon\u2019s Siege of Danzig. Adding to all of this danger, it is revealed that Napoleon has a new officer in the form of a dragon who bears a very strong grudge towards Temeraire. The focus of the series remains on the strong bond between Will and Temeraire and their adventures during the Napoleonic Wars. We are also offered up a couple of side plates on slavery and dragon rights. The former being a very real and upcoming cause of the time period and the latter being a great fictional one to introduce. Tharkay and Iskierka and the feral dragons are interesting new additions and I feel like there is much to be explored here in future books. I look forward to seeing more of that character development. I still think that the premise of the series is great and there are definitely some parts that tickle me. I would recommend these for young adults because Novik continues to weave cultural differences, geography and history into her story in an interesting way. She also does a good job outlining battle tactics from the unusual viewpoint of an aerial dragon force.

It's an enjoyable and tightly written book, well researched and written in (what appears to my layman's eye) a historically accurate style. I enjoyed the story of Laurence, a naval captain who accidentally captures a rare dragon's egg and becomes Temeraire's - the dragon's - captain and companion. However, in book 2, Throne of Jade, the story loses much of its tight pace, turning into a loose and sometimes dragging travel narrative, still giving a very interesting look at life aboard a large ocean-faring ship, but completely falling apart at the end with an improbable and downright silly ending. Book 3, Black Powder War, unfortunately combines most of the flaws of the second book with very little of what I enjoyed in the first book. In this novel, Temeraire and Laurence are summoned from the Chinese court to Istanbul. The result is another meandering travel narrative. Most of the last third of the book consists of long and detailed battle descriptions, some of which I ended up skimming over. Improbably, Naomi Novik came up with a deus-ex-machina ending that is even sillier than the second book's. There are some bright points in this novel, but it's nowhere near as good as the first book.

The faults seem to magnify and the good points seem to dwindle the more I read.These books seem more like a historical recounting rather than story. Before, in the other two books, the focus was more on the characters and the world. But now, the main importance seems more about political ideologies and the war between France and the world. Perhaps it is because I don't habitually enjoy historical fiction, but I find most of the book dry and plot-less. The end does pick up though.I know it's important for the series that Temeraire pushes for dragon rights and equality and all that good stuff, but good grief, I'm getting sick of it. It's like I'm reading the Social Contract or something. Not to mention his naivety is getting a little grating. It's expected and completely in character, but argh it's getting frustrating to the point where I personally think it becomes more of a flaw in the character design.Also, the bond between Temeraire and Laurence is also becoming less believable as the series progresses. They are basically inseparable, but there has been so many events that seems to make them disagree and split apart. And yet, there are no real compromising scenes of philosophical agreement or discussion of such personal differences, there is no resolution to their disagreement. Instead, they rely on the initial bond to keep them together and in harmony. Which is more of an easy excuse to mend any problems. I'm starting to get annoyed at Laurence and his stiff-necked formality. I just love reading about his one-sided understanding of how the world works and how duty and authority is the meaning to life, basically. Ah, excuse my dripping sarcasm. Sigh, I don't hate him. But it's just that sometimes Laurence is a hard main character to love. And then the plot. Where is the plot???? (I know it's not good writing, but I use so many question marks because I am that desperate!) I'm getting bored of how slow the book is progressing. It seems we stop in every single city and wind up having problems that are so easily solved in the end, but somehow it takes a couple hundred pages. It's getting to the point where I contemplate skipping every fifty pages to see if I would even miss anything important. Oh yes, yes. I'm just ranting about my problems with the book. Sure, there are some good points too. It's all the same stuff as the first two books. Novik writes well, she has a strong understanding of how to write characters and hidden emotions, and etc. At first I had also written off the battles because the fighting in the first two books were hardly interesting, being more about forced action and historical references. But surprisingly, I enjoyed most of the war scenes towards the end simply because they seemed to be contain more about strategy and decision making more than a mere battle. Unfortunately, dragon battle is just as ridiculous as it was in the first book. Similarly, the ending always seems to be a dragon-ex-machina and they mysteriously get out of an impossibly battle situation, no problem. Bah.Ultimately, I just can't get over the problems that seem to be growing in size. Or maybe I just have a magnifying glass glued to my eyes as I read the book, who knows. Or maybe it's because I'm reading this series one right after the other without much pause - and maybe Novik's slow paced books need a year in between so you can build up the patience to read through it without wanting to slam your head on the wall because the story moves so slowly. Who knows.Regardless, two and a half stars, because it is strong writing. Rounded down because I am so frustrated. Might round up later if I'm feeling less annoyed later, but I doubt it.I don't think I will pick up the next book. Maybe not for another year and I build up the curiosity of what happens next. Maybe."}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5238423-nathan", "userReview": "Fantasy Review BarnWelcome back and let\u2019s get a recap of the game so far. In the all black we have Temeraire and let me tell you this dragon is awesome. Two languages right out of the shell, a roar that destroys anything it\u2019s path, and a captain that will do anything for him.Facing the mighty Temeraire and his British crew are the French, led by their captain Napoleon. The Frogs have picked up a great free agent signing, strategy master Lien, the only other Celestial active in the Europeon war. With a chip on her shoulder against Temeraire, things could get interesting. After all, the French have a ground game that can\u2019t be stopped, adding an aerial assault could be the end.AND THERE THEY GO! The British make a mad rush for some extra points, driving quickly into the land of the Turks to get their hands on eggs of a different sort; fire breathers could add some real diversity to the squad. But watch out! Unaware of the Lien signing they are beat to the goal and a heavy defense is set up. Stalling tactics are worked on both sides and the shot clock is running down, this baby is going to hatch. Is a daring escape on the way? Will the British aquire new eggs and get them safely back home? Or will Lien\u2019s aerial genius combine with Napoleon into on unstoppable power? Anything can happen in this game of dragons.Ok enough of that, after three books of this series I didn\u2019t want to do a typically book summery, but damn I should have picked one sport and stuck with it. What was that, football mixed with basketball? Let\u2019s go over the highlights.I really liked the action, it picked up quite a bit from the last outing. In Throne of Jade the action was good when it came around, but was an overall slow book. Compare that to Black Powder War, with a desperate flight instead of a slow boat to China (literally). There were aerial battles, ground battles victories for both sides, an actually sense of danger. This is what I am looking for in this series.Some real intelligence was shown here as well. Temeraire was a bit of a dreamer last time, head in the clouds. This time Laurence and his dragon really put their head together and have starting working on some realistic solutions. I was a bit off put last time by real issues being brought up but given only courtesy glances, this time the issue of dragon equality was given some more depth.It was enjoyable to see a new dragon that was so heavily influenced by Temeraire, and I am guessing young fire breather could prove to be a nice companion for Laurence and crew. I really enjoyed the time spent against Napoleon\u2019s land armies, especially when it was apparent that they were often over their head. There was true tension in this book; if not for Temeraire\u2019s safety at least for the armies he worked with.My only complaints were the same as I had with the first book, so I won\u2019t repeat them. Needless to say, this was a quick return to form for the series, and I enjoyed it as much or more than the first book. It is hard to say much more, because by now the formula has been established. This was another entertaining and intelligent outing, if not as deep as the book tried to be at certain times. The action was still superb, the politics simple but realistic, and Temeraire and Laurence\u2019s relationship holds the rest of the book together just fine.4 stars. PS: If you actually took the time to read that intro, I am truly sorry."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2938801-marina", "userReview": "To be honest, I don't know what to think of this series.I knew based on it's reputation that it was basically the Napoleonic Wars plus dragons, which sounds awesome, and it's popular enough that I gave it a chance. But I didn't realize just how heavily on military engagements and politics it would be. Some of it is really fascinating and a couple of the dragon battles were so fantastic I nearly cheered, but some of the slower movements and lesser engagements get so boring, that I end up skimming most of it.Perhaps it is because the series is written from third person limited omniscient, but a lot of the times I find it hard to engage with the story line and the characters. As much as I love Temeraire, Laurence is hard to like at times, and others barely have any characterization.Part of me still thinks that books 2-3 were too early to take Temeraire out of his \"native\" setting, considering the setting and the world have barely been established and we've already being thrown all over the world, with most of the books consisting of travel and the trouble the characters meet along the way. I don't even care about most of the characters (aside from like three main) to care about what happens to most of the crew - which is another problem, with over ten characters in the cast, I have a hard time following who's who, even in the third book... and occassionally a character who has been there the whole time but didn't have any screen time will pop-up and I'm like wait who are you? I'm almost glad when they die off because that means less of them. Even stranger still is the fact that even with some many characters, the past two books have barely had any female characters. One or two get mentioned in the passing, but all together, their lines would take up maybe a page or two. Which I find kind of ridiculous to be honest, I almost expect it from male authors, but this series is written by a woman.I don't know... as much as I enjoyed the first book, and I'm rather fascinated with the dragons and their concept in this series... the writing and characterization leave a lot to be desired. If the next book does not get better, I think I will be giving up on this series."}, {"userName": "Roberta Jayne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21250003-roberta-jayne", "userReview": "Throne Of Jade was pretty terrible. It made me think twice about wanting to read any more of this series, but I gave it another chance. (Seeing as there are nine bloody books in this thing.) Thankfully, Black Powder War was an improvement, but it didn't manage to match the quality of the first book in the series.The pacing of this book was great. It began with Laurence, Temeraire and the crew swiftly having to leave China in order to collect a handful of dragon eggs waiting for them in Istanbul. The journey itself was packed full of memorable moments and Tharkay, an initially shifty new character who served as a travel guide for the crew, was brilliant throughout the story. Laurence, on the other hand, was bit of a dick sometimes - although he tried his best not to be. But something about him doesn't feel right to me, it's strange.Sadly, after the crew arrived in Istanbul but for various reasons ended up stuck there for a painful amount of time, the book also felt a bit stuck. A disappointing ending is not what you want in a book that started off with such promise and adventure. Things got semi-interesting after one of the dragon eggs suddenly started hatching in the middle of an already intense battle moment. (To be honest, I would've been disappointed if one of the eggs hadn't started hatching before the crew made it back to England.) But it could've been A LOT stronger. Anyway, I haven't abandoned all hope for this series yet."}], "description": "Picking up where book two left off (in China, Macau) Captain Will Laurence and his extraordinary dragon, Temeraire, are ordered to retrieve and escort a precious cargo of valuable dragon eggs from Istanbul to England.
