But like a small percentage of the population, he reanimates as a decaying zombie. He quickly learns that he has no civil rights. He has to live in his parent's wine cellar, and he isn't allowed to see or contact his daughter. It's against the law for him to do simple things like logging on to the Internet or go to the movies. He's harrassed and pelted with food by the living (Breathers) if he even tries to take a walk, and zombies are routinely attacked by thrill seekers and drunken frat boys. Stuck in the basement drinking wine he can't really taste and watching television, his only other entertainment is his zombie support group where he meets the lovely (but very dead) Rita. Andy and his fellow zombies soon run across Ray, another one of the undead, who shows them the secret to reclaiming their lives and their dignity.This was a terrific twist on a zombie story. I never thought I could feel sympathy for the living dead, but even as a Breather, I found Andy's story touching and sometimes heartbreaking. The black humor had me laughing out loud even as my skin crawled.A very original concept with great writing. I've seen a lot of reviews compare it to Chuck Palahniuk novel, and I'd agree that there are some similarities to the best of Chuck P. However, I think that's selling S.G. Browne short. He's done something unique and creative here that's all his own."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Karpuk", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk", "userReview": "Let me flip to a random page of \"Breathers\" and see how long it takes me to find a lame joke....Here we go, \"If you've never been in a room full of zombies eating freshly cooked pieces of human flesh, then you probably wouldn't understand.\"That took four flips, and I was having bad luck.That phrase comes up a lot, the whole, \"Then you probably wouldn't understand.\" It's one of the many touches in the book lifted pretty shamelessly from Chuck Palahniuk. I think Chuck Palahniuk has inspired about as many terrible first person narratives as Tarantino did bad student films about wise-cracking gangsters.Putting aside the stylistic borrowing, the main issue with this book is that S.G. Browne just isn't funny. His jokes fall flat, his witticisms aren't witty, and the book practically smells from the flop-sweat of him trying too damn hard. There's so many pop culture references I felt like I was watching \"The Soup\" or one of those \"Best Week Ever\" shows. He's trying really hard to shock and be clever and after a while it felt almost awkward to read.The paper-thin characterization didn't help either. There are a few fully realized, interesting characters but they're mostly on the fringe. The central cast are either devoid of distinguishing traits or flat stereotypes. The main character suffers the worst, appearing to be a little more than a cipher for the author. He makes more snide, metrosexual comments about fashion and cooking that Patrick Batemen in American Psycho, and that's the only thing that stands out. God, look what he just made me do!Some of the drama is halfway decent, the discussions of dying and rebirth are interesting, but on some level I just couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to get into it. I just don't think humanity would react to zombies like it was a civil rights issue. It would probably be a straight up geekshow if anything.He gets an extra star for some of the details and the world-building, but this feels like amateur hour that stumbled into print."}, {"userName": "Servius  Heiner ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/603766-servius-heiner", "userReview": "Pretty good, it kind of lost it's luster towards the end.

We follow Andy, a newly risen zombie and the other members of his support group.Zombies in \"Breathers\" are a little different, in fact the concept is quite original to me and was fun to read. Not all people who die become zombies, but when the selected few do rise as the undead they are ridiculed by society and despised by their families, who have to take them home again. The one aspect of the novel that kept niggling me is that the reason for zombies is never given. I have to know why, how and when and \"breathers\" didn't give answers to any. We never know how zombies are made, or why, and I will admit that this drove me a little nuts! However, it does mention that zombies existed far back into history.There are many passages that made me smile, but it's not a 'laugh-out-loud' kind of novel, it's a bit too dark for that, but it is amusing. The human world know that zombies exist and they treat them pretty badly like they are at the bottom of the pile with no feelings or thoughts. But zombies come back with as much of these aspects of humanity as they left with. There are many rules and restrictions which zombies have to abide by and if they don't? Well, people just turn a blind eye to the cruelty inflicted. There are times when Andy's feelings about the injustice of the treatment of zombies by society becomes slightly repetitive but I did feel their repression.Andy was killed while driving and so was his wife. She didn't come back as a zombie and remained dead, which Andy finds difficult to deal with although prefers in many ways. He's not sure she would have loved him the same way if she had survived. To deal with his feelings, Andy meets up with a support group who he begins to grow to love, especially a zombie called Rita. There is obviously romance on the cards and there's even a bit of zombie sex, although nothing is described explicitly - thank goodness.At first Andy can't speak, can't use one of his arms and walks with a limp due to a crushed ankle. But after meeting a zombie called Ray who introduces him to the lip-smacking pleasure of human flesh, everything begins to change...and this is where the novel gets really interesting...However, there is just something missing for me - I didn't particularly connect with or care much about any of the characters, which is always a disappointment. The ending is rather abrupt and cruel and somewhat out of place, in my opinion, to the rest of the novel.VERDICT:Although I didn't love \"Breathers\" I did enjoy it and would still recommend it to other zombie fans. It is an interesting take on the zombie and there is a fair amount of humour which I liked."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1819243-vanessa", "userReview": "A cute story that finds you cheering the zombies on.

He dies in a car crash and wakes up a zombie. In this world this is apparently common place. When you do wake up a zombie, (where everything about you is the same, except for the fact you're kind of decaying) everyone who really loved you right before your death, suddenly hates your guts....if you still have them that is. Zombies are persecuted, harassed and are given no rights at all. This bothered me a little bit, it didn't ring true.Yes, this is a book about zombies, not really based in reality. It has recipes for \"breather\", (which is how zombies refer to the living) for Pete's sake. Left over mom loaf.....hilarious. But still that little \"hate your dead loved ones\" kept gnawing at me (pun intended).Andy and his zombie friends did not start out eating breather right away. They were given breather, unbeknownst to them, by a fellow zombie who passed it off a venison. It was fantastic, everything was tasteless up till then, so they wanted more. Soon, after having more \"venison\", they found themselves healing and becoming more like they were when they where alive. When they discover that it was breather they were eating, well.....that's when the recipes started to flow.I have lost loved ones. Anyone who has had loved ones pass would agree that they would do anything to get that person back. So, if I had my loved one back as a nasty smelling zombie, and found out breather would make the whole again...well....I would get some breather for them, right quick. Over population is a problem, and we have a few nut jobs currently trying to destroy the country/world, how about killing two birds with one stone?......Brined Boehner in orange sauce (Boehner's are self brineing, easy peasy)1 whole Boehner (fyi when two vowels go walking the first on does the talking) 2 medium to large yellow onions, unpeeled and cut into eighths 2 medium carrots, unpeeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 2 medium ribs celery, cut into 1-inch chunks 1 pint bittersNo oranges neededDirections1. Clean your Boehner thoughly, I can't stress this enough. Boehners are covered with chemicals to acheive the orange cheeto glow.2. Remove the innards from the Boehner, cut off the tail, if attached, and reserve them for making the rich Boehner broth. Sprinkle the bitters all over it, starting on the back side, then the cavity, and finally the breast. Put the Boehner on a wire rack set over a rimmed pan or platter and refrigerate uncovered overnight. 3. Remove the Boehner from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature. Fifteen to 20 minutes before roasting, position a rack in the lowest part of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put half of the onions, carrots, and celery in the Boehner cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Tuck the arms behind the neck and under the Boehner. Scatter the remaining onions, carrots, and celery in a large flameproof heavy-duty roasting pan fitted with a large V rack. Set the Boehner, breast side down, on the V rack. 3. Roast for 30 minutes. Pour 1 cup of bitters into the roasting pan and roast for another 30 minutes. Remove the Boehner from the oven and close the oven door. With two wads of paper towels, carefully turn the Boehner over so that it's breast side up. Add another 1/2 cup bitters to the roasting pan. Return the Boehner to the oven and continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 170 degrees F, about another 10 hours for a Boehner in the 190-pound range. (Keep a close eye on the vegetables and pan drippings throughout the cooking process. They should be kept dry enough to brown and produce the rich brown drippings to make gravy, but moist enough to keep from burning, so add water as needed throughout.) Transfer the Boehner to a carving board or platter, tent with foil, and let rest for at least 45 minutes and up to 1 hour before carving and serving. Meanwhile, make the silky pan gravy from the drippings.Alaskan Pulled-Palin SandwichesIngredients1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (yes even if you're using Bristol)2 medium yellow onions, diced2 tablespoons chili powder1 tablespoon ground cumin2 teaspoons paprika1 teaspoon cayenne pepper12 ounces beer, preferably lager (1 1/2 cups)3/4 cup ketchup3/4 cup cider vinegar1/2 cup whole-grain mustard2 tablespoons tomato paste1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, minced, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce1 10-pound bone-in Palin butt, (see Shopping Tip)Directions1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and very soft, about 20 minutes.2. Increase heat to high; add chili powder, cumin, paprika and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add beer, ketchup, vinegar, mustard, tomato paste, chipotle pepper and adobo sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 minutes. Meanwhile, trim all visible fat from the Palin butt.3. Remove the pan from the heat and add the Palin, spooning sauce over it. Cover the pan, transfer to the oven and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn the Palin over, cover, and bake for 1 1/2 hours more. Uncover and bake until a fork inserted into the Palin butt turns easily, 1 to 2 hours more.4. Transfer the Palin to a large bowl and cover with foil. Pour the sauce into a large measuring cup or glass bowl and refrigerate until the fat and sauce begin to separate, 15 minutes. Skim off the fat. Return the sauce to the pan and heat over medium-high until hot, about 4 minutes.5. Remove the bone and any remaining pieces of fat from the Palin meat. The bone should easily slip away from the tender meat. Pull the Palin apart into long shreds using two forks. Add the hot sauce to the meat; stir to combine. Serve hot....and also to, don't cha know...you betcha!Shopping tip....Palins are best when shot fresh from a helicopter.Of course these recipes are a joke. I do not in anyway advocate killing and eating Republicans. Everybody knows their not good eat'n, to tough and gristly. Democrats are much more tender and juicy."}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "For me Breathers starts off great, but loses steam at the end. I laughed a lot through the first 1/3 of the book, chuckled in the middle, but the laughs were harder to come by when it turned into a zombie civil rights story. I also thought the unsatisfying ending was a convenient way to handle the first zombie pregnancy, something I'm sure all we readers were waiting to see how it played out. But even so, it's a unique take on the zombie story and I'm glad Browne tackled it. I knew going in that this would be a humorous story mixed with the grotesque. Knowing this, it was still a little off putting for me when Andy, the main character, killed and ate his parents. The running joke about all the delicious ways his parents' flesh was cooked and enjoyed didn't sit well with me, and it just got to the point where it was annoying. OK. We get it. You enjoyed dining on your mother's breast meat and your father's flank. Gag. But I guess he's not into wasting food.But there are many laugh-out-loud moments in this book. Discovering that Andy has to bathe in Pine-Sol to mask the smell of his rot, and watching the battle of wills between Andy and his grossed out father play out, make for some funny reading. There is a tug-of-war Thanksgiving dinner scene between Andy, his father, and a cooked turkey that makes me laugh to this day when I think about it. The bittersweet scenes between Andy and his mother, who tries hard to connect with her zombie son, are wonderful. I think zombie fans and non-zombie fans alike would enjoy this tale told through the eyes of the disenfranchised zombie population."}, {"userName": "Maicie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2512140-maicie", "userReview": "Second reading:(I'm rereading this a year later for a group read.

I don't usually give in to impulse buys (I have too many must-haves on my reading list as it is), but I'm so glad I decided to give into this one! This book has it all - the blood and gore of typical zombie fare, but also romance (who wouldn't love a twenty-something hottie, even with the stitches at her wrists and throat, who happens to eat lipstick like it was going out of style), humor (I'm sorry, but breather disguised as venison is pure genius), murder (the opening scene is a husband-wife body part freezer bonanza), and an undead support group (yes, they even have field trips). It's a quick read, and it is just so, so good. Andy, the main character, simply wants his life back, even if he is a member of the undead. As a member of society who now has absolutley no rights whatsoever, it's a lot more difficult than it sounds.

As one of the undead - who have been made public in the last fifty or so years - Andy is in a predicament. As a dead man, he has no civil rights. He cannot go out in public, he has to watch out for animal control (who hold jurisdiction over policing the dead), and he must bear the brunt of the livings' resentment. His only weekly excursion out of his hostile parents' home is to attend his Undead Anonymous meetings.

The book is downright hilarious. S.G. Browne does a great job of giving the zombie a \"softer-side\" that has nothing to do with being able to show each other their brains or finger open wounds. Macabre to the core, it was surprising how human Browne made the zombies feel. In fact, as the book came to a close, I found myself rooting for Andy and his band of undead friends as they started feeding on the living. Ultimately, Andy IS a zombie, so it's easier to accept his flesh-eating tendencies, and the treatment of the zombies by the rest of humanity, \"Breathers\" seems downright atrocious, (but still hauntingly believable). All in all, the concept of zombie romance was top-notch, but Browne tried to tackle something a bit too big for Andy's britches. The romance peaks quickly, and if you were hoping for some hilarious developments between zombie girl and zombie boy, this isn't really the book for you. It has some gems, but the back cover and certainly the front cover's illustration are more eye-candy than substance - the plot is more of a social commentary from a zombie's perspective: poignant, astute, and incredibly creative.

It's a touch of Chuck Palahnuik and a touch of Christopher Moore, but in the end, it really is Browne's own.\u00a0 If you're looking for a non-traditional zombie story to kick back and enjoy, this is the one."}, {"userName": "Greta is Erikasbuddy", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3267545-greta-is-erikasbuddy", "userReview": "What happens when you die?

The Zombie world that has been kept hidden from us for forever and a day. OH! Hidden you ask? Yes in deedy!! You see... Zombies don't have ANY civil rights and are just the chewed up gum on the bottom of the fat cat's shoe of society.In this book, ANDY is reanimated after a car wreck. He loses his wife and because zombies aren't allowed to see their kids he also loses his daughter to his wife's brother's family. Andy goes to live with his parents. His Dad's not too cool... well, not cool at ALL to have ANdy living there stinking up the house with his zombie funk and his Mom is trying to act like nothing is different but she won't touch him at all.Well, how does a newly born zombie deal with all the new horrors of society. I mean: he can't drive, he can't get a job, he has to drink shampoo with flamowdohyde (oh hells! I don't know how to spell that hahas!) in it just to stay fresh, and if you're poor Andy -- well, you've kinda been smushed, have a limp, and your vocal cords aren't working right. Well, what do you do? Why, you go to a zombie support group that meets twice a week!! That's what you do!!LOLZ! This book is great!! It's like SHaun of the Dead meets Beetleguise meets One Flew over the CooCoo's nest (the movie... never read the book, so I'm guessing they are similar lolz). I laughed, I gasped, I awed (that's right people! Check out the cover!! There is some zombie swoon in it!! I've never read zombie swoon before but it was most excellent), and the ending will leave you wanting more. Actually the ending reminded me of the ending with Jon Connor in Terminator 3. You know the one. Not the new one with the breathy husky voicey Batman in it. No! The one with the younger kid. Yeah, read this book and let me know if you thought that too.I totally recommend this book to any zombie lover. It doesn't reflect zombies as the big baddies that are just wanting to tear into human flesh. It also shows the softer more cuddlier side of a zombie. OK OK... It does start out with Andy's parents stuffed in his freezer... but I swear... these zombies are cuddlier hahahs!!Awesome read!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/284410-beth", "userReview": "In this self-proclaimed \"zom-rom-com\" the undead are the sympathetic characters. Victims of trauma are unexpectedly and unexplainably becoming \"reanimated.\" The zombies, all at different stages of acceptance, ability and decomposition, are outcasts of society. Their second class citizen treatment ranges from harassment (assault and limb-stealing) to SPCA imprisonment for curfew violations, with termination imminent if a human family member, or Breather, doesn't bail them out. Some cope by meeting in AA-styled group sessions. In Undead Anonymous, Andy develops a crush on the lovely Rita (a suicide victim) and meets several unique and interesting individuals, including the charismatic Ray, a self-sufficient zombie who refuses to be disenfranchised and rallies the others for equal rights for the reanimated. This very funny satire manages to not take itself too seriously without getting campy. Browne deftly balances humor with pathos, and gore with romance. The vivid writing flows, delivering a satisfying pace and many amusing scenes. Characterizations are strong, and the voice steady throughout. My one criticism is that there is a hair of predictability to the story, but the ending still didn't play out exactly as I thought.The opening draws the reader in immediately: Andy comes to in his parents kitchen, suspecting he has just killed them. From there, Browne delivers a backstory that relates what life is like as a zombie that one could analogize to being a minority, gay, or even, a teen - others tend to make snap judgments about members of these communities and may be intolerant to varying degrees."}, {"userName": "Helene Papageorge", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/335040-helene-papageorge", "userReview": "OK. ATTENTION ALL YOU SWINGING SINGLE EXISTENTIALISTS LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME AND A LIGHT BOOK FOR CONVERSATION AT PARTIES WITHOUT ALIENATING ALMOST EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU AND THE PUNCHBOWL, WELL, THAT MESSIAH OF NOVELS HAS ARRIVED. This is the most original accessible rom-com-zom novel to ever appear a la Chuck Palhinuk--sorry I still haven't learned to spell his name. The novel is set in the present: post 9/11 America but just before Bear Stearns belies up. There are 3 major characters: Andy, Jerry and Rita then there are other minor zombie characters that all play supportng roles. All these characters meet at a weekly \"Survivor's\" group formatted like an AA meeting Browne's writing style is quite fluid, but the storyline is tricky. Although it comes off as a simplistic romance, there are many emotional layers that Andy wears. There are his spiritual conflicts, his existential conflicts then there are taboos tagential to his existentialist conflicts he must confront and reconcile with. I don't want to kill this story by deconstructing it to death. THis novel's other saving grace is that both genders can enjoy this book. THere is enough romance to satisfy any tear-jerker and enough gratuitous violence, cannibalism and car chasing to satisfy most if not ALL George Romero fans. So, if your running out of ideas on how to have light conversation at a party on existentialism without revealing total social ineptitude or making a zombie of yourself while alienating others.

The humour was intensely dry and morbid, which is awesome. And I mean, the plot is pure gold. Man becomes zombie, falls in love with other zombie, gets involved with a rogue zombie who eats human flesh, hilarity ensues. It did have some vaguely serious story structure problems though. The first half was amazing, but the second half kinda floundered all over the place, with tone issues and random shit happening and what not. I do believe this book had the potential to rule in all sorts of ways, but it kind of let me down towards the end. Still, you can pretty much read it in 2 or 3 sittings, so it's worth it in that sense.

I just thought it was so clever and cute. And I have an affinity for covers. A stellar cover is usually a determining factor in me picking out books to read (i.e. Cassandra Clare\u2019s Mortal Instrument series). So I put this book in my GoodReads list of \u201cto-read\u201d and my dear friend Jenn (who is my Zombie Apocalypse Sister in Arms) told me in a few words, I have this book, you can borrow it, but don\u2019t get your hopes up. I should have taken this as a warning.The idea of Breathers is good. Clever even. And the writing is pretty decent. There\u2019s a bit more humor in this zombie POV than in Warm Bodies (see my review on my blog!). And that\u2019s where my praise for this book ends. Yeah. Sorry Mr. Browne. I had a hard time getting into this book. It was just sort of blas\u00e9. Oh! Good word! Anyway\u2026I\u2019m going to break down this review by what this book promised to deliver on and fell short on doing.1.\t\u201cDarkly Funny.\u201d Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, folks who are fans of this book, there were some funny parts in this book that made me chuckle. But most of the time I was too busy trying to decided if I should feel bad for Andy for the stuff him and zombie-kind put up with, or smack him like a bitch because he\u2019s acting like one. There is only some much \u201cbut you would only understand if you were a zombie\u201d to describe how it is to be a zombie. Honestly, see it as a cop-out for trying to weave emotions into a zombie and making us, the readers, understand.2.\t\u201cSurprisingly touching.\u201d Really? Are you sure? Are those zombie support meetings that Andy goes to suppose to make us feel a deeper connection to zombie-kind because honestly, I was left not feeling surprisingly touched, but more bored. I suppose having Andy and the others start to magically \u201cheal\u201d and the emotions of dealing and then to have Fate piss all over it could be seen as touching, but I just couldn\u2019t get behind Andy as a hero. I get that his life sucks, but dude, really? Grow a pair of balls and be a George Romero zombie for Christ sake!3.\t \u201cGory enough to satisfy even the most discerning reader.\u201d Liar, liar, pants on fire! Yeah, the zombies eat people. But where\u2019s the fury? The hunger? The natural urge for survival? Oh wait. It\u2019s totally not there. There is only one scene where Andy finally acts like a zombie and chomps on his psychiatrists face. The rest of the time, Andy and company are feasting on \u201cBreathers\u201d like they are at some family get together. Just because zombies are eating regular humans, doesn\u2019t mean that it is gory. Gross? Yes. Gory? Well, let\u2019s just say that I think whoever wrote the little review didn\u2019t look up the word gory.Can you tell I was totally unimpressed with this book? I have no problem with the idea of a zombie POV novel, I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m sure S.G. Browne is a lovely man. He can totally write. It\u2019s good. I just think this one fell kind of short of the finishing line.
