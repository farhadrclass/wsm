The three main characters were realistic and relatable with the different situations each of them faced and it was nice to have characters crossing a span of different age ranges.This book really caught me off guard at some moments! The biggest twist, I definitely didn't predict happening and also the outcome from that twist, I didn't expect. About halfway through, I found myself having difficulty in putting the book down because the story became more and more anticipatory. This wasn't the \"typical contemporary\" and I really enjoyed that fact. It wasn't meaningless fluff. It was an enjoyable read that included both serious topics and also included humour. The whole concept of \"What if?\" was explored in a new way and it also reminded me about living in the moment. I cannot wait to explore more novels written by Jude Deveraux as this one has become a favourite and I know that I will be recommending this one to others."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2556522-carolyn", "userReview": "I just love the Summerhouse series and this latest addition is fabulous!

And I have to admit it has been several years since I read one. This one was an ARC I won through a Goodreads giveaway.Frankly, I had to work to make myself finish this book. Cardboard stereotypical characters that I didn't care about, stilted dialogue and great chunks of information dumped into the story instead of being woven in. And a premise that wasn't believable to be honest.

In, As You Wish, by Jude Deveraux, you get so much...fiction, romance, time travel, second chances, and true to life struggles. Jude Deveraux, delivers an easy to read story. One of the things that got me about the writing of this book is how well the flashbacks are done. She delivered just enough to fill in the blanks and move the story along so perfectly. Then adding in the bit of time travel was just the cherry on top. An added bonus is that the if you love the Summerhouse series, you will appreciate this new addition. Olivia is a woman whose life did not turn out the way she thought it was going to. Living an unhappy life for so long can have its toll on a person. But now at 60 years old and a newlywed, she is over the moon on truly living the life she wanted, even though there are doubts and some conversations yet to be had. Kathy in her 40s is married to the man every woman wants and every man wants to be, but he is in love with someone else. Twenty year old, Elise, has a marriage arranged by her parents and their best friends. Her husband has a mistress that is having his baby and takes drastic measures to remove Elise from his life. Whether you believe in fate or not, these three women end up at the Summerhouse. These three women meet and drinks flow, what do they have to lose by opening up to complete strangers with conversations of regrets, wants and dreams. When an unexpected note is delivered the women have an opportunity to go back in time and make their dreams come true. 5 Brilliant stars **Review by Lisa, Late Night Reviewer for Up All Night with Books**"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3252678-linda", "userReview": "Review to come.

But, honestly, I feel all over the place about this book. I think it\u2019s one that as a reader you just have to let go, enjoy the ride and don\u2019t get caught up in the minutia. I did love seeing three women of differing ages all helping each other through the issues they were facing and seeing the differences in their thoughts and what approach they would take.

Shouldn't have bothered. That was a minor part of the book. Before I could get to the time travel aspect I had to suffer through the first half of the book and a clunky, contrived setup putting these three women of different ages and backgrounds into sharing a summer house. It was weird that pretty much immediately they all share their life stories in painfully honest detail with two strangers. What a coincidence, the husband of each of the women has/had a whole other life with another woman that they really love(d). (And on the afternoon they meet, the woman in her 20s and the woman in her 60s decide to streak buck naked through the woods together. So weird). The time travel part didn't appear until more than halfway through the book and it was a big letdown. After all that setup the book only portrayed what two of the three women did differently when they got to go back and re-live a three week period in their past. And their \"do-over\" mostly centered around picking a different man."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33156728-leah", "userReview": "This wasn't for me, which was disappointing.

Everything felt shallow.Here's what disappointed me the most: Everything awesome that transpired in A Girl From Summer Hill was just wiped out by this book.

You meet three women of different ages. Coming together at the Summerhouse in virginia where they find they have alot in ccommon. Olivia is starting over after being married to a man she never loved. Elise is the youngest of the three woman but she is married to a man she has known all her life. The sad thing for Elise is she has never felt loved or cherished by anyone in her life. Kathy is a intelligent woman but, she fails to recognize her own talent. She is married to a man who respects her, but does not love her. What brings these three ladies together is one of the many twist in this romance time travel fantasy. When they are given the chance to travel back in time for three weeks will they take it?

This is book 3 in the Summerhouse series. Olivia, Kathy and Elise meet at Summerhouse and discover that they can go back in time to change a decision that could effect their lives in the future. The only question is are they brave enough to make that change. This is a remarkable premise for a reader to contemplate about their own life. A lost love, an abusive marriage, an unexpected pregnancy are all things these ladies consider. This seems like a great book for Book Clubs and I imagine the discussions will get quite lively. I have been a fan of Jude Deveraux for a long time and this has to be one of my favorites and I'm going to get Summerhouse and Return to Summerhouse very soon.

Olivia attempting to right all the bad things that ever happened was pretty irritating, and her anger with Kit while ignoring her own culpability in the past. I also didn't think it was believable just how badly she let her previous husband and stepson screw her over, and the unreasonable expectations and bad attitudes of the stepson and wife, etc. That's nonsense. And apparently the stepson knew about his dad's other family? Seriously? Olivia raised him from a baby, so it's a little ridiculous that he would side with his dad's mistress. Also, I'm disappointed that Alan didn't change the second time around - honestly, who we are with has a huge impact on who we become. I really expected that he would end up marrying someone that forced him to actually do work, instead of repeating his whole life over.Elise's story was probably my favorite, though Kent was a complete asshole in so many ways, and Carmen wasn't a lot better. I mean, Elise actually knew Carmen for years before she was with Kent, so it's a little disheartening to see her become the stereotypical \"other woman\" talking crap about the wife instead of realizing that the guy is the actual problem. Kathy almost got left out - we got detailed views of the other two, but her story seemed like an afterthought, crammed into a few pages toward the end, and only after you already know she had a happy ending. I still don't understand why Cal was sneering at her all the time, but whatever. And I thought she couldn't have children (according to Ray). I also can't give Ray a pass, because even though he apparently loved Kathy, he was still cheating on her and trying to get his mistress pregnant. Despite the fact that he was completely WRONG in thinking Kathy's life revolved around him and she depended on him...if he really thought that, he's even more of an asshole for trying to end the marriage in that way."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15857586-natasha", "userReview": "Loved it.

What If you had chosen someone different? What If you had responded differently to situations? And not just one character is wondering \"What If...\", but three women are going to get the chance to see if their What If can produce happiness. That is the premise of Jude Deveraux's new book \"As You Wish.\"The friendship and support between the women is beautiful to see, and some scenes were perfectly written (I love the skinny-dipping scene). The three weeks that the women have in their \"What If\" scenario was a mixed result for me. For Elise, I found it hard to believe that her parents would act the way that they did, but Alejandro is a keeper. Kathy's story seemed to break the rules that had been explained before she went back, without any effects. Olivia's story had a sweet conclusion. Overall, the book felt like three short stories bound together by one really long introduction, but one of my favorite short stories ever (\"Matchmakers\" from The Invitation) is from Deveraux so that is a compliment.

I highly recommend that you do, and that you read all of Jude's books as she is the best! What makes Jude's writing so amazing?
