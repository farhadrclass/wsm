Then again, I'm picky.I'll mention this briefly; it was crude. There were way too many f-bombs dropped and way too many sex references. In my opinion, you don't need these to make a great book. In fact, it takes away from it. Perhaps I wasn't expecting it, but if I'm being honest here I wouldn't have started the book in the first place if I had. The medieval English sounded forced. It was nothing like Shakespeare or other authors of his time. I honestly can say I have no idea how big of a span this story took up. It might have been a few days. Maybe a few months. I have no idea.Actually, there are a lot of things I have no idea about. I never formulated anyone's appearance, particularly the vampires. If it was mentioned I didn't even notice. I used Loki from Avengers as first Tyr then Loki himself. Thor was more like Chris Hemsworth as his brief appearance in Star Trek. Tyr was faceless almost the whole time.The characters weren't very constant. Tyr was in the beginning a coward, but in the flashbacks(which is the majority of the book) was calculating and unafraid. He was analytical, but the present-Tyr was rash and jumped to the worst of conclusions immediately. There was never any mention of a transition. It was like they were two different people. Same with Thor. Michael was a fracas, but Thor was always calm and ambiguous. They said they liked Michael, so they made him a vampire. And they liked Thor. The two are completely different people to me. Loki was a little more consistent, and slightly more comparable to the Loki in Norse mythology; I didn't get that with the other two much. If someone were to come up to me and ask what the book was about, I wouldn't be able to say much more than just 'vampires'. There really wasn't a lot of plot or central conflict; he was trying to decide whether to kill the girl, but he'd already decided that, he just didn't want to. He was afraid of someone coming to kill him, but there was no real threat of that. Most of it was back story, with no central conflict, either. To me it sounded like this: I have an idea of how I think vampires are. I really want to write about my sexy vampires. I'll just describe how one became a vampire and throw in this chick to give it some sequence. And some sex, I'll throw that in, too, because sex is awesome. By the way, the title and the cover are completely lost to me. I get that blood is thicker than water. So is juice. So are a lot of things. There's no real significance to me; it was never explained at all in the novel. It does, however, sound awesome, and the cover, although it looks like red food colouring sprayed into a glass, looks awesome as well. I also don't get the prophecy. It was mentioned briefly but would have been very easy to bring up again and remind you of its existence. And maybe mentioned a bit earlier. I was wondering for half the book why he didn't just turn her into a vampire already.I think I got all the bad stuff. Let's move on to the good stuff.The fighting sequences? Freaking awesome. I loved those. They weren't overly detailed but I got what was going on, so in my opinion there was the perfect amount of detail. I loved them. And they weren't too long(maybe one or two was a little lengthy) and there weren't too many. They weren't even confusing at all.Although there was a lot of back story, and two stories being told at once, I thought it was very well done. It's easily confusing to write two stories at once and make the transitions smooth and everything make sense. I really liked how well that was done.I loved the Norse mythology reference. Before Avengers no one has really heard of Norse mythology. I'm glad I wasn't alone in that. However, the movie kind of ruined it, which is unfortunate. Sorry there, bud.The multiple points of view were nice, and provided different sides of each character; however, they switched a little to abruptly and occasionally I got confused. I also liked the West; not a lot of people use that these days. Overall I honestly cannot think of a single person I know that I would recommend this to. If I ever met an adult, sex-obsessed, Twilight lover, I might recommend it to him/her. Because, let's be honest. These vampires are just Twilight vampires that don't sparkle and are a little dirtier because their author isn't Mormon. There were too many f-bombs and too much sex for me to truly enjoy this novel, too much objectifying women into nothing more than whores and toys and blah blah blah(I'm usually okay with that, though, it's not as big of a deal). Anyway, I' keep away from this unless you're into the large amount of paragraphs above."}, {"userName": "Brainycat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3807871-brainycat", "userReview": "Brainycat's 5 \"B\"s:blood: 5boobs: 3bombs: 2bondage: 2blasphemy: 4Bechdel Test: FAILDeggan's Rule: FAILGay Bechdel Test: FAILI liked this novella a lot. The story could have been a moderately exciting thrill ride full of carnage and lust, but by breaking up the narrative between contemporary events and the history between the three vampires going back over a hundred years, the story elevates itself a notch above a mere gorefest. The story features vampires the way I like them: undead humans with supernatural abilities that turn them into amazing predators. Not unlike The Lost Boys, actually. These guys lack most of the weaknessses of the vampire genre, and are only held in check by the fear of an oft named but never seen arch vampire cabal that will supposedly kill anyone who violates the ages old codex governing vampire behavior. (Cue the sequel here...)It's a very short and visceral read. This is not a complicated book; there are no metaphors to decipher nor is the author trying to Say Something About The Human Condition. The characters are all straightforward (they're named Tyr, Loki and Thor - get it?) and one dimensional. This isn't a book to make you think about things, this is a book designed soley to entertain for a few minutes. The pace is excellent, the voicing good enough and the cadence and vocabulary are as good as books that have gone through the hands of a professional publishing house. Unfortunately, there were a number of grammatical errors and typos that should have been caught before going to publication. That being said, the price is right and I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.\nPlease note: I don't review to provide synopses, I review to share a purely visceral reaction to books and perhaps answer some of the questions I ask when I'm contemplating investing time and money into a book."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6220207-alicia", "userReview": "Where do I begin? I read the first half of this book in one sitting, expecting it to somehow change and introduce something... \"more\" to me. And perhaps that was the wrong thing to wait for. I just now finished the book and I didn't get \"more\". I actually got less. I got nothing. I got what a proper series book would never do: end with absolutely no closure. There was a hint at closure, and no promise of what was to come. Everything ended still up in the air. I assume the contents of the first half of the next book in the series are the closure I was expecting... But I don't care enough to buy that book because I can't get past the level of crudeness in this book. While I drop f-bombs all over the place, I do not find it particularly appealing to constantly see that when a character is not speaking. There were many other characteristic flaws and the book in itself was very lackluster in describing the characters and settings. I prefer to become wholly involved in a book's world when I open it. I learn about the characters and what kind of a person they are. Thicker Than Water does capture the personalities of the main characters well, but other than that they are simply blank canvases.In short, Thicker Than Water was very lackluster for me. I did not gain anything other than a memorably bad taste in my mouth. It was a nice change in view of vampires (no glittery aura here, no sir) but still, everything was so crudely written that I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it."}, {"userName": "\u2570\u22b1\u2665\u22b1\u256e\u10e6\ua9c1Kathy,Ahmazing Book Faerie\ua9c2\u10e6\u256d\u22b1\u2665\u227a", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5259574-kathy-ahmazing-book-faerie", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this more traditional take on Vampires. No glitter and sparkle here!! Just three blood brothers, doing what comes naturally to original Vampires.... rape and pillage and drink!

The story swings back and forward, so takes some concentrating, I myself am going to have to read it again, when I don't have so much else going on, so I can get it really clear in my head. Loki and Tyr have had a falling out and no longer associate with each other, but Tyr and Thor have remained close, Tyr, hoping his brother doesn't bother him again, because of the secret he is hiding from the rest of the Vampire nation.

They have been rehashed one way or another, recreated, done and redone to the point of causing nausea every time I even heard the word \"vampire\". I expected nothing from this novel but something gripped my interest and didn't let go. I had the opportunity to glance at the first few sentences of Chapter 1 on Greg Sisco's website. And I loved what I saw. I immediately ordered the book on my Kindle, eager to read more of it.Sisco's impeccable prose transports the reader into a horrific yet inviting world. He narrates the tale of Loki, Thor and Tyr, three vampires, three blood brothers, who share everything, from hunting, robbing and killing their victims to fighting each other mercilessly. They know no fear, no sorrow, and no compassion for the human kind. They only want to feed and enjoy their eternal condition the best they can. And enjoy it they do. Yet, Tyr meets this girl, Eva, and falls for her because she's stronger than any other human he met before. He saves her from a certain death, and promises himself to find her again. He also cuts all ties with Loki and Thor after Loki expresses his huge discontentment at Tyr's decision to spare the six-year-old girl's life.Vampires aren't supposed to fall for humans. Vampires aren't supposed to break the code. Turning Eva into a vampire is out of the question. Tyr knows the danger of loving Eva. While he struggles to find his path, far from Loki and Thor who live solely to cause havoc on earth, he tries to understand what binds him to this girl who thirteen years later is now dying of cancer. Eva means nothing and she means everything. She's the end and the beginning of a new life for Tyr. After reuniting with Thor and Loki in Las Vegas, he has to finally decide what to do with her before resuming his chaotic existence among his bloodthirsty brothers.Sisco's created a world full of wit, twisted humor and captivating imagery. He left me hungry for more and convinced me vampire tales aren't so old fashioned after all.A great read to recommend to any horror fan."}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "I got this book ages ago when it was a freebie on Amazon. It\u2019s supposedly a novella, but it took me ages to finish it. Why? Because it bored me to tears! It just went on and on and on, with nothing significant happening. No plot, mostly just back-story \u2013 which still did not culminate into something that could be considered a plot. The one good thing I can say about this novella (and also my reason for giving it a two-star rating) is that the writing is good. However, I would still recommend that a professional editor give it a good once-over to smooth it out. Many sentences had missing words. I also didn\u2019t like the typesetting of the Kindle version I got from Amazon. My Kindle allows me to change fonts to suit my visual needs, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t change the font on my Kindle for this book. This author undoubtedly has potential, but needs to learn a thing or two about plotting and world-building. The characters at least were relatively developed, but the pacing far too slow to hold my interest.Overall, nothing happened in this story. Nothing that I found interesting enough to make me enjoy the story. It\u2019s about vampires that are somewhat different from the usual, but still nothing that makes it worth my while to recommend this book to anyone."}, {"userName": "Marsha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5698739-marsha", "userReview": "Thicker Than Water is a welcome return of the old fashioned, villainous vampire. The characters in this book are the typical brutal killers that I came to love and fear while growing up. I enjoyed the fact that the vampires are susceptible to sunlight, holy water, and the whole nine yards. It's almost reassuring because the Blood Brothers are so ruthless and terrifying that they need some sort of an Achilles' heel. Loki, Tyr, and Thor, and their apparent God complexes, deliver on all accounts; bloodthirsty, conflicted, and intriguing. Greg Sisco paints an exotic picture of violence, seduction, and love with a straight forward writing style.

It took me 2 1/2 hours to finish, and it was so worth it. I loved this book. I don't know what it is with Indie vampire stories, but they are always the best. I can understand why someone wouldn't like the book, and that is why I marked this review as a spoiler because I will offer two different ways to review this book.\"The One Star Review\"This book had barely any plot. This book was one enjoyable roller coaster to...nowhere. If it was an explanation on how Michael became Thor, then the book should've just taken place in the past. If the book was trying to show the reconciliation between Loki and Tyr, then there needed to be more fear from Tyr and more threats from Loki. Maybe not have them makeup so quickly? Throw in a little fight? If the story was meant to be a love story between Eva and Tyr then this book failed. While I could sort of understand the love Eva had for Tyr, there was no way Tyr felt anything akin to love for Eva. He treated her like a sick puppy. When he first saw Loki after 13 years he stood between Eva and Loki and was protecting her. Then after an hour of making up with Loki he started saying how he was going to go home and kill Eva because fuck it there's a family code to honor. Should of thought about that family code while you were on the train in 1986 douchebag. The final reason why this book deserved 1 star isn't really a problem with the book but a problem with other people's review of the book. They kept saying how this book ends with a great cliffhanger and how they can't wait to read the second novel. About halfway through the book I began to feel like either Tyr, the Butcher, or Olfeiger was going to kill Loki and that would be the cliffhanger. If it isn't already obvious, he is my favorite character. While I continued reading, anytime the chapters took place in the future I would be afraid to turn the page because I didn't want to read about Loki's death. When Loki and Tyr met after 13 years, I had my computer ready to write some hate mail if Loki died. Then, Tyr and Loki just made up. And I was so excited. No Loki death-yay! But where was the cliffhanger? So I finish the book. And I just want to point out to everyone that if Tyr saying how he is going to wait until the morning to kill Eva is a cliffhanger, then you all are idiots. Anyway, I decided to make a one star review because while I am giving this story a five and I love this book, there were some flaws that I'd be a fool to not acknowledge.\"The Five Star Review\"Mr. Sisco painted a world of awesome vampires. Loki and Tyr were amazing in the flashbacks and reminded me of Anne Rice's Lestat. While sometimes an excessive of amount of flashbacks detracts from the plot, I believe the flashbacks are essential to the story here. This is not Twilight-these are awesome vampires. Oh, God, Loki is just the best. The flashback to Al's? The shootout between Locke and Al's gangs? So good. I read in somebody else's review of this book that they didn't like the excessive swearing and sex and they felt it ruined the book for them. I disagree-surprisingly. I usually hate the excessive use of that kind of stuff in books, but I feel it was so essential to the character's personalities that I didn't even mind it. This book deserves five stars from me because I was hooked from the very first page and I need more. This book was a breath of fresh air from some of the popular vampire crap that is cycling through the television these days. The vampires in this novella are exactly the kind of vampires that I love and I can't wait to read book 2."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "I have to start by saying vampires aren\u2019t my thing. No way, nuh uh, no vampires for this girl - strictly Zombies only. However, after reading Greg\u2019s fantastic blog post on \u2018proper\u2019 vampires http://www.gregsisco.com/five-vampire... I was intrigued. Maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s someone out there who doesn\u2019t think vampires sparkle and love kittens. So casting my long-standing vampire prejudice aside, I (reluctantly) picked up a copy of Thicker than Water.Thicker than Water is the story of two brothers Tyr and Loki, and their recent (in vampire terms) recruit, Thor. Named after Norse mythological characters, the brothers have been around the block more than a few times, and have the whole vampire game pretty much down pat. After a disagreement over a child during one of their hell-raising, blood-guzzling escapades, they are no longer in contact \u2013 Tyr is in a relationship with a human and Loki is building up his empire with Thor within the sinful confines of Vegas.Much of this book focuses on the tale behind the turning of Thor, in the late 19th century wild-west, and ends with the story behind the argument that has separated the brothers for the last 13 years.Thicker than Water pulls no punches where these vampires are concerned \u2013 they are in the truest sense of the word, proper vampires. For me, the story started a little slowly, but after the first third of the book, the pace was ramped up quickly, climaxing with the story of their last raid together. The characters are strong and easily identifiable, which makes them very \u2018likeable\u2019 (for want of a better word!) and intriguing.There were some small spelling and grammatical errors, but not enough to bring out the Grammar Nazi\u2019s in full force. One other thing I found slightly difficult to get used to was the accents during the Wild-West chapters, but once I got into it, I didn\u2019t even notice it anymore.Am I converted? Partially (I\u2019m old and set in my ways!). I love that Greg isn\u2019t afraid to go all out with his vampires and paint them exactly as they should be \u2013 bloodthirsty and merciless.Warning \u2013 the ending IS a cliffhanger!"}, {"userName": "Carrie Kilgore", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23167325-carrie-kilgore", "userReview": "This book starts out just fine, with some interesting details about these vampires (including some great folk lore the vampires have handed down within their species), an intriguing prophecy, and a compelling relationship one vampire begins to develop with a human. Then we are suddenly plunged into an extended flashback where everyone starts sounding completely fake and we're hit with a good deal of gratuitous violence (violence, like sex, can be pivotal to a good plot but please, let's have some reason for it beyond shock effect). By the time I was about halfway through the book, I stopped because I just didn't care anymore what happened to any character. It's a definite shame because I loved the ideas the author presented up front. That long, long, long, long flashback hijacked the promise of a good read. Flashbacks in general are a problem because they haul you right out of the action. Much better to present needed info from a character's past in other ways (no, not pages or chapters of a character explaining the past). Handled right, a character's history can help us connect emotionally and care about what's going to happen. That definitely did not happen here. If the point was simply that the vamps have been assholes for ages, that point could have been made more simply (and with greater brevity). If there must be a flashback, get quickly to the robbery (which I presume will be important, but there's no guarantee). A great disappointment.If, on the other hand, you are a die-hard horror fan and you like blood and gore ladled on (whether or not a real purpose exists in telling you about it), perhaps you'll love it."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3987691-brooke", "userReview": "[Tyr seems to be trying to be different, though.

There is a slight romantic type situation in the book so don't worry, it's not some vampire siblings how to guide.I loved how the author created a ying, a Yang, and a Median with the three brothers, and made sure to give the reader a glimpse into the makeup of them all. Also, everything wasn't so black and white, including the ending, and I really do hope he continues the series. This is one I will buy in bulk. But I digress. This really provoked some thought in me, which is easy in the terms of ranting but not in the sense of morals and right and wrong. I love Anne Rice, but these characters didn't have Louis or Lestat type breakdowns or questions about vampire way of life.

Each chapter tells a separate story but ties it all together. I'm trying hard not to give anything away, but it's so hard! Creates a different suspense with each chapter that leads up to the end. I can NOT WAIT for the next one!!! Not even love gets in the way to the way of life of these amazing creatures! IT\"S AWESOME"}, {"userName": "M.L.

Tyr and Loki are brothers that have not seen each other in 13 years since \"The Great Train Robbery of 1986\". Tyr has been busy drinking from his drains and putting bodies in the incinerator while Loki is off being Loki. And then the brothers are reunited along with Thor....and blood....and violence....Greg Sisco has a visceral grasp of the vampire genre which has been sorely missed since Twilight. If you like your vampires bloody, rough, and merciless, then this is a must read. Cannot wait for book two."}, {"userName": "Bren", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285663-bren", "userReview": "This was my first novel by this author. The writing was wonderful. The story was dark and twisted - just perfect. When I came to the end, though, I was stunned. I still haven't been able to figure out exactly what the plot was. I think it may have been the story of the little girl, but it was so minor and so unexciting, I just can't believe that was the plot. It read more as if it was a character development book. Explaining the histories of them and their personalities. Mr. Sisco is a wonderful author, just really lacked in a true plot."}, {"userName": "Peyton Sloane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21156394-peyton-sloane", "userReview": "This was sitting partially read on my Itouch for a long time.

Another vampire book down. And I have to say this one was more brutal, cruel, almost felt honest.. Not the fairy tale everyone falls in love with the vampire and they don't suck blood from humans and kill them. This was an all out blood and guts I'm killing fucking hot chicks for blood because that's what I do because I can and have to. I found myself liking the character I thought everyone would end up hating. He's domineering, selfish, confident, mean, self righteous, and an ass."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4957361-gary", "userReview": "These vampires are true apex predators. Do you weep for the chicken in your grocer's freezer? If you do then this isn't the book for you. If you want unremorseful, reveling in their own destruction vampires this is the book for you.

But I didn't overly love it. There was a misogynistic tone that I didn't like. And while the vampire lore was a little different than other books, it felt true to the story. I enjoyed the cross layers of time lines. Loki is psychotic and Thor is coming into his own. Tyr is the most conflicted. His story with Eva is cute. I wanted to see what would happen next.

They feel no remorse. They view human beings as livestock or sex objects. And after a thousand years of sex and destruction seducing and murdering the prettiest girls in the room, they have become two of the most diabolical serial killers of all time.But following a violent feud that separates the brothers for over a decade, Tyr hides himself away in a house on the outskirts of  Las Vegas where he falls in love with a terminally ill young woman named Eva, an act deemed punishable by death by the fabled vampire council known as  The Chosen.When a mysterious messenger arrives at his home, Tyr fears both Loki and  The Chosen have tracked him down, forcing him to protect both himself and the dying young woman who is teaching him to feel. Thicker Than Water is a vampire thriller focusing on 100 years of immortal, hedonistic life, from the slummy brothels of the  American Wild West, to the bright lights of  Las Vegas circa 1999. The story weaves together vampires, brothel owners, cowboys, prostitutes, and gallons of innocent blood in an orgy of violence, sex, revenge, romance, betrayal, and brotherly love.  The \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d Vampire Series  Thicker Than Water marks the first novel in the  Blood Brothers vampire series. Drawing inspiration from Norse mythology and the works of Shakespeare, the series spans 1,000 years and half the globe, telling the story of two brothers and the rise and fall of their bloodthirsty clan. The aim of the series is to paint vampires as gods, preying on humanity from the shadows as they steer the events of history.Each of the four novels in the  Blood Brothers series will tell both a present day story and an historical story set sometime within the last 1,000 years, gradually unveiling the mystery of the brothers' origin and the details of their fall.The second novel in the series, currently titled  The Wages of Sin, is planned for release in the second half of 2012. The last two novels will follow in 2013 and 2014 respectively.For all the latest on the  Blood Brothers series, visit www.GregSisco.com.  A Few Words from the Author With the state of vampire fiction, I'm almost embarrassed to admit to loving vampires, but I do. As a child, vampire thrillers like  Near Dark, The Lost Boys, and  Fright Night were my bedtime stories. I didn't want to be an astronaut when I grew up, I wanted to be a vampire. They were sexy, cool, and they were always out for a good time.They used to be confident, often to a fault. Today they're afraid to talk to girls.They used to be gluttons. Today they're vegetarians.They used to drink the blood of virgins. Today they  are virgins.I don't envy them like I used to. I just miss them.What I'm getting at is this: If you're looking for a vampire to swoon over, to fall in love with, to think about in the tub with scented candles and wine while some soft music plays in the background, you'd probably do well to look elsewhere for a vampire series. But if you're looking for a mean son of a bitch who knows how to play the silky seducer when it suits his needs, well... then you're getting warmer.", "title": "Thicker Than Water\n      \n          (Blood Brothers #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12945682-thicker-than-water", "average": 3.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327175485l/12945682.jpg", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5292596.Greg_Sisco", "name": "Greg Sisco"}], "type": ["Paranormal", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12945682-thicker-than-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13271805-one-night-stan-s", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17257316-the-wages-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13572538-the-tenth-photograph", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27385760-in-nightmares-we-re-alone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18188725-gunslinger-p-i", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
