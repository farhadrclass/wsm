Leniency in reviewing, knowing the painstaking hard work and headaches that goes with the territory of breaking into the mysterious world of becoming a published author. And excitement in discovering a new author whose charters, plots, and storylines are so intriguing one can't wait for future sequels. Pryor's novel, The Bookseller, needs no leniency in reviewing, as it reads as if penned by a longstanding seasoned, best-selling author of mystery and suspense. The main character, Hugo, retired FBI agent from Austin Texas, now head of security for an embassy in Paris, and an avid reader and collector of rare books, makes for a very likable, interesting, intelligent, and favored character. A great contrast to his best friend, cohort in crime solving, Tom, a retired freelancing CIA agent, witty, sarcastic and crass with charm. I'm looking forward, with excited literary anticipation, to many future Hugo installments."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "Maybe?

A Cl\u00e1udia sabendo o meu gosto por livros que falem sobre livros achou que este livro me iria agradar. E, surpreendentemente, agradou, mas j\u00e1 l\u00e1 vamos. Para j\u00e1 queria agradecer \u00e0 Cl\u00e1udia este novo \"amigo\". Parti para esta leitura sem conhecer nada da hist\u00f3ria, nem do que se tratava. E fiquei com a ideia que se iria tratar de um livro sobre o Holocausto, muito pertinente para o \"Leituras do Holocausto\". Mas n\u00e3o foi bem assim. A personagem que d\u00e1 nome ao livro foi, de facto, um sobrevivente do Holocausto. Mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 mais desenvolvimentos sobre esse passado. \u00c9 apenas um facto que o autor adicionou \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria. Foi uma leitura bastante r\u00e1pida. Um autor conseguiu criar uma hist\u00f3ria com o ritmo suficiente para o leitor n\u00e3o perder interesse na hist\u00f3ria. Pois a hist\u00f3ria vai-se perdendo ao longo da narrativa. Promete muito, mas nada de significativo. E acrescento at\u00e9 alguma desilus\u00e3o da minha parte relativamente \u00e0 quest\u00e3o do Holocausto. Fiquei com a no\u00e7\u00e3o que iria ter mais desenvolvimentos sobre o passado da personagem que d\u00e1 nome ao livro. Gostaria de ter conhecido um pouco mais este Livreiro, da sua hist\u00f3ria, da sua viv\u00eancia. Contudo, \u00e9 um livro com bastante ritmo, em que nunca nos aborrecemos. Mas como j\u00e1 referi, senti que o autor \"camuflou\" a hist\u00f3ria atrav\u00e9s do ritmo. Recordei, mais uma vez, Paris e os t\u00e3o t\u00edpicos alfarrabistas - os chamados boquinistes - na margem do rio Sena, onde tantas vezes me \"perdi\". Embora, e como o pr\u00f3prio autor refere no in\u00edcio do livro, n\u00e3o houve um rigor na geografia da cidade de Paris. O autor decidiu criar e/ou alterar certos locais da cidade conforme a narrativa do livro. Se por um lado n\u00e3o vejo qualquer problema tratando-se de uma hist\u00f3ria de fic\u00e7\u00e3o, por outro atribuo alguma arrog\u00e2ncia ao autor por este facto. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela falta de rigor atribu\u00edda \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria, mas tamb\u00e9m devido ao facto de conhecer a cidade de Paris bastante bem e ter detectado algumas incoer\u00eancias. Mas isto \u00e9 o meu sentimento, pois Paris \u00e9 e ser\u00e1 sempre Paris. Mas n\u00e3o posso deixar de referir que o autor conseguiu captar muito o esp\u00edrito da cidade. Rom\u00e2ntica, emblem\u00e1tica, carism\u00e1tica, muito ao estilo parisiense. N\u00e3o deixem de ler.

When I learned of Mark Pryor\u2019s novel, THE BOOKSELLER I was extremely curious. With a former FBI profiler named Hugo Marston working as the head of security at the American embassy in Paris, Pryor has created a strong character and a wonderful story line in his first novel. From the outset, when a Parisian bookseller, named Max Koche is abducted from his kiosk on the Seine River after selling two rare books to Marston, I was hooked. The plot is very suspenseful and mystery addicts will be extremely satisfied with Pryor\u2019s effort as a French detective is summoned to investigate the bookseller\u2019s disappearance and seems quite uninterested in pursuing the case. What drives Marston to distraction was the police\u2019s refusal to investigate Max\u2019s kidnapping which occurred right in front of him, claiming that Max went with his captors willingly. Marston researches the French criminal data base and learns that Jean Chabot, who claims that Max\u2019s kiosk belonged to him, had a long criminal record. Marston will turn to a former FBI colleague and now a part time CIA operative, Tom Green for assistance. The banter between the two is humorous and entertaining as the two try to figure out what really happened. They learn that Max was really Maximillian Ivan Koche who spent part of World War II in a French internment camp in the southern part of the country controlled by the Vichy government. His family had been sent to Dachau in July, 1944 and were liberated in 1945. After the war Max would work with Nazi hunter, Serge Klarsfeld and assisted in the seizure of former Gestapo Chief Kurt Lischka in 1971. Further, he was involved in the capture of Klaus Barbie, the \u201cbutcher of Lyon,\u201d and Jean Leguay, a high Vichy government official. For the remainder of his career Max focused on \u201couting\u201d former Vichy collaborators. Once Marston learns Max\u2019s background his approach to his investigation changes and the novel gathers momentum.Pryor introduces a number of interesting characters. Claudia Roux, a French journalist and police reporter for Le Monde. Count Gerard de Roussillon, Claudia\u2019s father, a member of the French aristocracy with many secrets. Bruno Gravois, who was in charge of the kiosks along the Seine River for the Chambre and Office of Tourisme, a shady character who secretly tries to gain control of all the Kiosks along the Seine. The police provide a number of important characters, particularly Capitaine Garcia, who finally agrees that something untoward has happened as a number of kiosk sellers turn up dead floating in the Seine. Pryor builds his plot around the idea that during World War II, the French Resistance passed messages by code hidden in certain books. For Max locating those books, which contained the names of French collaborators was an obsession as he focused on making those names public to bring shame and justice for their treason during the war. Pryor then introduces the possibility that events center on a Romanian organized drug ring, but how is that related to booksellers?Pryor has constructed a very tight story whose dialogue leads the reader to imagine what is really occurring. The plot shifts seamlessly numerous times and character development is very strong as one tries to figure out which individuals Marston can actually trust; government officials, the police, or members of the kiosk association, the Syndicat Des Bouquinistes de Paris. As the novel unfolds the reader is drawn further and further into the story, and their curiosity builds as Marston and Green grow more frustrated. If you are looking for a quick and engrossing mystery with a tour of Paris and a surprising ending then THE BOOKSELLER is for you. Pryor has written five other novels, the most recent of which is THE PARIS LIBRARIAN, all of which have sparked my interest."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11097919-claudia", "userReview": "Iniciei a leitura deste livro com grande entusiasmo, ultimamente tenho andado com vontade de ler policiais, talvez porque o cinzento deste Inverno que parece nunca mais terminar (sim eu sei que a Primavera j\u00e1 chegou... mas n\u00e3o parece, pelo menos aqui por \u00d3bidos) e um bom policial faz-nos esquecer o Ver\u00e3o que ainda tarda e enrolamos-nos com mais vontade no sof\u00e1.

Hugo Marston is an ex FBI agent, now living in Paris as chief of security for the U.S. Embassy. Recently divorced from his second wife (his first wife was killed in a car crash) he shared a love of rare books with her and had developed a friendship with Max, owner of one of the bouquiniste, along the Seine. He returns one afternoon after having bought a couple of first editions and witnesses Max being forced, at the point of a gun, on the a boat. When interviewed by the police, some of the bystanders insist that Max had gone willingly. The next day Max's stall has been taken over by someone who claims not to know Max. Hugo, having a couple weeks off, and an ex-cop, decides to check things out. He is soon joined by his old friend, Tom, a semi-retired CIA operative. What makes this book special is less the mystery, although that's good, too, but rather the surroundings, the flavor of Paris and the little historical bits that some readers objected to, those who must have at least twelve gunshots on each page. I love informative paragraphs like The term bouquinistes came from the Dutch word boeckin, meaning \u201csmall book.\u201d Made sense. The first sellers, he read, used wheelbarrows to transport and sell their goods, and fastened trays to the parapets of the bridges with thin leather straps. After the French Revolution, business boomed when entire libraries were \u201cliberated\u201d from nobles and wound up for sale cheap on the banks of the Seine. In 1891, bouquinistes received permission to permanently attach their boxes to the quaysides. Hugo was struck by the line: \u201cToday, the waiting list to become one of Paris's 250 bouquinistes is eight years.\u201d But what are we to make of Claudia and her gay father, a rich count, who, when he learns Hugo and Claudia are seeing each other tries to set him up with one of his attractive American employees? And what was his relationship to Gervais the chief of the bouquiniste union, the SBP? In the end, the book is a nice melange of spies, WW II collaborators, drug smugglers, murder, bad cops, microdots, a Holmesian suicide, and a shoot-out. I downgraded it a bit because Gervois just didn\u2019t seem that believable to me."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971945-kathy", "userReview": "When I read the back blurb of The Bookseller and the description of the main character, Hugo Marston, as head of security at the US embassy in Paris, I feared the book might be an espionage action book. I'm not particularly fond of that type of book. However, the additional statements about disappearing booksellers and WWII Nazi collaboration connections peaked my interest. I'm so glad that they did. This debut book by Mark Pryor is a well-honed mystery story with multiple layers of intrigue. Although the story is wonderfully complex, it is at no time confusing or cumbersome. Marston fully develops his characters and presents the engaging Paris setting without onerous distension. He knows what it takes to get the job done without overdoing.The novel begins with Hugo Marston bemoaning the fact that he is on a forced vacation from his embassy job, as idleness is not his natural state. While stopping to visit his favorite bookseller, or bouquiniste, along the Seine River, Hugo witnesses the older man's abduction at gun point. Hugo is determined to discover what happened to Max and why. As bouquinistes begin turning up dead in the river, Hugo uses his embassy resources and his ex-FBI experience to unravel a devious plot full of ghosts and murder. Aiding him in his endeavors is his friend Tom, who is a semi-retired CIA agent, visiting him in Paris. One of the books that Hugo bought from Max the last day he saw him leads Hugo to one of the most influential families in Paris and figures into Max's mysterious disappearance, too. His chance meeting with Claudia, a police reporter for Le Monde, both complicates and improves his life. She, too, will be involved in Hugo's investigation of the bouquiniste problem and its connections to the past.Marston has written a fast, smooth moving tale that is an excellent start to the series.

You've got martinis, little black dresses, Paris - or solidly-plotted, old school, murder mysteries set in Paris, for that matter. Author, Mark Pryor, has struck a sweet spot in the genre; achieved a black-tie comfort food, if you will, with the first Hugo Martson novel,THE BOOKSELLER. This whodunit and whydunit is staple locale mystery fare and all the expected boxes are ticked, but with one of those really smooth, gel-ink, fancypants pens.Hugo Marston is our hub. With his US embassy connections, FBI training, and ever-ready smirk, his life is, more or less, the one we'd like to have if only we were slightly fitter. When a friendly acquaintance is kidnapped right before his eyes, we follow Hugo into the world of the bouquinistes, the booksellers whose stalls ride the hem of Seine to the delight of tourists and also the book lovers who call Paris home. When the history of the bouquinistes collides with the agendas of some criminals with more contemporary to-do lists, the fate of a Nazi-hunter becomes the fulcrum for the US Embassy to team up, not always comfortably, with the French police to discover why booksellers are vanishing from their treasured posts.There's a beautiful journalist and a rumpled, foul-mouthed sidekick and, of course, there is Paris to round out the cast and fill in the action, of which there is plenty. THE BOOKSELLER is an excellent choice for someone who has been hankering for a good old-fashioned read - the hero is smart and bold, the heroine sparks attraction and some trouble, and the crime has tendrils that draw the past into the present.THE BOOKSELLER earned a favorable nod over at OPRAH.com and was Library Journal's Debut of the Month in November, so you don't have to take only my word for it.Just do it.

One of his passions is book collecting, and he indulges himself in buying some first editions from his friend Max, an elderly bookstall owner. Max is one of a number of booksellers who have shops along the Seine. The government controls the allocation of those shops, and they are often occupied for many years by the same individual. Shortly after Marston\u2019s purchase, he sees Max being dragged from his bookstall at gunpoint. He is unsuccessful at interceding and Max is thrown into a boat. He reports the incident to the police, but they seem uninterested in investigating. Curiously, there is no one willing to report that they witnessed the abduction. Against the advice of his employers, Hugo looks into things on his own. Meanwhile, other booksellers start to disappear. Working with a former CIA agent, Tom Green, they put together the pieces of a puzzle with a surprising answer. Marston finds that Max was a Nazi collaborator \u2013 could that have made him a target? Or is someone after a very valuable book? Or, more pedestrian, do the disappearances have anything to do with drug smuggling? Hugo is a likable character, combining intelligence and good old-fashioned stubbornness in his pursuit of the truth. The other characters are similarly well drawn, although I did tire a bit of Tom Green\u2019s potty mouth\u2014it seemed forced to me. However, he is an excellent partner to Marston. Red herrings abound, and there is no shortage of action. And there\u2019s a sexy, wealthy reporter who fills the romance slot. Where Pryor really excels is in his depiction of Paris in the winter.

Insieme alla giornalista Claudia e all\u2019agente della CIA Tom, Marston si addentrer\u00e0 in un mondo complesso, quello dei bouquiniste e del sindacato che li rappresenta, portando alla luce il passato burrascoso di Max e i traffici che si celano dietro l\u2019innocente vendita dei libri rari..Primo volume di una serie che ha come protagonista l'ex profiler Hugo Marston, Il libraio di Parigi regala al lettore un'immagine particolare della capitale francese, relegando in secondo piano le meraviglie architettoniche e i locali per concentrarsi sull'universo dei bouquiniste: questi svolgono un lavoro molto ambito, tanto che per entrare a far parte della categoria esiste una lunga lista d'attesa, e spesso riescono a portare alla luce libri molto rari, esemplari quasi unici che i collezionisti non si lasciano scappare. Come ogni categoria di lavoratori anche i bouquiniste hanno un sindacato, l'SBP, che si occupa di tutelare i loro diritti e seguire l'assegnazione delle bancarelle; l'indagine di Hugo si svolge propio all'interno di questo mondo, offrendoci la possibilit\u00e0 di sbirciare dietro le quinte e comprendere fino in fondo il lavoro di questi librai. Ma non solo. Attraverso una serie di interessanti e sconcertanti rivelazioni sulla vita di Max infatti il lettore pu\u00f2 buttare un occhio su una realt\u00e0 non molto conosciuta del secondo dopoguerra, una verit\u00e0 scomoda che per molto tempo si \u00e8 preferito mantenere segreta: quella dei cacciatori di nazisti. Intrecciando dunque scoperte a carattere storico e un'indagine dai mille risvolti Mark Pryor accompagna il lettore alla riscoperta di Parigi, svelandone il lato pericoloso; Hugo Marston \u00e8 un ottimo protagonista, consapevole delle sue capacit\u00e0 ma al tempo stesso dei suoi limiti, mi \u00e8 piaciuto particolarmente perch\u00e8, pur mantenendo l'atteggiamento che ci si aspetta da un responsabile della sicurezza, \u00e8 stato in grado di mostrare anche un lato umano a cui spesso viene preferita una temerariet\u00e0 irrealistica e fastidiosa. Senza dubbio la figura di Tom serve a risollevare il tono della narrazione, regalando alcuni momenti davvero esilaranti grazie al suo linguaggio non esattamente regale e alla sua personalit\u00e0 grezza; il personaggio di Claudia poi non mi \u00e8 dispiaciuto, anche se l'ho trovata meno originale rispetto ai due uomini, la giornalista di nera capace di mantenere il sangue freddo in situazioni pericolose svolge comunque un ruolo fondamentale nella vicenda e il lettore non pu\u00f2 fare a meno di apprezzarla, specie verso il finale.Mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto questo romanzo, sia per la versione inedita di Parigi ma anche e soprattutto per la componente storica, a quanto ho capito questa \u00e8 una caratteristica che l'autore manterr\u00e0 nei prossimi volumi della serie, quindi non vedo l'ora di leggerli! :)"}, {"userName": "Lelia Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089004-lelia-taylor", "userReview": "The BooksellerMark PryorSeventh Street Books, October 2012ISBN 978-1-61614-708-2Trade Paperback{{From the publisher\u2014Who is killing the celebrated bouquinistes of Paris?Max\u2014an elderly Paris bookstall owner\u2014is abducted at gunpoint.

I mean, after all, it\u2019s booksellers and I used to be one so how could I possibly resist? It didn\u2019t hurt that the description was so enticing. Paris, kidnapping, murder, booksellers, spy-ish stuff\u2014what more could I want? And now I\u2019m happy to report that debut author Mark Pryor and The Bookseller have lived up to my hopes quite nicely.Hugo Marston has joined my list of heroes I love to read about, joining the likes of Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher and Patrick Lee\u2019s Travis Chase. These are the guys who have all the brawn they need but they use their minds to win the day and that is so very appealing to me. Hugo also has a pretty nifty buddy in Tom Green. The two look into the puzzle of the missing and murdered booksellers with open minds and great aplomb and the pace is almost faster than you can keep up with. Possible perpetrators and motives are in abundance and, at the same time, the author gives us a feel for Paris that is so rich and full of history that, at times, I forgot the story takes place in contemporary times or, at least, within the last 75 years. Or so. You\u2019ll just have to find out for yourself ;)Wonderful characters abound besides Hugo and Tom\u2014in the very first pages, I came to like Max immeasurably\u2014and the plot keeps on a-comin\u2019. Throw in an intriguing journalist, the Parisian police, Nazi hunters, drug dealers and the hindrances that come with being attached to a US embassy and there\u2019s hardly anything more you need. Oh, I mustn\u2019t forget the feeling that the author gives that the reader is sitting right there in Paris soaking up all its beauty and history while all this is going on around you. What a lovely way to read a book!To me, three things are most evident when an author is really good. First is strong characters, second is a plot that grabs me and won\u2019t let go, and third is a mastery of the English language. Mark Pryor has it all in his first novel and I can\u2019t wait for his next Hugo Marston mystery.Reviewed by Lelia Taylor, November 2012."}, {"userName": "Verushka", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23271825-verushka", "userReview": "What is this about?: A thoroughly enjoyable action thriller set in Paris, involving books, Nazis and Nazi hunters.What else is this about?: This is an introduction to Hugo Marston, the central character in a series by author Marky Pryor. He\u2019s the chief of security at the US Embassy in Paris, be still my heart.Paris. Books and murder mystery \u2014 that right there are three of my favourite things and since finding out about the Hugo Marston series and recommending The Paris Librarian, I had to find out more.This is what you need to know: Hugo Marston is the chief of security in Paris at the embassy. Book 1 quickly establishes that Hugo\u2019s second marriage is ending, ensuring that readers are aware he\u2019s cautious about entanglements. They also know he\u2019s a bit of a book nerd, courtesy of trying to impress his wife, the one he\u2019s divorcing. To that end, he\u2019s made friends with Max, a bouquiniste selling his books along the Seine.And, one day, he sees Max being kidnapped. Immediately Hugo starts investigating, finding out more and more about Max as he does \u2014 namely, that he was a successful Nazi hunter, before become disillusioned with the law. Then he turned his attention to finding Nazi collaborators, and this is what The Bookseller is about and before it takes a turn somewhere else entirely.Pryor has written a straightforward but absolutely enjoyable first book in this series, building this wonderful Parisian world in which Hugo inhabits. We are introduced to his work, to his colourful co-workers, who mercifully can work with him and still give good snark, without coming across like wallpaper. As the plot develops, we see the reach and limitations of his position in a foreign country as he desperately searches for Max.There\u2019s romance \u2014 with a French woman, who happens to have the most over-protective gay father in the world. Some elements are a little too pat here, but you know what in the grand scheme of the goodness in this book, they\u2019re barely a blip. Claudia is confident and determined to do her work as a journalist and do her work well, no matter her background, which is one of the more interesting surprises.Our hero detective is not complete without his BFF Watson, the gregarious and sometimes annoying Tom, who helps where he can. I don\u2019t know how much of a role Tom plays in the rest of the series, but in this I am curious about how eager he is for action, without thinking about his own safety. It\u2019s just a sense I have from him in this book, which could be entirely off the mark in reality.The plot is complicated, filled with twists and turns, but not in the OMG, this is a TWIST way. Which to be honest, made it all the more enjoyable.And last, Paris! Be still my heart because Mark Pryor has given me a way to enjoy the beauty of Paris within the pages of his book.I picked up this book because the idea of exploring Paris through a good murder mystery series was too goof to resist and thankfully, Hugo Marston and Mark Pryor delivers in spades."}, {"userName": "Tempo de Ler", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165683-tempo-de-ler", "userReview": "\u00abDesde crian\u00e7a que Hugo gostava de livros, mas agora come\u00e7avam a dar-lhe dores de cabe\u00e7a.\u00bbHugo Marston \u00e9 o chefe de seguran\u00e7a da embaixada americana em Paris.

However, this had several other things that I normally enjoy so I figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it did not work for me and I did not finish this book.I feel I should first note that I listened to this in audiobook format, and the narrator's voice just did not fit with who my mind told me Hugo as a character should have been and what he would sound like. I am aware that this is an entirely subjective judgement, and more about me than either the book or the narrator. Unfortunately, the disconnect between voice and character in my head continuously distracted me from the story which was one problem for me.I also felt like the story developed very, V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W-L-Y. I made it as far as the end of chapter 10 and with the exception of the initial abduction [that's not a spoiler, it's right in the blurb] of Hugo's bookseller acquaintance it felt like there was little more than descriptions. Descriptions of Paris streets, Paris apartments, Paris people, etc. While I enjoy visiting Paris by book as much as the next person, that was not what I was after in picking up this book. I was expecting chases, and fights, and drama and intrigue. There were brief moments of these in the part of the book I read, but overall, I found myself drifting away from the story and having to focus really hard to stay with what was going on. For me, that means the book just isn't right for me.This will be going back to the library, so someone else can read it. Hopefully someone it will be a better fit for."}], "description": "Who is killing the celebrated bouquinistes of Paris?Max-an elderly Paris bookstall owner-is abducted at gunpoint.
