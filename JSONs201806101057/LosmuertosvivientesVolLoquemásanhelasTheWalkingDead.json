The Walking Dead is a great premise poorly executed. The characters are insipid, with no defining qualities to empathise with. The plot rapidly and repeatedly flits between killing and sex, with little meaning or worthwhile emotion given to either. This volume is particularly bad, portraying every character as sex-crazed. Almost every adult character has had sex, often with different partners, as if in a world of only 20 people everyone would just naturally and happily pair off. Carol has now had sex with Tyrese, kissed Lori and kissed Rick. It has the plot of a Jilly Cooper novel, with everyone wildly having sex with everyone at the drop of a hat, and talking in the most clich\u00e9d way possible about their sexual desire and exploits. I don't deny the importance of characters having sex, and appreciate it's an animal instinct that could offer some rare enjoyment in an apocalyptic world, but the frequency and tactlessness is ridiculous. Their friends are dying all around them, and yet they still have wild sexual urges. I'm pretty sure that's not how grief works. The female characters are so paper-thin and sex hungry that it feels like the writers have never actually met a woman in real life.When they do attempt philosophy or feelings, it's written in the most formulaic clich\u00e9d way, it makes my skin crawl. The action moves so quickly from one death to the next, that often characters aren't even around long enough to learn their name, let alone get remotely invested in them, and therefore as a reader you simply don't care when they die."}, {"userName": "Alejandro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665584-alejandro", "userReview": "A cage is a cage not matter what.\n This is the fourth volume of the softcover editions of \"The Walking Dead\", collecting the comic book issues from #19 to #24.Creative Team:Writer: Robert KirkmanIllustrators: Charlie Adlard Additional gray tones to inking: Cliff Rathburn Chapter Four\nTHE HEART\u2019S DESIRE\n\nCry me a river.\nEnter: Michonne,......mysterious Afro-American woman with a samurai sword. \u2018Nuff said!Rick\u2019s group has troubles in all fronts.

You have some issues when it comes to women. Thusly, you can't write women accurately. At all. The female characters in this series are either bitches, sluts or nagging harpies (or some combo of the three) who just wanna wash clothes, sew, have babies, fuck men, and maybe, in a completely out of character move, kiss another woman. Also, the children in this book are like Disney show characters, ridiculously blinking up through all the carnage with Kewpie doll eyes. So cliche and so unrealistic. Also, the dialogue is terrible. Cliches, out of character moments, stereotypes, non-sequiturs, every writing rule is broken, and not in a good way. This all being said, this is an amazing GN series. The base story is fantastic. The realistic reactions of people under unbelievable amounts of stress make the tension palatable. Happily, the TV series adaption has fixed a lot of my aforementioned issues with character and dialogue to take this story to the level is deserves to be at."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "Yeah.... this was not my favorite edition.

They\u2019re walking spoilers because it\u2019s so obvious that they will be the next to die. But, for every idiot that dies, everyone else get tougher. They learn from the fatalistic mistakes of the fallen: they learn never to fall into the same trap. Rick\u2019s already a hard bastard, and this is only the fourth chapter, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how ruthless he is bound to become. I\u2019m enjoying reading this through, but the television show does do a couple of things better. Take Carol, for example, in this she is unhinged and ridiculously vulnerable. She doesn\u2019t give a shit about her kid, and all she wants is a man to keep her safe. On the other hand, Carol on screen is a badass; she is essentially a female Rick. She started off weak, but she grew like no other character has in the show. She broke out of her shell and became a survivor. This is one change I really do applaud. I\u2019m not missing Daryl either. Tyrese works just as well in the roll of Rick\u2019s wingman. Both mediums have their positive and negative aspects; it\u2019s quite fun to compare the two. At this point, I can appreciate both. The story really picked up in this one, the group is finally starting to get it. It\u2019s taken them a while but they are getting there slowly. I\u2019m also starting to like Dale. He knows how to deal with the half crazed Rick; he knows how to keep the group together. Rather than just discuss things, like his television counterpart wanted to do, this Dale just gets on with it. His romance with Andrea is also surprisingly well handled. Everyone is seeking comfort; emotions are quick to change and are bursting onto the surface. Unfortunately, this is especially true with the annoying Carol. I think she needs a good slap, the television Carol could teach her a thing or two!I hope she dies soon because she is becoming really annoying. I want to see tough T.V Carol!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "\"WE ARE THE WALKING DEAD\". Another great volume of TWD comics. This volume focuses on morality and how the group are going to have to adapt if they want to survive. What's right? What's wrong? You can stay \"humane\" and get munched on or you can kill and survive. I really liked it. Everyone is fighting and it's great. I'm so obsessed with this story! I might start watching the TV show even though I know they're different and I also know lots of spoilers for the show! The shit hits the fan numerous times in every volume and I don't know how much more shit the group (or I) can take!!! I love the artwork and again, I adore the covers by Tony Moore. The covers really raise the comics standard that little bit more. (I know I've said this in every review I've done but I'm going to keep saying it - I wish this comic was in colour!). I'm excited to see what happens next in the comic. I really recommend these comics, they're brilliant!"}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:HOW CAN SOMEONE WRITE GIRLS SO HORRIBLY?I am not sure what happened in this volume.

Michonne is here, there is a confrontation between the prisoners and the gang. All is set for a great storyline. But what you get is drama, drama, drama. Who's sleeping with who and who blames who for someone death. And Rick's breakdown. Well the first one from memory. But I guess the cover does warn us by depicting a kiss. Everyone is on edge and having a mental breakdown. Probably not surprising given the circumstances.In the background Hershell is making a garden. And Andrea is becoming a seamstress.

That was brutal. And grim. The times... they are a-changin'! Still so great though. I am really loving this series, especially the artwork. There were panels in this volume that show Tyreese in such detail, and I love how intricate the drawings are. The fact that you can see the way his right ear folds down just a tiny bit at the top is so impressive to me. Or how you can tell so much about how Lori is feeling just by her facial expressions - she doesn't have to say a word. I love that these characters are real and identifiable and that they still do stupid things even though they have been in this world of the walking dead for nearly a year and you'd think they'd know how to survive in it... and with each other...

What keeps me reading and occasionally watching is the human aspect of it. When everything changes so dramatically, what is right and wrong? Is killing someone wrong if it's justified? Who's in charge of making the decisions? Who makes the law? What are the consequences for breaking the law?A lot of those questions are out there and the group is trying to find answers, but many of them are becoming unhinged. There are attempts to make rules that backfire and their form of government is challenged. Looks like we are moving to a committee approach to making final decisions.

I was really excited when I saw Michonne finally get introduced, as she's one of my favorite character in the show, but her character is a total bitch in the comics and I hate that. I hate how all of the women are portrayed in these comics, but specifically in this volume, it's really bad. SPOILERS BELOWThis particular volume is full of nothing but drama. And not even the good kind of drama, but the stupid love triangle romantic bull shit drama. Michonne decides to swoop in there with Tyreese even though he's with Carol and she gives him a blow job and carol sees through the window and decides to go slit her wrists. Like what the fuck? Carol is so weak in these comics it drives me insane. Especially knowing how badass she is in he show. Then Tyreese later finds out about Carol and gets all mad at Michonne for \"tempting him\" like bitch, it takes two to tango. Michonne then acts like a bitch to everyone including Andrea when she gets caught talking to herself in her cell. When Rick catches Tyreese cheating on Carol with Michonne he freaks the fuck out even though it's really none of his business and they get into a physical fight over it and start beating the shit out of each other. It's fucking stupid. They literally almost kill each other over this shit and Rick goes unconscious for twenty six hours. If that isn't ridiculous enough, then when Rick finally wakes up, Carol tries to make a move on him and she kisses him even though he's still with Lori. Like what the fuck is all of this random shit? I hate seeing all these characters I love in the show act so idiotic and ridiculous in these comics. Then they decide Rick won't be the leader anymore but instead they'll have a committee full of men, no women. In fact, the women don't even want to be a part of it because they'd feel safer with the men in charge. How sexist is that? The one thing I did enjoy was when Allen got bit and Rick decided right at that moment to cut his leg off so he wouldn't die, just like he did with Hershel in the show. But then I felt bad because the group got all pissed at Rick and Allen ended up dying anyway. I also loved seeing Sophia and Carl as I've said before they are my new OTP and they are just so cute. I look forward to their adorable scenes together. And, the greatest thing that happens in this volume, is Rick saying the famous line: \"We ARE the Walking Dead!\" Hands down, best part of this volume."}, {"userName": "Aurora", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12582808-aurora", "userReview": "[We see (the amazing in the TV show) Michonne blowing Tyreese; following that, Carol tries to commit suicide and fails miserably; Rick and Tyreese fight over who's the alpha male; Andrea, who is proclaimed by the group as \"the best shot\", and until yesterday wanted in on all the action the boys were having, decides to give all that up and become a seamstress (bitches be crazy, right?). Meanwhile Glenn and Maggie's only interest is where they'll get laid next; and Lori contributes nothing to the plot, whatsoever. Oh, and Allen dies, but he was mopey and useless, so all the better. AND YOU ALSO EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THE 7 (yes, seven) ADULT WOMEN IN THE GROUP WANTED TO BE IN THE COMMITTEE?? LIKE, YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?

Oh my.Oh. my.You said it, Glenn. It really, really is.Guys...I can't do this without spoilers so you've been warned.SPOILERS AHEADWhere the hell do I even begin?? And why has it taken me four volumes to realize how freaking fucking sexist this series is? Ok, ok. There have been hints of it in every issue, but nowhere near as blatantly stupid as this.Have any of these writers ever met a woman before? Because, I really, really wonder. Let's just go ahead and discuss these female characters, shall we?\nMICHONNE\nOk first off, I was super stoked to get to this issue because this girl finally shows up...Michonne!!! (And no, she doesn't really have a light saber, but she may as well because she's the closest thing to a fucking jedi that this series has seen).So Michonne finally arrives at the prison and immediately saves dumbass Otis from certain death. She's also toting two zombie repelling dead pets that she promptly disposes of once she realizes that she's finally safe. Here they are again, you know, in case you missed them the first time...(FYI: Those \"pets\" are her boyfriend and his best friend)So right away we know that this is a woman who can take care of herself. She's been out there, on her own, surviving for who knows how long. She is capable. She is strong. She is a surviver.Oh no wait, scratch that. She's just some dumb, brainless chick who blows Tyreese in the gym (her idea, btw) after knowing him for about sixty seconds. Even though he obviously has a girlfriend. Because reasons.Then when Tyreese confronts her about it later (and oh, tries to blame her for for his actions, btw - but that's a rant that I don't even think I have enough room for), she disparages his girlfriend by asking him what he's doing with a skinny white chick anyway. Yeah, sure. There are only like 15 people living together in this prison and the first thing this zombie killing badass is going to do is cause a shit ton of problems by stealing someone else's man, because sex and men are all this independent woman can think about. Yes, please, set us up with a killer character and then immediately reduce her to a vapid bitch. Yeah, TV Michonne is done with your bullshit too.(Whoever runs that television adaptation made some really good decisions when it comes to the female characters.)\nCAROL\nOk, so TV Carol is waaaay different from her comic book counterpart. And that is a fucking phenomenal thing. In the comics, we don't have Eddie (or Ed, I can't remember that fuckwit's name) - her sick and abusive bastard of a husband. Even though Eddie bites it early on (to the cheers of all who watched), what we see Carol go through before and after is nothing short of a beautiful and awesome transformation that I have loved watching. In the comics, Carol does have a daughter, Sophia, but she lost her husband before we meet her. And I don't get the idea that he was abusive (unless I missed something). She takes up with Tyreese pretty quickly after they all meet. (Like, super quickly).Once Michonne shows up and begins a flirtation with her man, Carol gets all clingy and possessive. Then she witnesses their, ahem, \"interaction\" in the gym. After which, Carol is so distraught, that she slits her wrists. Yes, can we all just please laugh at this? I know I did. You have survived the zombie apocalypse and have now reached a haven of relative safety for the first time in about a year, but your boyfriend of half-a-second has been unfaithful. And THAT, as we all know, is a perfectly legit reason to commit suicide.Never mind the fact that she has a FUCKING DAUGHTER. Mothers are strong. It would take a lot more than some douche sticking his dick someplace it doesn't belong to make a woman kill herself and leave her child helpless and alone.But Carol isn't the most stable human being on Planet Walking Dead. In the last issue, Tyreese went temporarily nuts after his daughter committed suicide and Carol, distraught with worry, kissed Lori. Because reasons.After Carol recovers and kicks Tyreese to the curb, she then kisses Rick BECAUSE FUCKING REASONS.I haven't yet discussed how there are virtually NO FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS in this series, but Lori and Carol are actually friends. And Carol betrays her only living friend by coming onto her husband.Because of course she does. Of course she does.Yeah, TV Carol (Scarol) is done with your bullshit too. \nLORI\nI personally think Lori is annoying in both novel and tv form. So, I'm just gonna leave it at that. Just my opinion.\nANDREA\nAlways with Dale. Doesn't socialize with the other women. Confrontational with Michonne for no reason at all.Because women aren't capable of friendship. \nMAGGIE\nAlways with Glenn. Doesn't socialize with the other women. Doesn't seem to have any kind of job or way of contributing within the community. Only cares about when and where she and Glenn will do it next.TV Maggie is done with your bullshit. \nTHE COMMITTEE\nThis isn't technically a female character but it deserves merit in this review because of the complete and utter lack of female characters present on it.So basically Rick goes bat shit crazy. As he tends to do. He kills people. Becomes confrontational. Gets the shit kicked out of him and wakes up 26 hours later. Dale has been elected to give him the news. He's no longer in charge. Instead, the group has elected a four person committee who will make decisions together. Rick takes this surprisingly well. He asks who the members of the committee are.Dale tells him.Here is a condensed version of that convo:Dale: The committee is You, me, Herchel, and Tyreese.Rick: What, no women?Dale: No.Rick: Seriously? Because, I think that they'd want at least one member on the committee.Dale: No, Rick. We all voted. And ALL SEVEN OF THEM voted to have just men on the committee. I think they just want us to be in charge and, you know, protect them. That's all they really care about.Rick: For reals?Dale: Well, I mean, some of them did want Lori on the committee, but she declined, so we didn't push it. It's better this way.Rick: Okey-dokey. *End Transcript*Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure if they tried to pull this shit in TV land, it would have ended up something like this...Now ride this eyeroll gif train to the end. So yeah, to say I was disappointed in this installment is putting it mildly. It gives me a deeper appreciation for the show and what a great job they've done there.Of course I'm continuing the series. I've already bought all of the volumes. Here's hoping it gets better.But it left me with a lot of bad feels.

Tyreese cheats on Carol with a newcomer throwing Rick into a crazy rage, both air the skeletons in their closet to the public and get in a fist fight, Rick losing. The group loses trust in Rick and decides to go to a committee system of leadership, and Rick doesn't understand why nobody sees things his way or how dire their situation really is.I enjoyed this volume. It boiled down to an everyone vs. Rick sort of model which I hope the volumes going forward steer away from, I mean it was good to see the leadership role put to question and to see how the stress level of being the leader in charge of survival was taking its toll on Rick, but it can't continue along this path without losing my interest. Also I like that the artwork has improved a little from the last volume, its a little bit easier to differentiate who is who; however, I still find myself every now and then looking in the back of a frame saying, \"Wait, who is that?

The cliffhanger of the last volume is dealt with in no time at all, as if that entire last volume\u2019s conflicts didn\u2019t matter at all, and a new character called Michonne appears, while another character dies, and a lot of relationship stuff happens. I\u2019ve mentioned in previous reviews how damn dark this series is, and it still is, but it\u2019s become almost comical now, like Robert Kirkman\u2019s parodying himself. When a character gets bitten and Rick decides to amputate his leg to save his life, the scene cuts to Carl and Sophia staring at the wall of zombies outside the gates and musing as to their mindsets, then the character is rushed by them screaming, and then we cut back to Carl and Sophia\u2019s shocked reactions - and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh! It\u2019s so silly, it\u2019s like something out of Chew! Then nothing horrible happens for a few pages and I began to think, right, something awful\u2019s going to happen - a character will die suddenly or will do something bad - and what happens? An attempted suicide! Again, I laughed at the predictably \u201csad\u201d style of storytelling. Of course someone would slit their wrists - you can\u2019t go too long in The Walking Dead without despair! But most of the book is focused on the characters\u2019 relationships. There\u2019s some more pointless \u201clove\u201d scenes between Glenn and Maggie, Dale and\u2026 uh, the blonde lady (it\u2019s hard to remember which two-dimensional figure is which), and Tyreese and Carol split up. It\u2019s not an unreadable book but at this point I think the series needs a real story, some kind of driving force other than the ever present threat of zombies - so far it\u2019s just characters getting worked up over their dull relationships while exploring the even drearier prison with obligatory zombies popping up out of the shadows every now and then. I was going to give Kirkman a pass on the writing in this book but he ends this volume in the dumbest way possible: a two page spread of a close up on Rick\u2019s face as he grimly asserts: \u201cWe ARE The Walking Dead!\u201d which made me laugh again. Really? Hadn\u2019t everyone already figured that out from the first volume? And the pseudo-intellectual discussion on the righteousness of killing certain people was a bit blunt metaphorically given that the characters are all wearing orange jumpsuits and sleep in cells. Real subtle, Mr Kirkman!

I didn't hate it, but I definitely did not like it as much as the previous three. Overall, it didn't seem like there was as much going on. Also, little things bothered me A LOT. The thing that got to me the most is that there are NO females on the committee. Why? Because they didn't want to be on it. Um, you can bet your ass that if I were part of that group that I would want to be on the committee. I'm not saying all women would feel the same way, but come on now. It may seem like i'm nitpicking, probably because I am, but this displeased me immensely. Also, the word retarded was used. This always scores negative points with me. I know that it was probably said to help construct the 'voice' of the character, but I can't help but feel that something else could have been used.Overall: While this installment, in my opinion, was not as shocking and action packed as it's predecessors, I feel that it still had some redeeming qualities.

I've really been enjoying Rick's \"descent into madness\", but found it a little forced - happening for the sake of it happening, rather than letting the character fall there at his own pace. I can understand if people disagree with this, it's just a personal feeling. Michonne, however, really annoyed me. I've been looking forward to her appearance since day one, as friends of mine who read the series wax lyrical on how wonderful/bad-ass she is. Her entrance was promising, but then as soon as she was inside the prison walls her character became boring and needlessly antagonistic in equal terms. If she is so glad to be there, why risk screwing things up by sleeping with Tyreese?

So much shit going down. And MICHONNE. MICHONNE is here. And she's more of a bitch than I thought she'd be. A racist bitch, if I may add. I really hope she won't stay like that for the rest of the comics, because I really like the TV show Michonne. Finally, we get to see Rick having a couple mental breakdowns throughout a single volume, but I'm used to that. However, he kind of speaks the truth.
