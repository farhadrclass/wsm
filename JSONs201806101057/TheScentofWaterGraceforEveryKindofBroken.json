You could call this an autobiography of her life, sort of, since she talks about some aspect of her personal life, not just her work with Wellspring.What is Wellspring International? According to the book, Wellspring was set up \"to research global needs for women and children at risk and to develop a process of due diligence to evaluate organizations seeking to meet those needs. Our mission is to facilitate financial support to meet such needs by providing donors the confidence that their gifts were managed with integrity and were meeting legitimate purposes.\" She details some of her work in this book, which is very interesting. This book is an enjoyable read. The work that Wellspring does is truly commendable.Through the ministry of Wellspring, children who would not have been able to afford liver transplant, get it, prostitutes enslaved in the red light district in Amsterdam (where prostitution is legal), are given hope and opportunity to live a better life and much more. Through her work with Wellspring, Ms Zacharias travels to different countries on different continents to help meet the need of the less fortunate. Wellspring is doing a good job. While talking about her work with Wellspring, she also talks openly and honestly about some areas of her personal life especially her divorce.While I applaud the work the author does through Wellspring, I do have one major issue with the book - there is no gospel message in it pages! As a Christian author involved in Christian ministry, the book seemed to lack the gospel message. In all the good that was done to the less privilege through Wellspring, there was no mention of ever sharing the good news of the gospel with any of them. Perhaps the gospel was presented, but there is no mention of it in the book. As Christians, we are called not only to minister to the needs of the poor and oppressed but also to preach the gospel to them. In His response to the disciples of John the Baptist who wanted to know if Jesus was the Messiah or not, Jesus said to tell John that the \"poor have the gospel preached to them.\" (Luke 7:22). Jesus is the only hope for the poor and the oppressed.Also, the Scripture is replete with what a Christian woman should look and act like, so I found it very disturbing that the author who professes to be a believer in Christ, encourages women to read Jean Bolen's book \"Goddess in every woman\" to find out which \" goddess archetype is prominent in her person.\" seriously?! She sees her own goddess archetype as Artemis and \"Artemis pursues her own course and appears strong outwardly\" Why this would even be in a book about a Christian woman and her work with a Christian ministry is beyond me!I do not question Ms Zacharias' faith in Christ, I question her wisdom in leaving the gospel message out of her book. While everyone who reads the book will surely commend the work of Wellspring International, we should not forget that as believers, we have been called to preach the gospel in season and out of season.Reading level: age 18 and up"}, {"userName": "Cbpax", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153236-cbpax", "userReview": "Job 14:9 \"Yet at the scent of water it will bud\" (speaking of a tree stump which is dead in the ground).Naomi Zacharias, founder of Wellspring International, takes us on a tour of some of the poorest areas of the world and areas of the world where nature has been cruel.

This book is full of places from around the world, right to what is inside of us. I will say my review of this book does not even touch the surface of what she did, where she went, and what she, personally, got out of her travels and portrays as she tells us her story. The only way to get the true understanding of what she went completely and what she has to teach us from her experience is to read this book for yourself.This is a story of truth. It is a story of life and lives. It is of sadness, happiness, of learning, of doing. It is reaching out to others when no one else would even consider it, and people reaching out to us. Naomi goes through life learning her own lessons of life, and helps to teach us what she has learned.Naomi Zacharias has written a work of Non-Fiction, telling us about her life experiences starting at the young age of 23 when she went to work for Wellspring International, an outreach of RZIM. From the book, their foundation bases their values on Rescue, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and Re-entry; helping individuals in need and existing organizations serving women and children at risk.Knowing that, you understand why she traveled and did some of the things she did. She has been all over the world to such extreme places, such as in Pakistan riding in a car with outside temperatures of 125 degrees, wrapped up, hidden in the dress of the area so the Taliban would not kidnap and take her hostage if they knew she was American, all in the name of helping people.She went to Amsterdam, Asia, India, and other countries visiting the Red Light Districts, trying to help the women who had become sex slaves of prostitution to try to help themselves get out. It is not something you can force these women to do, she says, as they must make their own choices to get out. It was not most of their choices to become sex slaves, but by the time Naomi would come across them, most of them could not get out or had children, and this occupation paid well. They had no friends or relatives to rely on for help, and could not return home as they had this title of \u201cProstitute\u201d hanging over their heads, by no fault of their own. They had become a shame to their families. If only these families knew they had sent their daughters to this life by blessing them.This was amazingly eye opening to me. I knew of the sex slave industry, but I had no knowledge or the circumstances surrounding it. This part is not in the book, but, when Natalie Holloway disappeared, there was speculation that possibly she had been kidnapped into the sex slave industry. When I heard that, I thought no way. I was wrong. I now can see why people thought that. I did not know this happened so often, and to so many women, nor did I know how easily this can happen to any woman. I did not understand the extent of this problem until reading this book.One of Naomi\u2019s descriptions of how women are kidnapped or even fooled into the sex slave industry will never leave my mind. It was of an airline attendant who was romanced by a man who traveled often on the airlines she worked for. He brought her gifts every time he flew and was so nice to her. He eventually expressed his wishes to marry her and her family approved of him. They married and she flew back home to his country with him. Immediately, right from the plane, he took her directly to the Red Light District putting her in a room with a window in the doorway right away. There was no going home with him. In this society, this was accepted. He put her to work for him. She tried to return home one time, but her family had known what had happened to her and they rejected her calling her a \u201cprostitute\u201d, yet this was none of her own doing.Some of these stories were heartbreaking, yet when Naomi\u2019s and the organization she worked for was able to and did help so many of these women, it was as if it was God rescuing them. Had Naomi and her organization not been there, they would still be stuck in a life they did not want and could not get out of.Naomi has been all over the map helping people where she could. She visited Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where the Tsunami had taken countless lives. Her description of the destruction of the Tsunami was horrifying. She helped people there. There are too many more places to list, but as she was helping these women, they helped her as well, in ways she never would have expected.Through all Naomi\u2019s travels, she learned a lot about her own life. She had her own personal trials she went through, good and bad like we all do. Life lived is not to be perfect. She talks of the deception we all come to realize that the fairy tales have, even though we know they are not true, the dream we still have is we want life to be like them. Life cannot be so. Life without these triumphs and failures is a life without growth. God meant for it to be this way. This is the way we grow. She said that \u201cRuin is a gift. It\u2019s the road to transformation.\u201d It was this way for all the women and children she helped and for her own life as well, and for our lives, to. She says it is \u2018the scent of water\u2019, the drop of water that allows us to bud, to blossom, to grow.I want to thank Zondervan Publishers for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for a review. It was truly my pleasure to read this book. I got so much out of this book that I almost feel guilty in only writing a review in exchange for it. This is a short book of only 222 pages, but it is so full of life, lives, and learning, I could not just write a \u2018short\u2019 review. There is much more to this book as I only touched on a small portion, believe it or not. This is a definite must-read. I give it a 5 star rating on my scale.Laurie Carlsonwww.lauriehere.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3412574-victoria", "userReview": "I have followed the work of Wellspring for a decade now, and have really enjoyed what they do to help women who are oppressed and who have been victims of human trafficking. I was unaware that Ravi Zacharias had a daughter (let alone three children) and that one of them was involved in the work of Wellspring as one who goes to different countries to gather information and work with women who need support. In this book, Naomi Zacharias talks about her own discomforts in life and hardships intertwined with the heartbreaking stories of those she has encountered along the way in her work. She shares many of the stories of these women as well as her own brokenness and need for finding herself.

The only reason I read beyond the first couple of chapters is because someone loaned it to me, and I would feel guilty if I returned it to them without reading it. However, it was such a waste of my time that I regret doing so. The only reason that I gave it 2/5 instead of 1/5 is because (1) the writing can, at times, be quite beautiful and poetic, and (2) the afterword written by Jacoline, a previously prostituted woman who was briefly mentioned in the book, somewhat redeemed the book with her personal story."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4475911-lindsey", "userReview": "Stories that make you aware of life outside yourself, life's struggles and grace through it all.

Grace for every kind of broken. The title of the book comes from the Scriptures in Job, about the tree whose stump is dead in the ground.\"Yet at the scent of water it will bud...\" The mere scent of healing and life will make a tree put forth shoots.What if the scent of Grace could be to the heart the scent of water?What if the scent of hope and healing could help a heart bud forth again?Sensitive is the word to describe Naomi's writing style, a sensitivity to the truth of Scripture and to the hurting human heart. This sensitivity should characterize us as Christians.Her love of India and other corners of the world God has made shine in this book. Most of us will never see these places in our lifetime- Naomi takes us there. The people and the world they live in... the exploited streets of Amsterdam where girls with wide eyes stand behind windows for sale... the little boy selling colored scarves who trotted beside Naomi and asked her to buy him milk. She tells us their stories... our stories. As Naomi says, I would be the girl behind the window, if what had happened to her had happened to me. There is no difference between us.Once upon a time there was a lady selling pearls. She showed her customer round, common, pink pearls, all the same. Objectively beautiful pearls.Then the customer noticed a rare black pearl. It was not smooth, or pink. It caught the light and reflected it in a way the smooth pearls did not. The merchant saw the customers eyes on the rare pearl.\"'Some people see them as flawed,\" the merchant said,\"While others see them as special.\"The customer bought all four black pearls, in their uneven and unique beauty, and gifted them to friends of hers. One of those friends was Naomi Zacharias, and the little pearl became a metaphor for those whose life is not smooth, pink and flawless. Which is all of us. In India there was a girl, Prema, who was burned as a child trying to make tea. She is now a reconstructive surgeon, head of the department at a Christian Medical College. She treats burn victims. \"As Prema sat across from me in a striking sari of pink and green, I was captivated by her.She exuded strength...something reminiscent of the architectural grace and genius of a pillar. She is a strikingly beautiful woman. It is not in spite of the scars, and not only because of them. A scar is not the source of beauty; it can only indicate the presence of of something that lies beneath its surface and guide you to its hidden depths. And in doing so, it becomes the symbol of beauty itself.\"In the Netherlands there was a girl forced into \"legal\" prostitution. The girl was a branded body to the men who use her and a statistic to the outside world. A statistic without a face, until Naomi met her. Then she was a wounded girl with a real name and an aching soul- sold into slavery by a man, unprotected by the government she lives under because she is now considered a legal prostitute. Her government is proud of its sadistic \"sex tourism\". The government is not the one covered in bruises and demeaned every day by brutal attacks.The orphanage in South Africa there was a young boy was bound to a plywood board, his neck broken from being dropped as a baby. He could not move his head. But when Naomi stroked his cheek, tears rolled down his face, and his dark eyes turned to hers. He could not speak. \"Words were lost in translation. But there was something that transcended limitations. It was a language, not of country or ethnicity or mental capacity, but of humanity; it was the power of human touch and the potential it carries to soothe a wound deep inside a soul.\"One upon a time a theologian prayed that God would break his heart for everything that broke God's own heart. The pain and brokenness of the world certainly breaks our Father's heart. This world has little time for broken people. It teaches us to deny our brokenness, to be ashamed of brokenness, to hide from brokenness, to run from brokenness. Instead the world peddles false strength, false perfection, and false idols. But God doesn't want us to run from brokenness, to deny brokenness, to be ashamed of brokenness. \"I thought I was running from something,\" Naomi writes, \"As it turns out, I was running toward something. In the presence of things that were broken- dreams, intentions, ambitions, and human spirit-I found invaluable lessons in life in the vulnerability of Annie and her convicting questions; the integrity of greif and acceptance of Anna, the angst and perseverance of Mariam. These are present day examples of age old stories. These people have not established my belief in whom or what God uses, they were just revelations in real time of what God had already told me.\"Naomi's writing helps break our heart a little bit so that we can open up our own brokenness to His Grace. I was blessed to receive my copy of Scent of Water from zondervan."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "Right from the beginning of the prologue I loved this book. The story of the rabbi is beautiful and one I\u2019d never heard before and now will never forget.In her book, Naomi takes us on a journey through unbelievable horror, poverty, destruction, disasters, immense pain and sorrow. In the beginning Naomi is in Banda Aceh on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia just six weeks after the tsunami hit killing 250,000 people. This disaster wasn\u2019t caused by man but by nature and was the most destructive natural disaster in history. Just think what these people lost! Furniture, homes, cars, clothing and the like, but these things can be replaced, however, our loved ones cannot. Did they, could they retain their faith and hope in Christ?In Amsterdam, Naomi met a woman named Annie who was a prostitute and lived in a brothel. Naomi was there to meet a woman who was the Director of an organization that advocated for women who want to leave the life of prostitution. The organization provides financial support, counselling and other resources, but most importantly of all, they are told about the love of God.In the Czech Republic, Naomi meets a young girl, Elsie, who is told by her mother to go and steal from her grandmother. On the way she is gang raped by several boys each taking their turn. Elsie pulled herself together and stole from her Gramma. After seeing a doctor she is told she will NEVER have children. This one horrible act caused her to lose something precious, her ability to become a mother. Eventually Elsie met a woman who told her about an organization that would help her. They applied for school, got her proper papers and then spoke to Elsie of a gracious and loving God for the first time and Elsie wondered if God might actually exist.The entire book is about abused and used women from all walks of life, and the indecencies that we as humans can bestow upon our fellow man.We all need faith, a belief in God, a higher power. Nothing in life is black and white and although as humans we struggle and demand for someone to tell us if the answer is black or white, sometimes we have to accept, whether we want to or not, that there is an \u2018in between\u2019 with no clear determination of black or white. It\u2019s like a cruel gray that taunts and haunts us, driving our humanistic need for right or wrong, black or white, up the scale, but gray is a times our only reality.We must be aware of our words and our actions as we might unknowingly hurt another person, even when that is not our intent.We must accept ourselves and others for who we are and who they are. Never expect anyone to change who they are to fulfill our own agenda of who we want them to be. If you\u2019re expecting someone to change for you then it\u2019s not a true and honest bond and nor should we change ourselves for the benefit of others. We must remain true to who God made us to be and the only one we should be striving to be like is Christ.Remember to \u201ctouch\u201d the people in your life, give them a hug, pat their hand so they feel the human connection. It signals that you care about them and love them just as God loves us all. There is great power in the human touch! Pray, but God doesn\u2019t always answer prayer when we want him too. He answers only when He thinks that you are ready to hear the response. This reminds me of a poem by Helen Steiner Rice:\u201cThere is no problem too big, no problem to smallJust ask God in faith and He\u2019ll answer them allNot always at once so be patient and waitFor God never comes too soon or too late.\u201dListen carefully to Naomi in the story when she realizes the pain she feels when facing these \u201cextreme injustices\u201d. Stand behind her as she fights within herself over her own identity and \u201ccomes face-to-face with redemption...\u201dSome of the other situations in this book will shock and disgust you but we need to be shocked and disgusted to be moved into action!There are so many lessons to be learned in this memoir and I encourage each and every one of you to read this with an open mind and an open heart!(Note*** The copy of this book was sent to me by Zondervan \u201cfree of charge\u201d for the purpose of reviewing the book)."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4743946-laura", "userReview": "This book was really heavy but good for anyone going through any type of grief. And aren't we all?Some of my favorite quotes from this book:(pg. 77) \"...the naivete of younger years should not be confused with courage. It is only courage when we know the cost of failure. It is only faith when there is potential for doubt. And it can only be won when we have to fight for it.\"(pg. 129) \"...shared wounds, when pinned to the sky, become stars in the night that help us navigate a pathway home. It can be said of friendship as well.\"(pg. 135) \"...I was looking for a fresh start, while in reality I had also been looking for a soft place to fall. But the distance of some falls is so far that it won't allow for any kind of buffer. Some heartache is so great that the only way out is by plunging into its chaos. And some loss is so significant that your heart will shed perpetual tears as an eternal flame to commemorate the story.\"(pg. 136) \"Yes, it was the perfect place, but until the tree had been planted, I had never noticed that anything was missing. The answer was not to cover up the hole. The solution was not to pretend the hole wasn't there. And it wasn't to leave the gaping chasm glaring back at us. In this case, the answer was to give it purpose.\"(pg. 202) \"I found it purposeful that the sediment was there at all, that bitter yeast was necessary for fermentation, and that it served a purpose for a time. Without the knowledge of the process necessary to achieve flavor, an amateur would mistakenly conclude that a bitter taste should be removed immediately or avoided altogether. But this wasn't the case. The sediment was part of a necessary process, and the wine was not immediately relieved of its bitterness by the contadino. The process required the careful eye of one who knew when enough time had gone by, when the presence of sediment no longer served to enhance but would instead destroy-but one who also knew enough to risk the presence and potential of something bitter, for its proportion made the flavor true. And within its truth lay the texture and richness that was the very character of wine itself, the difference between a good wine and one that is legendary.\""}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3788647-monica", "userReview": "The author takes us on a journey through Banda Aceh on the island of Sumatra six weeks after the devastating tsunami.

She notes how empty it feels after the wave of destruction swept through. For a prologue, it's awfully poetic. But Indonesia is just the beginning. By the time this book ends, Zacharias has taken you all over the world, and describes it with a compassionate and artful eye. She describes Amsterdam and its corruption as well as she paints the broken women she encounters there. Whatever pain she encounters, she is able to find the angle that others don't see. She sketches grace into paragraphs of tragedy. Her personal story is woven into this book, which focuses on redemption of the broken.

I am sure it will speak to you in more ways than you can imagination.It talks about grace, (even for her dog), and forgiveness, and above all love and guidance. What else can you read that will give you fuel your soul, and give you a glimmer of what you may be missing out on, if you can't be open to where God may lead you. (Other than your bible that is).

In a sence every chapter was a new story. Naomi helped a lot of people as a humanitarian. This book mainly interested me in the Red Light Districts of India. I heard a few stories of women there from Naomi's second hand view. A lot of it was alarming, and scared me to think people are really put in those situations. Over all this was a pretty good book."}, {"userName": "Rachel N", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/724269-rachel-n", "userReview": "Zacharias is a deeply profound thinker and an exquisite writer.

It was evident that author had a vision in mind right on the outset of this project, and throughout her writing as she kept a laser-focus in connecting humans' hearts to God's heart.

How God can redirect our lives from where there appears to be no hope to a life filled with hope and a future.
