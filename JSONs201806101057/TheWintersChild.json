The clever mix between past and present had me eagerly turning the pages.Desperate to uncover the truth!When Susannah Harper and John Harpers, teenage Son Joel goes missing it's every parents worst fear!Susannah and John divorce due to the heartbreak and strain of not knowing what happened to Joel.So when she visits a Fortune Teller, she is told things that makes her question everything she has spent her time protecting others from.It's hardly surprising that Susannah starts to unravel mentally and physically!Its from this point things chillingly eerily start to happen.Be prepared to question your thoughts and\u00a0 have your mind played with! I loved the craziness of this book at times the hairs on my arms stood on end!But are they real or just a fiction of imagination??\u00a0 Or is someone out to get them??I guess you will have to read it to find out!!I really don't want to give anything away as it's really too good not to enjoy for yourself.I loved Susannah, I felt sorry for her, I wanted to shake and yell at her, I wanted to grab her and hug her. She really is a tortured soul.Even though at times I really despised John most of the time, as the story unravels you get to see lots of different sides to John.Cassandra done an excellent job making you feel so many emotions towards her characters. Each one very relatable.I really don't think I have read a book like this before, that has left me completely bewildered and not a clue as to how it will end!I think the book synopsis\u00a0 is good but it really doesn't express just how fantastic this book really is!! So I urge you to Read The Winters Child you won't be disappointed!!!!A perfect read for those wanting a Physiological Thriller, with lots of secrets and lies, Mystery, Chilling and Eerie, unnerving and spine tingling good!I received this book from the Publisher in exchange for a honest and fair review.My Review is also on my blog website:https://dashfan81.blogspot.com/2017/1..."}, {"userName": "Magdalena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6142248-magdalena", "userReview": "Deeply moving, intense, emotional and beautifully written 'Winter's Child' is a gem of a book.\tSusannah Harper used to have it all, or so it seemed, perfect marriage, a much wanted son, Joel, beautiful house, a charmed life. It all falls apart when her son goes missing. Five years on, Joel has still not been found, her husband's gone, the relationship with her sister strained, and Susannah's life's unraveling. Her obsessive need to find out what happened to Joel, the raw emotions, almost madness she experiences, it's all so intense that I could not put that book down.\tCassandra Parkin wrote a chilling, dark thriller with strong characters and well-crafted plot.

Susannah Harper and John Harper have a teenage son named Joel. Joel goes missing.Many of us have read story items in the Newspapers or watched appeals for missing children on the TV haven't we or even read a book about it or shared a post of a missing child on Social Media. Heartbreaking events that I could never imagine the destroying effects of this on a marriage.Some pull together some pull apart. When I got to the part where Susannah is at a fair and creeps into the fortune tellers tent I was thinking a straight forward telling and revelations maybe, but no, not the case. We learn that Susannah has a blog, she blogs all the time about how deceiving people like this are, so why has she gone in?Susannah is a mess both mentally and physically.John made me feel quite cold, he was an odd character that had many different sides to him, just couldn't fathom him at times and his responses to things. Susannah of course is obsessed with finding Joel, finding out what happened, she can't settle, well.....would you?The facets of this story ravels some tangles and knots that you just will take ages unpicking. This is dark, chilling, compelling, emotional.The plot is so tight its amazing finish left me applauding.

I\u2019m pleased to say that this is another book I really enjoyed by this author.The Winter\u2019s Child is a dark mystery thriller. Yet again, this is a character led story. Something I\u2019m discovering this author does very well. If you\u2019re after a quick thrill, this probably isn\u2019t the book for you, but if you enjoy character led stories with a dark foreboding atmosphere as the mystery unravels, then I would definitely recommend this book. I really felt for Susannah, and could feel the personal torture in her need to know what had happened to her missing son. The feeling of her obsession and what felt like a gradual fall into insanity at times was very intense.For many years I\u2019ve been intrigued by fortune-tellers, but I\u2019ve always been too afraid to approach one in case they tell me something that freaks me out and I spend the rest of my life obsessing about it. I have to say that this story in no way changed my opinion, other than to confirm that for me I think life is best left as a mystery.Although I had my suspicions about the ending, I didn't fully guess what was going to happen.Well-developed and believable characters and a wonderfully dark atmosphere that still hangs over me a couple of days after reading this.My review is also available on my blog here:https://littlemissnosleep.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119019-karen", "userReview": "Well this is one dark and twisted tale. Whether or not you believe in physics or fortune tellers, the atmospheric narrative of The Winter\u2019s Child will hold you spellbound.Susannah Harper is an extremely complex character and if I\u2019m honest, not one that I particularly liked. Her son Joel was 15 when he went missing five years previously. Joel was the focus of Susannah\u2019s world; he was not an easy child and had his own inner demons but she obsessively smothered and protected him, always taking his side, even at the expense of her marriage.She has an obsession with consulting physics despite knowing that so many are frauds \u2013 she can\u2019t stop herself even whilst denouncing them on her blog called \u2018Life Without Hope\u2019 in which she lays bare her innermost thoughts and fears. We see her dealing with the internet trolls whom she labels \u201cThe Monsters Among Us\u201d \u2013 those who comment on her blog with false sightings and demands for money in return for information as to Joel\u2019s whereabouts.Her blog leads her to befriend Jackie, the mother of another missing boy. Both Susannah and Jackie are needy people and although they come from completely different backgrounds, their missing children are the one thing they have in common. Susannah thought she had found a friend but I thought their friendship was destructive and didn\u2019t think it helpful for Susannah to be around her.Susannah\u2019s pain is laid bare, she thinks she sees Joel at random locations and goes rushing off after him, much to the distress of her sister Melanie who pleads with her to seek help. As Susannah spirals dangerously out of control, we can only watch and hope that somehow she is able to pull herself back to reality.Susannah has never stopped searching for Joel over the previous five years. However it is an impulse visit to a fortune teller at a local fair that sets in motion her renewed mission to find the truth. She is told that Joel will return to her by Christmas. As the story progresses revelations come to light about Susannah\u2019s marriage and the problems with Joel.This is a book that requires concentration and needs to be read slowly so that each perfectly constructed sentence can be savoured. The characters are wonderfully drawn \u2013 there were some that I disliked, others that I felt sorry for and those that I mistrusted. The story goes back and forth in time to before and after Joel\u2019s disappearance and is interrupted with extracts from the blog.The Winter\u2019s Child is a beautifully written story of love and obsession with a mystery at its heart. I haven\u2019t read anything by Cassandra Parkin before (I\u2019m asking myself why on earth not!) but I certainly won\u2019t make that mistake again."}, {"userName": "Stuart James", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70394648-stuart-james", "userReview": "Susannah and John go through every parents worse nightmare, loosing a teenage son, Joel.The book starts with Susannah out with her sister, niece and nephew at the Hull fair and decide to go and seek the help of a fortune teller.She advises Susannah that her son will return by Christmas.The story unfolds and we get a good insight into the lives of Susannah and her husband and how their lives are turned upside down, the emotions they go through and the stress on their relationship.I enjoyed the story and how we go on the journey with them both, although a harrowing subject.It's a dark thriller.I've given this book 3 stars and received a free copy for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Winter reading for winter weather. Loved the setting (Hull) and the opening chapter: Susannah, whose teenage son Joel has been missing for five years, visits a fortune-teller. She's given three predictions, including the promise that Joel will come back to her on Christmas Eve. What follows doesn't deliver on the blurb's promise ('a ghostly winter read with a modern gothic flavour') quite as I'd have liked: it combines Susannah's renewed digging into Joel's disappearance with what seem to be apparitions \u2013 of the living as well as the dead \u2013 and the crumbling of her conviction that all who claim knowledge of 'the other side' are charlatans. Meanwhile, in flashbacks, we learn how Susannah's perfect little family came together and fell apart.The domestic details of Susannah, John and Joel's life together feel accurate without being mawkish; where there is sweetness, it's tempered by an inevitable fraying at the edges. Parkin is really good at writing children, and this book made me realise how rare that is. The extracts from Susannah's blog, which she writes to warn other grieving parents and relatives about those that may try to con them, are also strong.But, sigh, there's a bloody romance subplot. Nick is awful: he abruptly turns into an obsessed, lovesick schoolboy over Susannah the minute she shows some interest, despite having known her for years; it's implied he is attracted to both his wife \u2013 whose own mental health problems are frequently referenced but never explained \u2013 and Susannah because he likes to 'fix' broken people, yet he actively discourages Susannah from seeking psychiatric help when she needs it most. In fact, you could argue that he's the true villain of the story. (And not a very good policeman, either. Would a note from a neighbour who wouldn't even come out of his house to be questioned really be considered strong enough evidence to discount someone as a murder suspect?!)I'm never quite sure what I should make of stories that equate mental health problems with horror and hauntings, that make someone who is suffering from an illness into a monstrous figure. I thought this was going to be, and would have preferred it to be, a more supernatural story \u2013 which is why my favourite parts were the scenes in which Susannah visits a medium who does seem to have some real insight into the unknown. Still, it's a well-written, atmospheric tale that made a great accompaniment to the snow and ice outside.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "Review by www.ireadnovels.wordpress.com Twitter@favouritenovels I adore reading books about fortune tellers.

Susannah Harper's son Joel disappeared 5 years ago and she is now divorced from her husband John and alone and friendless.

Despite this she visits a fortune teller at Hull Fair who tells her that Joel will come back to her on Christmas Eve.This a story where things are not what they seem and mysteries deepen just when you think you know what's happening.

Cassandra Parkin's writing is excellent and I was quickly drawn into the mystery of why Susannah's son Joel disappeared and where he is now. I thought the use of mystics/psychics was a unique and unusual way of investigation and it was really interesting to see Susannah's reliance on them even though she knows most of them are charlatans. As a blogger myself, it was good to see the main character use blogging too and I enjoyed the blog pieces throughout the book. I really enjoyed mixed media books, especially when they are done well as in The Winter's Child. The characters are all complex and you end up having an opinion on everyone whether it be good or bad. What Susannah is going through is every parents worst nightmare and it was quite distressing seeing her trying to deal with the disappearance and everything that happens after. She isn't the most likeable character though and that makes it to me even more realistic as you end up judging her even when you're telling yourself not to. I was fully immersed in this story and when things start to get eerie I really felt creeped out even when I had put the book down. The Winter's Child is a dark and emotional book and is a perfect autumn/Halloween read, one to pick up on these dark nights and curl up with a blanket and a hot brew. I won't be giving away any of the story, but I will say it is extremely well executed and kept me questioning my own thoughts. Oh I also couldn't finish my review without mentioning just how gorgeous the cover is for The Winter's Child. Excellent and eye catching art work."}, {"userName": "Kath Middleton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5844564-kath-middleton", "userReview": "Susannah and John\u2019s son Joel disappeared five years ago, at the age of fifteen. The case has never been solved and Susannah is still occasionally in touch with one of the police team who searched for her son. She becomes obsessive about finding him, going out at all hours to search, and finally, she and her husband part. Though professing to despise mediums and clairvoyants, She still occasionally contacts one, and is told, on the night of Hull Fair (October) that she\u2019ll see her son again by Christmas.Although, as the story progressed and past scenes unfolded, I felt the inevitability of the ending, I couldn\u2019t work out why. One of the strengths of the author\u2019s writing is that she can tell of deep and turbulent emotions in clear and logical language \u2013 you follow it from the character\u2019s point of view, and totally believe it.

It is told mainly from the point of\u00a0 view of the victims, the parent's of two missing children with the police being largely background characters.\u00a0 I thought this was a fascinating approach to take as it was very interesting to see the investigation from the otherside and realise how such an event and a crime investigation can affect the victims.\u00a0 It made the story much more emotional then it otherwise would have been as you can see how each twist, turn or revelation effects the victims and how they can go on a huge rollercoaster ride of different emotions throughout the investigation.I had mixed feelings about the main character Susannah.\u00a0 On one hand i really felt for her as her emotions about her lost son were still very evident in her daily life and actions. It was heartbreaking to see how much she tried to fight against them and lead a normal life but was set back by little things.\u00a0 The description of the daily rituals that she follows in her son's memory were very poignant to read about as were the ways that she tried to rationalise every hopeful thought she has about her son to try and protect herself from further hurt.\u00a0 I loved the relationship she had developed with her neighbour and the description of how they were able to support each other without talking was beautiful and brought a tear to my eye.However I did find her a little selfish and unfeeling at times, especially towards others who had also suffered the loss of the child.\u00a0 She seemed to believe that her opinion or way of thinking was the only correct way to be and didn't seem to care a lot about the way others in her situation might feel.\u00a0 As someone who has lost a child, albeit it a slightly different way, I actually agreed with Jackie's observation that it doesn't matter what people believe in as long as is it giving them comfort that is all that matters.\u00a0 When I lost Christopher the hope that I would get to see him again in heaven and hopefully get to spend time with him was very comforting to me, as was the hope that he was watching over us all and keeping us safe.\u00a0 I know others wouldn't agree with this opinion but if it provides comfort to a grieving mother I don't see what the harm in it is.\u00a0 I felt Susannah was wrong to be so outspoken against things and it did make me dislike her a bit.My favourite character was Jackie, I loved her attitude and the fact that she tried to help Susannah despite suffering herself.\u00a0 She seemed a very strong lady, determined to find her son but not to let his disappearance affect her daughter. She seemed to also be the only one to stand up to Susannah and the only person willing\u00a0to tell her she was wrong.\u00a0 I found I quite admired her and hoped that in a similar situation I might be like her.The information about how psychics work was very interesting as its a subject I've never really given much thought to before.\u00a0 Their ability to work out a suitable fortune for someone based on the similar things everyone at an event might have experience is obvious when you think about it but not something that I had ever realised before.\u00a0 I do hope that not all of them prey on vulnerable people though and that there is some sort of legal action that can be taken if they are found to have done.The style and flow of the book drew me in from the first page and I soon found myself really immersed in the story.\u00a0 The author has a brilliant ability to help the reader understand a character quite quickly and I soon felt that I understood Susannah well and knew what made her tick.\u00a0 I think this is because the author describes what the character is thinking so the reader gets a much more holistic view of them.\u00a0 She also doesn't hold back from telling the reader everything, whether good or bad, about the character leaving the reader to make up their mind about them.This the first book by Cassandra Parkin that I have read but it definitely won't be my last and I look forward to reading more by her in the future.Thank you to Legend Press for my copy of this book and for inviting me onto the blog tour."}, {"userName": "Paula Sealey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650544-paula-sealey", "userReview": "'Winter's Child' is another example of Cassandra Parkin's superb writing. A deeply haunting tale of loss, I was completely mesmerised by the story and characters.When her teenage son went missing, Susannah was bereft. Joel was her life and in her desperation to find him she began to visit clairvoyants; seeking answers to his disappearance. Her inability to focus on anything but Joel bought her marriage to an end, and, five years on, she finds herself alone, still searching for him. She no longer believes in clairvoyants and blogs about their deceptions, but an encounter with a mystic at a local fair starts up a chain of events that sees Susannah and those around her question her ability to function. As she becomes increasingly traumatised, details of the weeks surrounding Joel's disappearance begin to surface, and Susannah finally gets the answers she craves.Truly compelling and heartbreaking, my Kindle didn't leave my hands throughout.

But even though the novel does cover some of those things it is completely different to what I expected it to be. It does concern a missing child but the child isn\u2019t a young boy like I imagined him to be, he is a teenager who disappeared after a family row. There is an unreliable narrator but again it is different. Susannah is a difficult character to understand. I wanted to feel sympathy for her. She is vulnerable and suffering without Joel but she appeared to be cold to others, selfish, unapproachable and snobbish. Her attitude to John, Melanie and Jackie was appalling. Especially Jackie, who was one of the characters I really warmed to. The police are minor characters, the focus is mostly on Susannah and how she is coping, or not, without her son.It\u2019s beautifully written, and quite refreshing to read. It\u2019s a crime novel but it\u2019s approached from a parent\u2019s view rather than an investigation into a disappearance of a messed up teenager.

As always, Legend have produced an exquisite cover for this one, it totally and wonderfully represents the fabulous story within the pages.The Winter's Child of the title is Joel Harper who has been missing for five years, the story is told by Susannah; his mother. This is not a traditional 'missing child' story at all, this is a novel that doesn't just concentrate on trying to establish where Joel is. No, The Winter's Child is so much more than that. Cassandra Parkin has written a story that is both haunting and very unusual, she's created characters that consume the reader with their complexities.\ufeffSusannah Harper is a character that disturbed me, in many ways. She is grieving the loss of not only her young son, but also her marriage. She's insecure, yet confrontational; she's one of the most interesting and infuriating characters that I've come across for a long time. Yet, there is something about her that urges the reader to back her, despite her constant forays into the world of psychics and fortune tellers. Susannah writes a blog in which she pours scorn on these people, yet something pulls her back to them, time and again.Set in the city of Hull, which is brilliantly described, adding depth and atmosphere to what is already an excellent tale, Cassandra Parkin's talent for plot and pace is incredible. I was in Hull, I was in Susannah's head.With surprises and twists along the way, The Winter's Child is a book that will stay with me for a long time.

Followed by the breakdown of her marriage, Susannah now finds herself completely alone, with the exception of her sister Melanie and her family. Writing her blog unmasking psychics for the frauds that she believes them to be, Susannah still hopes that someday her little boy will come back to her. But when she sees a psychic at the local fair, it will begin a chain reaction that will have Susannah, and those around her, questioning her sanity. Because she keeps seeing Joel, and having visions of drowning, and she knows that Joel is trying to send her some sort of message. But will Susannah ever be able to unlock the truth that has been hidden for so long? As a mother, the premise of this story terrified me from the very beginning, and as we get to know Susannah, we see a broken woman who is on the edge of despair with longing for her missing son. Questioning everyone and everything around her, we see her struggle to figure out what these visions could mean, but as the pace increases it soon becomes clear that there is something dark and disturbing at work. At times I did not want to know the truth yet I couldn't put this book down as I needed to know what happened to Joel and hoped that I was wrong in my assumptions. The story is told from Susannah's point of view moving from past to present, with snippets from her blog highlighting how she has fought to cope with never knowing exactly what happened to her beloved little boy. While my heart went out to her at times throughout this book, None of the characters are completely likeable as we can see they have made mistakes but I don't think characters have to be likeable, just realistic. \u200bTHE WINTER'S CHILD by Cassandra Parkin will put you through the emotional wringer and that ending will blow your freaking mind!

The Winter\u2019s Child really took me by surprise. I was expecting gorgeous writing with a magical element. I got it. I was expecting deep emotion. I got that too, but I wasn\u2019t expecting the darker side of the narrative which took me by surprise and held me enthralled.The Winter\u2019s Child is a darkly disturbing tale of what happens when a child goes missing. It is an insightful and hugely affecting look inside the mind of a grief stricken mother whose life has been utterly devastated and who can no longer separate truth from fiction. It is also a psychological tale and a thriller so that it is multi-layered , intricate and a fabulous read.The quality of the writing is such that I was brought up short on several occasions by the plot and found that sometimes I was as much deluded as Susannah is by the so-called psychics she visits in her desperate bid to find Joel. I couldn\u2019t always separate fact and fiction. Indeed, Susannah is a triumphant creation. I felt every moment of her grief with her. She\u2019s selfish, single minded and frequently quite unpleasant or unreasonable and yet she had every ounce of my sympathy and empathy. All the characters in The Winter\u2019s Child are incredibly realistic.I love the use of the senses in Cassandra Parkin\u2019s writing to create setting and atmosphere but also to convey emotion. Her writing is textured and affecting so that reading The Winter\u2019s Child was like being immersed in an experience I couldn\u2019t control. The depth of research that has gone in to The Winter\u2019s Child is also totally impressive. I felt as if Cassandra Parkin must have experienced the same events as Susannah to be able to translate them onto the page so magnificently.I loved The Winter\u2019s Child.

Susannah and John are husband and wife, Joel is their son and went missing several years ago. The story begins with Susannah sceptically going to see a fortune teller at a local fair, there she is told she will be reunited with her son by Christmas, and her journey will be hard. Christmas is only a few months away. Susannah is quite vocal in her views of clairvoyants, fortune tellers and the like, she believes they are charlatans, fake and just after money from the vulnerable .From this point on we are taken on a roller-coaster of a journey that is haunting and emotional. The story takes the reader backwards and forwards through time, to Joel story as he was growing up, the life of the family and then life after Joel\u2019s disappearance. The downward spiral of hopelessness, grief, desperation and loneliness. The story does not contain a large cast, and it is right that it doesn\u2019t, it adds to the personal side of the story. The personal tragedy is played out and along with this there are the usual rubber-neckers and interfering people who pray on the vulnerable victims by sending false leads and hurtful vile comments. What appeared at first seemed to be a simple story, soon starts to twist and turn in some unexpected angles that I did not see coming.The pacing is perfect timed and fits so well. There were several aspects of this book that I really liked in addition to the plot and characters, the blog inclusion was one of them as well as the great narrative that built up and expanded the visual side, I had clear pictures in my head.I would recommend this book to readers of contemporary fiction, who also like elements of a psychological nature, family dynamics, loss, desperation and hope. It is well written and developed, a real page turner all the way through."}, {"userName": "Lorraine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5048580-lorraine", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book, who doesn't enjoy a good horror every once in a while?

However, even I could not be prepared for how eerie. The novel jumps between the respective years and so we see Joel at various stages of his childhood. The descriptions of Joel at 5yrs old, matched my son to a tee. All of a sudden I felt a huge feeling of unease. So much so that I decided to finish the novel that day and only did so, in the same room as my son! Susannah Harper is the protagonist, she is a broken and damaged soul after the disappearance of her teenage son Joel. The disappearance occurred 5yrs ago, since then Susannah has started a blog about the dangers of psychics and how they target vulnerable individuals. The novel details her own accounts of incidents with psychics, including the one that finally pushed her husband to leave her. The novel opens at Hull fair, where a Roma fortune teller informs her that on Christmas eve she will see her son\u2019s face again. Susannah is at the fair with her sister Melanie and her niece and nephew. Joel disappeared one day, after leaving school at lunchtime and has never been seen since. The pain, grief and anguish of the mother is evident on every page. It feels so real and I began to be absorbed by her story. But that is exactly what she had intended\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cThis will be the last Christmas eve you\u2019ll see his face again\u201d PsychicSusanah\u2019s blog entries are scattered throughout the novel.

We learn that Joel was an unhappy and depressed teenager, struggling with life at every turn. The novel details the day of the disappearance. The police officers who worked the case DI Armstrong (Nick) and DC Wood. \u201cJohn always loved me the best, but the one I loved the best was Joel\u201d SusannahWhen Susannah begins to have visions of Joel, everywhere she goes. Her sister Melanie fears for her sanity and urges her to seek help. Instead Susannah finds comfort in the arms of married police officer Nick. The friendship with Jackie, is intensified when Susannah tricks her into visiting psychic James O\u2019Brien. James offers cryptic clues and misinformation, then finally he has an announcement that left me gobsmacked\u2026\u2026\u2026..The visions increase as Christmas approaches and I really feared for Susannah, she is a vulnerable woman, with so many untrustworthy people surrounding her. Susannah is desperate for the truth and she wants it at any cost\u2026\u2026..The novel moving around Joel\u2019s lifetime really adds to the plots depth.

There\u2019s a wonderful gothic and sinister edge to this one, a creeping darkness \u2013 but also a mesmerising quality to the multiple twists and turns of the story, and a real fascination in watching the impact of grief and loss, a mother falling apart. There\u2019s an icy chill about it too \u2013 in its wintery setting (I\u2019ve lived in Hull \u2013 there are few colds that chilling\u2026), in some of the episodes experienced by Susannah as she disintegrates, and in its stark portrayal of the desperation of loneliness.The story\u2019s construction is compelling and stunning \u2013 scenes of past and present perfectly interwoven, every one there for a reason, no words wasted, all driving the story towards its uncertain and unavoidable conclusion. The characterisation is exceptional, the relationships real, the emotions perfectly evoked and described, as Susannah slowly peels away layers of elusive memory, the ultimate in unreliable narrators. The moments of anger shake you, the realness of the family dynamics, and the moments of tenderness touch you to the core. The set pieces are wonderfully accomplished \u2013 this book had me totally hooked from the vivid opening scenes in Hull Fair, and there are other scenes that will be permanently etched in my memory. And I loved the extracts from Susannah\u2019s blog \u2013 her words, the emotions behind them, the impact it has on others.This book was just stunning \u2013 without question, one of my favourite reads of this year."}, {"userName": "Love ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5933698-love", "userReview": "Winter's Child caught me unaware, going from the cover I thought I was diving into a Christmassy themed book.

The effects of her determination have dire consequences to herself and her family.I loved that I didn't know the ending till the end. Most books I guess halfway through but because I didn't I was addicted to reading and finding out.\u00a0 It's cleverly\u00a0written and such a genius plot idea.A couple of things that didn't float my boat. The cover and title for me don't work. It limits the audience of the book. The book can be read any time of the year. It's also under the horror category on Amazon. Which if I had read before the book would put me off. The book is just so much more. It should be top of the thriller charts and I feel the cover would put thriller readers off. A romantic liaison\u00a0takes place in the book that I found to be unnecessary. It didn't feel right and I was disappointed that it happened.Cassandra Parkin has an addictive writing style and I loved Winter's Child.
