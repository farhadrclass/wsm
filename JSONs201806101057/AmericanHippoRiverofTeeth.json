It was originally proposed to Congress as a solution for meat production and to also cut down on the water hyacinth that was clogging waterways. It sounds crazy, but that's the alternate history world setting the scene for American Hippo. Instead of riding in on horses, the villains (who are kind of the heros) and the law enforcement ride in on... a water hippo. Yep. Instead of barns there are lakes, and different types of hippos have been bred for different purposes (speed, meat, etc.)So the alternative history setting is unique and fun in itself, but Gailey really shines in her interesting characters. One character named Hero is genderqueer, but that's not the main point, they play an important role in the murdering sprees because of their poisoning knowledge. One character is obese (at one point worries about not fitting in a chair) but is also a skilled assassin and thief. One character is pregnant in one novella and a mother in another, but doesn't necessarily want to stop killing; it's her passion. My only quibble is that two characters have names that start with the letter A and I kept mixing them up, so I do wish that had been a bit different. But overall I laughed a lot, sometimes because of humor, but more often because it's so ridiculous and silly (it reads like a hippo western) that it just made me very happy. It's a pleasure to read, and an escape of sorts.Thanks to the publisher who provided access to this title through Edelweiss. It came out May 22, 2018."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1281880-joseph", "userReview": "American Hippo presents an entertaining adventure of an alternative US where the lower Mississippi River has been blocked off in a plan to raise hippos for meat. As strange as this sounds, it almost really happened in the early 20th century. What evolves is a story of revenge, with some very colorful characters who travel on hippos. Its a western with a twist. There are the good guys, who aren't necessarily all that good. The bad guy runs casinos on the river and feeds the rowdy and cheaters to the gators...or rather hippos. Slightly different kind of western that is thrilling and filled with colorful characters and fierce hippos."}, {"userName": "Kristen Burns", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42225826-kristen-burns", "userReview": "4 StarsReview:*I received an ecopy of this book via NetGalley. This has not influenced my review.*You know how some books constantly tell you how awful a character is, and said character constantly broods about how awful they are, but then the character never actually does anything awful?American Hippo is not that book.Within the first chapter, our protagonist, Winslow, slit a man's nostrils and put a knife through his eye without hesitation when the man insulted his hippo and then tried to attack him. So it was kind of self-defense, but you don't learn how to toss a knife in the air so that it lands perfectly in someone's eye without practice, and you don't do it all without hesitation unless you've done it before. Just sayin'.And all the other main characters? They were just as bad, if not worse. These characters, they were thieves, con artists, killers. They knew what their priorities were, they knew what kind of people they were, and they were unapologetic about it. And that was what made me enjoy reading about them, even if I didn't quite like all of them as people or didn't agree with some of their actions. I was shown the bad that was in them, I was shown the good, and I was allowed to make my own opinions or to simply read this story about them without worrying about good or bad. But the author did manage to make me really like and care about some of them anyway. In fact, I really want to read more about Winslow and Hero and am bummed that there won't be more books about them!Another great thing was how much diversity/inclusivity this book had. The main characters had different ethnicities, body types, sexual orientations, and genders. There weren't a lot of labels used, and I don't want to make assumptions, but I do know some had dark skin, one sometimes spoke in Spanish, one was fat, one used they/them pronouns, one was was genderfluid, the main character was either bi or pansexual, and multiple characters fit into more than one marginalized group. It also seemed to be a very accepting world they lived in (or maybe just a very accepting circle of friends).The overall stories (plural since this book was a combo of two connected novellas and some shorts) were enjoyable too. The book was not as sci-fi/fantasy as what I normal read---no paranormal creatures or space adventures, just an alternate history---but the Old West setting (which I love) and the hippos still transported me to another world and made the story fantastical in its own way.This book even had some romance! There was still plenty of hippos and explosions and fights, and there was nothing sexually explicit, but there was a definite romance threaded throughout. I liked it though. My only complaint about it is that it seemed sudden. I'm not sure how much time Winslow and Hero spent together, but we didn't get to see any of that time, so their feelings seemed really strong really fast. But they were cute together.I also enjoyed the writing. Something about it just pulled me in. I was a little confused by the POV though. Sometimes it seemed like 3rd person limited, but then it would switch without warning like it was omniscient. Not that big of an issue though since it didn't happen that often.Overall, I was easily drawn into this book, I loved the diverse and morally grey characters, and I really enjoyed reading about this hippo-filled Old West!Recommended For:Anyone who likes alternate history, the Old West, morally grey characters, diversity, and hippos.\nOriginal Review @ Metaphors and Moonlight\n---------------------Initial Thoughts:Diversity, outlaws, and a hippo-filled Old West!

Oh yes, sweet gentle fiends, hippopotami. The most dangerous creature in Africa is intentionally brought to the United States as an alternative meat source during a meat shortage. But Americans always take things one step further, and now they\u2019re also used as mounts. Of course, someone always has to fuck something up and there manages to be a massive hippo escape from a ranch. Now there are feral hippos that rule the rivers and marshes. Blood thirty, angry hippos.In this novella we are introduced to a host of outlaws, hired for a high paid, high danger job. To rid a dam of the feral hippos. Doing so will release the dangerous feral hippos into the South, spreading their death and destruction even further. Jobs never go as planned, someone always wants the death dealing hippos to stay right where they are.Taste of MarrowThe surviving characters from the first novella continue their adventures in this one. Adelia has given birth after kidnapping Hero. Houndstooth is obsessively searching for Hero, not quite convinced that they\u2019re even alive. Archie is waiting for her handsome U.S. Marshal to show up after not hearing from him at their arranged rendezvous spot.Adelia\u2019s newborn is stolen during a surprise attack while her and Hero are traveling. She\u2019s being forced to meet with a mysterious person who arranged her child\u2019s kidnapping, to see what they intend for her and the child. Probably not the smartest idea for the mystery person, Adelia is an infamous assassin. Hero is helping her despite the fact that she stabbed them, and they\u2019re a poison and explosives expert. Archie is a notorious pick pocket and scam artist, and Houndstooth is your general bad ass and they\u2019re hot on Adelia and Hero\u2019s trail.There are a couple short stories at the end that cover Archie meeting her U.S. Marshal for the first time and how Houndstooth\u2019s hippo Ruby got her gold-plated tusks.I loved everything about these novellas. The characters, the world-building, the plot lines. You name it, it kicked all the ass. Most importantly, major kudos to the author for including a non-binary person. It was a perspective to get used to but only because we are a gender obsessed world. It was further proof that content of character is far more important that one\u2019s gender."}, {"userName": "Judy Lesley", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley", "userReview": "Thank you to NetGalley and Macmillian-Tor/Forge for a digital galley of this collection.This is a collection of two novellas by Sarah Gailey, River of Teeth and Taste of Marrow. If you read the novellas when they were released you will find the only new items here are two very short stories using the same characters from the novellas. First is Winslow's Problem where Winslow Remington Houndstooth has just committed a robbery and needs to make a getaway on his hippo, Ruby, but she just won't get up. Whatever shall Winslow do? The remaining story is called Nine and a Half where Houndstooth and Archie are involved in robbing a bank while carrying on with the running joke about how many times Archie has saved Winslow's life.These stories are quite good entertainment with Gailey writing with humor about the life of hoppers who ranch hippos in the South for an alternative meat source. You get all the trappings of a story out of the American West with hoppers instead of cowboys and con artists, lawmen, gamblers, riverboats, the Mississippi River and people who maybe aren't exactly people as we know them. Hero is always referred to as they, them, their so I spent lots of time trying to work out exactly what I thought Hero looked like. Gailey lets the reader use their own imagination for some things but spells them out for others. I had already read River of Teeth so the remaining novella and the two short stories were new for me and I enjoyed them a lot. Looking forward to more fantasy work from this talented writer."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15751114-james", "userReview": "seems readers get a hootenanny of a good time from these hippo tales or they'd rather they weren't ever written... i am a huge fan of them, and i am not entirely sure why... they're just lots of fun i guess.. yes, there are weak points to the 2 novellas for some, and i won't argue them, but the idea is so fascinating what's to complain about... the writing is fresh and romp-y and smartassed and cheeky and rollicking... there surely needs to be more hippo going on, more how-hippos-got-here historical bits, but in the meantime just get on for a fabulous ride... the two short stories here are perfect examples of the western-themed hippo world Gailey is developing... hopefully it keeps growing and expanding...

This enchanting rough and tumble alternative history of the South infested by feral hippopotamus, an animal introduced to America as an alternative meat resource which has since run awry, is sure to captivate readers seeking an inclusive Western-feeling caper. The sheer joy I found in reading about murdering, bank robbing, and hippo riding was unexpected and exhilarating. I myself am not a fan of Westerns, but found myself enthralled in the drama of their relationships, the action necessary to survive, and the suspense from the possibility of being eaten by raging feral hippos.\u00a0I began reading the first novella, River of Teeth, over these past winter months, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now that I have the omnibus in my hands, I quickly devoured the remaining novella and two additional short stories. Gailey's writing is amazing. It's quirky, each character has such a different and robust personality, and I haven't found a writer whose descriptions felt quite the same as hers. Her personality as an author shines through her writing, yet each character sees the world in such a unique light that I can't help but feel immersed in both their inner dramas and the plot as a whole.\u00a0Taste of Marrow develops each of the characters further, and throws in a few more side characters. I could feel their relationships building as the characters get through a host of emotions, from betrayal to heartbreak and back again. They lean on each other in ways I wouldn't have expected based on who I thought they were from River of Teeth. I would definitely want all of them on my side in case of a gruesome feral hippo attack. The main characters are the most badass group I've gotten the chance to meet in a long time.\u00a0I don't think I've ever read about a more diverse cast of characters. Certainly not in a historical fiction/Western type story. I count myself lucky to come across such a great read, and can't wait to read more. Gailey is most definitely an author I want to read more from. I'm hoping the author will continue to write in similar genres, although I'd also be fascinated to read something if she put out a book in the complete opposite direction. I hope this isn't the end of the hippos - I may have to reread this book over and over again if that's the case!\u00a0I received a copy of this book via the publisher, Tor, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Laura Newsholme", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39039852-laura-newsholme", "userReview": "Sometimes a book comes along that makes you sad when you've finished reading it because it was so good! For me, that is American Hippo. It collects the two novellas Rivers of Teeth and Taste of Marrow in one volume and includes two further short stories set in the world of Hoppers and Bayous and literally every word is pitch perfect! The premise is so original and funny on the surface, but Gailey doesn't play it for laughs. Instead, she creates a world with so much depth and vivid imagery that the narrative just zings. The cast of characters is fabulous and each one is given the time and space to develop in an organic fashion, which makes them feel like lived experiences. I also loved the hippos and the way in which they each have a distinctive personality. Although this world never existed, Gailey makes it seem like it did, or should have and in my opinion, we'd all be a lot richer for it if it had!

This plan failed to take into account some key facts about hippos: they are savage, they are fast, and their jaws can snap a man in two. By the 1890s, the vast bayou that was once America's greatest waterway belongs to feral hippos, and Winslow Houndstooth has been contracted to take it back.
