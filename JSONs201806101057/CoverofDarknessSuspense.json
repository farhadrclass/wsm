While Book 1 felt more like a contemporary romance with a little suspense, this one was straight up hardcore military suspense with a little romance thrown in. I was caught off guard by that fact.There is a lot of details about the Middle East politics, which drives me a little dizzy. But I'm amazed by Kaylea's knowledge nonetheless. This whole deal is about Luke trying to make use of Bryn's as a human bait to capture Tehrazzi, while recruiting the Navy Seal, Declan as some sort of bodyguard. But I don't understand the rationale behind it at all. All Luke did was whisking Bryn all over Middle East trying to follow Tehrazzi's location. He can totally take down the man himself without the added burden of Bryn. To me Bryn totally didn't serve her purpose. The romance and the steam level between Declan and Bryn is just okay. In comparison to the grand scheme of thing happening, maybe it doesn't really matter much. In fact, I find Luke's limited conversation with his ex-wife, Emily more heartfelt. Oh, I just can't wait to go through the next two books and get my hands on the final one.

This was hands down one of the best (if not the best) romantic suspense I've ever read.Thank you, thank you, thank you GR recommendations for pointing me in the direction of the first book in this series, Out Of Her League, otherwise I never would have known about Kaylea Cross.I loved the H/h in this book. It amazed me how fabulous Bryn was - imagine an RS heroine who checked all the right boxes for me!! Smart, intelligent, didn't read into situations or overreact, wasn't bitchy, didn't put herself into dangerous scenarios and knew she was on to a good thing when she was developing feelings for Declan therefore, didn't screw it up!Dec was ohmygod... absolutely divine. Unf. Not only was he a highly trained, amazingly professional Navy SEAL; but he was such a great guy. Sweet and protective and... just breathtaking, really. *sigh*Cross' writing throws you right into the thick of the action and doesn't hold anything back. She seems to have an excellent grasp on the technical aspects of the armed forces that she writes about; and while I initially thought that would bore me, I was actually quite spellbound by it. Her writing was flawless, flawless. Even the array of secondary characters didn't throw me off at all, their interactions in the story were well-timed and perfectly delivered and I look forward to reading their stories.I don't know what else to write. I'm kind of speechless to be honest.

Too much telling, no showing. I wanted it to be over. It was tedious reading.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION:Way too much stupidity and illogic by both the heroine and the good guys. At one point I thought boy these SEALS are incompetent. An example of illogic: the good guys want to get into a nightclub to wait for a bad guy to show up. They know they won\u2019t be admitted by themselves. So they want a belly dancer prostitute to perform at the club with one of them going inside with her. You\u2019d think they would get a local prostitute to do this. But no, they ask Bryn (our heroine) to do it, but to disguise herself so the bad guy won\u2019t recognize her. Of course something bad happens to her because the bad guy recognizes her. Later they go on a mission to attack a compound where the bad guy is staying. There was no need for Bryn to go along. All she did was yell, run when she shouldn\u2019t have, and not follow orders. Another time Luke told Bryn to stay at someone\u2019s home \u201calone\u201d without any of the guys on his team to protect her. Luke knew he was sending her to the home of one of the leaks. Yes something bad happens to her. Why didn\u2019t he send one of his team to protect her? He wanted all of them to help him investigate the source of the car bomb. Of course the author doesn\u2019t show us any of the investigating activities.Way too much telling and no showing. For example an explosion happens. It is described after-the-fact by someone thinking about what happened and saying there must have been a leak. We didn\u2019t see the bad guys planning or doing it. We didn\u2019t hear any conversation between the leak and the bad guys. Too many events were done this way \u2013 not enough showing. I never got into the heads of the bad guys. There were occasions where the bad guys took action against the good guys based on leaks, but we never saw any details about the leaks. In one case bad guy B realizes X gave info to the good guys, so B kills X. Then B thinks there must be a second leak, but there was no reason for him to think there were two leaks.What was good? I liked the way the bad guy loved his horse. There were several action scenes of people running and shooting. I suppose those were ok, I just didn\u2019t care for the reasons behind them.STORY BRIEF:Bryn is visiting her father who is a diplomat in Lebanon. They are kidnapped by Tehrazzi and thrown in a hole in the ground in the desert to die. They are rescued by some Navy SEALS. The father dies but Bryn survives. Tehrazzi is angry and wants Bryn dead because her escape makes him look bad. Luke works for the CIA and has been after Tehrazzi for years. He wants to use Bryn as bait to get Tehrazzi. She agrees. Dec is one of the Navy SEALS who is part of Luke\u2019s group. Bryn and Dec are attracted to each other. Dec won\u2019t follow his feelings for her because he needs to stay focused on the job. Bryn hurts because she wants him.This is book 2 in the series. Various characters are introduced in one book and then have their own stories in other books in the series. In book 1 the main story is about Rayne, and we briefly meet Rayne\u2019s friend Bryn and his father Luke. You do NOT need to read book 1 before this book.DATA:Story length: 337 pages.

The military actions were well done. There was a lot of action and almost all of it made sense. The villian was well done and I liked the way he was humanized by showing his love for his horse juxtaposed against his killing of anyone who got in his way.Things that I felt held it back just a bit:The characterization of the two main characters seemed a bit underdone. It was nothing too major but I think with more explanation of where they were coming from might have rounded them out a bit. For example, the heroine, Bryn, was half Lebanese half American. The author never explained anymore than that. You don't know if her mother was Caucasian American or Lebanese American or what. Where did her parents meet and why did they split up? How long had she been going to visit her dad during the summer months? How vested was she in being Lebanese in addition to being American? How did her ethnic background shape her?Same basically for Declan although he was very whitebread American we don't know much about his background I'm not even sure I know what color his hair was. If it was mentioned then it was only mentioned once not enough to set it in my mind.Also, I never really bought into why she really needed to be on the second half of the mission. It wasn't totally unnecessay but I wasn't totally sold on it either. I also didn't like the way Ben called Declan, Irish. It wasn't bad enough to be a slur. They weren't close enough for nicknames that weren't derogatory.It was an odd choice for the heroine to be saved at the last by the other man, Luke instead of the hero, Declan. This is a romance so it makes more sense emotionally for the hero to save the heroine. Then he could get injured if need be. All in all it was well written and I will probably go on with the series."}, {"userName": "*Book-Lover*", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12227502-book-lover", "userReview": "[save two kids from being caught in house being blown up (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Celestine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928747-celestine", "userReview": "Soldier then loverInteresting how a Middle East-based fictional romantic thriller can seem dated just six years after it is published.

We have a heroine who is educated and a supposed black belt in Karate. To spice things up we have a terrorist trying to kill her. The book had all the ingredients that could have made it an exciting and riveting read. So, was it?Let me tell you why.There's a golden rule in writing that everyone knows about (or should, anyway): \n\"Show, don't tell.\"\n \"Cover Of Darkness\" ignored this principle. We are constantly told how strong, handsome, beautiful, resourceful, spunky, thoughtful, etc. the characters are, but we are not shown the evidence of this through the characters' actions. We are told of suspicions, but we don't get to see the suspicious character behave in such a way. And when they do show it, it's done in such a way you'd have to be extraordinarily unobservant not to notice. We are told our main heroine receives grueling training, but we are not shown it, etc. This becomes annoying very quickly. There are POV's from various characters in this book and while this should help the reader to get inside their heads, it only comes across as an opportunity for the author to enforce her own opinion of the characters on the reader.Take for example the POV from Dec, the main guy in the book, a SEAL at that. He's so impressed with our main heroine, he can't shut up about it throughout the book (in his monologue of course, we don't actually hear him say the things he thinks.) Bryn for her part can't shut up about how intelligent, gorgeous, etc. Dec is. In short, in order to learn about the characters' personalities and what makes them tick, we have to read another character's POV where they describe their object of infatuation in detail, instead of observing the characters themselves. Because of this, there's barely any real dynamic, just the one we're told. It basically goes like this: [main heroine Bryn says something bland] --> [main hero Dec thinks: Oh my god, what a courageous, intense, beautiful little unicorn! She's the strongest woman I've ever known! <3 <3 <3!!!] Lather, rinse, repeat. Even if a character makes a very witty/intelligent/whatever comment, I don't need someone to point that out, I can decide for myself, thank you. Another problem the book has is buildup between the main couple. They basically love each other right from the start. Heck, Dec already starts his complimenting monologue when just being presented a pretty picture and a file with some basic stats. He's supposed to be the best of the best, so it seems out of character of him to be so affected by a picture and a name of a person he doesn't know. There's more stuff like that. Too much, actually. The plans the professionally trained people come up with aren't all that bright. In fact, they're downright ridiculous. This team of highly trained professionals use the main heroine as bait to lure out the terrorist. But instead of setting up in an environment they can control, they let the terrorist decide and follow him around. And then, when they do whisk her out, they try to disguise her! I mean, what's the point in that? Of course the disguise doesn't work and our main character almost gets killed. But even when things heat up you never feel like you're there. It's like listening to someone recounting a story rather than seeing it unfold in front of your eyes. In short, a rather dull read for a suspenseful romance novel."}, {"userName": "SheLove2Read", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708674-shelove2read", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "~Megan~", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4264260-megan", "userReview": "Wow, this book was so different from the last, but just as good!
