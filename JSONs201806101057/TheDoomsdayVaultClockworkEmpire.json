It would have been more interesting.I feel like this book really wanted to be a clever adventure in the vein of \"Soulless\" and the other books in the Parasol Protectorate, but it never quite got there. For one, although \"The Doomsday Vault\" tries to put its heroine in scary but seemingly absurd situations (like fighting zombies in a ball gown at 3am), the narration doesn't have the self-awareness to pull it off, and Alice is just too weak a character.The book has a few good ideas, and there are little hints of what could have become a truly great story. Take this situation: the heroes are in love, and they've just gotten information about the mastermind behind the unusual circumstances that have been happening. They find the villain, revealed to be a relative of the leading lady, who explains that they are the mastermind behind an incredible invention: a cure for the zombie plague that afflicts hundreds. Unfortunately, the cure was stolen by the same organization the heroes work for, and they must infiltrate the top-security 'Doomsday Vault' in order to retrieve it. To make the situation even more dire, the heroes realize that the lady's lover himself has been infected by the plague, forcing them to undertake this difficult task or watch him die slowly. All of that is the set up for a really great plot! Unfortunately, in 'The Doomsday Vault', all of that information and action is crammed into the last 50 pages or so. Instead, for the first 300 pages we have the main lady Alice CONSTANTLY whining and waffling back and forth on a decision that should be no decision at all. A secret society wants her to join them and put her amazing engineering skills to good work! But no, she is poor and so she must marry her hated, but rich, fiancee, so he can pay her debts! But she is REALLY NEEDED at the secret society! But she just can't agree to join them! Oh, but she wants to! But she can't! But she must! THREE HUNDRED PAGES OF THIS, with a character who has very little personality of her own. By the end of the book I wanted to strangle Alice, she was so annoying and useless. If the drama about the relationship absolutely had to be included (and I don't think it did, the plot as I outlined above is WAY more interesting) then there needed to be much higher stakes-- perhaps Alice is the only one who could do the job, and every time she refuses more people die. Or she's being blackmailed by her fiancee. SOMETHING to give her a better reason to say no, because as is it's just incredibly frustrating. She is a heroine in a steampunk novel. She should jump at any and every chance at adventure. When Alice finally does get over her awful engagement and pursues our hero, Gavin, the relationship feels very artificial and constructed. We know the characters are in love because the narration tells us, not because they show each other any affection or have any chemistry. I also had some issues with the idea of the 'clockwork plague.' This is a plague that turns the vast majority of people into \"zombies\" who are not walking corpses but badly diseased individuals whose flesh is rotting from their frames. However, in a tiny percentage of people it accelerates their mind into genius before driving them mad and then killing them. Well enough. But for what is supposed to be a rare condition, there seem to be dozens of \"clockworkers\" (as the geniuses are called) in England alone, and plenty in other countries. How does that work? And why it it even called the \"clockwork plague\"? There doesn't seem to be any connection between the name and the disease-- the connection with the geniuses makes some sense, but why call it that if the vast majority of people just rot away and die? It feels like the author threw in clockwork because it's a steampunk novel and that's what you do.There was a lot of potential here, but overall the book just falls flat. The plot doesn't even happen until the last 100 pages, where explanations are rapidly handed out and then everything is rushed together. The actual raid on the Doomsday Vault takes perhaps five pages at most, which makes me wonder why the book was titled after something so unimportant. The main character is completely boring, although the other characters are interesting. It is those other characters that save this book from a 1-star rating. Honestly, if the entire book had been written from Gavin's perspective, or perhaps from Aunt Edwina's, it would have been much more engaging. As-is, I certainly won't be reading any more in this series, and the book itself will be chucked in a box to be sent off to the used bookstore."}, {"userName": "Echo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/437515-echo", "userReview": "[I could understand Alice's choice of family over love when she chose to marry a rich man and save her father instead of joining the Third Ward and being with Gavin. I could even understand the choice when she found out her fiance wasn't exactly a saint. But I was baffled when she finally decided to leave her fiance and then suddenly dropped off screen in the book, only for Gavin to be told by a third party that she'd changed her mind because her father had died. Wait. WHAT? Her ONE reason for marrying someone she didn't love in the first place is dead, she's completely free to do as she pleases, and she decides to stay? That makes no sense. I just assumed, especially since she isn't seen in person or heard from in the narrative, that this was some trick of her fiance's. Nope. It was all her, and when she does explain it, her explanation is pretty weak. And, when she changes her mind again, she does a 180 in character so fast, it wasn't convincing me. In the matter of a few pages, she seemed to go from a proper, though independent, girl who balks at women who vote and wear pants to one of those women who wear pants. In fact, her second day of pants wearing, she's already uncomfortable putting a dress on again. I am not convinced. I am not convinced at all.

I want to enjoy the novel--because who actually enjoys rating someone's pride and joy poorly?--but I simply cannot.In THE DOOMSDAY VAULT (TDV), the voice was what ultimately made me give up. While it has an interesting concept, and while I enjoy both steampunk and zombies, I could not become immersed within this world. There is no way that I can eloquently describe what I took issue with, so I'll be blunt: TDV was too monotone for my tastes. I felt that this title gets lost in a lot of unimportant details at times, which makes the world seem somewhat lifeless (as opposed to being vibrant). The tone was the same for both characters, thus making it difficult to differentiate between the two. Thankfully, Steven does not shy away from using the character names quite often throughout the pages, so there is no possible way to mix up the two. Intricate details regarding the technical aspects of fights--as opposed to delving further into character thoughts and emotions--added to my lack of enjoyment. What were awesome fights in theory became labor intensive to read about. The chunky paragraphs also added to my disenchantment with this book.Too much telling and not enough showing was another culprit. Info dumping way too early on, combined with the telling, made me wonder why I should care about the characters and world.I read roughly 50 pages before calling it quits. I hate that I did not enjoy this, but it's bound to happen every so often. Perhaps others will enjoy this title and find the voice engaging. I suggest that you do not base your decision on whether to read (or avoid) this book based on my review alone. Take my review with a grain of salt, and read a preview first. As for me, I think it's time to give zombies a temporary break."}, {"userName": "edifanob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1120366-edifanob", "userReview": "It is the first book in a series and it is definitely steampunk.A lot of gadgets, interesting twists and turns.There are two reasons why I did not give five stars:- From my point of view some of the solutions have been a way too easy- Alice Michaels, one of the main characters, has been a pain in my neck too often.Anyway I own a copy of The Impossible Cube which is the secon book in the series and I will definitely read it."}, {"userName": "Simcha Lazarus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2715084-simcha-lazarus", "userReview": "All across the world, zombies roam the streets at night, infecting those they touch with the Clockwork Plague. Most of the infected die horrible, drawn-out, deaths, but some people are affected differently and instead of destroying their brains the plague enhances them. These people are called Clockworkers and they are responsible for creating the greatest inventions of the time. Unfortunately the disease eventually causes them to go mad.In Victorian England, Alice Michaels lives with the horrible knowledge that it was because of her that her family was infected by the Clockwork Plague, leading to death of her mother and brother. Alice will therefore do whatever it takes to bring her father the happiness he deserves, even if it means attending balls in order to capture for herself a wealthy husband. Unfortunately Alice's social standings have dropped so far that no one in Society is interested in having anything to do with her, until Mr. Norbert Williamson shows up. Mr. Williamson is new to London and a bit of a mystery, but Alice doesn't much care as long as he is willing to provide for her and her father, even if he doesn't excite her the way the romance novels and poetry describe.But Alice's resolve to go along with her father's plans wavers when she gets her first taste of excitement and adventure, after helping quell a zombie attack. Alice's loyalties to her father, and propriety, are strained even further when her path crosses that of a young man who makes her feel the excitement that she never felt with Mr. Williamson. But despite her own desires Alice knows that her duty to her father comes first. Though when a new Clockworker appears, stirring the zombies to attack the populace, Alice may be the only one who can stop it because for some reason it keeps seeking her out.Gavin Ennock is a seventeen year-old cabin boy, on the USS Juniper airship, with a talent for playing the violin. Gavin can't imagine any other life other than that on an airship, but after his ship is attached by pirates Gavin finds himself alone and destitute on the streets of London. By playing his violin in the park Gavin manages to make enough money to feed himself, and hopefully enough to eventually get him back home. But Gavin's talent gains him unwanted attention and once again he finds himself captured, and at a stranger's mercy. Though this time Gavin is saved by a beautiful young woman who helps direct him onto a new path of adventure and excitement, working for a secret government organization, fighting zombies and capturing Clockworkers.I'm not sure what it is about Victorian England but for some reason I really enjoy reading stories that take place in that time and setting and The Doomsday Vault was no exception. The Doomsday Vault was a fun and thrilling fast-paced adventure full of engaging characters and plenty of surprises. The premise of the story was unique, with all of biggest inventions of the time being credited to this rare form of the zombie Plague that enhances the inventor's skills, before leading them to madness. I particularly enjoyed all the interesting and unexpected twists that kept popping up, just when I thought I had the story figured out, particularly towards the end.Alice is great character, and one who I was easily able to sympathize with. Her run-in with the zombies has given her a taste for adventure and the desire to use her skills to make a difference in the world, even as she struggles to stay on the path of propriety for the sake of her father. She is constantly in fear of becoming one of those wild Ad Hoc women that she has heard so much about, even though this is exactly the kind of woman she really longs to be.One of my favorite interaction between Alice and Gavin comes right after she assists him in capturing a crazed Clockworker, which leads them to spending the night together unchaperoned. The next day Alice insists they come up with a cover-story so that no one will suspect her of impropriety. \u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Alice put in, \u201chow are we going to handle the travel and explanations?\u201d  Gavin looked puzzled. \u201cI don't understand.\u201d  \u201cGavin,\u201d she said gently, \u201cas a traditional woman, I can drive about London with a man who isn't my husband or father as long as we are in public. But I can't go overnight with him. Even an Ad Hoc lady couldn't do that. I'm not even coming back in my own clothes.\u201d  \u201cOh. Right. It's always something stupid,\u201d He scratched his cheek, which was growing raspy. \u201cLook, I don't think anyone saw you leave London with me....If anyone does know you left town overnight, we'll tell him Baron captured you. I, an agent of the Crown, rescued you in a daring raid at dawn, and now I'm seeing you home. Your dress was badly torn in the rescue so you bravely donned a spare set of man's clothes. How's that?\u201d  \u201cWhy am I the one who gets captured?\u201d  \u201cYou're the traditional lady.\u201dSo while Alice would love to run around, battling zombies and saving the day she feels bound to follow of the role of a traditional lady, because that's what's expected of her.What I found interesting about Gavin was that he's so different from the kind of male protagonist that are usually featured in these kind of stories. Usually the male is a real Alpha personality, a larger-than life character who is confident, handsome and overly protective of his female counterpart, whom he is often in a constant battle of wills with. Some examples that come to mind are Lord Maccon from Gail Carriger's Soulless, James Easton from Y.S Lee's Agency series and Alexi Rychman from Leanna Renee Hieber's Strangely Beautiful series. Gavin, though, was a lot more, well, normal. While he was handsome, as a good male lead should be, he wasn't overly confident, or brave or of superior intelligence . But he was more of an average guy, though a very nice and talented one. It was also unusual that he was actually a few years younger then Alice. While I thought it was rather nice to have this unconventional kind of hero, I was also a bit disappointed because I do like those Alpha males. I kept expecting him to be more forceful whenever Alice pulled away, and to chase her a bit more, but this wasn't the case. I wonder if the fact that the author is a male gave him a different perspective in creating Gavin. I don't think any of the other similar book that I've read were by male authors.I usually enjoy reading about the different steampunk inventions in these books but I didn't find the ones in The Doomsday Book very convincing. Alice's robots seemed strangely independent for mechanical creations and there is a huge mechanical tree that shows up though I couldn't imagine why anyone would create a huge tree as a means of transportation. It seemed very impractical to me.The Doomsday Book has almost everything I like in a good book including adventure, romance, some humor and a strong female protagonist. It was a lot of fun and can't wait for the next installment in the series."}, {"userName": "James Tullos", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21076860-james-tullos", "userReview": "See my full thoughts here: https://youtu.be/SMTit-Cl234I have very little to say here.

I could pick it apart and examine every problem if I wanted, I just don't want to.

I guess I'm trying to say that this book was practically custom made for my palate. And that was before I even opened it. Then it had to go and be all super awesome what with the plague zombies and the clockwork bits and the fighting. Oh, and the vaguely frowned upon romance between an upper crust lady and a lowly airman who's *gasp* younger than she is. Love it!One thing I will say is that this book is dense. There's a lot of worldbuilding and character building going on here. It works beautifully, I must say. The dirty streets of London, haunted by those that have fallen to the Clockwork Plague, come alive with ease. The lovely Alice Michaels, fallen on hard times and trying desperately to be a proper young lady in a time when women are beginning to rise up and take their places among the men, shines as an example of a woman of noble birth torn between doing what is socially correct and following her heart. Gavin Ennock, cabin boy and musician, suffers misfortune after misfortune until he finally finds a place where his extraordinary talent for music can be put to good use. Honestly, even the background characters were wonderfully drawn and complex.As a fan of steampunk, I adored the gadgets and mechanical pieces that populated the scenery. Alice has an affinity for the gears and clockwork bits and she manages to indulge it despite the way society frowns upon a woman showing interest in those sort of things. Although I may have disagreed with some of the decisions she made in her personal life, I applaud a person who can sneak in a good bout of wrench wranglin' every once in a while.With secret organizations, zombies that come in several levels of gross, and a quiet, star-crossed love that I found myself rooting for, The Doomsday Vault was an imaginative ride. Fans of steampunk, zombies, and twisted morals (or any combination of those three) will enjoy dipping their toes into this world.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal"}, {"userName": "Steve Walker", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2110619-steve-walker", "userReview": "I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I am not generally a fan of alternative history or zombies, but this story has both and I enjoyed it. Set in the late 1800s it is a mishmash of 19th century and more modern technology as the backdrop for Steven Harper's enjoyable tale of a young American \"sailor\" who finds himself abandon in London after his \"ship\" was taken by pirates. Some of his shipmates were killed, while others were ransomed to the shipping company. Being just a cabin boy, he does not rate being ransomed and must fend for himself.Mixed in with familiar 19th century life is a plethora of robotic gadgets that have a level of artificial intelligence. They are comprised of complicated gears and steam power. At this time in London a \"clockwork\" plague is spreading which has turned a large portion of the population into zombies. But every once in a while the infected person does not become a zombie but a \"clockworker\". The clockworker has heightened intellectual and creative abilities. These are the people that create all of the \"clockwork\" gadgets, most of which are animatons of animals, human servants, etc. In one scene an orchestra is made entirely of automated clockwork musicians and instruments. It's a lot of fun to see what Mr, Harper chooses to be an advanced clockwork creation versus the mundane 19th century items we know and love.But he also weaves a good story and reveals a mystery with some espionage, love, patriotism, betrayal, loyalty, and just good fun. He builds good characters in Alice and Gavin and they play off each other quite well. There is also an enjoyable cast of supporting characters: Alice's father the baron, her Aunt Edwina, her friend Louisa, the fiance Norbert, the clandestine Third Ward group, mad clockworkers, and more.It is a \"steam punk\" genre novel. I had never heard of that, but Wikipedia describes it as a genre that \"incorporates elements of science fiction, fantasy, alternate history, horror, and speculative fiction.\" That explains it! I'm interested in reading more from this series and maybe exploring more Steam Punk authors."}, {"userName": "Jeff Raymond", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32271-jeff-raymond", "userReview": "My limited experience with steampunk has been of the more gritty variety. Most of the steampunk I've read has been more the Cherie Priest variety, where the setting is more dark and things are Very Wrong and not so much fun. Thus, when I read a book like All Men of Genius or this, it feels different and fresh for me.This was a fun one. On one hand, you have Alice, she of high society in London and great with a wrench. On the other, Gavin, a cabin boy flying over to Europe in a dirigible from Boston. When Gavin's ship is hijacked by pirates, Gavin escapes and eventually crosses paths with Alice, opening the door for a much wider situation.The book pretty much had everything I was looking for: fun with machines, zombies, a government conspiracy, some sci-fi elements, and a fun, fast-paced plot that didn't telegraph too much and didn't seem out of place or too reliant on the setting. I couldn't tell you why I chose to pick this up, but I did and I'm glad.Definitely recommended if steampunk is your cup of tea, and definitely recommended if you're looking to dip your toe into the steampunk waters.

Particularly notable is the assortment of strong and interesting female characters, who play a variety of roles in relation to the protagonists and who are essential to the story's development. The protagonists themselves (twenty-two-year-old impoverished noblewoman Alice Michaels and eighteen-year-old American airman Gavin Ennock) grow in ways that are both realistic and sometimes surprising.

I think it was due to the fact that I initially wasn't buying the main character's situation. Someone with a mind which worked like that should be able to shake off the social conventions or at least work around them especially with the examples provided elsewhere in the postulated society. I think I would have believed the set up more if there had been some sort of legal/outside impediment to breaking the social mold rather than just a cartload of psychological guilt which the reader doesn't actually find out about until almost the end of the book. I would have even run with the psychological angle if the author had set it out a bit more clearly earlier on. Other than that the tale was enjoyable once I finally got into it.

His origin story is traumatic, and his choices, bad and good, feel authentic. Descriptions of Gavin flying, playing the fiddle, riding a giant automaton into battle--I could have read the whole book in his viewpoint. Alice gets more page time.

Michaels was born into nobility. As the daughter of a Baron, she is expected to act like a proper lady. The Clockwork Plague has devastated her family and now they are in deep debt. Alice uses one last opportunity to seek a suitor, a rich man who would benefit from her title and pay off her family\u2019s debts, since as a proper lady she cannot hold a job. Alice enjoys working on automatons and she has a skill for repairing them. Alice\u2019s skill catches the eye of the Third Ward, an underground organization that has a need for her talents.Gavin is a cabin boy on the USS Juniper. He is also a talented singer and fiddler. He is more comfortable soaring through the clouds than standing on dry land. After a series of unfortunate events, Gavin is stranded in London. He turns to playing his fiddle on the streets to gain money. A strange event leads to him meeting Alice, where they begin to develop feelings for each other and it is his musical talents that ultimately lead him to a job with the Third Ward.Alice is head-strong but she cares a little too much about what people think about her. She struggles too hard to be the Baroness that society demands. Behind closed doors she is a strong, smart woman but it does take her a long time to get past the prejudices that she has put upon herself. Gavin is smart and he easily adapts to the situations he gets put in. Both characters do grow as the story moves along. My only complaint is that some of the character emotion is lost in the story but I did still like Alice and Gavin.I really enjoyed the world-building in this book, zombies, mechanical men, airships and a clockwork cat (I would really love one of these). The Clockwork Plague is a highly contagious zombie disease that has some rare side effects that have led to the development of the \u201cSteampunk\u201d world. The world has adapted to living with the zombies. The Clockwork Men are incredible geniuses and the experiments they create are genuinely unique.The Doomsday Vault is action-packed from beginning to end. There are very few slow parts. Even though there are zombies, The Doomsday Vault is not a horror story, it is strictly a fantasy read.I found The Doomsday Vault to be a wonderful read. Mr. Harper created an entertaining world and I can\u2019t wait to read The Impossible Cube to see what\u2019s next for Gavin and Alice.Notable Scene:\u201cMr. Barton!\u201d Alice shouted. \u201cYour Boadicea has arrived. May I blow you a kiss?\u201dShe\u2019s gone completely crazy, Gavin thought. She\u2019s gone crazy and he\u2019s going to kill her.But Barton paused. From inside the glass bubble, he peered down at her, and Gavin thought he saw a grin slide across his face.\u201cMy queen!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you wet?\u201d\u201cI have crossed the wide ocean to be with you, my king,\u201d Alice said. \u201cAnd now that we\u2019re together, nothing will stop us from ruling the world.\u201dGavin stared. What the hell?\u201cOpen your bubble and receive my blessing. O my king,\u201d she continued. \u201cProve your love to me!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to trick me,\u201d Barton said. \u201cYou\u2019re a queen of spades.\u201d He raised the boulder again, and Gavin\u2019s heart lurched.\u201cYou refuse your queen?\u201d Alice\u2019s voice rose to a shriek. \u201cThen watch my blood spill across the ground, for I cannot live without you!\u201d She raised the knife and held it over her breast. Gavin gathered himself to lunge for her.\u201cWait!\u201d Barton set the boulder aside. \u201cI love you, my queen. I can\u2019t bear to see you in pain.\u201d The bubble hissed and slid back, though Barton made no move to come down. \u201cClimb up and receive my love.\u201d\u201cWith pleasure, my king.\u201d From her sleeve Alice pulled a pair of tuning forks and brandished them like a pair of swords. Gavin slapped his own jacket pockets and discovered them empty. As the startled Barton watched, Alice clanged the forks together. From Gavin\u2019s vantage point, the tritone was thin and weak, but Barton was only a few feet away from it. He clapped his hands over his ears and howled. The tone died down, but Alice struck the forks again to keep it going. Gavin didn\u2019t wait. He burst out of hiding and swarmed up the mechanical to the seat where Barton screamed. One practiced punch put the man out. Gavin shook his stinging fist and looked down at Alice.The Clockwork Empire Series:1. The Doomsday Vault2. The Impossible Cube3.

In 1850\u2019s London,it\u2019s all about appearances. Well,appearances and money,and Alice and her father simply don\u2019t have any. She\u2019s to be a Baroness,but since Alice\u2019s mother,brother,and fianc\u00e9 were killed by the clockwork plague,it left her father a cripple,and Alice a social pariah. Hoping to get back into society\u2019s good graces,Alice decides to attend a ball,and see if she can meet someone willing to marry her and take care of her father and their many debts. However,society doesn\u2019t look kindly on girls that prefer to be elbow deep in automatons instead of at dances. However,when she meets the outspoken and frank Louisa Creek,she\u2019s glad she\u2019s found someone to confide her true interests and desires. At the dance,she also meets the agreeable Norbert Williamson (rich to be sure),who seems to take an interest in Alice in spite of,or perhaps because of,her unusual proclivities. Then Alice acquires a rather unusual inheritance from her Aunt Edwina,who seems to have mysteriously disappeared. Aunt Edwina\u2019s disappearance will be very important to the story,Alice\u2019s future,and possibly,the world.Meanwhile,on an airship high above London,17 year old Gavin Ennock is one year away from becoming a full airman,enjoying the company of his comrades and entertaining them with his wonderful talent as a fiddler. When his ship is attacked by pirates,he finds himself stranded on the streets of London. Eventually,his path will cross with Alice\u2019s with life changing results. After helping to thwart a zombie attack,Gavin and Alice are asked to be part of a clandestine organization (funded by the Queen) called the Third Ward,that rounds up Clockworkers to harness their amazing abilities. Clockworkers are those that are stricken with the clockwork plague but are affected in a completely different way,able to create amazing gadgets and inventions,some with the power to end life on our planet (hence the Doomsday Vault).Where do I start with The Doomsday Vault? Coming in at just under 400 pages,the author manages to pack a LOT into this novel,and he does it expertly. Alice desperately wants to explore her talent for machines,but fights against her need for security and a means to care for her father. Then there\u2019s that really irritating attraction to Gavin. She can\u2019t get him off her mind,but for the most part,remains resolute in her determination to marry Williamson and take her expected place in society,in spite of the freeing adventures she has with Gavin and the Third Ward. I\u2019ll admit,Alice\u2019s stubbornness made me want to smack her at times,but who am I to judge? I live in a time where women can be pretty much whatever they want,without the weight of society\u2019s expectations on her shoulders,so I tried to give Alice some leeway here:) I totally fell in love with Gavin,who\u2019s bravery and determination made him a hero to root for. You\u2019ll have great fun exploring the Third Ward,and the author created such a rich and lavish world for his characters,that I felt I could (happily) have gotten lost in it for hours. Among the general awesomeness that is this book,Alice has a charming automaton manservant called Kemp,a mechanical cat called Click,and a gaggle of automatons that assist her in just about everything. Plus,I did mention zombies,yes? Twists and turns abound,and the author managed to lob some shockers at me that I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t see coming. I\u2019ll admit,my only complaint about this book is that it wasn\u2019t longer,because I didn\u2019t want to leave Alice and Gavin\u2019s London! If you love your Victorian adventures filled with zombies,amazing automatons,steampunk flare,and an impeccable eye for detail,you\u2019ll love the fascinating (and fantastical) Doomsday Vault!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie  G", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2989497-stephanie-g", "userReview": "3.5 starsAlice is the daughter of an impoverished Baron.

I\u2019m not very familiar with the genre since I\u2019ve only read a few books, but I think I\u2019m becoming a true fan. So far, I\u2019ve enjoyed all of the steampunk novels that I\u2019ve read, and The Doomsday Vault is no exception.Obviously set in a Victorian London, this novel takes us on an adventure through balls, pirate attacks, zombie attacks and crazy clockworker meltdowns. When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be a mix of steampunk and pure paranormal but the paranormal aspect is limited to zombies. The clockwork plague is what created these zombies, infecting people on contact and spreading the disease through the streets of London. However, some of the infected people don\u2019t become zombies. Quite the opposite \u2013 they become clockworkers, geniuses with great analytical skills and the ability to create and invent remarkable things. In this world, Mozart was actually a clockworker, creating the most amazing music while infected by the disease in the last year of his life. Automatons, the many robots encountered in this book, were also invented by clockworkers. These geniuses remind me of autistic children who are evaluated as savants. Almost to intelligent, the clockworkers end up going through a meltdown as the disease kills them after a few years of being infected.I truly enjoyed the idea of the plague and the clockworkers, but I think it\u2019s the main characters that really brought the story together. Soon to be Baroness Alice Michaels would love to be an independent, free thinking woman, but at twenty-one, she\u2019s not getting any younger. Pressured by her father to look for a wealthy husband, she acts as the dutiful daughter and accepts the first marriage proposal she is offered. However, the only things that Alice likes about her new fianc\u00e9, Norbert, is his ability to pay off her father\u2019s debts. Deep down, she knows her heart belongs to Gavin Ennock, a poor American airman stranded in London, that she saved from her aunt Edwina\u2019s strange and dangerous house. The ever absent Edwina, who inspired Alice\u2019s unrefined interest in automatons and engineering, has gone missing and Alice feels it\u2019s her duty to find her.But overall, my favorite character has to be Click, one of Alice\u2019s automatons. In the shape of a cat, Click has humanlike qualities even if you find him licking his paws and illuminating dark halls with his bright green lights for eyes. Rarely saying anything, he still has a big part in this story. Automatons and machinery play a big part in the novel and Steven Harper had done a wonderful job in describing everything. Also, I believe he has thoroughly researched the physics of sound and music, a reoccurring and important element in the book.Because I love the colours of this cover, I just need to say a few things about it. It\u2019s actually the main thing that drew me to the book while I was browsing my library. I think the contrast between the yellow London fog and the sharp blue of her dress was a good choice. Of course the little elements like the automaton cat and the strange pistol are positive additions. I especially like the foggy background that includes the ever popular airship (dirigible) that seems to dominate the steampunk genre.This novel has many layers and it guarantees you non-stop action. From science, to dirigibles, to politics, to social norms of Victorian England, I believe this book is the true definition of steampunk. A great start to an imaginative series, I strongly suggest this book to fans of the genre. Its sequel, The Impossible Cube, comes out in May 2012."}, {"userName": "Daron", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13007426-daron", "userReview": "[creepy sexbot business?

She lost her mother and brother to the clockwork plague, and then several years later, her fiance as well. So now everyone treats her like a pariah. At 21 she is already long past the prime age for a desirable marriage, and her love of automatons has even further outcast her. In a last ditch effort to save her family's honor she goes to one last ball to try and snag a fiance. This sets in a chain of events that will forever change her life as she gets thrown into a world of secrecy and finds an attraction in a man who would make a very unlikely match. It took me a little while to really get into The Doomsday Vault as the beginning was a little confusing. Things took a turn for the better when the two story lines came together as Alice and Gavin meet. Prior to that point, I was a little unsure as to what the two different story lines had to do with each other. However, as time went on and they interacted together, I started to enjoy things a lot more. Perhaps that was because I finally had something to root for as their attraction grew, as before that I didn't have an attachment to their struggles. I enjoy reading the struggle and conflict these two faced as they tried to make decisions the best they could, even if it kept them apart. I've always been drawn to a story with mismatched couples with plenty of obstacles in their path.This was my second foray into Steampunk, and to be honest I still have mixed feelings about the genre. The first had more of a western feel, while The Doomsday Vault was more Elizabethan. Both times I ended up enjoying the book in the end, but the large learning curve and past setting lessened my enjoyment. So while things have turned out okay overall, I still think I prefer books with a modern setting, as things like propriety, class status, and titles drive me a little batty. I realize those things were a major part of the time period, but it gets a little monotonous after a while. I guess it is a really good thing I didn't live during that time period. However, putting that all aside, the world behind The Doomsday Vault was quite intriguing. The plague that is the root of the world as they know it, not only kills, but also can give great gifts as well. Although the ones with the gifts, known as clockmakers, only receive the gifts of brilliance for a short while as eventually the plague claims them as well. Even so, almost all major innovation can be laid at their feat, which I found to be a really interesting twist on things, as who would expect a deadly disease to cause so much good.While The Doomsday Vault didn't quite hold my attention as much as other books, I still was pretty entertained, and will come back for more when the next installment is released. There was enough of a build up and teaser for more, that I am very curious to see what happens next. So, while it didn't have a cliffhanger ending in the truest sense, there was still plenty enough left unsettled to leave me wanting more. Considering my feelings for this genre, that was no small feat, making The Doomsday Vault pretty impressive in the end. If you enjoy the steampunk genre, or even books set in the Elizabethan time period that have a little fantasy mixed in, then The Doomsday Vault should be a solid read."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3082444-candace", "userReview": "This review was first posted on my blog at http://www.candacesbookblog.comWow! This book got me all sorts of excited! It was absolutely fantabulous! {Yes, I know that's not a word.} It had amazing gadgets and a super strong steampunk aspect. And while I love steampunk {seriously, I do, I seek it out} I'm always a bit worried about how detailed it will be because I have a short attention span. This book though, this book had the very strong steampunk aspect without lengthy descriptions, at all! And while that's a good thing for me others may see that as a negative. Personally I don't need to know how everything works. I want to know what it looks like and what it can do and maybe a brief description of how it works is okay, but I don't need to know how everything works. These things may pass through my head fleetingly, but really, I was completely okay with not knowing. But like I said, others might not like that. The characters were great! In the beginning we're getting stories from Alice's perspective and from Gavins as well. It alternates between them and we don't know how they connect. It worked fine for me and I felt like I got a good opportunity to get to know both of their back-stories this way. And got to know them more personally. Once their paths cross then it becomes mostly Alice's story, with going back to Gavin just occasionally. I thought it was all well done and was done in a way we got to get a real feel for them and their personalities. And they are both absolutely fantastic characters, I fell in love with both of them. The one issue I had, which was very minor, was that I had a hard time picturing Gavin as older. When we are introduced to him he is a cabin boy and I think hearing 'boy' maybe messed with my head. I'm not exactly sure, but he always felt a little young to me even though he never really did anything that made him seen immature or anything. I still loved him though! This was a fast paced read with almost constant action that had me dying to know more. I found myself wanting to sit and read it and not do anything else. And I actually was so impressed with the automatons and the world that I totally went crazy describing it all to my six year old daughter. {Yeah, I was seriously excited.} And it got her so excited that she said she wants to read it when she grows up! {YAY!} So any book that gets me excited like that is definitely awesome. And as far as the gadgets and steampunk aspect goes this may be my favorite yet. I mean this world building was phenomenal! Now, I could go into telling you more about how it all works and how there's paranormal to it {there's zombies on page one!} but I don't think it's necessary and will just get me all carried away. I will say that the zombies have a scientific reason and so it was more light on the paranormal aspect {which I actually really liked!}.This book was actually quite clean. There is some cursing, but not much. And there's violence, but you find it worse in many YA novels. And there's no sex, just some mention of sexual activity {it was quite vague} and I think that many mature young adult readers may really enjoy this book. Anyway, I loved it and I very highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Kim ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/148723-kim", "userReview": "Review written for steamingenious.blogspot.com where I have many steampunk book reviews.I don't know why I begin most steampunk books with low expectations. When I haven't heard of the book or the author before, well, I always at least halfway expect it to suck. Which means that I'm almost always pleasantly surprised. In the case of The Doomsday Vault, I was extremely pleasantly surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys steampunk.The world depicted by Harper is very close to historical Victorian England. All the real world societal rules still apply. Things are very difficult for women and racial minorities. The only difference is that there is a \"clockwork plague\" that causes illness, death, and sometimes zombies. So zombies are roaming the streets of London, only coming out at night or under cover of fog. They aren't the huge threat that zombies usually are in fiction, they really are something of a minor annoyance, except that if they touch you they can infect you with the plague.But for a very small number of people infected with the plague, the results are different. They become \"clockworkers\", essentially mad science geniuses. They don't live long, but they create incredible technological inventions while becoming more and more insane. So society at large benefits from some of these inventions, while shunning anyone who has any contact with anyone infected.The heroine of the book is a young woman who lost several family members to the plague and therefore is shunned by society regardless of the fact that her father is a baron. She's seeking only to find a wealthy husband to improve her family's fortune and save her respectability. Her secret desire is to spend her time working on automatons and putting her mechanical skills to use, but her duty to her family prevents her from acting on those desires. The hero is a young airman from America who is stranded in London after pirates attack his ship. The two of them eventually encounter one another and become involved in a series of mysterious events. The feel of this book reminds me most strongly of Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate series. This book doesn't have the same amount of humor, but otherwise the attitude and tone is similar. Alice Michaels must deal with her own secret skills and various shadowy conspiracies while also trying to fit in with upper class society, regardless of how much she wishes she could rebel against it. The idea of uncontrollable mad scientists constantly inventing things in fits of inspiration is also reminiscent of the webcomic Girl Genius, though again with less humor. The lack of humor isn't really a negative though, as the implications of the events in the novel are serious. Even the personal struggles of the heroine are disturbing due to the lack of freedom she has as a Victorian woman. In short, things have weight and reality to them, which I appreciate. To summarize, if you are looking for an enjoyable steampunk read, you can't go wrong with The Doomsday Vault. Plus it's the first in a series and I'm looking forward to spending more time with these characters and this world."}], "description": "In a clockwork Britannia, Alice's prospects are slim.
