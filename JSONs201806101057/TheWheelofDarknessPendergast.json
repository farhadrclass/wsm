So far, every book has been fun, suspenseful and entertaining. At times the books can creep you the fuck out! I mean, they can't all be 5 star books. Right?!\"Why did I give this a lower rating?I think the unbelievability with this plot was a bit much for me along with how Pendergast and Constance always got their way while on the Britannia. And to be honest, I think my mind is too damn dumb to understand the complexities of the Agozyen.It was still an interesting, powerful and fascinating Tibetan artifact. I liked the idea of it and wish I was smarter so I can figure out how to take over the world!I enjoyed the secondary characters, the premise of the plot and all the action.

However there are a few points that tie it back into the rest of the books that will be spoilers if you want to read them to.Pros:- Lots of suspense- Mystery and surprises at every turn- Characters you root for and characters you root against- Interesting settingCons:- Key plot points kind of confusing. After finishing, I am still not sure I understand some of it.- Some plot development was a little too convenient.\u00a0 I am not always a fan of the Deus Ex Machina - and it happened quite often here.Even with those couple of cons, still another strong Pendergast entry and I will continue to read this series!"}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "Following the horrors of their last adventure, Special Agent Pendergast knows his ward, Constance Greene, needs a breather, a trip to renew her physically and psychologically. What better place to renew and become mentally stronger than a Tibetan monastery? Although the monks don't normally admit women, Constance is special. She learns much from them during her time there. Then the monks discover that a dangerous artifact that has been in their keeping for centuries has been stolen. They ask Pendergast and Charlotte to get it back for them because in the wrong hands the artifact could destroy humanity. The duo find themselves on board a cruise liner, The Brittania, searching for the artifact. Unfortunately, the passenger who possesses the cursed item is already attempting to use its power. Will Pendergast be able to retrieve the artifact before its evil is released on all of humanity?Wheel of Darkness is the 8th novel in the Agent Pendergast series. I found this book to be a bit weaker than the others I've read so far. Still enjoyable.....but the story felt like a \"mop up'' of the prior Diogenes-centered storylines. But, I do have to mention that I listened to an abridged audiobook version of this story. I am not sure how much was gleaned out to shorten this book to just over six hours, but my guess is about half of the story was removed. So it could very probably be that I felt this was a weaker story because I didn't get to hear the entires story the way Preston & Child wrote it. I don't like abridged audiobooks, but in this case, it was the only option I had at my local library. I enjoyed Rene Auberjonois as narrator. He reads at a nice even pace, and I like the accent he uses for Pendergast. But I don't like the fact that so much of the story was removed. In a few places it was quite obvious that portions of the storyline were absent. Plotwise, I found the story interesting, and it was a bit of a departure from Pendergast's usual behavior. Although some of the differences were due to the effects of the artifact. The action being on a ship at sea made for some exciting suspense. I for one would not want to be in the middle of the ocean on a ship with a powerful and evil artifact causing mayhem onboard. That's a basic fear for a lot of people, I think. Being faced with danger and a possible excruciating, torturous death while stuck somewhere that prevents escape. You can't exactly jump off a cruise ship and swim for it. The setting really made this story a lot more creepy. For the most part, I enjoyed the book.....I just wish I had been able to get an unabridged version. I would rate this book 4 stars based solely on the story itself, but lowering to 3 stars for this particular audiobook version. Just too much was removed from the book....leaving some obvious holes in the action. Bleck. There are 15 books in the Pendergast series, with a new one scheduled for 2018. I already have the next audiobook on hold at the library (unabridged!!!!! yay!!!). I'm hoping to be caught up by the time the new book comes out!

Those that have never read the rest of the Pendergast series and those whose understanding of the rest of the Pendergast series is skin deep.This book is an insult to the rest of the series. I wonder if Preston and Child just got to the point where they said \"I bet we can write any piece of garbage and put our names on it and put the name Pendergast in it and people will still love it\"Anyway, you could easily have written this book and replaced all of the character names with other new characters and the book would be better off. It would still be pretty bad, but at least it wouldn't soil the rest of the series. Pendergast and Constance bear little resemblance to the characters in previous books anyway."}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22765690-terry", "userReview": "This book is a little different from the other Pendergast books in this series, but not to its detriment for me.

Many a thread are left untied with the conclusion of this book. In their past books they have treated the unknown with science and explanation, but here they delve way too deeply into the supernatural. The ending is remenicent of the deus ex machina endings of ancient Greek theatre. The authors build up the suspense, but then take the easy way out by having very improbable things happen. The hanging elements of the previous book are left out of the entire story until the last page of the epilogue, wherein they are treated very lightly. Hopefully the authors are not planning to try and squeeze another title out of this storyline because they really aren't going anywhere."}, {"userName": "J.K.

It's their superhero FBI agent at it once again, saving lost pieces of art, relics and outwitting everyone all while making you, the reader, feel like you need to go out and start buying Hugo Boss suits and driving around in vintage luxury cars. Actually, this book is a departure from the usual behavior of Agent Pendergast. He actually becomes a victim of sorts in this book and it's interesting to see Preston and Child trying to develop his character beyond the \"super-cop\" hero archetype. Or, maybe that is part of the archetype...guess I didn't pay enough attention in anthropology class.All in all it is an entertaining read. I finished it in a few days (give me a break I was on my way to Afghanistan when I read it...otherwise it would be a one or two day read) and of course it left me wanting Preston and Child to hurry up and finish their next Pendergast novel. Not the most sophisticated or demanding read, but definitely entertaining and Pendergast is such a great character that you can't help but want to spend more time at your local museum of natural history...or something."}, {"userName": "kartik narayanan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan", "userReview": "After the disappointing Diogenes trilogy, Agent Pendergast is back in a much better book. The story is set in Tibet & on an ocean liner which brings back the feeling of claustrophobia that existed in The Relic. In addition, Constance is now a much more involved character which brings that extra oomph that was missing. Not everything is great though. The ending is a deus ex machina. Plus, the plot point used here is quite similar to the plot point in The Book of the Dead.So, The Wheel of Darkness is a decent Agent Pendergast book but it palls in comparison to the first three in the series."}, {"userName": "J.S.

Their plots are interesting but we never really get to know the characters. Just who is Pendergast, and who is Constance? What are their motivations? Their hopes? Their dreams? Their fears? I gather from reading that Constance is immeasurably old but still looks very young, but I don't know what led to her longevity. These characters, as well as the \"supporting\" cast, seem paper-thin to me because they're really just a name and a face and not much else. These novels would be more entertaining if the characters were more fully fleshed, because it is very difficult to care about the fates of characters I know nothing about."}, {"userName": "ScottK", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234101-scottk", "userReview": "I love most of what these guys Douglass Preston and Lincoln Child write together.

Mystery novels are supposed to be a fun romp with a whodunit. But when you look at this book as compared to the rest of the series it belongs to, it becomes a bit worse. Nothing about The Wheel of Darkness added to the series. The plots drew from Titanic and Sherlock Holmes. And dare I say, the characters seemed to have different personalities.

But loads of disposable cruise passengers."}, {"userName": "Irrlicht", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2699929-irrlicht", "userReview": "Okay, this was a tough one. From what I\u2019ve read so far and in my own personal opinion, within Preston/Child\u2019s series about FBI agent extraordinaire Aloysius Pendergast the books are either very good (like, for example, Still Life With Crows) or not good at all (Relic). Interestingly enough, \u201cThe Wheel of Darkness\u201d was a bit in between. Maybe I should mention that I haven\u2019t read \u201cBrimstone\u201d, \u201cDance of Death\u201d or \u201cThe Book of the Dead\u201d up until now, so Constance was a new character for me, but I liked her well enough, even though I didn\u2019t know much of her background. Pendergast was his usual smart and witty self \u2013 and sometimes he wasn\u2019t, which I liked a lot. It added a nice twist to things and showed that even Aloysius Pendergast isn\u2019t all that perfect and can be thrown off track or maybe even turned. (Then again, of course he saved the day once more \u2013 with a bit of help from Constance \u2013 so, yeah, maybe still a bit too perfect.)The story largely took place on the \u201cBritannia\u201d, a huge cruise ship which is like a swimming city, and because of that the reader is introduced to a lot of supporting characters. Some of which were actually likeable. Also: even if the story progressed slowly, it managed to get quite thrilling on the last 100 or so pages. So far, so good. Unfortunately there were a lot of downsides, too. I think the setting was both a blessing and a curse. By being on a cruise ship, they had nowhere to \u201cgo\u201d. They couldn\u2019t involve any police at all (only the ship\u2019s security staff), they couldn\u2019t involve the usual and well-known characters like D\u2019Agosta and Hayward and \u2013 because of that \u2013 they had to introduce A LOT of new supporting characters.Which took time. A LOT of time. And due to the fact that \u2013 to me \u2013 most of those characters were completely unlikable or just killed off after just having been introduced, the book got incredibly boring in parts. There were two or three characters I really liked and would\u2019ve loved to read more about, but since there were so many others, those were neglected up until about the last quarter \u2013 and it really was a drag sometimes to actually get there. The case itself progressed so slowly that I almost lost interest. Plus, there were too many side stories that had nothing to do with the actual case. (Especially Pendergast catching the card counters. I\u2019m sorry, but that was just showing off and an unnecessary digression.)And then there was the \u201cspiritual\u201d part. For some reason I seem to attract storylines like that lately. \u201cRiver Marked\u201d and now \u201cThe Wheel of Darkness\u201d. I know that Pendergast spent a lot of time in a Tibetan monastery, learned some super-secret meditation-exercises, and ways to strengthen the body through the mind, ways to actually touch something with his mind, and whatnot. Fine. Either you deal with Aloysius Pendergast being a modern-day Sherlock Holmes with slight supernatural abilities and money to burn, or you don\u2019t. I did. I always do when reading Pendergast novels. But this case and its end were so\u2026 obscure, confusing and generally absurd that I just couldn\u2019t buy the comparatively simple solution. So\u2026 yeah. Not completely unreadable, but still boring in parts and very convoluted.2,5 stars \u2013 by the skin of its teeth."}, {"userName": "Lee Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15656602-lee-miller", "userReview": "The language is arch to the point of smugness, the situations are ridiculous, and the characters are absurd, but I couldn't put it down.

For long and long, it seemed Preston and Child wrote things that bordered on paranormal, but still had a logical explanation. They still held my interest because those things could be possible in our world. I love fantasy, I even write it, but not on Earth. For me, fantasy has to be on another realm--there is no magic here on earth. Ghosts, goblins, etc., all do not exist, and anything \"paranormal\" can be explained. And so, I went into this book thinking I would be treated to a rational solution and ending.Nope. Where I expected a full explanation, a solution that pointed to something logical, I was presented with a sentient mist.

I was uncomfortable through a good portion of the book since I felt a bit abandoned by certain things I had grown used to depending upon. I felt the book did a really great job putting me into this discomfort zone, which naturally increased a lot of the tension during the inevitable crisis situations.Many of the most prominent characters dealing with the problems that arose were new, and similar to events in the non-Pendergast book, The Ice Limit, much of the craziness took place at sea, and of course there was some sort of serial killer on the loose.Some people were seemingly going mad, and there were even rumors of a monster!Perhaps it really does all lead back to a hidden monastery in Tibet and an ancient curse."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5663034-k", "userReview": "This was...fine?

The paranormal aspects were kind of unnecessary and I think I would have preferred the story without them.
