The humor & antics2. NO love triangles3. No female angst4. No drama to keep the 3 couples apart5. The couples were able to get to know each other in real situations with out something messing it up6. The couples didn't try to fight the attraction and/or push each other away7. MOST IMPORTANTLY this book made me LAUGH and LAUGH and LAUGH and no crying whatsoever was involvedI couldn't put this book down, nor did I want to. Even when I tried to put it down for my book club I just couldn't do it. This book was a breath of fresh air. It had me literally in stitches laughing so much and at times so hard I had to put the book down to control myself. I realized that reading this book late at night in bed with the hubby sleeping wasn't wise as I couldn't control my laughter.This book is ultimately about 3 couples who, in their own circle, are best of friends. The women swear off men for 6 weeks as they are having bad luck dating. They make a wager that who ever holds out until New Years with out giving in to their set of rules with a man, wins the money in the pot to buy a killer pair of heels for their first New Years date and bragging rights. The men are fed up with finding or being hit on by barflies at the bar they bar tend at. They swear off women, otherwise known as barflies, at their place of work. They are looking for nice/good women to date, the kind they can take home to mom. They make a wager and the last man standing in their bet wins the the tip jar that they are putting all their tips in. Both sets of groups eventually meet and the fun begins once this happens. All of the pranks, antics, conversations/jokes, ex-loser bad date stories, funny ring tones on each others phones and the loopholes the men find to try to date these women with out the women realizing they are actually dating are pretty entertaining and funny. This book is told mainly from the POV's of Grace and Michael. Michael is swoon worthy ...Ryan can be as well. SIDE NOTE: The book starts off at a tad slow of a pace for a couple of chapters as we get to know each person in each group. DON'T be put off by this. This book will pick up and keep you smiling, laughing and pretty happy and definitely tear free."}, {"userName": "Kyndal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6122153-kyndal", "userReview": "This was really bad. Really, really bad. With the high rating, I thought it might be a cute book I could flip through easily. Wrong. First off, this is badly written. I kept thinking this must have been some kind of fanfic that got published because somebody was being nice the day this landed on their desk. Everything was just so sappy and unrealistic. Did the characters even have any faults? Every person is described as perfect: chiseled abs, amazing body, the opposite sex constantly hitting on them. It gets ridiculous! I kept thinking there has to be something the author is going to include to make me sympathize with the characters. No. Well...I think she tried. I really did. For some reason, Grace is incredibly self conscious even though she has an incredible body with killer curves. I mean how could you forget? Her friends reassure her of this every chapter. And there were moments when Grace would just suddenly burst into tears. In fact, this happened with every girl in the book. It was like the author thought 'Oh! This is a sad situation. Let me just put real quick here that all the girls had tears streaming down their cheeks and that should be good!' I just kept rolling my eyes at how contrived it all was. And the way the girls behave is completely annoying. There are too many examples to list but it was beyond unbelievable. Like they're thirteen and just had their first kiss. Ugh. For the love of God, do not waste your time on this book. It's horrible. I had to force myself to finish this. I am so glad I'm done with this garbage."}, {"userName": "Akanksha\u2764 S\u00f8ren\u2670", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6165339-akanksha-s-ren", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVED this book.

It's a bit juvenille. Well, it's infantile, but it's all in fun. This is definitely a YA book. Very young.It reminded me a little of Hanna Montana meets Sex and the City. If you like inuendo and blue balls, this might do it for you. Lots of tension and near misses. Way too many perfect coincidences for my taste.The first half was so painful for me, but I kept reading based on the reviews. The most redeeming part of this book is the bartender dance to the kid rock song \"So Hot.\" I loved it. The second star is for this part alone.So hot, I want to get you aloneSo hot, I want to get you stonedSo hot, I don't want to be friendsI want to fuck you like I'm never gonna see you againThe second half is better, but poor Michael really lays it on thick, making him not much better than any other creep, except she LUUUUVVVVS him.At least 5 typos. Folks, chocolate mousse is dessert, the desert is in Arizona! I ended up skipping all the meaningless detail and just read the dialogue to get thru it quicker,but I did finish it.There were a few funny lines, \"It's Okay, I like screaming sex with a bartender better than a regular old orgasm anyway.\"The moral of the story is that one out of three sluts is able to wait three weeks to sleep with her new boyfriend.So hot, I want to get you aloneSo hot, I want to get you stonedSo hot, I don't want to be friendsI want to fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again"}, {"userName": "Kellie Maddox-Ward", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309666-kellie-maddox-ward", "userReview": "If you are looking for a fun happy read look no further! Grace, Meg and Bianca (all 24) have been best friends for 4 years after meeting at College. They even live together. They are all unique with different personality\u2019s. . Their relationship was tight and you felt the love they have for each other, more like sisters than friends. They are also freakin hilarious! They were successful in their professional lives but not in their love life\u2019s. After another tragic date the girls save Grace from they come up with a Boycott. 6 weeks of these rules. They just have to last till the New year. The Boycott Rules  #1 -\tNo Dates # 2 - \tNo tongue kissing with boys. Closed lip kissing is fine. If a guy rams his tongue down your throat unexpectedly, it doesn\u2019t count, unless you kiss him back (AKA Bianca\u2019s rule) # 3 -\tNo Sex \u2026 of any kind. If you wouldn\u2019t want to see your parents do it, that counts as sex and it\u2019s off limits. # 4 - \tEach of us puts $200 into the pot. If you break the rules of the boycott you lose the money. The last person standing gets the money to spend on a hot pair of shoes to be worn on her first date of the New Year and gets eternal bragging rights about her superior will power.  Easy right? And who doesn\u2019t want a pair of Manolo Blahniks?? Well you would think it would be easy with the losers and dorks they have dated in the past. It all changes when they meet the very sexy, single and amazing Ryan, Michael and Jack. Michael, Ryan and Jack (all 26) have been best friends since forever, like the girls they are extremely close and tight, with different personalities but the ability to bag the shit out of each other and laugh about it. They are currently working as full time bartenders to learn the ropes so they can open their own. Working at a bar.. well that = Barflies\u2026 They are sick of dumb plastic girls. Of course they flirt to get a bigger tip but they are over playing around. So they come up with their own bet. The No Barflies Rules#1 -\tIf they meet a woman at the bar she is off limits. #2 - \tNo Sex. The last guy to have sex wins. They also put money into a kitty to make it a real wager. (Straight to the point these guys!)Now let the fun begin!! As these 6 people cross path\u2019s and start falling for each other. You will laugh your ass off!! There is the library, the football game, pizza, the bar (one scene the boys do a lot of cocktail flair tricks for the girls! OMG! they do it to Kid Rocks \u201cSo Hott\u201d < - seriously you tube that song!) , the girls house and the Xbox, the Gym, Christmas, snow storms, weird stalkers, playing pool and just other \u201crandom\u201d meetings that aren\u2019t dates! As they start to couple off Michael finds \u201cloopholes\u201d in the girls rules and even negotiates some new rules in there with Meg, so that he can spend more time with Grace. Including ONE no-holds-barred kiss.. with tongue.. one by one they start teaming up and trying to make the other couples cave so that they can be together. You just have to see how it all plays out! Ok so in all honestly this book was fluffy.. There was steam but only one real sex scene. A lot of sexual chemistry but due to the Boycott it didn\u2019t happen. So hence my wording \u201cfluffy\u201d. There was also nothing wrong with the boys or the girls. No deep inner \u201csomething\u201d that happened when they were younger, no father/mother issues etc. Well except for Grace\u2019s insecurity. Just a fun read. Bianca has long red hair, blue eyes, lush eyelashes, curvy body, and killer legs. She was also strong, sexy and in control. And throws a mean punch! Meg average in height, small framed, chocolate hair (but changed frequently) Deep blue eyes. was just\u2026 that girl that everyone likes! And also sexy and strong and shopping obsessed, as well as believed in the HEA all her life. Grace long black hair, average height, was insecure but hilarious! Michael oh wow Michael\u2026**daydreaming about Michael** Smart, popular, (gave the pizza place's number instead of his own if wasn't interested.) Deep blue eyes, dark brown messy hair. and a total sweetheart! Jack large frame, well defined muscles, playful big bro type. He was damn funny and perfect for Bianca. Ryan the strong silent type - a real gentleman and a self proclaimed romantic, long blonde hair and ice blue eyes, he was just beautiful. The boys weren\u2019t the usual book boyfriends I fall for. They weren\u2019t all Alpha male and Mine Mine Mine, but you still felt there jealousy and that their girls were theirs! I burst out laughing SOOO many times in this., So I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who believes in HEA and just wants to smile the whole time they read it. I\u2019m def going to check out Victoria Michaels other works! It\u2019s the kind of book I would love to watch as a Rom- Com Movie!! Fav Quotes:  A red Dot on a white canvas isn\u2019t a \u201crepresentation of a woman\u2019s struggle in a man dominated society,\u201d it\u2019s a red freakin circle!\u201d \u2013 Jack to the boys. \u201cI\u2019m going to my room to die now.

It was loads of laughs, humorous and downright awesome! Let the games begin! Grace,Meg,and Bianca, met in college and have known each other for four years and now are the best of friends, they're so close you could consider them sisters. I loved them to pieces! Their characters were snarky,full of enthusiasm and so much fun. The novel starts off with the girls going on lame dates and not finding the right man who aren't what the girls would call \"Dorks\" Lol!! Poor girls, their so full of life and so pretty, one would think they would've found the right guy by now. But the answer is, no they haven't. So they've decided to have a bet on not dating men till the New Year. The Boy-Cott Rules:  1.No Dates 2. No tongue kissing (snickers) 3.No sex of anything kind  4.Each of them puts $200 into a pot. If they break rules of the boycott, they lose the money.and the last person standing gets the money to spend on a hot new pair of shoes to be worn on her first date of the new year and gets eternal bragging rights about her superior will power.Their bet isn't as easy as they think. They have one challenge coming their way that they would have never expected..... So much fun!Michael,Jack and Ryan, met also in college, as they finished their degrees in management. They've known one another for years. They now want to learn the ropes on bar-tending on hopes of pursing and opening up their very own nightclub. Here's the challenge they're all in,they're in their early twenty's but haven't found the love of their life yet, and are tired of dating woman who flirt with them on a daily basis in the bar they work at. Their looking for woman with intelligence,smarts and still have a corky fun side. So what the guys would call \"Barflies\" (woman from the bar) don't quite fit in their description. They're determined to go searching for that one woman who would win them over. In the meantime they also set a bet that goes into effect immediately.NO MORE BARFLIES! Rules: 1.No barflies, if they meet a woman from the bar, she's off limits 2.No sex, the last person standing wins the money.(Yeesh!) Their rules are much simple,compare to the girls....) OMD!!! Let me just say! I don't blame these Barflies for swooning over them. They are so damn hot! *sweaty palms and naughty dreams* Lol!! Gosh I can't put the picture of them out of my head! They too are, Snarky,Sexy (in all areas) and no filters going on for either of them,they're so funny! My dream men *dazes off* I love their relationship and how close they are. Total knockouts!Grace,Meg and Bianca are the outgoing, witty girls and everything the guys are looking for. The guys sweep them off their feet. BUT!! (and that's a huge But..) with the ladies and guys making bets, it makes it harder for them to keep things simple and clean, they're all in with wanting to win the bets. At this stage it's couples against couples. Who will win? Read it and find out! *squeals*I love their interactions and relationships. Theirs no secrets and lies to worry about, it's all in love and fun. I sat back waiting for something to back fire or the usual gut-wrenching scenes. They never came and I was beyond grateful! This novel speaks for itself. In all honesty I'm on a hunt for other similar books. I'm a \"Hook, line and sinker\" kind of gal! This author got me good. I can't express how much I loved it. But hope someone would jump on my happy boat and join me, it's guaranteed to make you laugh,cry and swoon even after you're done with the novel :)"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11971939-jamie", "userReview": "Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet !!\nThis was a really cute and fun story... one of those thats so sweet it will give you a toothache ....There is NO ANGST, NO DRAMA, NO SADNESS, NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS, NO EX'S.

But I just can't help for this one. The reason why I started reading this book is because, you know in Goodreads there is a section 'People who like this book also like...' (the column on the right side. See that? Nah.) When I finished Wallbanger and had written the review, I peeked at the right column, saw this book, clicked the title and WHOAAA..!! Its rating is four point something. This must be good!The first pages were really okay. Funny and hilarious. I started to believe this book would be another Wallbanger. But later on, it was getting so painful for me--but I kept reading because of the reviews (FOUR FREAKIN POINT SOMETHING MUST NOT LIE TO ME. IT WONT! IT. JUST. WONT.) Just when I thought anything could be better: Wrong. Badly written, everything just cheesy, sappy and unrealistic. The characters (ALL OF THEM! I repeat: ALL OF THEM) seemed very flawless, too perfect, and you wont find people like this in the real life. Maybe one or two, BUT NOT SIX OF THEM!! The characters also very, very childish, annoying and (again) unrealistic.Too many coincidence, too many unnecessary scenes, too many repeated things.Seriously, do not waste your time on this book. It's horrible. If it was not because I had completed (almost) half of the book, I wouldn't continue to read it. Even I had to force myself to finish this. Save your precious time by skipping this book is the best advice that I can give you."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222084-maggie", "userReview": "I know, like, 50 Koreans and 3 of them are named Grace Park. Seriously. So when I read the summary of this book, I got super excited. An Asian-American lead! In a book that has nothing to do with Kim Jong-Il, the Korean War, or karate! Well, you know what they say about people who assume.No, no, there's no mention of the Dear Leader, the war, or ninjas -- but there's no mention of any Asians either. Grace Park could easily be Grace Smith and the author wouldn't have to change anything in the story. This was a disappointment to say the least because there was no other draw to this story for me. The plot about three female roommates who decide to boycott men after some horrendous dates isn't particularly unique or noteworthy. The three perfect men they meet, bartenders of course, aren't special either.Still, I'm a sucker for a good romantic comedy so not all was lost. I got over my disappointment and settled in for some light reading. There's a scene early on where the guys, who are sick of only attracting drunken barflies at work, decide to head to the library to meet \"nice girls.\" I think there was a Saved by the Bell episode with the same premise, but hey, I liked Zack Morris back in the day. That's where the guys meet Grace, who is helping her librarian friend reshelve books. One of the guys is dared to ask Grace where the Playboys are. Poor Screech. Thus begins a series of coincidental encounters where Grace and her friends meet Zack, Slater, and co.After about the 5th encounter, I noticed that I wasn't even halfway through my Kindle book. I checked online and saw that it was FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY-TWO pages. Now, unless one of the characters is a dragon or a unicorn, there is NO reason for a romance to be 400+ pages. It reminded me of an episode of Sports Night where Jeremy has to cut his first highlights package for a game. He asks Casey to look over his work and Casey tells him -- after watching 8.5 minutes of clips that should've been 30 seconds -- \"Make it shorter.\"Jeremy: \"I don't know what to do.\"Casey: \"Make it shorter.\"Jeremy: \"I've tried everything!\"Casey: \"You should try making it shorter.\"Jeremy: \"I can't imagine what I'd cut.\" This is the conversation Victoria Michaels should've had with her editor. Apparently, this book started out on a fan fiction website? I'm not biased against self-published books, hello Angelfall!, but this could've benefitted from tighter editing. Had this book been 200 pages less, I probably would've given it 4 stars. It's cute and cotton candy fluffy, but 422 pages of \"I love you!\" made me want someone to die.

I felt as if I was reading a junior high schooler's novel and there was no bond between the story and author. It seemed as if she just threw up her thoughts on paper and didn't put time and care into making it presentable. The plot was ridiculously impossible, and I literally laughed at the absurdity of how perfect everything seemed to work out. No wonder this book is fiction; it could literally never happen in reality. Not even close. With that all said, I actually enjoyed it. After the first few chapters, I lowered my expectations and realized I wasn't reading the book for its writing. I was reading it for its ridiculous, absurd plot. It was nice to step into a world where everything worked out unbelievably well and there were no conflicts or problems. Everyone was always happy and perfect. The entire world just seemed to be perfect, and being as far from reality as that is, it was nice to experience from time to time. Easy read that is merely for the beach or just destressing and stepping into a dimension where anything is possible, every dream is achieved, and no one is unhappy. Ever.

Either that, or all of the readers are 14 and this is the life they dream about. The entire premise is based on which girl can avoid a date/sex with some guy they met less than a month ago. No...really. That's the big bet. The prize is a pair of shoes. A nice pair of shoes, but shoes nonetheless. Really? The down times (between all the sexual angst and frat boy hijinks) are spent sharing intimate details (usually while huddled together in panties and a t-shirt) punctuated with a lot of screaming. In my head, it sounds like a bad roller coaster ride full of junior high girls. Maybe it's because I'm old and mildly grown, but I'm going to A)Buy whatever shoes I want and B)Shag whenever I want and C)NOT \"squeal in delight\" with anyone about either. Who does that? Bleh.

Boycotts and Barflies has got to be one of the sweetest and cutest reads I ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It has such a wonderful playful energy feel to it and the characters are so feisty and fiery. Crisp with wit and banter these characters will comically amuse you to sheer entertainment long after the story is done.Charged with steamy sexual tension that you could cut with a knife makes the plot thicken with rich deliciousness.A wonderfully flirtatious story that asks you what you would do to find true love.

I wanted to love this book, especially after reading the description. I'm a HUGE chick-lit fan and enjoy 95% of the books I do read. However, while reading Boycotts & Barflies, I felt like I was a reading a slightly-less smutty romance novel, not chick-lit. The whole thing was just so cheesy...I was waiting for the phrase sheath to be used. About a third of the way through the book, I started rolling my eyes at the physical descriptions of the characters. They just kept happening over and over again about the same characters. Look, I get it! Michael has a nice body and Bianca has long red hair. Noted. I also could not have much sympathy for a 24 year old who couldn't find a man. And the twist at the end? Not sure of the point. At all. I will say that some of the situations the characters found themselves in definitely tipped the humor scale (the library scene and some of the moments in the bar). Unfortunately, they weren't enough to warrant recommending this for a beach read if you are looking for chick-lit.

We follow three girls who make a bet to boycott men (to win a pair of expensive shows and bragging rights) then fall in love with three men who\u2019ve sworn off cheap girls. The entire \u201cconflict\u201d, if you can even call it that, is the prohibition of sex with guys you\u2019re supposedly already in love with because you want to win the stupid bet! That\u2019s it!! There is nothing else and it\u2019s quite frustrating when you have this girl trying to thoroughly convince you about how much she loves this guy she just met a few days ago but it\u2019s not enough of a love to give up a dumb pair of shoes for. It\u2019s annoying and it makes no sense for adults to consent to something like that for more than 400 pages!! There are things that when they are in the format of a fanfiction, you can forgive. Why? Because you get one chapter a week, so the tension and the interest builds over time. When you have it all together in one book, there is no anticipation! Everyone can tell what\u2019s going to happen and the whole time you sit there thinking, when are these idiots going to get their shit together? I\u2019m going to be sharing a discussion inspired by this book and fanfictions later this month because I was so frustrated the entire time I read this. The whole thing was super cheesy and boring and filled to the brim with constant cliches. Halfway through, I started skimming because there was nothing happening except the day to day activities of these characters that meant absolutely nothing to me because there was no depth! Too many pages dedicated to a book with a pointless plot and a conflict which could\u2019ve easily been resolved in a moment.Grace is Bella Swan, there is literally no other way to describe this girl. She\u2019s shy, quiet, completely insecure and has the lowest self esteem ever. IT WAS SO ANNOYING! I don\u2019t care for a girl who spends time overly describing how gorgeous her friends are and how plain and ugly she is. I have no patience for this! But then everyone else in the world find her beautiful too. I wanted to gouge my eyes out, seriously! There was supposed to be growth and strength in her personality but there was nothing! All she realized was that she needed the love of a man to feel good about herself. AND THAT\u2019S NOT TRUE! It\u2019s so infuriating because the kind of messages this book is sending about women and their personalities is awful!The side characters were literally just a repeat of all the Cullen siblings. Way too perfect and honestly, a little condescending. They treat Grace like a porcelain child who must not be bothered or disturbed but at the same time, want her to feel better about herself and be more secure. But not in an encouraging way no, by lying to her! Almost the entire time they were having these problems about the bet, the only people in it were Grace and Michael (who is like Edward personified by the way). All the other four side characters, yes you know who they are no need to tell you their names for this book, were getting together and making the biggest deal about the smallest things.It\u2019s so frustrating to find these kinds of books that basically give a bad name to published fanfictions. There\u2019s a lot of great talent involved in fanfiction communities who put their effort into creating great works with someone else\u2019s characters but also in developing those works beyond what they began. And these examples, as well as Fifty Shades of Grey in my opinion, just basically combine all their chapters and call it a book. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to go. You have to adjust a lot more than just character names and places to create something that\u2019s original. So please, don\u2019t read this and if you do, don\u2019t think this is the best fanfiction authors who are being published have to offer.

They are fun, caring and loyal girlfriends. I want to sit on the couch, eat popcorn and watch a movie with them. You can\u2019t help but love these girls.

These yummy bachelors perform sexy bar tricks, cruise the library for \u201csuitable\u201d women, and share a fake girlfriend (she keeps the barflies away).Boycotts & Barflies doesn\u2019t really have a major conflict. There are some conflicts throughout the novel, but there is no big turning point. (At least I didn\u2019t think so.) This was different from other novels I have read in the past, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s just a fun book all around, and the minor kinks are addressed throughout the novel.Also, it\u2019s not very practical that the same group of people would run into each other on several accounts or that both groups of friends would make similar bets at the same time, but that didn\u2019t stop me from ravishing/adoring/loving this novel.

As murphy's law gets in the way of a lot of things in life they meet the guys of their dreams. 3 friends Michael, Ryan and Jack (Michael is my favourite here) are fed up of dating bimbos and barflies (all 3 of them are bartenders) so they decide that they need to broaden their horizons. Do they head off to the library this is where the fun begins. Unfortunately Jack isn't the sharpest knife in the draw so when they first meet Grace in the library it is a hoot. One scenario leads to another and each one falls madly in love. The best part for me is when Grace tells her Mum that she is taking a break from men and her Mum automatically assumes that she now likes women so Grace plays along. When Grace goes back home for Christmas she then meets surprise Michael who is the son of one of Grace's Mums friend and apparently he is gay!And the thing that touched me the most was when Liz - Michael's Mum gave her the picture of the both of them sleeping together on the couch as grown ups and as toddlers."}, {"userName": "Swaleha Ahmed", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15737091-swaleha-ahmed", "userReview": "I was very excited when I started this book, hopeful that this is going to be amazing from all the reviews I went through before starting this but I'm not going to even rate this book. I'm a huge sucker for good chick-lit romance and this just wasn't it for me. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the amazing romances I've read, written by amazing authors or maybe this was soI waited, with every page that I read, that this story is going to get interesting somewhere but it just disappointed me. Being cursed with the habit of being unable to leave the book before I finish it, these past few hours have been hell for me. This is a story of 3 girl- Grace, Meg and Bianca, all 24, who became bestfriends in college. The main heroine, Grace, is suffering from insecurities which leads her to date the most dorkiest guys around. One day, after all of them have had horrible dates, they decide to boycott boys until New Years, which is in six weeks and to keep them motivated they make a bet after which they will get the sexiest pair of shoes from the 200 dollars each of them has put in and eternal bragging rights. On the other side, 3 guys- Michael, Ryan and Jack, who also met in college and are 26 ( I think they are, I didn't bother remembering), are sick of dumb girls that they call barflies and have decided to not date anyone who they have met at the bar. One of them even suggests they go to the local library, since his mother had told him there's where the good girls are. This is where Micheal, who is also the lead hero, and the other two bump into Grace. From there, their story progresses as the remaining two guys bump into the other two girls in unexpected places and end up going to the same movie and later dinner as friends. The guys do their best in sweeping the girls off of their feet while the girls try to resist them and wait until the New Year. The stakes have been increased after the girls put in 200 more to keep them on track. The girls have fallen in love with the guys by now and they have admitted their feelings to their guys except for Grace and Michael. Then Grace and Meg go to her mother's house, who is forever trying to set her up with random guys, to spend Christmas as the guys go off the grid when Michael's mother calls them home because of the broken water pipes at their house. As it turns out, Michael's mother was actually Grace's mother old college friend hence proving to Grace and her friends that Michael and Grace are meant to be. Bianca who is not with the girls, turns out is out of the bet because she had caved in and had Jack over at their house. Long story short, Grace wins the bet after she finds out just before New Years as she gives in to temptation and decides that she is out of the bet, that she won because it was Meg who was the first one of them to give in. End of the story is that all of them now have their happily ever afters and are happy. Without any drama, or competitions, or any drives-you-insane-romance. This was too YA and honestly I wouldn't recommend any one to read it. It felt like I was reading about 16 year olds figuring out love for the first time. I so need to start a good romance to wash away this one. P.s. This is just my opinion. Nobody should decided how horrible the book is or get offended based on this."}, {"userName": "Literati Literature Lovers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13992137-literati-literature-lovers", "userReview": "What can I say about Boycotts & Barflies?

It got me grinning and laughing like an idiot at times. It had humor, cheesiness, enough romance and a good plot to make it a entertaining book. However, the more I read it, the more I questioned my opinions of the book.  Let's talk about the storyline. There were too many coincidences in the way they all met. I mean the chance of you and your two best girlfriends meet and fall in love with three gorgeous and absolutely flawless guys who also happen to be best buddies is close to zero. Portland is definitely a small city if they happen to just bump into each other at the gym, movie theater, the mall,... all the freaking time. No doubt the book was sweet, but I can't help to be bored not even after half of the book. The humor dried quickly and the flirting between the characters was just too sappy after a while. Also, there wasn't any climax to keep things interesting. The characters were practically falling flat for each other about a hundred pages in. And the characters??! Are they even humans? It was like reading my ultimate fantasy. All of them were beautiful, attractive, sexy as hell and basically perfect. \"It wasn't very realistic\" is probably an understatement. But I have to give the credit for the author for at least attempted to make things relatable and created Grace as a person with self esteem problem. However, if I were her, I wouldn't have such issue because I had an incredible body with curves , assurance from my best friends that I was hot and a guy who constantly called me beautiful. I don't think the author deliberately portrayed the characters like that but they are extremely immature to me. Please, someone please tell me that most 24-year-old don't actually think like that and they don't do stupid things like restraining their feelings to someone just because of some designer shoes. But again if I were in this situation, I would cheat anyway because it is too easy.

I was told that this book would be just as funny and it most certainly was! I love reading romance and when there\u2019s humor added to the mix, well that\u2019s just icing on the cake.What I Liked: The relationships were well established, both between the friends and between the couples, with the limelight shining Grace and Michael. Grace, Bianca and Meg are best friends from college and are close like sisters. They are always there for each other in a time of need, like when Grace needs an \u201cemergency phone call\u201d as an escape route during a bad date. The girls are tired of dating losers. They find themselves in a dating slump so they decide a boycott from dating would be best. And to make things a little more interesting, each puts $200 in the pot; Last woman standing gets the money to buy a hot pair of shoes and eternal bragging rights.Michael, Jack and Ryan have been friends since college and all tend bar at a local nightclub. They meet and date lots of beautiful, but boring, women at work but none of them ever turn into relationships. They\u2019re tired of the escapades going nowhere, they want something more, thus a bet ensues. No more barflies; if they meet the girls at the bar, they\u2019re off limits. Last guy to have sex wins the money in the pot.Then the girls meet the guys and things get interesting from there.I wanted to know who was going to lose the bet and how. The outcome was not what I expected in that there was more to the story than the reader is originally thought to believe. And boy, was there temptation! The girls weren\u2019t allowed to even kiss a guy (except once or twice) per the boycott rules so the foundation for Grace and Michael\u2019s relationship clearly wasn\u2019t sex.Boycotts & Barflies definitely had its funny moments. This book was laugh out loud hilarious.\nNot missing a beat, Bianca continued with her story. \u201cI turned around and said \u2018What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 and he gave some lame excuse about not trying to grab my ass, he was trying to grab his wiener. Can you believe it?\u201d\nI love the analogy Meg uses when she tries to justify ordering a certain bartender from the waitress while on their \u201cboycott\u201d:\n\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in just window shopping. It\u2019s like visiting the puppies at the pet store. You go and look at them, and they\u2019re so cute, they make you smile. They get all excited to see you and they lick your hands and face, then you go home without one. I just wanted to look at the puppy. Is that so wrong?\u201d she asked with her best pouty face.\nWhat I Didn\u2019t Like: I found it a little too convenient that the 3 girls hooked up with the 3 guy friends. It was too perfect and too matchy-matchy. There were also too many chance meetings between the guys and the girls, it sort of felt forced. The part with the stalker guy at the hotel felt out of place. It didn\u2019t add anything to the overall story for me so I could have done without it.Overall Impression: Boycotts & Barflies will have you laughing your socks off. The writing style caught my attention right from the start. It was a fast, fun read and I definitely want to read more by this author. The book\u2019s hilarious moments and romantic chemistry will definitely appeal to fans of The Redhead series, though it\u2019s less on steamy love scenes and more focused on the actual relationship itself. This book was a tease most of the way but in the end, I got my sweet reward."}, {"userName": "Susan (susayq ~)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5305480-susan-susayq", "userReview": "I don't know how I missed writing a review for this.

This was not Michael, yet I found myself falling for him.The one problem I had with this story was the way the bet ended. Grace had officially won the bet well before Christmas but no one told her. Meg lied about still being in the bet so that Grace would have time to realize her feelings for Michael were true and they could be together. Grace was hurt at being lied to and manipulated and then in the next breath she was all smiles and ready to go on her first official date. I didn't expect that from Grace. I expected it from Bella when this was fanfiction cause we all know Bella is a bit of a push over. I didn't get that Grace was a push over. Yes, Grace was a little reserved and unsure of herself, but I never thought that she'd just let people make decisions for her and she'd go along with whatever and be ok with it.All in all, a great read that had a wonderful swoon worthy guy and had me laughing in spots.
