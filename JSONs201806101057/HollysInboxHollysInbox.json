Another hilarious and funny one that I finished reading is Holly's Inbox by Holly Denham. So if you're feeling gloomy these days, this book is surely going to lift your mood up and will certainly make you feel happier and lighter. But one disadvantage, this book is way too long, more than 700 pages, and on the positive note, it's written in an e-mail form, so it's quite easier and faster to read than any other 700 pages books. I finished reading this one, just in few hours!!This book is about Holly Denham, a receptionist, who managed to get her job in an investment firm in London, by embellishing her C.V. Her whole life is shown in her inbox, how she makes new friends in the firm, how she keeps in touch with her old ones and her old life, and how she keep up with her completely mad family, seriously each and every one is a total nut.Well I never got to know how Holly looks like, but I do got to know her personality through these e-mails and trust me you'll love her. And as reviewed by the \"Entertainment Weekly\" that this is next Bridget Jones. Read this one and find it for yourself, because once you started the book, it's really hard to put it down."}, {"userName": "Wallace", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2414546-wallace", "userReview": "Type: {Beach Read: fluffy, mindless, easy to read}Rating: {An Unputdownable: Couldn\u2019t eat or sleep until I finished this book}Why You\u2019re Reading It:You love British Chick-LitYou need a vacation from heavier booksYou need a good book to read by the poolFunny, light, entertaining stories with a good splash of romance charm youWhat I Thought:I read and loved Holly\u2019s Inbox by Holly Denham. I ate it up. Swallowed it whole. It is 665 pages and I downed it. It\u2019s that good. And it\u2019s written in e-mail form, so it goes faster than other books. (Be sure to click the link about Holly Denham, but maybe after you read? You don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise about the author until you\u2019ve started reading and can understand the irony. Let me know what you think\u2026I was impressed.)This book is from the UK\u2013published three years ago, and was only recently published in the United States. It popped out of the table at me in my Barnes and Noble. I went to pick it up, thinking it was a thin, chick-lit novel\u2026it is a brick. I almost dropped it because I wasn\u2019t prepared, and I was laughing (out loud, by myself). I knew I had to have it; a thicker than thick, total chick-lit, British novel\u2014SOLD! Did I mention it had a recommendation by OK! Magazine on the front cover (that\u2019s the British version of US Weekly only better)? It was exactly the kind of light read I was looking for to get me through the end of the \u201cyear\u201d (the beginning and end of the school year\u2014ok, and all the times right before a vacation, too\u2014are mad\u2026completely exhausting and stressful) last year as I was ending my last teaching job.Can I tell you how fun this book was to read. First, it\u2019s always fun to read e-mails and letters (who doesn\u2019t like getting letters? And who doesn\u2019t remember The Jolly Postman and how fun that book was?) So 665 pages of e-mails, that you don\u2019t have to worry about answering, is spellbinding. Not to mention that Holly is very Bridget Jones-esque, yet not quite so incompetent. (Note here: I love Bridget Jones, and most other of the British chick-lit books\u2026isn\u2019t there just something delicious about the way British authors write?) It\u2019s got the ridiculous aspects, but is also relatable\u2026which is why this genre is so successful.For the first few hundred pages I was reading it because it was fun and entertaining. For the last couple hundred I was reading because I couldn\u2019t put it down and wanted to know what happened next! It was kind of like eating guacamole; although there isn\u2019t that much nutritious value, you just can\u2019t stop eating!Tastes. So. Good.Even though I could feel the stack of papers in my right hand getting smaller as I approached the end, I was still shocked when I got to the last page. No! It can\u2019t be over! Luckily there is a sequel that is now available in the US (ahem, some of us had to order it from the UK last year because we couldn\u2019t wait\u2026 I won\u2019t tell you who though)."}, {"userName": "Odette Knappers", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35775020-odette-knappers", "userReview": "This book was SO MUCH FUN to read! Love it, and so glad there is a second book! This is book is for lovers over Bridget Jones, it has a bit of that feel.This whole book is only her e-mails. This would not be interesting nowadays, but this book is 9 years old. it is from the time we used e-mails to chat, in stead of WhatsApp or Facebook or whatever. Nowadays, this book would be her WhatsApp. So, you get all her chatting with her colleague, friends and family. And she chats a lot.You do know everything that happens in her life, because if something happened over the weekend, she tells her friends or colleague about it, so you are not missing a single thing. Sometimes this is a bit forces, but only a couple of times, and that does not bother you in those 700+ pages of email!

I've added a new shelf to my library to fit books like this and calling it \"IT\" Chick Lit to encompass all the chick lit novels written in email format. With a tagline like 'ever wanted to peak inside someone else's email?', readers know you're in for gossip and a good time and Holly's Inbox does not disappoint! At 672 pages, Holly Denham's debut novel may seem a bit overwhelming but with the email format and quick pace, this novel is literally a breeze, fit to be finished in just one weekend. The drama, the chaos and the complicated characters are too funny; you'll be guessing til the end what everyone's big secrets are, and being privy to their confidential email proves to be just the way to unveil everything about each of them that you might not otherwise have known. From office affairs, to long, mysterious lunches, to evil and bitchy coworkers and kooky family members, there's an email for everyone. The only thing that seemed a little \"too\" fictionalized for me was the lack of MIS Dept involvement in the emails back and forth. I think in any company post-Y2K, computer departments everywhere monitor incoming and outgoing emails of their staff with consequences for inappropriate communications; but I know there would be no story (at least not a juicy one) without the full and raunchy emails!

It was just 'okay'. Too many pages, too many unnecessary emails and too much going on. In my opinion this book could have been over in half the pages. The book started off great but gradually began to falter as I quickly realised I found the characters confusing and the constant changing between email contacts made me feel really disengaged with the story, having to keep checking who was who. I really wanted to love this book, but I really couldn't; I actually skipped more than I read. It just didn't hold my interest.

I was quite surprised to learn my library owned a copy and was first on the wait list. I couldn't wait to begin reading Holly's e-mails.I was looking forward to reading this as I read so many glowing reviews. I have to admit, around page 200 or so, I lost interest in Holly and her friends. I really wanted to know Holly's back-story with Toby. It took awhile for Holly to disclose to Trisha, her co-worker.I do have to say, the secondary characters were quite interesting and added to the story. Around page 415 (the reader was able to peek inside Trisha's inbox), I found myself glued to the story and couldn't put it down.Yes, it's a long book (665 pages of e-mails), but worth reading on a lazy afternoon.

She works as a receptionist for a big firm in London, despite the fact she has little experience. Her entire life is conducted through her inbox, offering an insight not many books are able to pull off. As she navigates her new waters, making new friends, getting back in touch with old ones, we get to see what it\u2019s really like to work for a big firm. Throw in a couple of secrets Holly\u2019s keeping and life is about to get a lot more interesting as they threaten to be let out.I think that if you haven\u2019t already met Holly, my fellow Chick Lit fans, then I think you really should. Only, it has to be said, if you\u2019re a fan of books told entirely via email. The book came to life after the success of the website http://www.hollysinbox.com which is set up like a real email inbox, honestly, it\u2019s brilliant and you can actually read the entire book on the site. At least I think you can, so please don\u2019t hold it against me if you can\u2019t. The book is fiction, and it was revealed a while back that the author is actually Bill Hutton-Surie, but never fear the book is based on Bill\u2019s own experience.Now, dear readers, I know what you\u2019re thinking: How are you supposed to get to know a character through emails? For me, that\u2019s easy because you can learn a lot about a character not only through their own emails but through that of their friends. So although I didn\u2019t know what Holly looked like, I was able to know her through the emails she sent and through her friends and family. Along with Holly we also meet her two best friends Aisha and Jason, along with Holly\u2019s completely madcap family and believe me, they are utter nutters, Holly\u2019s family.Holly\u2019s Inbox is a book you should be reading \u2013 or a website you should be visiting, there\u2019s no doubt about that. I fell in love with her, and you will as well. The book is an absolutely mammoth 700 pages but don\u2019t let that fool you, the pages whizz by so fast you\u2019ll barely believe the speed with which you finish the book. I started reading it and the next time I checked my page count I was 100 pages in. I like it when a book can capture you so easily and I\u2019ll be buying the sequel there\u2019s no doubt about it. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing still reading my email to you, readers, you should be buying this book immediately.Love Leah xxxPS: If you\u2019re looking to buy me a present for bringing you this brilliant book, I like more books! Thanks!"}, {"userName": "Becky R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1836567-becky-r", "userReview": "As a fan of books such as Bridget Jones Diary, Meg Cabot's The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl, I had already read a variety of books that use the email, or epistolary format in telling the story. While I like the playful way that this style shows the development of a relationship, there does seem to be some advantage to the author jumping in from time to time to guide the story. In the case of Holly's Inbox, all we get for the story comes directly from emails. Over half of the novel (which although is made up of short emails, is still over 300 pages) is spent developing our idea of who Holly is, as well as the characters in her life such as her best friends who work at a hotel there in London, her parents who now live in Spain along with her grandmother, and her cohort at work who although sits next to her, spends her day emailing Holly and checking in. This set up of the basic plot and characters is amusing, but left me wishing for the bulk of the story that I was sure was to come.By the second half of the novel, a portion of the conflict has been revealed, and Holly is left to deal with what appears to be a messy social life, and a \"friend\" from her past who she refuses to speak to. We soon find out that this friend played a major role in her life, but not until the last moments of the book. It was during these last moments that I really got into the novel and wished I'd had more information.I can't say that I disliked Holly's Inbox, as I had to keep reading to know what happened, but I did feel like I'd seen this technique before and like it when the author breaks out of the all email format to include some narration. For chick lit, this novel was fun to read and had me entertained. It's not hearty reading, but a fun time if you can hang in there and wait for the main action."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3043110-stephanie", "userReview": "Holly is a new receptionist at a huge, bustling bank. She\u2019s totally lost and in over her head, but things start looking up when she makes friends with some of her coworkers, finds old friends there, and even starts dating a handsome VP. Mixed in with e-mails with all of them are messages with her crazy family and best friends, a gay man and a\u2026 \u201cpromiscuous\u201d girl. Soon, though, things begin falling apart for Holly at her new job when she gets dumped, gets back-stabbed, and an old flame joins the company, revealing her secret past and heartbreaks.I thought this book was slow to start. In fact, about 200 pages in, I set it aside to read another book that needed to be returned. Then, I picked it back up after I finished the other book and it got SO good. At first, it was just back and forth e-mails without much going on, then about halfway through, it really picked up! Lots of stuff went down and I was dying to know what would happen. Catty friends, crazy fun friends, handsome backstabbers, secret pasts\u2026 it had it all!The book is around 700 pages, BUUUUT, it\u2019s all written in e-mail form so it\u2019s quite a quick read. A lot of the e-mails are really short, and I wish some of them had actually been a bit longer, but overall, the book flies by. Holly and her friends were really likable and entertaining, while the couple of backstabbers were completely dreadful and made me SO angry. I think this book portrayed a variety of different relationships realistically, like with her grandmother and parents, and I liked that aspect a lot.Overall, fun brit chick-lit!

If you're looking for some light reading, this is your book. I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled at first, and I still find some parts a bit problematic, but the characters grew on me, and the book flows really well. I love epistolary books, so this one was right up my alley. I loved getting to know the characters through their emails, and all the snark definitely improved my reading experience. There's one character who's just a B from Apartment 23, and I would have liked to understand WHY she was being so mean and ridiculous. There were also some things left unresolved (one of which worries me quite a bit), and the ending didn't quite convince me. Also, I have absolutely no idea what the point of Pregnant Pam's character was as she has no relevance to the story other than to randomly pop up to torture the reader with images of puke and ducks. Don't ask.Favorite characters:- Holly's grandma: she's hilarious and I love how Holly is always kind to her, even when she signs her up for spam emails- Jason: he's Holly's friend who's really snarky, but mainly what I like about him is that he's just genuinely a really good friend - Trish: she's Holly's co-worker and gives her a hard time at the beginning, but turns out to be awesome- Shella: her character makes zero sense to me, and I want explanations, but she also sent that one awesome emailEverything else I have to say would include spoilers, so I'll leave it at that."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Ray", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11564097-elizabeth-ray", "userReview": "I was really excited to read this book, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. This book was about Holly, who started a new job at a finance/banking company and it's a look at her inbox at this new job. I love books in the format of emails back and forth, but this book had more gaps and things you had to \"fill in\" for yourself between emails than most others I have read in this format. There was also a lot you didn't find out about the main character until halfway or even further in the book. It totally changed your perspective of her and I'm not sure how I feel about these things being revealed SO very late. Because of this revealing taking so long, it felt like the romance was squeezed in at the very end, instead of having the reader spend the majority of the book hoping they would get together and letting that suspense build. There were also some problems about minor characters at the end of the book (I.e. Aisha) that were not resolved by the end of the book, so on a whole, it ended rather abruptly. I do realize there's a sequel and maybe that's why? Even though this book looks huge, it's a really quick read and I did enjoy the format. I also enjoyed the personalities of some of her friends/ secondary characters. I would read the sequel because of these reasons and am giving it 3 stars.
