Jameson and his team rush into CentCom to try to take control of the situation while Rebecca's group try to get there safely. Juice is trapped onshore while his teammates battle Spetsnaz in the air and under water, and a bioterrorist is working on a way to redeem himself by destroying the zombies.Juice resorts to a desperate solution to try and gain partial victory over the Spetsnaz forces, and get the warehouse secured as the zombie horde closes in. His team are retreating back to the dock to return to the JFK and it seems that help will not be coming for him. Homer is proven right when he finds mines on the hull of the JFK and is suddenly involved in a deadly underwater knife fight with enemies testing all of his skills. Ali's helo races to get to the downed pilot but comes under fire from a sniper in the Russian helo. She is furious to be coming out second best and her panicking crew are not allowing her to kill the sniper, allowing the Russians to grab the pilot.On the JFK Abrams and Campbell become increasingly frustrated by Drake's decision making as he tries to hide the fact that he is now seeing dead people around him. As his sanity wavers, he is refusing to listen to anyone as they try to take control from him, and his decisions are putting everyone at risk.Jameson's group hear the outbreak sirens and rush into CentCom to try and take control but find the place in chaos with Mayes the last man standing, but not for long. It is now going to be up to Jameson to try and get CentCom back on it's feet, control the outbreaks in the south and get help sent to them all. (no pressure then) The Para defence lines around London are starting to crumble, Eli is hunting for Grews and Charlotte takes to the air over CentCom to ensure no zombie escapes the building. Rebecca's group find trouble on the London streets as they are pursued by armed men while Alan arrives at CentCom.Up in the Chinese mountains in an isolated retreat, the bioterrorist Aliyev who designed the original virus has made a new virus which will kill all the existing zombies but releasing it would kill all the survivors as well. Hearing on his radio that his old colleague Simon may have a cure, he decides he must get to London to help, if he can find a way to stop survivors dying from his new virus.The action moves along as usual with Jameson's entry into CentCom to try to stop the new outbreak and the Paras outside the city fight a desperate battle to stay alive and hold back the zombie hordes as they move towards London. Homer's underwater adventures were like something out of a James Bond film and added a whole new element to the book, while Ali battles an enemy sniper in the air. It was all pretty exciting. For me, Homer really steps up in this book and shows what he is made of and I liked that. The same can be said for poor Juice who is alone and far from rescue. Ali is having to face coming up second best for once and I liked seeing her character deal with that.It was interesting to get a new character in Aliyev, who sold the original virus to the Al Shabaab terrorist group, which then somehow mutated into a zombie virus. He is a character you think you should hate but I found myself liking him from the start as he perfects a way to kill all the zombies. He now needs to find a way to stop his cure from killing the survivors as well, to redeem himself somewhat. I think his adventures could be interesting as the series progresses.Overall, I loved this book again and can't get enough of this series."}, {"userName": "Angela Verdenius", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11378467-angela-verdenius", "userReview": "Picking up where the last book left off, it had me chewing my nails.

And a little bummed because now I have to wait for more. This book had some parts that made me lose all hope at first, but ended with a couple of the most satisfying moments in the whole series.

I did however appreciate the story behind the Genesis of the outbreak...or at least the Genesis of the virus itself. In this book...anything that can go wrong will...I cannot believe that for all the military experience in the different aspects of the book would succumb to such normal/human tendencies. I mean...really...really people...the bumbling of these people...better you give me a citizen view because I\u2019m sure survival would mean you do whatever is necessary to save your own ass...because the \u2018higher ups\u2019 clearly can\u2019t do what is necessary for the entire race.You cannot tell me that the mission objective is to get the scientist to the lab to create the vaccine. This book did not touch on that...or at least it was so long and digressed I got lost. You send out 5 important players to mission objective to retrieve a non-mission task. Resulting in the death of 4 of those players, destruction of 1 of the last remaining aircrafts (which may be needed for mission objective) PLUS could not even complete the non-essential mission which was to retrieve the pilot whose plane had been shot out of the sky...waste of resources...4 lives and property lost for 1...well 0....because they never save the pilot. It is madness that a man come back from the outside and not be subjected to quarantine because why...he refused...?? what madness is this! There is a reason for quarantine...and any doctor that allows one man to slip past that is not worth their salt. Subsequently...the man turned and run amok in central command, wipe out more than half of the people in CentCom necessary for monitoring and directing the remnants of the British front, destroy important screens etc responsible for monitoring the front leaving them blind etc...right...NEXT...while I am not a military person...I clearly do not understand fighting for and next to your brothers...but how can retrieval of a dead comrade be more important than mission objective? You fail to ensure that you secure the supplies you initially went out to retrieve and instead break ranks to retrieve the body of a fallen brother and get yourself blown up as well...really...? Now that\u2019s helpful. You take the dead body back to receive a \u2018burial\u2019 on the ship or whatever while the rest of the crew on board the ship die or whatever because they were unable to retrieve the stores...Really...?Failure..."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53670034-brian", "userReview": "Each book tells the continuing saga of a world upside down where everything has changed due to an infection that turns 7 billion people into raving, human hungry zombies. This goes well beyond the Walking Dead for action as Fortress Britain, the only country left standing, is trying to reset the world to being zombie free. The missions are many and the action is hot as American and British military conduct missions across the globe trying to find materials and people in a race to stop the extinction of the human race.There are many characters in this saga and yet the author develops them with depth and reality. The protagonists and the antagonists seem to be so real, as does the action. Reading this saga pulls you in and places you in the middle of the action. This HAS to be one of the BEST Zombie saga's going !!! Detail, information and realism pervades throughout the 12 books (books 13 & 14 will arrive) and I can't wait !"}, {"userName": "David Dalton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18241411-david-dalton", "userReview": "Another good read in this thrilling zombie/military series. But.....I have to say this was probably my least favorite of the nine books in this series (counting the prequel). Kind of hard to pin it down, maybe the underwater scenes took too long to develop or the warehouse scenes. To me it seemed the carrier was just where it was at the beginning of the book, or even where it was at the end of the last book. This detour from their primary mission took way too long. I am in no danger of not continuing on, but Book 8 to me did not really advance the story any more from Book 7. They combined to make one LONG story."}, {"userName": "Ralph Wark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26299560-ralph-wark", "userReview": "Good next chapterI've read all eight Arisen books, and enjoyed each one.

That is what I feel like after crushing both of these books. To say I'm still entertained is an understatement. The work of these two collaborating authors runs the risk of giving a reader a heart attack, or at least make you out of breath. Action is the main underlying theme here as we travel through a world of zombies.I rate this work at 3/5 stars.Why you may ask, because even though it is entertaining and fast pasted, there are a lot of issues research could have fixed. Probably because they fashioned the information from The Walking Dead or something, but let me go over a few things for you. This will assist you if your desire is to write something similar.Gas goes bad! Yes, that's right, gas goes bad. It takes about 6-12 months, but unless it is stabilized constantly, petroleum will break down and cease to be useful in a combustion engine.-You must be strong as hell to fire a shotgun single handed.-People do stupid things-Underwater is hard, especially when fightingBesides the above, consider the saying, \"He laughed out loud.\" Really? I would not have thought he laughed out loud unless you wrote it. \"He sighed out load.\" Again, thanks for telling me it was not in his head. Really? Podium Publishing let those slip by. I think they need a better editor before publishing.Don't let those little tidbits stop you from reading the series.

The whole idea was just stupid and not believable or plausible. But then a friend that was a zombie freak rd me that he would guarantee that the first book of the ARISEN Series would hook me on Zombies. He told me he would pay for the first book and if just the first book didn't get me hooked and grabbing book two as soon as I finished book one, he would buy me every new book my favorite author put out from now on. Well how I turn that offer down?Well needless to say I not only was hooked but I swallowed the whole tackle box. This book, book 8 has continued the the wildest and best rollercoaster I've ever been on. Oh man, straight up then straight down and unexpected 90 degree turns at break neck speed. I've never before, literally and physically became exhausted from reading a book until now with this series and this book continues incredible ride.So get the series from book one and I guarantee you, you will be unable to get to this book fast enough.Ok, where is book nine Glynn and Michael?

Juice leads the Marines on a base raid and gets two killed by Spetsnaz, before he blows them to hell, and then the zombies show up and he's left trapped on his own, only to be finally rescued and the much-needed supplies saved.Meanwhile, the JFK runs from the Russian ship, until (off camera which is actually very disappointing) Homer sinks it using the Russian's own mini-sub and limpet mines.

Happily, I was wrong. This series is wonderful; I love the characters and their stories. These books are so well written, it feels as though I am there sharing the fears, hopes, and loves of the characters, not to mention all the adrenaline. The action is definitely heart pounding and nail biting, at the edge of your seat, going to explode any second rush. My only complaint is that once I started reading, I couldn't stop, which lead to late nights and bags under the eyes, not to mention a lot of half completed projects at work (which makes for a not so happy boss).

The books could alternatively be titled \"A series of unfortunate events\" or \"Murphy's Law, Zombie edition\".

Example: The scientist on the hill - how could he have survived for so long and then manage to bring down his hideout in a matter of hours and via so many badly timed events and badly placed items - I'm gonna play loud bass music, put a kero lamp near this flammable liquid, then put the grenades up near that, but also in close proximity to a fridge full of toxins, what could possibly go wrong.I do still really enjoy these books, but these characters are meant to be highly trained experts, please let them pull off at least one mission without absolutely everything going wrong"}, {"userName": "John Cheeseman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36564892-john-cheeseman", "userReview": "Very exciting and I'm sure technically accurate as I recognise half the weapons and gear the author talks about, why is everyone apart from Alpha team so stupid and why aren't they using tanks, APC's, artillery, bombers, shotguns, spears, axes, buildings with their stairs removed or 100 other obvious ways to defeat or slow down the zombie menace? Theyve had 2 years to prepare against a zombie holocaust in the UK but haven't worked out that if everyone locked all their doors and went to the attic it would be almost impossible to spread which would give the military a chance to use tanks and APC's or even landrovers to wipe out the infected.
