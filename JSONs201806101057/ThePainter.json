Poet and painter compete to see which can capture her best, in words or paint, with the woman herself as the ultimate prize. Rembrandt works admirably (though possibly because I know nothing about him?) but Marvell as depicted here seems out of kilter with the poem he writes (To his coy mistress). Also the poem itself doesn't quite seem to fit with the situation and the fact that Amelia hints they are already lovers, but I suppose it is Marvell's most famous poem.The 'present' story I found far less convincing, even though the premise itself was an interesting one: Amy Dale, a descendant of Amelia, comes to the house where the past story was set and which is now being renovated. She traces the story of the competition through Amelia's diary and is herself involved in a fatal triangle between two men.The problem is that I don't think Davenport's portrait of Amy or her relationship with Don is in the slightest bit realistic, and the plot device of two (or three?) journals is both clunky and unnecessary. I quite like the fact that Amy is both painter like Rembrandt and yet also object of rivalry like Amelia, but wasn't quite sure if that was what the author intended. There are far too many incidents with chainsaws in this story; and the idea of Don being able to simply recite the whole of Marvell's poem (all 46 lines of it!) off pat was too much. The end of the modern episode was also very rushed and anticlimatic - far too many loose ends left dangling. Which was a shame as the figure of Don is an intriguing one that unfortunately this book doesn't explore enough to do him justice.So overall a book with more promise than it fulfills, but still an interesting page-turning read - 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Florbela", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101917-florbela", "userReview": "This book isn't really what I expected, however I enjoyed it.

Or at least so says the back of the book.Actually, with its parallel tales of a developing relationship in the present uncovering and reflecting relationships in the past it reminded me more of Possession or Headlong. However it is a much lighter and less obviously erudite read than the first of those : in style it is closer to the second - not quite as farcical, but certainly with funny as well as tragic moments. So what it has in common with the two given is the period in which it is set and ... umm ... that's it methinks.I enjoyed reading it, and devoured it quickly - partly to see if my idea of the whereabouts of the missing painting were correct (they were). I think more could have been done with Marvell and the Captain, but that the latter was a bit of an enigma I suppose was one of the points of the tale.Bookdarted bit:She considered evasion, but in that confessional car, with this concerned man next to her, there was no room for a glib reply.Glad I'm not the only one who thinks cars are good places for serious conversations and personal revelation ..."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "Davenport manages to seamlessly spin two stories, past and present, into wonderful whole cloth containint elements of love, betrayal, suspense, mystery, art history and murder. In the present we are introduced to artist Amy Dale, who is hired to participate in the restoration of a 17th century manor house that once belonged to a distant relative. Her task is complicated by two factors. One, the discovery of a 300 year old journal written by her ancestor Amelia Dahl that throws new light on the history of the manor. Secondly, she becomes the focus of an antagonistic competition between Dennis, an amiable older man and Don, the scarred and brooding laborer to whom Amy finds herself emotionally and sexually attracted. The past presents a richly imaginative tale that concentrates on the missing year in the life of one of history's most unique, creative and talented artists, Rembrandt Van Rijn.....and his obsession with Amelia Dahl. The two stories are mirror images and Davenport's writing erupts from the page and draws you into both stories."}, {"userName": "Night", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2416457-night", "userReview": "The story was told from two fronts during two time periods. The past was about the missing chapter in the life of Rembrandt van Rijn, during which he was in a poem vs. painting contest with Andrew Marvell. The prize was Amelia Dahl, the lady of the Manor and a wife.>> So, they are competing for a married woman? Ok, it may be possible, but I just can't come to terms with it. Anyway, the writing and historical details are intriguing enough.The present was about Amy Dale, descendant of the Dahls, who got a restoration job at the Manor also involved in a love-triangle with 2 men. They found Amelia's journals (two versions of them) and began searching for the possible undiscovered Rembrendt's painting. All led to mystery and murder.I like the past. Fiction and facts well matched and plausible.

I really loved the historic parts about Rembrandt and his life. I love reading about that time period and the author does him justice. (Though an even better, fuller, more biographical account is Rembrandt by Gladys Schmitt). I'd give this 3 stars though the writing is excellent. The problem, as I see it, is the descendant and main character Amy is somewhat unlikable - she's driven by odd impulses, immature thinking in her attraction to men, and while this and the strange worker she is attracted to become a main part of the story, I felt it took away from the real story. The story of Rembrandt and the modern day search for a possible painting by him - they tying of past to present, is more integral, and much more interesting, than this ill-fated love match. I found the love match and her constant questioning, wondering, judging, rather tiresome."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050198-linda", "userReview": "Two artists, two parallel stories, two love affairs.

Four hundred years earlier, Rembrandt van Rijn unexpectedly spent some time in the same mansion, where he was pressed into painting a portrait of the lady of the house, with whom he falls deeply in love.Told from the vantage points of the two protagonists, The Painter spins out a tale full of intrigue and history.
