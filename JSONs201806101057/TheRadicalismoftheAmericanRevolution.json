Nothing dry, parched or plodding to be found here. This is history that reads more like literature and will trap your attention into the folds of its narrative flow like sailor falling into Charybdis. Mr. Wood, together with David McCullough (John Adams)and Barbara Tuchman (The Guns of August), constitute the ruling council on my shelf of historical treatments and I don\u2019t see their power waning any time soon given my love of their work. Despite the myriad of histories and biographies picking over the remains of this pivotal moment in world history, Wood manages to distinguish this piece by boldly and brilliantly recasting the historical, cultural and societal underpinnings of the colonies break with England. And he does so while thoroughly entertaining his reader with his smooth, polished prose. For fans of history, in general, or the American Revolution, in particular, this is not a book to be missed. In his incredibly readable fashion, Gordon Woods utterly demolishes the common \u201cmyth\u201d that the American Revolution was some \"conservative\" tweaking of governmental rule that merely replaced one group of rich white men with another. Au contraire, Wood argues, the American Revolution was an extreme and radical departure from the English regime. Wood takes the reader step by step through the make up and various constituencies among the colonists and how it was a growing disconnect between the cultural antecedent and \u201cmodus operandi\u201d of the English system and the burgeoning sense of individuality and social maneuverability that had taken hold in the colonies. By deconstructing of the social, economic and political systems in place in America before, during and after the break with England, Wood demonstrates in no uncertain terms how \"monumental\" an upheaval was the American Revolution. Without regurgitating the wonderful detail Wood imbues in the narrative, below is a brief sketch of his depiction of the colonies that give to his central argument. Pre-Revolution America in 1750 had the following characteristics: 1. Colonists were intensely proud to be British subjects due to the sense of unprecedented freedom that British subjects had in the world. 2. Love and respect (and to some extent even deification) of the King. 3. There were few separate factions as everyone was divided into essentially two large groups: gentlemen (i.e., the aristocracy) and commoners (i.e., the rest of us). 4. Patriarchal Dependence. Women, children, indentured servants and slaves were all dependent upon the head of the family who ruled \u201clike a king\u201d over the family unit. This familial arrangement helps partially explain two important aspects of the colonial mindset. First, it sheds light on why slavery was not widely condemned as inherently evil. Since, to a large degree, all of society was formed along the lines of a de facto class system, slavery was simply another rung on that ladder and differed from other arrangement only by a matter of degree. Second, this ordering of the family unit also lends explanatory force to the love and deference of the people to the King as the \"patriarch\" of the country.5. Patronage. Business and commerce in the pre-Revolution colonies was almost wholly dependant on relationships between people rather than impartial factors like price and quality. 6. Political Authority was tied to relationships. Family members and patrons were routinely given political offices and this nepotism was not looked on with disfavor. In Post-Revolution America, all of the above characteristics had been completely transformed. By 1820, in less than 70 years, the Revolution had created what readers will recognize as the beginning of modern America (both good and bad). When describing the U.S. today in terms of the characteristics mentioned above, Wood makes a powerful case that the American Revolution was the most radical (and the most important in terms of true individual freedom) revolution in history. This is a fascinating book and one that makes me want to read a lot more about our founding fathers and this critical period in U.S. History. 5.0 stars.

I found his analysis absolutely fascinating. It changed my perspective on what the American Revolution was about and what it achieved. Enlightenment principles cast on a distinctly fertile American culture set the stage for the American Revolution. The founding fathers believed they were establishing a new republic guided by benevolent rationalism. After the dust settled they were stunned to find their philosophies cast aside as a proletarian democracy dominated by commercial interests took over. Wood emphasizes ideas and painstakingly explains rapidly changing cultural norms, foregoing the patriotic drama of other accounts of the period. Thus it can be a slow read at times, but it is well, well worth it.Wood starts off by introducing us to American society in the mid-eighteenth century, a society much different than our own. To understand the events and ideas of the Revolution and how truly radical they were we must understand the times that spawned them. Monarchy was the accepted form of government and it determined the relationships of people. Unlike today where people identify and collaborate in horizontal groups such as teachers, blue collar workers, homemakers, etc., relationships in the eighteenth century were vertical from the top (king) down to the bottom (slave or servant). This system was patriarchal. Power was vested with the male heads of elite families who controlled everyone connected to that family. Everybody, wife, child, laborer, tenant, etc., had a specific place in the pecking order. Strict norms dictated how one related to those above and below them in the pecking order. Communities and towns were small and run by a few powerful men in a well-defined hierarchy. This was a world in which many wives called their husbands sir, in which labor was commonly produced by indentured or apprenticed workers who could be bound over for any offense. It was difficult to run away because you had no place to go. There was no privacy. Everyone knew everyone else and their business. Tradesmen relied on patronage rather than customers. They were there to meet the demands of the rich. If they stopped selling to a dominant family, no customer was likely to take their place. Conversely, if a dressmaker had run out of work, her patrons recognizing her reliance on them would typically place orders just to keep her solvent. The top families lent out significant portions of their estates for income but just as important to exercise control over their communities. This was a world of dependence. Freedom as we understand it today was unknown. The elite families also controlled politics. Political appointments were a favorite form of patronage. High political offices of course went to family members and many offices were essentially hereditary. Commoners were not allowed to occupy any important office since it would denigrate gentlemen to deal on important matters with a commoner. The last half of the eighteenth century would see dramatic change. Taking hold in England and America were republican ideas with their implicit moral duty to fairness that undercut patriarchal control and dependence. In England republicanism was constrained by an established hierarchy running from the king through Parliament, the nobles and the gentry who controlled their tenants, servants and laborers. Patronage was administered through this structure. Parliament following the 1688 revolution served as the counterpoint to the king but its members had a vested interest in the continuance of the monarchy. Not so in America. Local assemblies did not answer to the king. America\u2019s elites controlled their towns but did not have the English top to bottom all-encompassing network. Republicanism in America would not complement the existing structure but undo it. To the colonists, many of whom left Britain with grudges against the monarchy, the king and Parliament were far away. Patronage was conducted through local institutions and assemblies not answerable to the monarch. And most colonists did not answer to the Anglican Church which the king used to extend his authority. America\u2019s aristocracy was less rich, less connected, less organized and less powerful than its English counterpart. America had readily available land and far fewer tenant farmers, which predominated in England under the control of the aristocracy. America\u2019s commoners were typically free holders, more self-sufficient than their English counterparts. Thus American society was more egalitarian and far more open to republican ideas. American society was much more fluid than English society. From 1750 to 1770 the population doubled from 1 million to two and doubled again in the next twenty years. This meant people were on the move establishing new homesteads and new communities, breaking established ties and lines of authority. Economic opportunity grew and American commoners were far better off than their English counterparts. With the development of trade between widespread communities, the use of paper money grew, which further cut into the traditional control of the patriarchs that their system of credits had previously provided. Contracts became impersonal instruments with clearly delineated responsibilities replacing the more informal personal agreements between people who knew each other in prior generations. Americans were more independent and less accepting of authority. Increasingly sons and daughters left home for new opportunities diminishing the role of the traditional extended family. New parents were changing their ideas on raising children. John Locke\u2019s writings on education were very influential. The concept of strict control and absolute obedience was being replaced by the idea of parents and children having responsibilities to each other. These new ideas also undercut the idea of a subject\u2019s relationship to his monarch. The relationship was now being viewed as a contract with rights and responsibilities on each party instead of the traditional paternalistic model. All of the preceding applied of course only to white Americans. But the shift in thinking caused for the first time many white Americans to see that slavery was wrong. Before this economic and social transition, everyone accepted slavery as just another category, the lowest in the pecking order, although poor whites, indentured laborers and servants were often not much better off than slaves. As patriarchy was undermined and the principle of social contracts accepted, slavery didn\u2019t fit and it began to be viewed differently. The first anti-slavery society in the world was formed in Philadelphia in 1775.The founding fathers were well educated in the classics and classical ideals. They were steeped in Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke. For them the Revolution was seen as the fulfillment of the Enlightenment. Naturally they saw their ilk as the leaders of their new creation feeling only the liberal gentlemanly class would be benevolent and fair. They believed that only the educated elite would not be swayed by the narrow interests of everyday commerce and thus be unbiased enough to hold together the new republic. However equality had a different meaning to the common man. It meant that he was as good as anyone and just as qualified to occupy political office. Such notions alarmed the gentry, not because they felt ordinary men lacked ability, but because they felt the farmers, merchants, traders and mechanics of the country could not be above self-interest and thus would tear the government apart. The Revolution thrust an already rapidly growing economy into many competing market interests that would now use government to increase their profits. From the very beginning the notion of enlightened republicanism was challenged by the reality of everyday parochial commercial interests. Acceptance of the idea that competing self interest in elected officials was the best way to govern signified the demise of classical republicanism and the start of liberal democracy. By the end of the eighteenth century the Federalists who represented the aristocracy had lost most of their power. This was particularly true in the north where laborers and proto-businessmen rose up in egalitarian anger under the Republican banner. A huge shift in the national perception of the value of work was taking place. Once deemed a necessity of plebeians, it was becoming a badge of honor. Increasingly laborers were seen as the true producers of wealth and the idle rich as parasites. Even southern plantation owners, who oddly enough were also Republicans, now described themselves as hardworking. The first decades of the nineteenth century saw continued rapid population growth, the massive movement westward, the decline of traditional religious denominations and the rise of strident evangelical ones, unprecedented alcoholism, increasing entrepreneurship and dramatic growth of domestic trade. All these disruptive changes broke traditional ties and values. And cohesion was not forthcoming from the federal government which was so weak that for most people it seemed practically non-existent. With very little money, it had to operate by granting private charters for banks, bridges, roads, etc., further fueling private interests that in turn sought control of government and exploited the public. Fortunately the judiciary began eschewing political power and assuming the role of society\u2019s arbiter, a role the founding fathers had envisioned for themselves as elite rulers of the republic.Wood concludes that, \u201cBy the early nineteenth century, America had already emerged as the most egalitarian, most materialistic, most individualistic \u2013 and most evangelical Christian \u2013 society in Western History.\u201d Jacksonian democracy would complete the transition. Introducing the spoils system, Jackson recast patronage in the context of the modern political party. His successor Martin Van Buren would be the first pure politician to be elected president. This was not the outcome the revolutionary leaders had envisioned and those that survived to see it begin to unfold were appalled. John Adams wrote in 1823, \u201cWhere is now the progress of the human mind?....When? Where? How? Is the present Chaos to be arranged into Order?\u201d Jefferson found it a hard fight just to get his state university approved over stiff evangelical opposition and he was terrified that someone like Andrew Jackson might become president. Writing a friend in 1825 Jefferson recognized that America had profoundly changed since the revolution lamenting \u201ca new generation whom we know not, and who knows not us.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1064644-nathan", "userReview": "Wood's thesis - that the American Revolution was essentially a cultural and political metanoia - is not actually so controversial as it might seem. He has no problem proving that, and does so thoroughly and consistently. What this book has more trouble with is building towards a useful conclusion after laying the theoretical groundwork; Wood never quite manages to address the question \"So what?\" after he has answered the question \"What happened?\" Still, it's interesting to note that, given the love affair modern conservatives have with the Founding Fathers, the country was actually birthed in what we would now term a leftist movement."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "There were some chapters that made my eyes glaze over (Benevolence, Interests), but others (Enlightenment) were fascinating. I was expecting more of a political history, or even something that would touch on military exploits, but this is a social and intellectual history. The war itself is not discussed. The first section (Monarchy) describes the social structure of the colonies at about mid-century (1750) and lays the foundations for the next two sections (Republicanism, Democracy), which relate the way Revolutionary ideas disrupted and upended the societal order.If you're tired of hearing people argue on behalf of American exceptionalism, quote them this:The revolutionary generation was the most cosmopolitan of any in American history. The revolutionary leaders never intended to make a national revolution in any modern sense. They were patriots, to be sure, but they were not obsessed, as were later generations, with the unique character of America or with separating America from the course of Western civilization. As yet there was no sense that loyalty to one's state or country was incompatible with such cosmopolitanism. (p. 222)And if you meet people who insist America was founded as a Christian nation, please, citizens, read them this:At the time of the Revolution most of the founding fathers had not put much emotional stock in religion, even when they were regular churchgoers. As enlightened gentlemen, they abhorred \"that gloomy superstition disseminated by ignorant illiberal preachers\" and looked forward to the day when \"the phantom of darkness will be dispelled by the rays of science, and the bright charms of rising civilization.\" At best, most of the revolutionary gentry only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and ridiculed it. Jefferson hated orthodox clergymen, and he repeatedly denounced the \"priestcraft\" for having converted Christianity into \"an engine for enslaving mankind, ...into a mere contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves.\" Although few of them were outright deists, most like David Ramsay described the Christian church as \"the best temple of reason.\" Even puritanical John Adams thought that the argument for Christ's divinity was an \"awful blasphemy\" in this new enlightened age. When Hamilton was asked why the members of the Philadelphia Convention had not recognized God in the Constitution, he allegedly replied, speaking for many of his liberal colleagues, \"We forgot.\"  (p. 330)The book ends with a fascinating appraisal of how the Founding Fathers viewed what America had become - what the Revolution had wrought. In many cases they were disappointed, or even horrified and disgusted. They had designed a nation based on elitist virtue and classical ideals, with religion held in check; but the nation they now saw was deeply religious and sectarian, increasingly irrational and superstitious, commercialized and money-obsessed, anti-intellectual, socially crass, politically vulgar. George Washington \"had lost all hope for democracy.\" Alexander Hamilton opined that \"this American world was not made for me.\" John Adams bewailed the halt in the \"progress of the human mind.\" Thomas Jefferson saw America going backwards, not forwards. Benjamin Rush viewed his Revolutionary efforts \"with deep regret\" and could not find a man who loved the Constitution."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe", "userReview": "Caveat: While this book is the kind of great history book to tickle a history fan like myself pink, I see it as being too \"on subject\" to appeal to most general readers. My nutshell review is that it offers a fine three stage analysis of the changes in the American social-political thought process in the years before, during, and after the Revolution. If that sort of thing floats your boat you will love this book. If not, I know very well this one will bore you stiff.Too bad that last bit, since the material inside would go a long way toward disabusing you of a lot of the bowdlerized notions of history they filled your head with in public school. It offers a fine glimps at how far the ideals & expectations of the founging fathers were at odds with how things actually turned out, and how unhappy many were with the kind of democracy that came out of the Revolution. You'll also learn a bit about the rise of the religeous right in the years just after the Revolution, which took good rationalists like Jefferson and Franklin quite by surprise.Actually, when I consider the subject matter I am inclined to think that the people who would benefit most from reading this are the sort of people who by political leaning never would.

My host, a retired American historian, plans a series of trips to sites relevant to the colonial and revolutionary war periods.This book is about cultural history. It's divided into three major parts descriptive of three sociological modes of being, those being the monarchical, the republican and the democratic, with the intention of showing how the peculiar circumstances of North American settlement led, almost inevitably, through these stages to the present-day United States of America.Implicit to author Wood's argument is what may be taken as a critique of Marxist analyses as applied to the American experience. The centerpiece of the story is, of course, the American revolution, a revolution which, as he has it, was not of the economically oppressed against their oppressors--descriptive of the later French and Russian revolutions. Rather, the American revolutionaries were relatively well off compared to their English peers, their movement precursing a broader cultural transformation which in time would manifest in Europe as well.When still in high school I read Charles Beard's economic interpretation of the American revolution and McDonald's critique of same, the argument of the former being that the delegates to the constitutional convention were significantly motivated by their economic interests. This, despite errors in detail, seems to have been the case overall. In a Marxist sense, so far as I understand it, the American revolution represented a pivotal transition from late feudalistic forms to a maturing capitalistic one, distinct from subsequent European changes in great part owing to the abundance of land and the paucity of its white population. In this sense, recognizing that the American revolution was not a revolt against capitalist exploitation, but a revolt which fostered the development of wage labor, of industry, of markets and, yes, of peculiarly capitalistic modes of exploitation, Wood's work seem to me to be a valuable contribution to any discussion of the transformations of dominant modes of production."}, {"userName": "Robert Owen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3797352-robert-owen", "userReview": "Wood\u2019s \u201cThe Radicalism of the American Revolution\u201d is a mind-bending exercise in historical context and its consequences. Unlike so many popular histories one is likely to read, Wood does not discuss historical events through the prism of modern sensibilities, but rather, makes the ancient sensibilities of the nation\u2019s founders comprehensible to modern readers. The overriding cultural attitudes surrounding power and structures of social hierarchy of pre- and post-Revolutionary Americans were as vastly different from each other as they each are from those of our time. As understanding who we are is dependent on understanding where we came from, Wood\u2019s history provides a fascinating and relevant touchstone. Woods begins his work by describing the highly patriarchal social and economic structures of pre-Revolutionary America and how these, in many ways, were actually more pronounced and deeply entrenched than those of England at the same time. Essentially, pre-revolutionary American society was ruled by a class of genteel patricians who, by virtue of their means, educations, leisure and resulting social stature, viewed themselves as the rightful masters of society. The hallmark of this genteel class was a perception of \u201cdisinterestedness\u201d made possible by means so significant that one was not required to dirty their hands with any form of labor. A disinterested member of the gentry was a man who was not dependent on anyone for his means, and so, presumably, could be trusted to make decisions for the common good of the larger population that were not burdened by the need to pander to any particular interest. In other words, a gentleman was \u201cindependent\u201d and could, for the sake of honor, be counted on to decide what is best for everyone. As the vast majority of the colonists were, in addition to being culturally obliged to respect this hierarchy, also economically dependent on the patronage of this class the status quo was generally accepted by all as the natural order of things. An interesting insight that emerged from Wood\u2019s discussion was the fact that in the spirit of the times and the general acceptance of this hierarchy by all members of the society led to a sense that anyone who was not a \u201cgentleman\u201d was, by definition, a debased and dependent vassal. As such, modernly perceived horrors of things like slavery or indentured servitude were not seen as wrong by this proto-American society so much as they simply represented a particular status of debasement along a spectrum of indignity that non-gentry were entitled to and naturally shared. The founding fathers were essentially a group of only-just gentry who chafed under a social structure that inevitably relegated them to a second-tier sort of preeminence. Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, Hamilton, Washington, just to name a few were, each in their own way and for their own reasons, relegated to the top of a second class heap. Fascinated by the examples of ancient Greece and Republican Rome and entranced by the writings of such \u201cegalitarian\u201d Enlightenment thinkers as Locke and de Montesquieu, the founding fathers parlayed general discontent with perceived English ambivalence towards colonial interests into a Republican Revolution. Interestingly, none of them were particularly adept at anticipating the consequences of the revolution they sponsored. They essentially envisioned a Republican world free of historical hereditary hierarchies in which merit and not birth was the measure of a man. Yet, they utterly failed to think through exactly how different the world they envisioned would be from the world they actually coveted. Meritorious men who rose in prominence, they assumed, would be like them\u2026..dedicated to education, reason and \u201cdisinterested\u201d public service. Democracy, however, produced a decidedly different result. With the patronage systems of the past stripped away and access to power available to a far broader group of men, the nation they created quickly devolved into self-interested factions whose constituents were obsessed with acquiring wealth. \u201cSmall men\u201d of limited educations and cultural attainment rose to power through base campaigning for office that would have been unthinkably crude to a true gentleman. The establishment of modern banking that made credit and paper money available to \u201cthe many\u201d essentially eliminated the bonds of patronage that had traditionally held the \u201ccommon man\u201d as a vassal to his wealthy patron. This increased liquidity, combined with a political structure that enabled the celebration of self-interest (avarice, in the Framers\u2019 minds) basically tore the historical social structures apart at the seams. The result was at once glorious and terrible. The common man, liberated by currency and politics from a state a near-serfdom was suddenly free to go and make his fortune by whatever means seemed good to him. This massive leveling of society unleashed the awesome power of a creative and industrious people who were suddenly free to apply their energies to making themselves rich. This elevation, however, came at the expense of manners, refinement, social order and any inclination to \u201creason\u201d that had previously characterized the pre-revolutionary world. Bombast and pandering became to the means to office, leisure of the sort that made a classic liberal arts education possible was suddenly ridiculed and despised, the patriarchal structures of \u201cthe family\u201d was disrupted and everywhere the cult of \u201cdisinterest\u201d was replaced by an unashamed pursuit of wealth. The book was interesting, well-written and contributed significantly to my understanding of American history and the world we\u2019ve inhereited. I found this idea that relative to the ideals they were striving for, that for the most part the Founding Fathers felt their Republican experiment was an abject failure. The book also made clearer the genesis of American anti-intellectualism \u2013 ennoblement of the opinions of everyone without a corresponding obligation to actually educate themselves in the object of their opinion - and American evangelicalism - every man as the monitor of his own soul combined with set agendas of specific sins to be battled in order to validate one\u2019s righteousness \u2013 was also fascinating and relevant to my understanding of our modern times."}, {"userName": "Paul Donahue", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2887291-paul-donahue", "userReview": "A great read on the revolution from a completely different angle than I've ever read. Wood doesn't write the book chronologically; there are no story arcs, protagonists, etc. It reads like a textbook and as such can get pretty dry. But textbooks can also be fascinating.When we think of the American Revolution, we think of a war and a political revolution. We were taught that the French Revolution, even though it happened afterward, was the more monumental event because it was a social and societal revolution, eradicating monarchy and enabling middle class rule. Wood doesn't spend time comparing the revolutions, but his point is clear: ours produced every bit the change as in France.To fully understand this revolution, Wood says we must consider not just the war of 1775-1783, but the entire time period from about 1740 to 1820. The gentry of the early 1700s mirrored English aristocracy; inheriting their wealth, owning land, serving as judges and legislators, independent. Labor was an act of poverty, and anyone who could not live on their inherited wealth was a member of the mob, unsophisticated and dependent upon the gentry both socially and politically. Commerce was limited to trade with Europe. As much as 40-50% of all men were slaves or servants.By 1820, all this had changed. Wealth in the colonies was not enough to allow anyone to live the life of a true, leisurely aristocrat, which created dependencies. Leisure itself became a vice and labor a virtue--the exact opposite of colonial America. The realization of the benefits of interstate commerce launched the US into the commercial, market-centric society we know today. And that firm line (huge gap) between commoners and gentry was obliterated. Everyone was now a gentleman, everyone was free to pursue happiness in their own way, no one had to be dependent on anyone else if they worked hard enough. Except slaves. But eliminating the hierarchy and dependency of colonial society gave oxygen to the emancipation movement where before there was none. The revolution made it possible to begin the debate on freeing slaves, and that alone is an underappreciated and radical consequence.The most jarring message of the book was how disappointed the revolutionaries were with what they had created. They thought republicanism would lead to a more enlightened society, where each man would use his new freedom to become more informed and more sophisticated. Disinterested, liberally educated men would serve in the government, above private interests and all for the common good. Some of them were mortified to see what then occurred. By 1820 it was considered virtuous by many to have no college education. Common mechanics, artisans, and merchants, with no knowledge of government or the political philosophy of Cato and Cicero were being elected to legislatures. By the time Andrew Jackson, a crude, violent Tennessee farmer, was elected President, Jefferson was disheartened and disillusioned with his own Revolution, and even \"reduced to despair.\""}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67523-joel", "userReview": "I cannot figure out what book the people read to give this thing 3 or 4 stars.

Wood himself has argued very cogently that the political changes of the Revolution were eventually far more conservative than originally envisioned (the need for a strong executive to pull together the disparate strands of the Confederation to ensure the economic survival of the Union). Here, he explodes all previous conceptions of social change in the period by insightfully arguing that the 1770s-1780s oversaw the complete overturning of centuries of world order by taking America from a European model \"vertical\" ordering of society to a horizontal democratization of those social interchanges. For those decades, there was no strong executive like today, no overtly centralized government. Previously, as Wood argues in his first part, social interchanges were conducted on the monarchical model, a complex series of interchanges of patriarchy and paternalism and patronism which left no doubt as to who was higher in the social food chain. In Part 2, Wood tracks the leveling of that paternalism into a \"republicanism\", where enlightened representatives represent the common people in a convention or a representative body. By the time of Jackson, a sort of rhetoric of true democracy erupted, with the feeling of direct representation by non-elites in the government. At this time, banks, and special interests, and emolument made a mockery of that projected democracy.It's a brilliant overview of the true revolution, the radical overturning of the social order, which is still on display today: anti-intellectualism, anti-elitism, appeals to the lowest common denominator. The fundamental socioeconomic underpinnings of America were present from the beginning, as Wood brilliantly demonstrates."}, {"userName": "thethousanderclub", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub", "userReview": "No matter how deep, how far, and how much I swim in American History, I always find something of interest and something new that informs my perspective and love for my nation's history.

Its subject matter is interesting, but, alas, its writing lumbers and stomps around and makes the overall reading experience less than enjoyable.To begin with, I don't want to diminish the additional insight Gordon S. Wood's book brings to the overall conversation and exploration of the American Revolution. There is a lot here which was new, fresh, and valuable. Above all, I loved the exploration of ideas and how they impacted American society before, during, and after the Revolution. How did America slough off the old sentiments of aristocracy? What did the idea of equality do for American society generally? How did it diffuse throughout the population, eventually illuminating not only white male property holders but also women, African slaves, and others? What was the impact of individualism and the establishment of American's republic of commerce? These and a host of other fascinating questions are the book's reason for existing. In the end, The Radicalism of the American Revolution is worth reading, but it will take some extra work and dedication to do so. I'm fine with reading hard books, but I don't love reading bland writing.When I started reading the book I was a little concerned because it reminded me a bit too much of Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States of America. That book suggest and attempts to show that most of the founders acted wholly out of self-interest in relation to their wealth and property. No doubt the founders were wise enough to be comprehensively concerned about a great many interests, but I found Beard's arguments unpersuasive. For a certain duration Wood appears to be taking a similar approach with the monumental changes which occurred leading up to and causing the Revolution. Wood presents a great preponderance of economic evidence suggesting why societal feelings and trends moved in the way they did; however, this focus misses some of the mark. Ideas matter, as The Radicalism of the American Revolution shows, and economic factors can never, in my opinion, fully explain the course of nations and societies. I admit the explanatory difficulty becomes somewhat of a chicken or the egg dilemma, and the truth is probably found somewhere in the middle. Regardless, the book doesn't fully embrace an economic explanation in the same way Beard's book does, and I think the book was much better for it.Having attested to its usefulness and value, I have to point out the grind reading the book is. Historians are not wordsmiths in most cases and Wood proves the point. The prose of the book is so utilitarian it can feel downright sterile. By far the most interesting passages in the book don't belong to Wood but to the historical personalities he quotes; unfortunately, far too many of their quotes were sliced and diced by Wood's commentaries and interpretations, but the reader may have been better served by reading the direct passage. By reading The Radicalism of the American Revolution the reader can expect an incredible and unique education\u2014albeit not for beginners\u2014on the American Revolution, but they can't expect anything but the most practical writing.I liked The Radicalism of the American Revolution for what it is. There is plenty to be learned and gained from the book, but the authorship lacks the necessary style to make the history as unforgettable as it probably should be. It's nice to have in my collection, but reading it wasn't a particularly nice experience.The Radicalism of the American Revolution won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/201574-marc", "userReview": "This is just a great work of political and social history. Wood does a particularly fine job of teasing out the contradictions in various conceptions of \"interestedness\" and showing how those conceptions--and interestedness in general--dominate the intellectual landscape of the Revolutionary generation and, by extension, how they shaped modern America. In a nutshell, here's the argument (not that I can do justice to its complexity or the richness of research that supports it): many Founders believed in the classical version of public servants as disinterested by virtue of their independent means. For example, Jefferson and his crew often tried to place officeholders based on merit (where merit often had as much to do with bloodline as with native ability or achievement), and John Q Adams was so averse to partisanship that he left in place many of Monroe's appointees. But as the country grew, this model became increasingly unsustainable; in a large country with an expanding bureaucracy that possessed democratic pretensions, placed an emphasis on social mobility (for white men), and at least paid lip service to meritocracy, there simply weren't enough of the \"right\" people to staff things. Which leads directly to Jackson's creation of the spoils system, where successful parties reward their followers with jobs. Paradoxically, because this leads to appointees who are nakedly partisan and often unqualified, the structure of government becomes more professional as a safeguard against excessive interestedness; essentially, this is the genesis of the civil service.Meanwhile, on the economic side, the growth of publicly-chartered corporations entangles the chartering legislatures in commerce and the market. And one of the key mechanisms to protect the integrity of private transactions and businesses from partisan is the judiciary. Because legislatures are inherently compromised, it's left to courts to mediate business disputes and uphold and interpret contracts, the inviolability of which is codified in the Constitution.Anyway, this is just a taste of the book. Lots of other great stuff on the role of religion in public life, the origins of American middlebrow taste, and the role and definition of \"the people\" in the founding era. Just a great read all around."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872058-karen", "userReview": "2016 ReviewI powered through the last 80 pgs. with grad student rapidity, Wood's point by this time is quite clear: unlike other historians who have argued that the American Revolution brought no real change in the day-to-day lives of ordinary citizens, Wood sees sweeping social changes that benefitted what became the middle class. Landed gentry and non-working aristocrats were no longer the only ones who had political say and in the new United States, working not idleness was valued. Perhaps this was because a monied salary came with an expanded purchasing power for the flux of goods that allowed one to buy basic gentility, but white men also gained access to voting in unprecedented numbers, rejecting aristocratic pretensions to rule. The change in the ideas of this social contract have roots that are distinctly American (New Englanders calling and rejecting their own pastors at whim), not British and well predate the Revolution. This freedom Wood ultimately notes, came with a cost - America is vulgar, rootless, materially driven, and anti-intellectual (pg. 369), but these allowances enable the common man to have a place and a say in how the government transpires. Unlike other historians of the American Revolution, Wood sees the colonial period as a \"premodern\" NOT a modern era. 2008 ReviewCertainly an excellent work, and essential reading for a colonial americanist. However, it is not a work without flaws. For a view of the scholarly debate, read the transcript of the Forum \"How revolutionary was the Revolution? A Discussion of Gordon S.

Wood claims that the American Revolution was not only a political revolution, but also changed the social and economic structures of North America and the United States. Wood argues that the revolution that began in 1776 radically changed life in the colonies and subsequently life in the United States. Wood claims that ideas of republicanism were widely present and accepted by many people within the colonies prior to the Revolution. Colonists believed in the political reality of republicanism and many of the Founding Fathers recognized the changes this Revolution could mean for American society. Gordon S Wood effectively describes how the Revolution radically altered the political, social, and economic structures in the United States. His work follows a logical progress that describes what society was like just prior to the Revolution, what changes occurred with the onset of the Revolution and newly secured independence, and how these changes continued to develop in the decades following the Revolution. While Wood\u2019s work covers changes in politics and economics, his most convincing argument for the radicalism that the American Revolution brought to the United States is in the changes that occurred in patterns of patronage and leadership, particularly in the North."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279609-craig", "userReview": "This book does a really good job explaining the dramatic cultural changes prmopted by the American revolution. I came away from this read persuaded by the writer's thesis.The writer argues that the revolution wasn't strictly a change to the self-rule of democratic government but also a transformation of society. The argument goes that society was composed largely into cultural elites with high manners, learning, and property, and a laboring mass with little learning, a meanness of character, and a strong work ethic but no political voice of their own with one.For a period of time, by effect the revolution eliminated both extremes in the culture with a large middle-class group of white males that gained its voice, its own education and its own work ethic, and the freedom and equality to act for their own independence, prosperity and happiness. The notion that there became a middle class and that these pursuits were available for this new class is a really radical outcome of the revolution.This book is written with a somewhat scholarly bent and is a somewhat harder read than books by historians such as David McCullough or Stephen Ambrose.I recommend this book to those with a strong interest in the role of history on America today."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1653168-larry", "userReview": "Professor Wood is an emminant historian and has written an insightful work demonstrating that not only was the American Revolution a world political pardigm shift but that the subsequesnt invention of an all new republican democratic society was in itself an even greater and more radical change in society. The post-war destruction of the patronage systems and the then existing aristocracy, coupled with the advent of the personal work ethic and unquenchable desire to improve one's economic position lead to a society never seen before in the history of the world. America was an enormously diverse society as a colonial entity and becme united only by the mutual desire to be independent. Once the Revolutionary War was won the thin threads of unity frayed into an uncountable number of separate filaments. Jefferson believed that the government ought not be the center point of society and that each citizen should be free to form and follow their own beliefs. In retospect he succeeded beyond even his expectations resulting in a nation of astoundingly diverse peoples who, bound by their revolutionary mythology remain bound to the concept of one nation.

His research is impeccable and he is able to weave that research into a narrative that is readable (if a bit dry at times) and gives new understanding to his topic. I have studied the revolution and read many books on it but none of them explain the Revolution as thoroughly and clearly as this book. it should be required reading in any class on the subject. From his explanation of the prevailing attitudes of the people of Europe and America previous to the War to effects it had on the post-war world, the reader is left with a much fuller and richer understanding of why it was revolutionary. The Founders were not completely happy with the result because even though they were not happy playing second fiddle to their compatriots while still part of the empire, they still very much liked their place as the aristocracy in the newly created country. They set in motion the creation of a democracy failing to understand that as Woods put it, democracy is an extension of a republic.

He is able to put the Revolution into the context of the time in which it occurred in a respect that brings the era to life with periodic anecdotes from individuals that lived from the time: whether common man, aristocrat or founding father. The thesis of the work is that the revolution that occured here in the U.S. was much more radical than it has been given credit for. In comparison to the French Revolution, for instance, it wasn't near as bloody. However, Wood argues that our Revolution was a Revolution of our state of mind,agradual buildup from hierarchal and monarchical servitude and patronage that evolved into a republic and eventually a quasi-democracy in which we are a part of today. Wood explains the era through setting the context in a way that many historians have trouble portraying.

I made the mistake of starting this book while in law school, so I ended up reading it off and on over a period of years.

Dr. Wood covers an enormous amount of material without ever letting it up, yet the book coalesces into a brilliant narrative.
