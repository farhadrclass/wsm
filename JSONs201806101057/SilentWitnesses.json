The book is really general and so I wouldn't read it if you want to learn details and specifics about how forensics work but if you want a quick read that'll give you an idea of the time line in which forensics started to be used then you should totally read this. Also if you're looking for an introductory book into forensics science this is a good read as well."}, {"userName": "Carly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly", "userReview": "\"Murder has a magic all of its own.\u201d So said William Roughhead, a 19th century criminologist, and so opens Silent Witnesses: The Often Gruesome but Always Fascinating History of Forensic Science.McCrery sets out to demonstrate the wizardry and science of forensic identification, which, as he notes, is \"a history of uniqueness.\"The book is divided into chapters, with each section discussing the technological progression of one particular form of forensic evidence: fingerprints and physical identifiers, ballistics, blood, trace evidence, the body, poisons, and DNA. The writing is casual and conversational, with each technological advance accompanied by an anecdote that demonstrates the efficacy of the new technology. I was especially entertained by the unexpected details (for example, the first time fingerprints were used to solve a murder was in Argentina) and some of the more archaic anecdotes. (Did you know that in ancient China, handprints and fingerprints were used in evidence, and in Babylon, handprints were considered sufficiently individual to be used to seal legal contracts?) McCrery provides entertaining biographies of some of the most influential figures in the forensic sciences, such as Dr Joseph Bell, Doyle's main inspiration for Sherlock Holmes, as well as Alphonse Bertillon, the \"Holmes of Paris\" and man who introduced the idea of \"photo-fit pictures.\" (In fact, in Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes is described as second only to Bertillon.) McCrery also discusses a few crimes that I think may have been inspirations for other mystery writers.Whilst I rather enjoy the lurid stories of the long-distant past, more recent atrocities, especially ones in which McCrery acted as an investigator, felt far more ghoulish to me. Other than my distaste for these recent true-crime cases, the main place in which I think the book could be improved is the photographs that pepper the book. Even though photographs would be incredibly useful in illustrating some of the details such as differences in rifling or the equipment used in isolating poisons, most are of buildings or generic \"forensic-ish\" pictures that add little to no enlightenment.Unlike the photographs, the stories themselves are varied and entertaining. They include tales of crooked expert witnesses, the struggles of pioneering scientists and detectives, and murders so outlandish that they belong in an Agatha Christie novel. Amongst a multitude of amusing anecdotes and sensational stories, here are a few of my favourites:--Several entrepreneurial ladies have run profitable businesses in the industry of husband removal. For example, the lady Toffana di Adomo was so successful in marketing her \"Acqua Toffana,\" supposedly a benign ladies' cosmetic, that she helped almost 600 women to become quite merry widows.--Samuel Colt's famous 6-shot was known as \"the equalizer\" because of a popular poem that was written about it: \u201cBe not afraid of any man, no matter what his size.When danger threatens, call on me and I will equalize.\u201d--The freakiest poisoning case in the book is that of Georgi Markov. He was out walking one day when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his leg. He thought it was due to the umbrella point of a passerby. In fact, the umbrella had been used as a weapon to shoot a tiny spherical metal pellet into his leg. The pellet, which contained a lethal dose of ricin, was sealed with a material that melted precisely at the temperature of the human body. (I kept waiting for someone in the story to show up with a mini-rocket cigarette or perhaps a shoe-phone.)From explanations of Locard\u2019s Exchange Principle (\u201cEvery contact leaves a trace\u201d) to the details of the science behind \"bullet fingerprinting\" to pure hearsay like the story of the man who outsmarted a highwayman (he tricked him into taking a shot, and because early guns took so long to reload, was able to get his sword out before the gun was read again), Silent Witnesses is both entertaining and informative. If you're an inveterate mystery reader and interested in a casual, informal look at the history of forensics, this book is definitely worth a peek.Excerpted from my review on Booklikes.~~I received this ebook through NetGalley from the publisher, Chicago Review Press, in exchange for my honest review.~~"}, {"userName": "Book Addict Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7403283-book-addict-shaun", "userReview": "Police programmes with a focus on forensics are hugely popular, the CSI franchise getting some 30 million viewers at the height of its popularity. The realists of course know that actual real life forensics isn't like that, it's often laborious and very time consuming. The instantaneous results obtained by Horatio Caine and Mac Taylor don't reflect real life. And certainly not back a few hundred years ago when forensic science was just starting out. This book took me a while to read because it's one I picked up and read a few chapters of and put down again. It's not something I wanted to read continuously not because it wasn't good just because I don't want to take in large amounts of detail all at once. The book is very informative, and would be perfect for somebody studying this field or someone looking to study the field. I remember my 6th form offering forensic science as a subject but it was a very tame version of the field and extremely amateurish (I didn't take it). From the conception of forensic science through to present day we read about how the field has evolved. There are some really fantastic tales about early forensic science. A head being put on a pole in the hope a passerby would recognise it is one example. It's crazy to imagine things like that even happened. Moving on to the more advanced stuff and it really does blow my mind how many ways there are to solve a crime these days. You would think it would put off even the more hardcore of criminals. Everything from a hair, a bullet casing, a single drop of blood.. all of these things can identify a perpetrator. What I especially liked is this book can be picked up, read and enjoyed by someone with even just a passing interest in this subject. Often I've picked up a book written about something I am vaguely interested in but I can never get past the jargon or superiority of the author in what they are writing about. This book is written in a very accessible way but at the same time even considered experts in this field could probably learn something from the book. With each aspect of forensic science separated into different chapters it's easy to just pick a chapter you like the look of rather than read the book in the traditional cover to cover fashion. With illustrations, anecdotes and a plethora of brilliant research this was a very enjoyable book and one I have no trouble recommending."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616058-annie", "userReview": "Continuing my odd streak of reading nonfiction books, I finished Nigel McCrery's Silent Witnesses: A History of Forensic Science this evening.

The book is broken down into 7 main topics that Forensics covers. He goes through each chapter giving a nice background on each topic and also gives various stories of how different cases helped or used a method to bring justice to the perpetrator. Many of the cases I had never heard before and I thoroughly enjoyed the history behind the methods/ideas.I give this book 3 stars for a couple reasons - first, I feel that the book could have been better edited. There are times where the text completely jumps. In one paragraph he will be talking about a method and then all of a sudden he's talking of a case - there is nothing leading into this transition. This happened several times. Also sometimes it seems that a case was discussed before there was background on the topic - it would have made more sense to go into the topic first.Second, as a non-fiction book, there were absolutely NO references (other then those for the pictures). The reason this bothered me was because I looked up one of the cases online and read the Wikipedia article. I was surprised when part of the wiki article seemed almost word for word what I read in the book. Any scholar knows that Wikipedia is absolutely not acceptable as a resource. It seems that either Nigel McCrery wrote the Wikipedia article (to which his book is not a reference) or he used Wikipedia as a resource and simply re-worded it (hardly) for his book.. I will never know since he and/or the publisher felt that it was unnecessary for him to list his resources.In general - a decent, captivating read - could be great if it was better edited and referenced."}, {"userName": "Judy Abbott", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16717406-judy-abbott", "userReview": "\u00d6l\u00fcler S\u0131r Saklamaz polisiye d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcnleri i\u00e7in bi\u00e7ilmi\u015f kaftan.

Each chapter also looks at key scientists in breakthroughs in these areas, and sample or key cases that established the validity/usefulness of certain forensic methods. There are two things that set apart this book from other forensic books I've read. One, the author only talks about his own forensic work rarely, so this reads much more like a history of forensics than a memoir. Lots of the other forensics books out there are memoirs (like \nDead Men Do Tell Tales: The Strange and Fascinating Cases of a Forensic Anthropologist\n) or biographies of certain forensic figures (like \nThe Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York\n). Also, this has a broader net for sample cases than the average forensic book including cases from all over Europe and the Americas. Asian cases are even mentioned a few times in the Identity and Ballistics chapters. Probably the most similar book I've read in scope and content is Val McDermid's \nForensics: What Bugs, Burns, Prints, DNA and More Tell Us About Crime\n, and given the choice, I'd recommend McDermid's over this. Her book is a bit broader in scope, more forthcoming about the limitations of the science, and is a nice blend of memoir and historical cases. I found it somewhat humorous that the case McCrery seems most proud of, the DNA analysis of the Romanov family, he actually played a very minor role in. I've read other memoirs of forensic anthropologists who were actually in Russia and were involved in a long, laborious process of uncovering the bodies of the executed royal family. McCrery's summary of that is almost laughable in how much he left out (Like that Alexei most likley Anastasia were missing from the bones and not recovered till 2007 in a separate location! That's a big thing to leave out and gloss over by saying the DNA confirmed they had found the family! Abstract of scholarly journal article about this) If you want a good account of forensics & the family Romanov, read the memoirs of one of the forensic anthropologists actually called into Russia to help with the identification process (\nDead Men Do Tell Tales: The Strange and Fascinating Cases of a Forensic Anthropologist\n or \nBone Detective: The Story of Forensic Anthropologist Diane France\n though both were published before the more recent discoveries) or the notes in Fleming's \nThe Family Romanov: Murder, Rebellion, and the Fall of Imperial Russia\n, which actually does tell about the more recent discoveries. So why should you read this one? Read this if you're interested in key cases that validated the use of a certain forensic tool in solving crimes. I'd heard a few of them before, but most I hadn't and they made this an interesting read.Notes on content: Little if any swearing I remember. Several of the crimes related are sexual in nature and one or two times McCrery includes some detail more than just saying the person was sexually assaulted. McCrery does seem to like murders, very few thefts or less violent crimes mentioned, meaning there's a lot of violence and more than one gory dismemberment case."}, {"userName": "Warhammer Grantham", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16444115-warhammer-grantham", "userReview": "This book was very informative but I had to take breaks from reading because it made SO ANGRY.

All of which makes him perhaps the ideal person to write a book on the history of the contribution of forensic science to crime detection.Each chapter looks at a different aspect of forensics \u2013 ballistics, blood, fingerprinting, the human body, DNA etc. McCrery introduces us to the scientists and detectives who developed the techniques and tests that gradually led to the current state of play where forensics is one of the major planks of detection. In less skilled hands, this could be a very dry subject indeed, but McCrery writes flowingly and interestingly, making the people come to life and explaining the science in a way that is easy to understand.What makes the book most interesting is that McCrery tells the stories of the true crimes that were the earliest to be solved by each individual technique, and he ranges widely across the world to do so. He takes us back in time to the earliest days of detection to give a picture of the primitive, sometimes barbaric, methods that were used prior to the development of scientific methods \u2013 so we learn, for instance, of the suspect forced to share a bed with the bodies of his supposed victims to see if guilt would produce a confession. Or how about the early method of identifying an unknown victim\u2026 \u201cThe head was presented to local magistrates, who ordered that it should be cleaned up and its hair combed. After it had been prepared in this way it was taken to St Margaret\u2019s Parish Church and stuck on a pole for all to see. The queue to view the remains was apparently so long that traders worked the crowd selling food and water.\u201dMcCrery uses a chronological approach to telling his story, so in the chapter on the gun, for instance, we learn about its history from its earliest appearance as a Chinese 'fire-lance', through the invention of flintlocks and on to revolvers. At each step he explains what methods could be used to match a gun with its bullets and, while I must admit my lack of knowledge about \u2018rifling\u2019 has never kept me awake, I found it unexpectedly interesting. On the subject of blood, McCrery takes us back to the days when there was no test to differentiate between human and animal blood, and then leads us through the development of blood-typing and the increasingly sophisticated tests that could be used to match samples. The chapter on poison reveals, amongst other things, why it\u2019s often thought of as a \u2018woman\u2019s weapon\u2019 as he tells us about the history of women in the days of forced marriages forming little societies to get rid of their unwanted husbands\u2026\u201cDuring the 1650s there was a noted increase in the number of young, rich widows in the larger cities of Europe\u2026A group of young wives, some from among Rome\u2019s first families, were meeting regularly at the house of Hieronyma Spara, a well-known witch and fortune-teller. She was training these women in the art of poisoning. Papal police arrested La Spara and she and several other women were hanged. A further thirty young wives were whipped through the streets.\u201dAnd finally, McCrery ends with a look at DNA and how this has revolutionised detection, both as a means of catching the guilty but equally importantly of clearing the innocent. The cases he uses throughout as examples are interesting and well-told, though as we reached closer to the present, I felt a little uncomfortable with the thought of using murders still within living memory as part of what is really an entertainment. However, he does it with a good deal of sensitivity and due respect for both victims and their families.A fascinating and informative book that is also well-written and enjoyable.

It reads like a work of fiction but offers the reader a clear history of many of the most important advances in forensic investigative techniques. The topics are covered in chapters titled: Identity, Ballistics, Blood, Trace Evidence, The Body, Poisons, and DNA. Each subject is reviewed chronologically and numerous milestone cases in the development and growth of forensic science are presented.For example, in the Identity chapter, the war between Alphonse Bertillon and his anthropometric ID system known as \u201cbertillonage\u201d and those who favored fingerprinting as the gold standard for identification of an individual is documented. In Blood, the development of the ABO blood typing system is well presented as well as the methods for identifying a stain as blood and determining that it is human and not animal, both extremely important in crimes where blood is shed. In Trace Evidence, the discovery and development of the microscope as a forensic tool is covered in great detail. Poisons have been around almost as long as civilization and in the chapter Poisons this long and sordid history is chronicled as are the steps in the creation of the fascinating field of forensic toxicology, including the development of the famous Marsh and Reinsch tests for identifying the \u201cinheritance powder\u201d arsenic.Perhaps the most enjoyable parts of Silent Witnesses are the discussions of famous cases that helped develop forensic science as a viable entity. Silent Witnesses opens with the famous Colin Pitchfork case\u2014-the first time DNA profiling was used to solve a murder. Other seminal cases include: the Francisca Rojas case (the first time fingerprints solved a murder); the St. Valentine\u2019s Day massacre (which put firearm\u2019s examinations in the public eye); the Sam Sheppard case (where blood spatter analysis proved crucial in the retrial of the famous physician); the Parkman-Webster case (one of the first to employ dental examinations to identify a partially destroyed corpse); the Murder at the Crumbles case (involving the great medical detective Sir Bernard Spilsbury and leading to the creation of the police officer\u2019s \u201cmurder bag\u201d); the more modern \u201cradiological\u201d poisoning of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko; and many more that will keep the reader enthralled. Silent Witnesses is a delightful journey through the evolution of forensic science and is a very useful introduction to the subject. Highly recommended.

This begins the first of seven chapters, each one becoming more detailed in establishing both the identity and method used to commit the crime. Mostly he uses a murder case as an example of how forensic science was improved to provide proof of who committed the crime.The first problem had always been in finding a way to establish the identity of the criminal. This was a major problem before mass communication because criminals could travel to new areas and commit the same crimes. If caught they would use an alias that the Police had no way to trace. Eventually, the use of fingerprints in a national database solved the problem of repeat offenders.Once guns became prevalent, especially after World War One, establishing that a certain gun was used to commit a murder provided another way of establishing guilt. If fingerprints were found on the murder weapon and the weapon could be tied to the murderer, this represented prima facie evidence. With the categorizing of blood by type (A, B, O, AB) and secretor and non-secretor, gave the police another way to match criminals to crimes. The processing of a crime scene by experienced personnel, and then microscopic examination of findings, helped lead investigators to many a criminal. A detailed autopsy which examined both what happened to the body of the victim, and the contents of the stomach, would give leads that could determine where and when a murder happened. Establishing tests for chemicals like poisons also tripped up many a murderer.But nothing is more damning and determinant than DNA. A DNA match can not only lead to one suspect (especially those in the national database), but can turn up family members of a criminal conspiracy. DNA testing (when done right) is correct to one in ten billion. If you like CSI and procedural style mysteries, this is a history of how those procedures came into being.

The author started his working life as a police officer in Nottinghamshire and towards the end of this book he uses one of the cases he worked on to show how DNA profiling can be successful many years after a murder.In his introduction the author launches straight in with details of a murder of a young girl with illustrations of how forensics can rule someone out as a suspect as well as pointing justice in the direction of a perpetrator.This book goes right back to the early forensics. It must be remembered that identifying someone from their corpse is probably not the easiest task! `Always remember you are absolutely unique, just like everyone else.' Margaret Mead US anthropologist (1901-1978) Although arranged in order of chronological developments in real life some of the techniques overlap before the scientists come to an agreement of the best method.Each chapter of the book not only details the advances in forensic science but also gives examples of how these discoveries were used in evidence in court. There is much to digest in this book but it is all presented in such a way that you don't need any specialist knowledge to understand. I even kept track during the chapter on ballistics and for the first time understood how bullets can be tracked back to a particular gun.I have to admit my favourite chapter was on poisons `after all, they were an extremely convenient way of ridding yourself of an enemy whilst avoiding detection.' Often used by women it took scientists much trial and error before they came up with conclusive proof that could be laid before a jury.A must read for anyone who would like an accessible insight into the work of forensic scientists through the ages."}, {"userName": "Ankit Desai", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089693-ankit-desai", "userReview": "This book is for anyone that likes crime dramas (e.g., NCIS), detective stories, and/or analysis and forensics. The book delves into a history and evolution forensic analysis and crime solving. There are seven chapters divided into identity, ballistics, blood, trace evidence, body, poison, and DNA.Within each, the author, gives info on real cases where a specific element of forensics came into use and how it helped to find guilty or find an innocent freed. For example, in the chapter on Identity, you come to know of the difficulties policies had in identifying the victim (in London, they stuck a chopped off head on a pole and held a viewing in public (where Marble Arch is today) to see if someone recognise the victim), let alone the criminal. How did we get to the point where a fingerprint can be relied upon for identification, matching a gun to the bullet it fired, thallium salts and castor seed extracts, using DNA to find out about the last Tsars of Russia and their gruesome death in the Bolshevik Revolution, the list goes on. There are lots of interesting stories and cases to read through and though at times the techniques can be a bit difficult to comprehend, it is a very good read. The author is quite descriptive which helps the reader to recreate and vividly imagine the cases as if you were a witness; at times, you wonder if you can make an episode or two on the cases as part of a crime drama serial or a movie.Overall, I would highly recommend picking this one up or have your partner surprise gift it to you."}], "description": "A crime scene. A murder. A mystery.The most important person on the scene? The forensic scientist. And yet the intricate details of their work remains a mystery to most of us. Silent Witnesses looks at the history of forensic science over the last two centuries, during which time a combination of remarkable intuition, painstaking observation and leaps in scientific knowledge have developed this fascinating branch of detection. Throwing open the casebook, it introduces us to such luminaries as 'The Wizard of Berkeley' Edward Heinrich, who is credited with having solved over 2000 crimes, and Alphonse Bertillon, the French scientist whose guiding principle 'no two individuals share the same characteristics' became the core of identification. Along the way, it takes us to India and Australia, Columbia and China, Russia, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. And it proves that, in order to solve ever more complicated cases, science must always stay one step ahead of the killer.", "title": "Silent Witnesses", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536847-silent-witnesses", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377698188l/13536847.jpg", "reviews": 75, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/197069.Nigel_McCrery", "name": "Nigel McCrery"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Crime", "History", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536847-silent-witnesses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24017627-silent-witnesses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19218476-silent-witnesses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25364971-l-ler-s-r-saklamaz", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18657608-silent-witnesses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20948875-silent-witnesses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38888292", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2707820-still-waters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6184379-tooth-and-claw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25879177-the-thirteenth-coffin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8071240-scream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2533181.Silent_Witness"]}
