Pete's a salesman who needs to sell his special privies to the ladies of The Women's Library Association. Through her descriptions and use of dialect, Aubrey Wynne does an excellent job of taking her reader to the America of the 1800's. Set during a time when toilets were quite different than the ones we have today, the stories the ladies share about the their bathroom experiences were hysterical and cringe worthy (in a funny way). This is one story everyone in the family can read and enjoy."}, {"userName": "TL ", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl", "userReview": "Cute story with some humorous moments but not hugely funny for me overall, more mildly amusing.I am VERY glad though I never had to use any of these Privies.Everyone's sense of humor is different so go ahead and read it for yourself, you may think different from me :)."}, {"userName": "Valerie Clarizio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13908750-valerie-clarizio", "userReview": "Pete\u2019s Mighty Purty Privies is a cute humorous short story about a salesman trying to sell his outhouses to the ladies of the Women\u2019s Library Association.

The talk quickly turned to privies instead of books. Pete waits nervously to be introduced on the sidelines. He gives himself a pep talk, knowing he has a good product. Because he\u2019s such a good salesman he turns a simple sales pitch into an interesting tale of bathroom history.Ms. Wynne has taken historical facts and turned them into a humorous short story. She\u2019s done her research and everything you\u2019d want to know about outhouse construction is given in full detail. Through her main character, Pete McNutt, the reader learns the basics of 1890s bathroom etiquette. I guess you could say the author used old time bathroom humor to make a history lesson interesting. If you liked to know more, join the women of Pottstown, Michigan to hear Pete\u2019s presentation."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16389264-karla", "userReview": "This could be a scene right out of Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegon radio show, especially with the addition of different voices for characters and sound effects. It's that funny. Outhouse salesman Pete finds himself at a meeting of the Women's Library Association, selling his line of \"mighty purty privies\". What follows is a discourse from the bottom of the line \"Bachelor\" model way up to the \"Thomas Jefferson\" Presidential Privy, packed with hilarious anecdotes from the ladies in attendance. Not only will your sides hurt from laughing after reading this, you'll also have a whole new appreciation for indoor plumbing! I would highly recommend this book.

It was even shorter than I expected though, with only 15 pages. I have laughed my head of about some anecdotes. This sales-talk of a privet-salesman is made very, very funny by what his audience tells in return. Still, I find head and tail missing in this booklet. Wouldn't it have been nice to know if Pete sells something in the end, and how his audience reacts to their new privets, for example? Is he top-seller, or just starting up? I can imagine women coming back to him with complaints, or noticing that their new outhouse isn't that different from what they had, deliveries of the free year's worth paper gone wrong etc. All in all a very nice and quick read in between longer books, very well written. And although I have been warned that is was short, I mostly find it too short anyway, just because I'd loved to have more, \u00e1nd because it didn't feel finished."}, {"userName": "Clare O'Beara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara", "userReview": "This won't take you long to read, but encapsulates a good deal of information about outhouses and privies. A salesman in the 1890s in Michigan hopes to boost his sale of privies by addressing a book club meeting full of ladies. The topic is delicate but several cheeky asides are contributed by the audience. Not much actually happens; but the tale is a lesson in how to use odd research which you may have come across while looking for background to a longer story. Characters seem quite realistic and we get a good feel for the times. We can also have a chuckle, which is a nice way to start a Sunday morning. Minor punctuation quibble: when a person speaks over more than one paragraph, each paragraph indicates at the start that the person is still speaking by opening quotes, which are not closed until the person stops speaking. Thus:\"My basic model is...\"Now to my better model...\"Finally my top model privy.

As a kid, I rolled my eyes and silently willed whomever it was to hurry along with their story so I could go about whatever shenanigans I was planning. Now as an adult, I find myself doing it too! It\u2019s also a lot more humorous now. Even though I don\u2019t have any true good old days stories, I enjoy hearing them. Pete sure does know his stuff too by golly! He does what any good salesman does when looking to sell his product. Why, he goes to the women folk of course! After all, isn\u2019t it the wives who hold the purse strings?In this cute and entertaining story, you get to follow along with the musings of these fine, respectable ladies as they listen intently. Who would know how many different ways there really is to build a privy? You can go straight out primitive with a shack and a whole in the ground. Or you can get you a real nice building that matches your whole house! I loved the bantering between them all as they contemplated the merits of Pete\u2019s Privies. I have to say, if this was still a time of outdoor facilities, I\u2019d fancy one of those deluxe models with the matching curtains and paint!I loved this, and it was great.
