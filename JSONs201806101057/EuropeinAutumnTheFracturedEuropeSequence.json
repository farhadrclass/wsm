This is a rather deep and detailed look at parts of the world I have little experience in, even though I'm a fan of spy movies, obscure horrors, and thrillers of all types. By all rights, I might have had a harder time with this novel, but I was very fortunate. I really like Rudi. The kid was really put through the wringer. Where he goes when he decides to take his destiny in his own hands is where the novel gets really interesting.I did have some issues with how the narrative started looking at Rudi from the outside or as a stranger, with short Vignettes, but when each of those outside PoV's started tying together into a very incomplete, but still extremely interesting picture of a grand conspiracy of polities and information assets going after a goal that is still unclear, I still don't mind.I should. I really ought to mind, especially since the novel doesn't get tied up with bow at the end, but the picture, the map I'm forced to draw of the situation, happens to be very revealing and satisfying, even if it doesn't fit the standard structure for novelizations. It's obviously just the beginning of a series, but it gave enough payoff to the reader, enough meat, and real food for thought, that it still *felt* like a good ending.Isn't that odd? Some sort of magic happened, here.There are some good techo-geekery going on in the novel, but it's generally sparse and always in the service to the tale, never the other way around. No macguffins. The focus is all on people, and what can I say? I appreciate it. The other stuff is too obvious and too clich\u00e9. This is a return to the roots of the spy novel, and it really sucked me in. :)I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series. :)"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5* enthralled starsThe Publisher Says: Europe in Autumn is a thriller of espionage and the future which reads like the love child of John le Carre and Franz Kafka.Rudi is a cook in a Krakow restaurant, but when his boss asks Rudi to help a cousin escape from the country he's trapped in, a new career - part spy, part people-smuggler - begins. Following multiple economic crises and a devastating flu pandemic, Europe has fractured into countless tiny nations, duchies, polities and republics. Recruited by the shadowy organisation Les Coureurs des Bois, Rudi is schooled in espionage, but when a training mission to The Line, a sovereign nation consisting of a trans-Europe railway line, goes wrong, he is arrested, beaten and Coureur Central must attempt a rescue. With so many nations to work in, and identities to assume, Rudi is kept busy travelling across Europe. But when he is sent to smuggle someone out of Berlin and finds a severed head inside a locker instead, a conspiracy begins to wind itself around him. With kidnapping, double-crosses and a map that constantly re-draws, Rudi begins to realise that underneath his daily round of plot and counter plot, behind the conflicting territories, another entirely different reality might be pulling the strings...My Review: If book 2 is out, I'm orderin' it for myself for Xmas.This isn't a uniformly kinetic book. The characters, by whatever names their current legends require, (oh, and \"legend\" here is a term of art) are shown thinking, strategizing, reflecting on their world and its insanities as much as they're shown whizzing around with cool spy stuff and lots of ways to blow people up and steal their money.My favorite piece of spyware in the book is a towel that rolls out into a computer. WANT. NOW.Rudi, by various names, does many reprehensible things and feels...remorse is too strong...as if he's failed when he has to resort to reprehensibility to get what he's been sent after. He meets and re-meets many folks from his pasts. He is a darn good, fun hero-on-the-border-of-antihero-ness, and I want to see him in book 2, Europe at Midnight.And now I'm going to do something really, really mean: At the end of the book, Rudi makes a complete worldview-changing discovery that is, at least for me, unexpected to the point of jaw-dropping. It makes some oddly rough, even poorly fitting, facts make absolute sense.I really, really liked this book. I hope there's no let-down coming!"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "In a future post-EU Europe that's been busily fracturing into small states a young man is inducted into the Les Coureurs des Bois, effectively a non-state actor espionage organization.The book covers how Rudi, an Estonian chef initially living in Poland, gets recruited and trained by the Coureurs. Then we get several disparate looks into what life as a Coureur is like; basically tradecraft, paranoia, moments of desperation and barely finite amounts of preparation with tantalizing glimpses of the top end of 21st century technology. Eventually the story emerges from just straight futurist stuff to an actual science fictional plot, but it feels a bit tacked on.As a piece of futurist work, looking at the sort of political and social pressures that would arise in a post-EU Europe I found this to be at least interesting if not entirely relevant to someone living on the other side of the globe. The author's opinions in regards to the state-building actors are fascinating, with groups as wide-ranging as soccer hooligans and national park rangers wanting to form their own polities. The push for a non-state actor espionage group to allow free movement across the myriad new borders is also an interesting and perhaps inevitable idea as well.In terms of what's really going on, it all comes very late in the piece, and there's some very frustrating loose ends. Why Rudi? Who exactly are the actors here? There's clearly a huge amount going on behind the scenes, but we get almost no backstory for it or much idea what their motivations are in doing what they're doing. It's all a very unsatisfying shadow play.A friend who was buddy reading it with me made the observation that throughout the book things just happen and you just have to accept it. Unfortunately, even when Rudi does begin to get proactive instead of reactive, the slices of his life we see still make the action of the book appear to \"just happen\".I liked this well enough to want to read the next book. Hopefully there are some of the answers I wanted out of this book in that one."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8287397-elizabeth", "userReview": "Really bloody excellent.

They\u2019re wrong. This is the book that will prove to them once and for all that they\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m a sci-fi nut, and even I had to admit to having doubts as to whether the \u2018science fiction\u2019 label on the back was appropriate for what appeared to be a spy-thriller, albeit an exceptionally literary one, but by the time I realised it was correct, I had reached the end and genre was irrelevant. What mattered was that I didn\u2019t want the book to end, and was furious when it did. There needs to be a sequel, and quickly. Le Carr\u00e9 is referenced within the text, and quite rightly. I haven\u2019t read his books for a long time, but I used to devour them and felt on home ground with this novel as a result \u2013 but Le Carr\u00e9 never wrote anything quite like this. The story is told from the point of view of Estonian chef Rudi who is recruited, not as a spy, but into the equally secretive \u2018Les Coureurs des Bois\u2019, an organisation that transports \u2018packages\u2019 \u2013 which could be anything from messages in one form or another to actual people \u2013 across borders. Europe at this point is full of borders, more and more of them appearing all the time as countries break up into smaller states and \u2018polities\u2019, making international communication increasingly difficult.The story is told in a series of episodes, with links and hints and a fabulously rich texture that means it begs to be re-read the moment you finish. After just two back-to-back readings, I\u2019m dying to get back into it to pick up some of the deeper layers which I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed.Depth, richness \u2013 makes it sound like a heavy read, but it isn\u2019t remotely. It\u2019s a hugely entertaining, and hilariously funny read in places. The description of the bed and the slippers after the \u2018rescue\u2019 must be one of the funniest things I\u2019ve read in a long time.If you fancy reading a long and erudite examination of many of the issues in the book, then I suggest you pop over to Paper Knife, here http://paperknife.wordpress.com/2014/..., and read what Maureen K Speller has to say, because she really gets it \u2013 but read the novel first. If you love by maps, read this novel.If you love John le Carr\u00e9 and wish someone was still writing gritty, realistic spy thrillers, then read this novel, and be transported back into that world, but with additional and often surprising layers. If you\u2019re coming from the other direction genre-wise, perhaps you love Boris and Arkady Strugatsky\u2019s writing and wish someone else was writing gritty, realistic sci-fi, then read this novel \u2013 and then beg Dave Hutchinson to get the sequel published, because this took me back to that feeling I remember from years ago having finished the first book of Asimov\u2019s Foundation Trilogy and knowing I simply had to read the next \u2013 nothing else mattered."}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11269948-nicki", "userReview": "From the moment his childhood television first blinked on to the sight of a cooking show, all Rudi ever wanted was to be a chef. Abusive bosses and sabotaging family members weren\u2019t enough to stop him from working his way up and achieving his place at the head of a Polish restaurant\u2019s kitchen. It\u2019s somewhat puzzling why a man who\u2019s always been so certain of his life\u2019s direction, and worked so hard to achieve it, would step into a world of danger and espionage, but perhaps the dogged pursuit of something more is a hard trait to let go of.So in a Europe that is no longer a union, but an ever-shifting array of nation-states and polities, Rudi ends up becoming one of the Coureurs, a carefully apolitical association of messengers, smugglers, and traffickers (with a rather overwrought sense of tradecraft) who will run almost anything or anyone across the increasingly complex borders in the spirit of keeping the failed Schengen agreement alive. It\u2019s hardly a danger-free life -- but when the danger arrives, it comes from unexpected sources, and Rudi might be the only one without the faintest idea why he\u2019s in so much hot water.Europe in Autumn is divided into two parts, and part one reads like a fairly solid, dryly humorous spy novel, in which the only discernible science fiction element is the near future setting. And what a strange and compelling setting it is, on the one hand an exaggerated and yet disturbingly relevant look at a futurist post-EU Europe in which the petty nationalism of the Daily Mail-reading, UKIP-voting Brexit types and their half-baked fearmongering about immigrants have gained enough sway to Balkanise the continent into irrelevance, on the other hand strangely mired in a very eastern European post-Communist sensibility that feels straight out of the 90s. Frankly it might have made a brilliant stage for a series of fairly straight espionage stories a la John le Carr\u00e9, especially since those aspects are the strongest part of the novel.In this part we\u2019re more intimately connected to Rudi as a protagonist, and mostly watching the setting\u2019s mysteries begin to unravel themselves at the same pace as he is. Rudi is kind of an empty inside everyman, not unlikeable, sometimes annoyingly passive in that he keeps coming back to the Coureurs like a kicked dog without giving us any insight into why he\u2019s drawn to this whole mess, aside from the money, which in the face of actual torture seems less than adequate a motivation considering his situation beforehand didn\u2019t seem like rough living. He\u2019s at his most human when we get to see him with his not-quite-estranged family and he shows a realistic side of love, anger, distance, and nostalgia.Part two is a beast of a different nature, though. The narrative breaks down into a series of vignettes, some of which take quite a while to show how they loop back into Rudi\u2019s story, and the fantastical premise underlying the novel finally appears. And it\u2019s a really good premise, but horribly executed -- instead of getting to explore the whole new side to the setting, the plot skips and stutters ahead to when Rudi\u2019s already so familiar with it that he barely bothers to introduce us to it at all.I wonder if this book suffered from the pressure to make first books shorter, as some of the other debuts I\u2019ve read lately seemed to. I know a lot of readers have levelled backlash against door-stopping tomes that could\u2019ve used a firmer hand with the editing, and certainly the SF/F market has plenty of novels about which that criticism is entirely fair, but the result seems to have led to publishers being wary of letting unknown (or relatively so) authors loose with a large debut novel, even in situations where it would really serve the story so much better. If this had been a 500-600 page book in which the second part had as much room to breathe as the first, I expect I would\u2019ve rated it much higher. From a technical standpoint, it\u2019s definitely a well-written book -- Hutchinson\u2019s prose is clean and precise, and I love the very English dry wit that\u2019s sprinkled liberally through the book.Despite the significant pacing issues I would cautiously recommend it on the basis of its fascinating and topical setting, with the hope that the rest of the series will develop upon it in a less haphazard fashion.Review from Bookette.net"}, {"userName": "*Absorbed in Countless Worlds*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30465086-absorbed-in-countless-worlds", "userReview": "Lovely book in a Le Carre meets Kafka style.

A novel not overburdened by exposition, a novel where the dialogue sounds vaguely human, a novel where there\u2019s a sense of pacing and momentum to the story. You know, the basic components of a half decent piece of literature.Dave Hutchinson gets the little things right. More than that, Europe in Autumn is a veritable masterclass in plot, dialogue, pacing and world-building. And as such it\u2019s up there with novels like Annihilation and The Race as the best written science fiction novel for 2014.First off, there\u2019s the world building. Hutchinson does not start the novel with a block of text explaining how his book is set in a near future Europe where economic failures and the odd plague has seen the continent fracture into hundreds of sovereign states and principalities. No, he begins his novel in a restaurant where the head chef, Rudi, encounters a bunch of mean looking Hungarians. It\u2019s a tense little moment which doesn\u2019t end in the overblown action scene you expect it to, but instead has the mean looking Hungarians praising Rudi on his food. \u201cClever fuck Pole,\u201d says one of the Hungarians.It\u2019s odd to read a science fiction novel where the author holds back the urge to vomit out a stream of world building and plot set-up. Rudi\u2019s life is about to change dramatically but it has little to do with him being a chef or the opinions of Hungarians. And yet that scene does create a sense of tension, a sense that this time and place is not entirely safe.There is exposition, but Hutchinson delivers it to the reader in dribs and drabs, such as \u2014Xian Flu had brought back quarantine checks and national borders as a means of controlling the spread of the disease; it had killed, depending on whose figures you believed, somewhere between twenty and forty million people in Europe alone. \u2014 and \u2014[Darius] picked up his glass and took a sip of vodka. \u201cI saw on the news last week that so far this year twelve new nations and sovereign states have come into being in Europe alone.\u201d \u2014 and \u2014The [European] Union had struggled into the twenty-first century and managed to survive in some style for a few more years of bitching and infighting and cronyism. Then it had spontaneously begun to throw off progressively smaller and crazier nation-states, like a sunburned holidaymaker shedding curls of skin. Nobody really understood why this had happened. What was unexpected was that the Union had continued to flake away, bit by bit, even after the Xian Flu. Officially, it still existed, but it existed in scattered bits and pieces, like Burger King franchises, mainly in England and Poland and Spain and Belgium, and it spent most of its time making loud noises in the United Nations. And this approach to exposition remains consistent throughout the novel. For the most part it\u2019s employed as flavour text, data-points that add depth to the near future Europe he\u2019s envisaged. Even when Hutchinson decides to take the opportunity to provide more background to his characters, such as the section where we hilariously learn why Rudi became a chef, these episodes stem naturally from the story.The dialogue also plays a significant role in carrying the plot and developing the world. I acknowledge what constitutes good banter is a very subjective thing. In my review of Jim Butcher\u2019s novel, Skin Game, I found Harry\u2019s dialogue to be smug and filled with unnecessary pop culture references. I might have blamed Joss Whedon. And yet the internet is crammed with people who eat up that sort of self-aware witty banter with a knife, a fork and their best china.Hutchinson\u2019s dialogue and his prose in general has a sardonic and deliberately noir-ish quality. There\u2019s a self awareness to what\u2019s said, but one that\u2019s more about the character\u2019s internal psychology than any attempt on the part of the author to show off his post moderns chops. Hutchinson mostly leaves the dialogue alone. He doesn\u2019t punctuate it with descriptions about how the character is feeling or his motivation in the scene. For example this exchange between Rudi and Fabio \u2013 the guy who is meant to be mentoring Rudi in the art of couriering packages across borders \u2013 is not only funny, but provides insight into their relationship:\u201cI hate chefs,\u201d said Fabio, stuffing himself with [food].[Rudi:] \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cTwitchy little prima-donnas.\u201d Fabio tapped the table with the handle of his knife. \u201cAny half-intelligent person can follow the directions in a cookbook and produce food at least as good as this.\u201d\u201cBut could they do it night after night for a restaurant with seventy tables?\u201dFabio sipped his wine. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the planning, right? Any fool can do it [\u2026] This wine is really good. What is it?\u201dRudi consulted the menu. \u201cHouse red.\u201d\u201cReally? You should talk to the staff, you know, one catering worker to another. Maybe you can score us a couple of bottles to take back with us. It\u2019s better than that piss you serve me.\u201d And then there\u2019s the plot. I haven\u2019t really described Europe in Autumn because it\u2019s the mechanics that impressed me. But I don\u2019t want that leaving you with the idea that this is a professionally written book with zero substance. While the novel might start inauspiciously in a restaurant, Hutchinson slowly and intentionally ups the ante. Rudi goes from his work as a chef to becoming a courier for a shady organisation and you think the novel is going to be about that organisation and the sort of low-level espionage Rudi does for them. Throughout all this, issues of geography and cartography bubble under the surface. No surprises there, in a Europe that\u2019s flaking \u201clike a sunburned holidaymaker\u201d the idea of making a map \u2013 even a digital one \u2013 would be viewed as a nightmare.Late into the novel we\u2019re told the story of Captain Charles John Whitton-Whyte, his survey of the British Isles in the 18th Century and his obsession with Stanhurst, a small village that never existed. This slice of history, conveyed to us via an article exploring Whitton-Whyte\u2019s cartographical obsession, has an almost fairytale quality. Suddenly, a novel about a chef who becomes a courier and find himself on the run from a shadowy organisation out to kill him takes on a distinctly Borges feel. And what\u2019s brilliant about this, is that this glimpse into another reality \u2013 a place that doesn\u2019t exist in our world, but does exist somewhere else \u2013 works seamlessly into the novel given that this is a book that\u2019s all about shifting boundaries.I could say more about how smart this novel is. I could mention how the second half of the book is essentially a bunch of linked short stories where Rudi features but is not the point of view character. And how this sudden shift in focus widens our understanding of Hutchinson\u2019s Europe and the shifting boundaries and realities simmering underneath, without upsetting the narrative flow of the novel. I could also note the political implications inherent in a book where borders are frequently changing and independence is a fragile thing. Instead, I\u2019ll leave you with the clear statement that Europe In Autumn is a remarkable science fiction novel from a writer who deserves all the critical praise he\u2019s been receiving."}, {"userName": "Karina", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3798335-karina", "userReview": "Read most of this while sitting around in (Scandinavian) airports, which felt theme-appropriate.

I am more than fashionably late when it comes to this particular party. What can I say? The life of a book reviewer is a battle against the same ever encroaching horror \u2013 so many books, so little time. Why did I decide to pick up Europe in Autumn then? The quick answer is I read the synopsis for its sequel, Europe at Midnight, and was suitably intrigued. I\u2019m not a fan of starting a series anywhere other than the first book so I made the decision to start at the only sensible place, the beginning.Dave Hutchinson\u2019s vision of future Europe is a fragmented continent made up of tiny fiefdoms and power hungry groups. All are hell bent on grabbing as much control as they can. These various factions are focused on carving up the map in such a way that they end up with as much real estate as the can manage to get. Borders have become fluid and moving around has become an art in itself.The narrative follows Rudi through various different points in his early career. From his initial floundering steps as a raw, somewhat naive, agent still learning all the aspects of his new tradecraft, to the more self-assured operative who continually checks all the angles. It is fascinating to watch how the character evolves. One of the things I particularly like is that each of the chapters is almost completely self-contained. Though there is an over-arching plot, each time we see Rudi things feel episodic in nature. I also picked up on the growing sense of unease and paranoia in the character. Each step Rudi takes leads him to a revelation and the writing does a superb job of building to that moment.The plot also gives the author opportunity to explore the politics of Europe. The story touches upon everything from the global war on terror, to the upheaval in the Balkans. From the re-emergence of the far right and neo-Nazis in Germany, to the potential future for the United Kingdom. It feels like the events in this novel are almost a natural continuation from the current political climate we find ourselves in. There is a horrible sense of Orwellian inevitability about it all that appeals to my inner-masochist. Mr Hutchison is giving us a glimpse of an all too possible future. The scary thing is that much of it appears like it could easily be real.As an aside, it\u2019s not often I find myself doing research when it comes to book reviews, but this one piqued my interest. According to Wikipedia, the source of all knowledge, coureur des bois translates as runner of the woods. After reading further, it seems an entirely appropriate nom de guerre for a clandestine international organisation responsible for specialist jobs that can often be viewed as, at best, morally ambiguous.This was an absolutely corking read. I love it when I start a book I know absolutely nothing about, and by the end I am in awe. There is a blissful moment when the author throws a literary equivalent of a curveball into the plot that caught me completely unaware. You\u2019ll know it when it happens. I had to re-read the page more than once just to make sure I understood the implications of what was happening. Brilliantly unexpected plots twists are a thing of wonder, and I relish them entirely.If I\u2019m honest, as a genre, I sometimes struggle a bit with science fiction. In this case however the writing is so smart I didn\u2019t spot the subtle science-fictiony elements even creeping in. By the time I had realised they were there, I was already enjoying them too much to worry about it. If you\u2019re looking for a near-future thriller with an elegant science fiction feeling, then look no further. This is highly recommended. In fact, someone needs to develop this series for the screen, that would be amazing.Europe in Autumn is published by Solaris Books and is available now. Its sequel, Europe at Midnight, has just been published this week. I enjoyed my experience with this first book so much I\u2019ll be reading that next immediately."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737182-kate", "userReview": "A fun, fast and exciting read that takes us across the well-defended borders of a near-future Europe in which many countries have now been replaced by numerous rival polities, states and sovereign cities. Getting from A to B is no longer as easy as it once was and it's Rudi's job - a courier for a secret agency - to drop off and collect 'packages'. His previous job as a chef was easier - longer hours, though. The novel is packed full of surprises (one or two are enormous) as Rudi tries to discover exactly who is in charge as time after time he runs up against the unexpected. This is a clever book with a sense of humour and some fine characterisation. One of its most fascinating characters is Europe itself. Personally, I preferred the first two thirds to the final section and so that's why I've given it four and not five stars."}, {"userName": "Andreas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1118763-andreas", "userReview": "I got interested in \"Europe in Autumn\" when I saw it shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award 2015. Looking back at the other years it's safe to say that from now on I will ignore the award. The story: In the near future Europe has fallen apart into many small countries and polities. Post offices don't work reliably across borders so couriers take over the job to deliver packages, which could be anything. Rudi is trained as such a courier and the reader follows him on his missions.I immensely enjoyed the setting and the characters. I grew up at the Baltic Sea myself and know about the different ethnic groups, their history, oddities and animosities. It's very refreshing and quite different from the typical anglo-american scenarios. The plot itself didn't grab me that much and the whole time I hoped something big is going to happen on the next pages. The characters held my interest so I kept on reading and had a good time.Towards the end finally a twist is introduced and unfortunately at this point the book started to annoy me. The idea isn't bad but the presentation in form of a long info-dump first slowed down the pace followed by a rushed end. I was bedazzled and dumbfounded. Other reviewers have pointed out that the different parts felt like loosely connected stories. This is exactly the problem I had with the book. Wasn't it possible to make it tighter and throw out stuff that wasn't needed in the novel? For instance, at the beginning of later chapters the author had the tendency to introduce a new character, spending some pages and then to return to the \"main event\". In a serial this would work but not in a novel. Why investing time and emotions into something that is only a mini subplot?It's a shame that the book is so shallow and has nothing to say. The atmosphere is wonderful and I loved the characters but I am afraid that nothing will stick with me."}, {"userName": "Jakub", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528889-jakub", "userReview": "Very interesting near future concept and quite a good usage of the spy genre miscellanea.

There is the alternate-history/near-future aspect, which centers on the interesting idea that the EU has not just fallen apart but splintered into dozens of tiny pocket states (and I have to say, there was a strange resonance to reading the bit about Scotland's explosive parting from the UK only a month after the real-world vote failed). There is the largely Eastern European setting, the Estonian and Polish and Hungarian characters, which read delightfully exotic to this American (though I wonder how it will read to my European friends!). The writing is strong, never getting in the way of the story but frequently delighting me with clever phrases and evocative images, exactly the style I love reading. And I adored the idea at the heart of the eventual reveal.But...there were problems. The pacing was a little odd, slow to get going, with scenes (or parts of scenes) that did not obviously contribute to the story. Some, granted, played a part later. But it didn't feel tight to me; yet at the same time, there were all these questions that were answered in oblique ways, or left hanging such that clearly the reader was supposed to connect invisible dots, which made me feel a bit too stupid for the clever author - not as bad as Ken MacLeod's books make me feel (and there were bits of this that were reminiscent of his The Execution Channel, but along those lines. And the cool reveal I mentioned above comes practically at the end of the book - but when I hit it, I felt, that is what I want the book to be about! Not all this preparation stuff! And there wasn't enough about the cool part!Still, worth reading, and an excellent example of near-future SF."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134976-nick", "userReview": "Very rarely has a book so completed surprised me as this one did. For three quarters of the book I thought I knew what I was reading, a slightly futuristic, enjoyable espionage novel, in the vein of deighton or le carre. That was enough, I was having fun and following lazily along. It's nearly the end of the book before you realise what's really going on, despite the scaffolding laid by the earlier chapters all tying neatly into it. It goes from a fun espionage novel to an exceptional one in a matter of pages, and ends just as it starts getting really good, with The City & the City levels of new weird, though with a dimensional spin rather than a psychological one.I hadn't realised when I started there was another book in this series. When I found out, I thought maybe i'd read it one day. Now, I want to get it immediately, and it's a rare book that grabs me like that.The surprise got the book it's fourth star, and the fact that I desperately want the next book to see where things goes earns it the fifth.

Probably'.And none of this matters, because I found Europe in Autumn hard to put down from the start. Rudi, world-weary and naive - who is repeatedly taken advantage of but keeps on keeping on because what else would he do - is a warm-hearted, comforting narrator in a fractured European landscape that otherwise cuts a little too close to the bone in the current political climate.In the end, there's a bigger, weirder story here than I guessed at - making this an extended introduction to a fascinating world I can't wait to explore further.

It ends up being being both less and more than those things, but is nonetheless a hugely enjoyable read.So, we have a dystopian spy thriller set in an alternative Europe where the EU has crumbled after multiple economic crises and ever smaller nation states (or polities) are springing up all over the place. Our hero is Rudi, a young Estonian working as a chef in a restaurant in Poland, who finds himself recruited into Les Coureurs des Bois, a mysterious organisation that, for a price, will move any package (be it files, hardware or people) across any border. They employ all the old tradecraft of a security service - dead drops, stringers, brush passes, legends - and Rudi soon finds himself entrusted with ever more dangerous assignments. Until, after a Situation in Berlin goes disastrously wrong, he finds himself hunted by both his employers and several other security services - with no idea why.The novel moves at a breathless pace, moving us from Poland to Berlin, Tallin to London, Scotland (a virtually bankrupt independent Scotland at that) to Prague as Rudi races to stay ahead of a Kafkaesque conspiracy that threatens not only him, but everyone he comes into contact with. Hutchinson has constructed a great thriller and fleshes out the central conceit of a splintered Europe brilliantly. Some of the polities Rudi visits and how and why they came into being are fascinating. Of special importance is The Line, a transcontinental railway stretching all the way to Siberia, that has declared its own independence. Then, in the last third of the story, we take a left turn into something altogether stranger.This is a thriller unlike any other, fusing espionage with hi-tech thrills and elements of Science Fiction, but all rooted in a totally believable alternative Europe. Fittingly a lot of the action takes place in the colder parts of Eastern Europe, giving the novel a bleak, Cold War feel, while some of the tech employed wouldn't be out of place in a Mission Impossible movie.Ultimately Rudi takes his fate into his own hands to try and find out what is going on and who is behind it all. What he does find is not your usual conspiracy and Hutchinson leaves us wanting more. Luckily he's written a trilogy (Europe at Midnight, followed by Europe in Winter), so there's plenty to get your teeth into.If you fancy something out of the ordinary for your spy fix you'd do well to give this a go.

He describes himself on his blog as \"A journalist, once upon a time. A science fiction writer, occasionally. Will write for food. Or even the odd kind word.\" (https://hutchinsondave.wordpress.com/...)Fortunately for me, Europe in Autumn was recommended by some fellow bloggers who had been singing its praises on their 'Best Books of 2014' posts. It's a great story full of some brilliant ideas and well-realised characters. It reads a bit like a cold-war spy thriller which has had some of its technology amped up to an innovative level. The atmosphere is one of intrigue and espionage, trust and betrayal, and its setting is a fragmented, near-future Europe split by ever-increasing numbers of borders. It tells Rudi\u2019s story. \u201cThe gun was flimsy, lightweight composite compounds and bracing wires. It had a pistol-grip and a magazine the size of a wheel of Stilton, and a five-year-old could have put their fist down the barrel. Rudi snapped the magazine into place, thumbed the selector and stood very still, watching the four heat signatures moving towards the escaping Package.\u201dWhen we first meet Rudi he is a cook in a Polish restaurant, but things quickly change after his boss asks him to help a family member get across one of the borders. I enjoyed the travelling that\u2019s done in the story. Hutchinson takes us around Eastern Europe and over to a strangely-quiet London. At times, despite its futuristic flavour, I detected a feeling of nostalgia drifting out of the book. Perhaps the author is a fan of the early spy stories of John le Carre?.. But it also feels very current, very contemporary, with nods to Scottish Independence and the toughening up of border laws. \u201cThe border post was a featureless brick cube embedded in the wire of the fence. It was simple, unadorned by national symbols, although a nest of cameras and aerials rose from its roof. There was a single door, on each side of which stood an armed Polish soldier.\u201dThis book is intelligent and exciting but it\u2019s also peppered with humour. I enjoyed Hutchinson\u2019s wit just as much as his invention. His prose is tight and addictive, tempting you to read just a few more pages. There aren\u2019t many action scenes, but when they come they are gripping and well-written. The author has fun with some of the weaponry he creates, especially in a scene right near the end which I had to reread to fully take in. And as for what is lurking just under the surface of the main story, I\u2019ll leave it for you to discover. No spoilers.

Although the SF designation might itself be slightly off. It\u2019s more of a future history a la William Gibson\u2019s Blue Ant trilogy liberally mixed with a dose of John Le Carr\u00e9. The European Union has mostly collapsed; there\u2019s been a pandemic which has reduced the population and resulted in the splintering of Europe into self-declared republics, duchies, polities and city-states. The UN has endorsed a concept of self-determination that has expanded into neighborhoods, national parks, even a railway line declaring themselves a self-governing political entity. The case for open borders is predicated on the free flow of goods, people and information.The scenario of fractured Europe creates a need for new methods to get goods and information across the many borders and so is born Les Coureurs des Bois. Rudi, a Polish cook, gets involved in all manner of adventures when he joins Les Coureurs. The novel then does a complete and, at least to me, surprising narrative turn in the final pages. This effectively turns it into a different series than one might expect. I think this partly accounts for the differences of opinion on the book on GoodReads. I read this and the next title, Europe at Midnight, one after the other thus retaining a closer sense of plot and intention perhaps a bit more than others. That might be a side benefit of coming late to a series.
