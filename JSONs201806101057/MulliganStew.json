The content of most of those letters aptly furnishes several points the publishing world considers indispensible in conventional novel writing and conveys the difficulties for bringing out the avant-garde fiction in the world of literature. The gist of the matter is simple: If you\u2019ll transgress in your literary ambitions, you\u2019re likely to get rejected. Mulligan stew transgresses and does it in style.This book traces the journey of a delusional avant-garde writer, Anthony Lamont, who is writing an intellectual detective mystery story, Guinea Red, which he believes will establish him as the most interesting spokesman of the American avant-garde, and for Sur-fiction as well as Ur-fiction and Post-Modern fiction to boot.  The chapters of Guinea Red are the epitome of ridiculous plot and bad writing which at times becomes almost unbearable to read but have some great funny moments and present a pertinent example of flawless parody writing. But Mulligan Stew is this and thankfully, a lot more. Lamont\u2019s novel writing strategy makes way into a notebook he keeps, where he updates us not only with his thinking process while writing his novel but various excerpts from his previous books. He also keeps a Scrapbook, containing several advertisement clippings and primarily a series of questions and answers dealt in a schizophrenic manner. The contents of this scrapbook basically tell us that Anthony is not a half-wit at work but does possess a fair range of imagination. The high point of this novel for me are the letters which Lamont addressed to his sister, his ex-lover, and one Professor Roche who shows interest in Lamont\u2019s work to include in his class course on \u201cAmerican Experimental Novel\u201d or so Lamont believed. These letters presents his frustration as a writer in a witty and sarcastic yet ironic manner. Some examples:To Prof. RocheYou, sir, are an asshole, fit only to teach writing courses in the prison system, where the pupils would just as soon make wallets and bookmarks.To a random Friend(?)I must say that your offer of $50 for my \u201ctrouble\u201d is breathtakingly generous, but I simply must refuse. Even had I the essential expertise to perform such a task, the subject matter is far beyond my poor understanding, i.e, I don\u2019t even comprehend the motherfucking piece of shit!That  piece of shit is a dream come true of any reader of meta-fiction. But wait! I\u2019m yet to come to the main point. The novel Lamont is writing has characters, which are not the figment of Lamont\u2019s imagination but the real beings, having real lives and real jobs. Their job is simple, to be the protagonist, antagonist, or mere extras in books written by different writers. The two main characters of Guinea Red, Martin Halpin and Ned Beaumont (on loan from Joyce and Dashiell Hammett) unfortunately lands up in Lamont\u2019s novel. Their commentary on Lamont\u2019s mediocre writing, Halpin\u2019s journal entries which ridicule the clich\u00e9s surrounding the art of fiction, their future \"job\" prospects under more talented writers and their plan to escape Lamont\u2019s novel provides a brilliant dose of comedy. The essence of this book lies in its wide scope for postmodern parody. Apart from whatever I\u2019ve mentioned above, there are lists, erotic poetry (baffling), book reviews, etc so a reader can pick up this book, turn to any page and get a hearty laugh. Sorrentino has included some of the elements we experience in real lives which I always wanted some writer to address in their books. Although this book is a great fun to read, there are few instances which can be grasped only if someone has a basic knowledge of Joyce\u2019s and O\u2019Brien\u2019s novels. As Sorrentino said: My novel Mulligan Stew is not truly intelligible unless it is seen as dependent on the work of Joyce and Flann O'Brien.... The novel is, or was meant to be, the end of that process we call modernism.Without such knowledge, some parts of this book can test ones patience and proves to be a bit longer than one is game for, but all this is easily forgiven for the levity it rests upon for major part of its narrative which made me laugh the loudest which no novel ever achieved till date. It's essential to understand what Gilbert is trying to say in this book.The stew that is eventually presented to us has the underlying ingredient of writing and its various modes. How those modes are used in creating an art which faces the difficulty of acceptance among the mediators of literature, whose misinterpretations or false judgments deprive the general readers of the pleasure of reading works of writers like Sorrentino. This iconoclastic writer deserves to be read and acknowledged for his genius.Here are few links for those who are interested to know more about Gilbert Sorrentino:- Sorrentino's 1994 Interview http://www.altx.com/int2/gilber.sorre...- David Andrews Article on Sorrentinohttp://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gilbert..."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126266-geoff", "userReview": "Mulligan Stew was, after years of attempts at finding a willing publisher, published in 1979. By 2010 it had sold something on the order of 25,000 copies. Does this constitute a failure? And if so, a failure of what, or whom? The publisher? The author? The literary establishment? The reading public? I would say yes, it is a failure of sorts; the book\u2019s essence is failure; it is pretty much only about failure in many forms- and that its legacy should be a sort of failure to reach readers makes sense. This book won\u2019t win many readers. If it didn\u2019t in 1979 it surely won\u2019t now. What does a book primarily concerned with interior nature of books, written in a melange of forms from epistles to lists to fake academic papers, matter to the consuming public now? On the whole I can hardly think of a book that will connect less with the Average Joe, or that will turn Average J. off as much, or that will simply bewilder Joe, or send his mind spinning, or just frustrate or infuriate Joe, or that Joe will not simply toss across the room into the wastebasket after like 30 pages, because Joe will feel assaulted, insulted, and exhausted. Bravo to you, Gilbert Sorrentino. Because Mulligan Stew is wonderful, and entertaining, and it might be the funniest book I\u2019ve ever read, and it is totally weird, and a masterpiece.To reduce a 450-page brain-rattler into a few sentences, Mulligan Stew presents one Anthony Lamont, self-proclaimed avant-garde novelist, working at his new thing, an \u201cUr\u201d- or \u201cSur\u201d-fiction, an experimental mystery, which he believes will finally rescue him from literary obscurity and shine forth his genius into the world, with all such rewards as comes with a shining forth of genius into the world. The problem is that he is a laughably terrible writer, and oh yes he\u2019s definitely going insane. He is also dealing with a number of let\u2019s say \u201cstrained\u201d personal relationships, which are presented by letters inserted between chapters of his ridiculous novel (sometimes titled \u201cGuinea Red\u201d, sometimes \u201cCrocodile Tears\u201d), excerpts from his notebook, and from his scrapbook of found items that eventually begin to display his full-on paranoid delusions. The main characters of his new work, Martin Halpin and Ned Beaumont, realize early on that they are in a real piece of dreck (Halpin once being employed by such a \u201cgentleman\u201d as James Joyce, and Beaumont from the hard-boiled detective novels of Dashiell Hammett), and discover that through Lamont\u2019s use of flashback as the structure of his novel, imaginative space-time has been ripped and they can move about on their own as sentient, liberated beings. As they try to find a way to escape their degrading current employment, Halpin keeps a journal, in which he comments on the absurd awfulness of \u201cGuinea Red/Crocodile Tears\u201d and what he is made to endure as a character thereof, and of his and Beaumont\u2019s explorations in this literary imaginary space, populated by other characters who have fled their own employment in bad novels.This world of literary refugees provides Sorrentino with a platform for some wild and brilliant stuff; a scene involving three cowboys who discuss various degrading and ridiculous cliches they\u2019ve had to perform at the service of hack authors stands as a classic among all the books I\u2019ve read. One of the main things Mulligan Stew is doing is assaulting cliche, attacking lazy writing and lazy reading and lazy criticism, blasting the elevation of the mediocre and the proliferation of the dumbed-down or the derivative. But that isn\u2019t all that\u2019s going on here, and the very last page of the book, Emile Fion\u2019s quote on Cezanne, affirms what is really the heart and soul of this book- that a work of art needs no other justification to exist than the sheer joy of the human imagination at play. What makes art infinite and full beyond the capacity of our annoyingly mortal selves is the absence of restrictions, the limitlessness that can so easily be achieved internally that can never be gone beyond externally, materially- that these 26 squiggly letters and 2 ligatures can be so arranged to evoke worlds on worlds on and on forever, and that whatever can be imagined actually does exist, only by the fact of its having been imagined.One doesn\u2019t need to know that Mulligan Stew takes its premise from At Swim-Two-Birds, or that Martin Halpin has his origins in a footnote in an obscure part of Finnegans Wake, or that \u201cThe Masque of Fungo\u201d (a maniacally absurd play inserted in the middle of the Stew) is a parody of the Circe scene from Ulysses, or the many references to Nabokov (this book reminds me so much of Pale Fire), or any of the other countless literary Russian dolls. One must only leave oneself open to the occurrence of words. Which is why the many lists in this book, while halting the narrative and seemingly flipping the ol\u2019 bird to the reader, that may seem excessive or even provocative parataxis, are actually just as entertaining as the rest of it. It\u2019s the joy of watching Sorrentino at play in the fields of his own imagination, conjuring things, enjoying babble and nonsense along with high-minded literary analogies, it\u2019s the child and adult coexisting, the low and the high communicating, the language roaming about its own wildernesses."}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "My Proper ReviewHello!*Choice Selections From Antony Lamont\u2019s Guinea Red, latterly Crocodile Tears:\u201cImagining myself looking at myself, I seem to be relaxed.\u201d (p9)\u201cI knew the reason for our meeting was hovering in the air, like a great sinister plastic animal that was waiting its opportunity to come between us and give us cancer.\u201d (p12)\u201cIt was as if I had struck him full force in the faded face.

Dermot Trellis was frying up lard-ons in the kitchen and chewing the chit with Alison Purdie. I had no memory of writing Mr. Trellis into my story, but I had been suffering from paranoid delusions for several months and didn\u2019t want to irk the surreal spectres at war in my noggin. So I sent Mr. Trellis to the abattoir with Alison that morning to do a hog count in the hope he might toddle off into the afternoon. The next day, I found Trellis in bed with Alison having moved his stuff into the back bedroom. I was crazy, and prone to imagining things, but was I crazy, and was I imagining things outside of the things I was imagining for the story\u2019s sake?

I don\u2019t have the gall to confront him about all this.*The Necessary Evisceration of Evan Hulka\u2019s Review:Sorrentino was one of the lesser lights of the '60s postmodern movementIncorrect. Firstly, Sorrentino only published one novel in the 1960s, The Sky Changes, a very morose literary novel with no distinguishing pomo elements. For the most part he wrote poetry and criticism in the 60s. His only two metafictive books of the 70s were Imaginative Qualities and this one, otherwise he wrote collage-like novels of Brooklyn life in the 30/40s (Steelwork, Crystal Vision) and published more poetry, and the prose-poem Splendide-H\u00f4tel. Sorrentino later aligned his aesthetic more to the high modernism of Joyce and disliked the postmodernist label. He never deliberately aligned himself with Barth: it\u2019s quite possible the two never met, or read each other. Unlikely but possible.a schmuck from BrooklynA distinguished professor, critic, poet and novelist from Brooklyn with (at the time) twenty-five years or so editing and publishing experience, and a lifetime of voracious and eclectic reading behind him.with a serious Flann O'Brien/James Joyce fetishThe problem with this being . . . ?unless you're Kenneth Goldsmith, you can\u2019t just do that and only that for 400 pagesAh, Kenneth Goldsmith, that well-known name in American letters the kids can\u2019t stop reading. I didn't realise Mr. Goldsmith had the world\u2019s only metafiction license. and expect someone to publish itClearly Sorrentino didn\u2019t expect someone to publish it. It took him four years to find a (very small) publisher.you\u2019ve gotta sprinkle it in between lengthy chunks of actual novelSo there is only one way of doing things, and any work that does not adhere to that rubric is worthless? Good to know.I find Sorrentino\u2019s prose intolerable, overblown and self-infatuated.In which case, you haven\u2019t read Sorrentino\u2019s prose. The problem with these metafiction guysGeneralising. Always a good idea.blatant homageYou say this as though writing a homage is somehow cheating.Flann O'Brien's masterwork, At Swim-Two-BirdsWhich you only gave three stars, so why call it a masterwork?it was never clear that he wasn't intentionally writing badlyRead the parody closer. The parody is so subtle and nuanced, it quickly becomes clear that Lamont's writing is awful.This is the second-best book, after John Barth\u2019s \"Giles Goat-Boy,\" to begin with a series of rejection letters from publishersOf about two books which do that, this is the second best? Did we really have to rate the book in terms of how well it uses a never-used technique? Does that mean anything? and you *know* Barth's were fake.Because Sorrentino\u2019s satire is more subtle than Barth\u2019s, this somehow makes it lesser, as satire? Why can't all satire be completely obvious when we see it? Damn satirists and their cleverness.Paratextual Matters:1. Scott Esposito\u2019s long article on MS2.

(p.9)Gilbert Sorrentino\u2019s Mulligan Stew is one of the Great Comic Novels and a hack-seeking exocet missile in the War Against Clich\u00e9. The novel recasts Antony Lamont from Flann O\u2019Brien\u2019s At Swim-Two-Birds as an arrogant, self-described avant-garde novelist, chronicling his hilarious descent into writerly oblivion. Lamont considers his first published work, Three Deuces\u2014a pompous crime potboiler\u2014to be among the Great Works of American literature. His follow-up novel Guinea Red (later Crocodile Tears) is labelled a Sur-Neofictional mystery and ups the ante in the indulgent, ponderous hackwork stakes. Sorrentino worked as an editor for Grove Press in the 1960s (helping elevate Hubert Selby to stardom), and exacts his revenge with these exquisite and riotous parodies of arrogant, overwritten, inelegant prose styles that make embarrassing gropes for the profound. Fourteen chapters of Lamont\u2019s MS appear in MS and leave the reader rib-tickled and breathless in equal quantities\u2014delirious exhaustion is this novel\u2019s MO.I did my best to leer appreciatively, while my heart twisted in me like a boiling lobster. (p50)Sorrentino modelled his structure on At Swim-Two-Birds, and expands upon O\u2019Brien\u2019s metafictional innovations with his characters plotting to escape from Lamont\u2019s novel as the author loses control of his mind and MS. The weaving of intertextual references (characters are taken from O\u2019Brien, James Joyce, and Dashiell Hammett), and the fondness for the relentless and freewheeling list (and there are a maddening number of lists) are homages to and continuations of Joyce\u2019s vast literary legacy, as evidenced by his appearance in \u2018The Masque of Fungo\u2019 (a 40-page play indebted to the Circe chapter of Ulysses).Ugo colored, blanched, then colored again and blenched. (p53)Among the copious delights are letters Lamont writes to his sister Sheila, ranting about the novel and his loathing for the successful and talented Dermot Trellis. There are bizarre parodies of academic mathematical papers, sophomoric erotic poems (\u2018The Sweat of Love\u2019), and spam letters from two Mexican seducers, Corrie and Berthe, with whom Lamont becomes obsessed, and a late descent into middle-English (presaging the archaic forms Sorrentino parodies in his inventive if less successful novel Blue Pastoral).At that moment her face took on the unmistakeable frown that one gets on a face when one smells gas. (p232)Mulligan Stew launches its assault on clich\u00e9, bad writing, writer egos, and literature as a capitalistic commodity, themes prevalent across Sorrentino\u2019s career and in his incisive criticism (see Something Said), with an unrelenting blast of the original and unexpected: this masterpiece demonstrates a spellbinding comic imagination in full flight and a tireless passion for formal and artistic innovation\u2014a lesson in what to strive for as a writer, a warning in what to sidestep as a writer, and a rewarding feast for the daring and willing reader.

Sorrentino goes hunting for tropes and he pretty much bags as many as are out there,The plot is tenuous but revolves around avant-garde novelist Anthony Lamont and his attempts to write his new book. The characters in his novel have lives of their own. Here literary characters hire themselves out to novelists and move from novel to novel like actors. Characters appear from Finnegan\u2019s Wake, At-Swim-Two-Birds, Dashiell Hammett and Daisy Buchanan from Gatsby also makes an appearance. The characters also have interior lives and relationships outside the novel. At times Sorrentino deliberately writes badly when writing as Anthony Lamont in his novel; it is a noble attempt and he absolutely pulls it off. This does however make for a difficult (if funny) read.During the book its characters become increasingly disillusioned with Lamont\u2019s writing style and begin to plan their escape and the idea of a town full of book characters at rest, having escaped from bad novels or between jobs are hilarious. Apart from Lamont\u2019s truly appalling novel, there are lots of letters from Lamont to publishers, friends, his sister (married to a rival novelist) and his ex-wife. As the novel goes on these letters become increasingly splenetic and paranoid and are a delight. Sorrentino also has a crack at erotic poetry and it\u2019s difficult to describe in mere words how bad it actually is! There is a more or less unreadable brief play in the middle and a section on abstract mathematics attempting to explain contravariant behaviour (this may also be brilliant, but my maths isn\u2019t that good). The orgy scenes again are excruciating and mostly anatomically unlikely. As you may have gathered this novel has lots of different aspects; some work very well, for example the stream of consciousness section near the beginning. Every now and then Sorrentino goes into list mode. The two main characters in the novel explore the cabin they are using in the novel whilst Lamont isn\u2019t writing and they come across lots of books and periodicals. Some of these are just hilarious, some very clever and some just silly; I suspect they must have been great fun to make up.

Mulligan Stew is funny, playful, and also rather vicious. I had a lot of fun with it, though I was forced to a temporary retreat about midway through when its unrelenting listifying, absurdity, and echolalia threw me into a temporary condition of shock and awe.Sorrentino develops a schtick, and his voice and characters grew on me, but the essence of the schtick is this: if there are 15 possible ways to say the same thing, he'll find an additional 39 and treat you to all of them.The novel showers bile and derision upon phonies, hacks, and philistines; editors, critics, and charlatans; faithless friends, family, and lovers; women who won't put out, and those who will; and anyone who doesn't love the most obscure of cultural references presented in sing-song and baby talk; but it saves most of it's extreme debasement and humiliation for the sincere struggling artist who strives to achieve his best, who is unfortunately delusional, incompetent, and unable to live up to his ideals.It's funny. It's also painful. Because no one wants to be Antony Lamont. But perhaps some of us feel quite like him, from time to time... or at least we have a secret nightmare that, unknown to ourselves, we are as deeply deluded and utterly doomed as he.One magical feat that Sorrentino achieves is that he writes extremely badly extremely well. Somehow one is able to see that what Lamont writes is unrepentantly awful, yet with ironic distance it seems that Sorrentino make something quite good from the same exact words.But note that Sorrentino attacks his reader as much as he does his characters, himself, and his very own novel. There is no compromise--rather the opposite. The reader's goodwill is thoroughly and intentionally abused.Well, maybe one can say that, and maybe one can't. Let's look at it another way.Let's say you can raise 5000 cabbages in one acre. Okay. What if you can raise 8000 in two acres? Okay. Well, what if you can raise 10,000 in five acres. Do we want maximum yield, or maximum efficiency? There's no correct answer. But what if one acre gives us 20 blisters. Five acres gives us 500 blisters and two compressed vertebra. When do we like the tradeoff?Let's say a novel can give us 5 laughs in one page, and nothing but light, breezy reading. What if it can give us 20 laughs in 20 pages, and 10 groans along the way? Maximum yield? Like the tradeoff? But what if groans are part of the payoff? I.e., the book wants us to laugh and groan too... because light and breezy is not the soup du jour?One thing I like, and I find I'm liking more and more is WRONG ENGLISH. I really like it. Language is fun to play with, including when you bend it, break it, and occasionally kick the shit out of it. Apparently Sorrentino agrees, which is one of the many reasons why I felt I got plenty of good payoff for my invested reading time. In fact, there's a significant chance I may read it again!

This is a comedy of Rabelaisian gusto, a blazing cartoon bulldog with real teeth let loose in literary la-la land.In a book replete with borrowings Gilbert Sorrentino wrote a thoroughly unique masterwork. From Flann O\u2019Brien\u2019s At Swim-Two-Birds (a novel I MUST read some day) he borrowed the idea that characters in novels are merely people working odd jobs and so can hop from book to book, wherever they can get work. Sorrentino uses this to create some of my favorite sections of Mulligan Stew. But to describe this requires a new paragraph.Mulligan Stew progresses as Anthony Lamont, a fictional author within Mulligan Stew who is also a partial parody of Sorrentino himself, progresses with his book, Guinea Red. Guinea Red is an avant-garde noir wherein one friend murders another, possibly over a woman (likely story). The surviving friend is stuck in a cabin with the body of his dead friend, but as Lamont goes progressively insane (with rage and jealousy and neglect) and gets more and more involved with attacking all his enemies real and imagined, the two main characters of his novel realize they have some autonomy and start sneaking off and exploring the fictional land they find themselves in. At first this world is hazy and ill-defined, but as they adjust to the strangeness more details emerge and they discover other fictional characters like themselves living in-between lives as they\u2019re between character gigs. It\u2019s an hilarious conceit with touches of metaphysical profundity. Let me add here that these two characters themselves have been borrowed by Sorrentino from Joyce and Hammett. Wheels within wheels! Eventually the dead character absconds from the novel in progress entirely and ends up on a low-rent tropical isle with other out-of-work characters, hanging out at a bar, living a Margaritaville life. Meanwhile the novel-within-the-novel continues without one of its main characters, so the remaining character is forced to play both parts, without the knowledge of the author. Funny funny stuff.And this is only one small part of this novel. Other sections are just as involved, just as inventive, and all are accomplished with an extraordinary attention to detail, as if each word was polished bright and etched in place. This is art of the highest sort, even without having much meaning beyond itself. But it doesn\u2019t need to be anything but itself because it was the product of a thoroughly unique Mind on Fire.And one other thing... There were regular mentions throughout the novel of the color blue - characters looking up into a clear blue sky, sometimes just the word \"blue\" thrown in - and after a while I knew there must be some great significance to this. While I was working (playing) my way through the reading of the book I read an interview with Sorrentino from the time when he was working (playing) his way through the writing of the book. In the interview he mentions an aesthetic epiphany he had many years previous regarding creative writing, poetry in particular. His epiphany came when he realized that poetry did not have to be based on any previous life experience, that it could be written \"out of the blue\". Ah! So that's what the characters were doing when they were looking up into a clear blue sky - they were looking toward where whence they came."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4055243-michael", "userReview": "This is not your mother\u2019s novel within a novel. Not with lines like, \u201cbut wild horses could not drag my head around to make me look!\u201d and, \u201cI knew the reason for our meeting was hovering in the air, like a great sinister plastic animal that was waiting its opportunity to come between us and give us cancer.\u201d But with the prevalence of lines like these, I wouldn\u2019t begin describing this book by calling it a novel within a novel. That device is an afterthought here. This is parody on parade, a vehicle for the varieties of bad writing. And I wouldn\u2019t begrudge anyone for loving this book if such a one trick bullet train does indeed tickle them. For me though, it\u2019s a little fun, but little fun\u2013for 450 pages. If I were to judge Sorrentino solely by this work\u2013which I know is unfair\u2013I\u2019d say that he is something of a talented studio musician whose best attempt at a work of art of his own is a sprawling send-up of the polyphonies he recognizes as amateurs and pretenders. But let\u2019s be honest, idiot characters such as these are nothing if not easy targets. And it\u2019s not exactly a courageous stance to take issue with the flaws of a capitalistic publishing industry run by humans, most of whom are more concerned with fame and sex\u2013or whatever sates their ego\u2013than with the thankless rearing of art. And talented as he is, Sorrentino himself sometimes commits something of the sin of telling vs. showing, which he\u2019s so eager to put on display in his characters.In my conception there is a point in history after which any distinct form\u2013within a respective art\u2013that has yet to be born, is to be, by right, green-lit and given a place in the flowering\u2013a code which I cannot but wholly endorse. However, my loyalty here is to the like-minded reader, and my contribution will remain in the spirit of her best interest: a humble sign post, warning her away from any work that is not of the highest profit, no matter its place in the history or hierarchy of literature. I keep saying it\u2013unapologetically: Life is too short for 3-star books. Kafka, you probably know, said it better: \u201cI think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13924119-greg", "userReview": "Ripped off from MJ Nicholls\u2019s A Postmodern Belch.

It on one hand is an accolade to stick to the fiction, yet it boils down to the book being a very strenuous read for the more casual reader.To sum it up: the writing style, the width and plethora of lyrical imaginations is amazing, the multiple meta-layers and the fun he has with it, is impressive, but the novel sometimes loses its steam in the middle part of the book and sometimes feels like Sorrentino was showing off whilst losing track of his protagonists."}, {"userName": "Billy Dagger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537697-billy-dagger", "userReview": "It's a parody of pleasure (sometimes with a soft voice and sometimes rage, perhaps 'check your pleasure!')Almost seems lazy and careless in how the whole thing WORKS in Form and lacks that familiar mechanism of thematic \"objective correlative\" unity, but I think that's the great CLOWN darting her way through our ties and bras.
