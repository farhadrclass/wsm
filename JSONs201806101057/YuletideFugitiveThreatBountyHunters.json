Several missteps in this book too that even a bounty hunter should have thought of all prevented some enjoyment for me. I read a lot of these books and maybe would have enjoyed it more if it was a newer genre to me :)"}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7884584-pam", "userReview": "Yuletide Fugitive Threat is a Bounty Hunters book by Sandra Robbins. Mia Lockhart was terrified. The man who had killed her husband, Kyle, had been calling with threats. He wanted something but Mia had no idea what he wanted.

With him, she felt safe. When she received another phone call while with him, he knew he had to help her. Tony seemed to know everywhere she went and who she talked to. How was he following her? Could Lucas find Tony and find out what it was he wanted before he could kill Mia or himself? Could he keep his heart uninvolved? What else was Mia hiding?"}, {"userName": "Joanie Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12027480-joanie-bruce", "userReview": "This book begins with a bang. I started the book and couldn\u2019t put it down for at least sixty-two pages. That says something about how much I connected with the plot.What I liked: I thoroughly enjoyed the way Ms.Robbins drew you into the story with emotional responses for both main characters. You can\u2019t help feeling sympathy for Mia, the main character. You sense her fear, frustration, indecision, and utter desperation from the beginning of the story. Then when she introduces Lucas Knight, his anger then compassion, was evident enough to evoke strong emotion in me as a reader. What I didn\u2019t like: The only thing that made me a little uncomfortable was when Lucas put his family in danger by letting Mia stay at their house. In spite of the fact that they had some defensive training in their history, I thought he should have found a safe-house or another location that wouldn\u2019t have endangered his family. But\u2026.maybe the author planned it this way to show that Lucas was not perfect and only human. I loved this suspense book. I would give it more than five stars if possible. It was such a sweet story wrapped in suspense and tension, and I highly recommend it. It\u2019s one I will be placing on my \u201cmultiple read\u201d shelf for reading again at another time, and that says something."}, {"userName": "Mary Lawson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32942199-mary-lawson", "userReview": "Yuletide Fugitive Threat by Sandra RobbinsSecond chances come in strange ways.

From the beginning you learn who the suspect is but as you read more you discover there is someone else involved. The author gave you opportunities to determine who the other suspect is.
