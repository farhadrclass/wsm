I really had trouble with the main character - she was as dense as a box of rocks. I really have a hard time enjoying the book when I have so little respect for the character's intelligence.I also wish that \"bible thumper\" authors would label their books as such. I wouldn't have bought it, if I had known ahead of time. Every other page crams Christian religion down the reader's throat. I wish the author would have spent more time crafting her story and characters and less time forcing Jesus on the reader.The book also did not have an ending. It just sort of... stopped. I don't know anything about this author, so I'm assuming that this book is part of a series and the main character's life will be settled at another time, but it was weird to have the book just sort of peter out and end when it did."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "After finding the first in the series just o.k.

During the remodel of her lighthouse basement, Bree Nicholls' carpenter, discovers a corpse which turns out to be the long missing lighthouse keeper. This leads to numerous other discoveries that keeps the suspense level high from start to finish.Once again, Coble's focus is on the suspense with just a light touch of romance thrown in. Kade Matthews finds he now has competition for Bree's affection from the new fireman in town. But once again, he frustrates me no end as he still can't vocalize his feelings for Bree. There's also teenage trouble in town with vandalism, drugs, and border running. The man who is heading up all the trouble is a surprise to everyone when he is finally revealed. Coble kept my attention from start to finish and leaves just enough threads hanging to make me anxious to discover what happens next in Rock Harbor.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"Not all of our trials are discipline for sin; but He sometimes allows trials so that our faith might be strengthened and so that we might come nearer to His side.\"\"We can even deceive ourselves into thinking we are Christian or that we are following God. But when adversity comes the true believer will still weather it standing, though he may go through a fire of doubt.\"\"Sometimes asking for forgiveness can be a daily thing...We know we don't deserve it, and we still keep turning our guilt over to God until we can finally believe he means what He says about---then it's gone.\"I received a complimentary copy of this book from Goodreads Giveaway and Thomas Nelson Publishing to review. I was asked to give my honest opinion of the book - which I have done. I received no compensation."}, {"userName": "Bekah", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25766853-bekah", "userReview": "Colleen Coble definitely raised the mystery and intrigue up a notch. This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and it kept my mind turning as Bree tried to figure it all out. These same characters are back and I thoroughly enjoyed getting another peek into their lives.What I Liked: This one was a lot more suspenseful than the last one and I felt dread and fear right along with Bree as she dealt with her raging stalker and then figures out there's much more to the mystery than meets the eye.I read this book in just a few days. I was happy to see Naomi's joy as she marries the man of her dreams and settles down to married life. Naomi always has such wisdom and I love her encouragement to Bree. Naomi and Bree are close and their close friendship is sweet.I really liked Kade in this book, as well. He's going through a whole lot concerning his sister in this book and doesn't necessarily know what to do. I feel for him as he's making hard decisions and trying to respond appropriately to different circumstances in his life. This author did an excellent job showing imperfect humans, but a perfect God working through the lives of His children. I felt bad for Kade and wished Bree had a little bit more understanding for him in this book. The ending, once again, was not what I expected. I'm not going to say anymore. You'll just have to pick up this book for yourself. :)What I Didn't Like: While I really loved this mystery and it kept me intrigued and I liked the Biblical message and all of Anu's wisdom to her daughter-in-law, one thing did bother me. There was one time in this book where a very minor character (I think he only makes one appearance in the whole book), uses an abbreviation of a phrase using very bad language. I get the guy was upset and might not use pure language, but I strongly believe that the author (especially a Christian author) can spare the reader bad language. It shouldn't even be in the story. Besides that, this was a good book.I give this book 5 stars for a suspenseful story and a good Christian message about accepting God's forgiveness."}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Colleen Coble in her new book \u201cBeyond A Doubt\u201d Book Two in the Rock Harbor series published by Thomas Nelson gives us another adventure with Bree Matthews and Samson, her search-and-rescue dog.From the back cover: Evidence of a violent crime in Bree\u2019s basement causes police to re-open a cold case.

They have great story lines, plot twists, relationships, but the books fall apart. I can't believe they get published. With this series, I can't get myself to care for the people. I was 20 pages from being done and abandoned it for something else because I really didn't care how it ended. Sad. I think there is a great premise here, but I get confused on if Rock Harbor is a small town or big city. Why do we have characters in book two that weren't in book one?

Her search-and-rescue dog, Samson, is just as famous. When she decides to remodel the basement in the lighthouse she owns, a body is discovered. This starts a train of events that will change the lives of everyone who lives in Rock Harbor and shed light on some lies people have believed for years. I'm a fan of Ms. Coble so it was no surprise that I enjoyed this story. She mixes mystery, suspense, romance, faith, and family so that they are seamless. The characters stand out and are distinguishable. I definitely enjoyed reading this book and raced through it. There were a few sticking points for me though, that made it not quite up to the five star quality. The romance was weak for me. Just didn't get the chemistry between the two main characters. The book is definitely NOT a stand alone and ends, for the most part, on a cliff hanger for most of the characters. I felt very lost for portions of the book because I could tell I was missing something. There is another Rock Harbor series that is more geared towards children and I wondered how many of those characters were in the book since it felt like I was missing way more elements than just the previous book. But I still enjoyed it and think that if I'd read everything previous to this book, it wouldn't have been an issue.I received a copy of this book from Goodreads.

Basically a mystery /adventre / love story it started out somewhat promising. But about halfway through it just kind of fell flat for me. There were too many characters to keep track of and I think they were mostly introduced to keep us guessing who the bad guy was.
